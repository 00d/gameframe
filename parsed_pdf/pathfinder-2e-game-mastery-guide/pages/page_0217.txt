GUIDE
Guides bring travelers, tourists, and adventurers into the wondrous
natural world, using their expertise to avoid deadly monsters and gruesome hazards.
TIPS FROM THE GUIDE
You might allow PCs who Follow
the Expert when led by a guide to
continue to add their level to the
skill check for some time afterward:
1 hour if the guide is an expert,
1 day for master, or 1 week for
legendary. (The guide here has
expert Athletics, Scouting Lore, and
Survival.) A character can have this
benefit for only one skill at a time.
