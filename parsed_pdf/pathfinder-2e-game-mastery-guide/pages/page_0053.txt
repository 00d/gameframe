If you’re worried that you don’t have the kind of artistic
mastery to create a map, don’t be! Fundamentally, your
maps should serve your purposes, framing the flow of
action and story in a way that allows you to track the
campaign’s action and possibilities. No one expects
you to create stunning maps that look as professional
as those in published adventures. Just follow some best
practices to make your maps both interesting and clear.
So, grab the following supplies and let’s get started.
 • Sheets of graph paper
 • Scratch paper
 • A pencil, preferably with H or 3H lead to leave a soft
mark that’s easy to erase
 • An eraser
 • Ink pens (optional)
 • Ruler and compass (optional)
In all stages of mapmaking, don’t be frustrated by
missteps. You can always fix them later—the eraser is
your friend! Drawing or erasing too much can weaken
the paper, but you can always throw out a draft and start
again. Remind yourself that this doesn’t need to be the
most exquisite piece of art ever made—all it needs to be
is a tool for you to keep your story straight.
CREATE A LEGEND
Begin by making a list of the features your adventure site
should contain—from geographic features to the types of
rooms in a building to the monsters and traps the PC will
face—and deciding the map’s scale and orientation. The
scale, orientation, and a key for any symbols you use to
indicate features will go in the map’s legend.
The scale for your adventure maps is usually the easiest
to decide. If the map is meant to be usable for combat
on a grid, where 1 inch equals 5 feet, you can assume
each square of your graph paper equals 5 feet. If you
are mapping a larger area, you could use each square to
represent 10 feet or even more.
For the orientation, draw an arrow toward the north,
write an “N” above the arrow’s point, and you’re done.
The key of the various details your map depicts is less
predictable. Once you’ve decided what features your map
should include—such as monsters, secret doors, and traps
for a dungeon, or settlements and ruins for a regional
map—think of a symbol to represent each feature on the
map. You can also use the symbols in the sample map.
START SKETCHING
Now that you have your legend, it’s time to start the map.
Grab a pencil and begin sketching your adventure site.
DRAWING MAPS
Once you have an idea of the scope and the challenges in your adventure, the next step is
to map out your adventure location, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a desert ruin,
or an undersea coral forest.
If you’re drawing a dungeon complex, start by detailing the
corridors and rooms. If you’re creating an outdoor area,
begin with any bodies of water, rivers, and topography.
No matter what you are drawing, do so with soft lines
so you can easily erase—you might make mistakes, or
you might have better ideas later in the process. As your
map starts to take shape, start populating it with features
matching the symbols you’ve designated in your map key.
Try not to overcomplicate your maps. Keeping your
map as simple as possible will make sure important
details stand out and aids in the map’s legibility.
When sketching your maps—especially when drawing
areas of wilderness or buildings—pull inspiration from
the real world. An internet search will turn up reference
images that can help when you’re deciding the placement
of trees and shapes of canyons and streams, or when
you’re replicating ancient, medieval, renaissance, or
fantasy architecture. Basing your terrain and buildings
on these references will help your creation seem more
natural and believable.
When you draw dungeons and similar adventure
sites, remember the size of the creatures that live in your
complex, and give them enough room to live and move
around. In other words, make sure the ancient black dragon
fits through the entrance to its lair! Second, avoid empty
rooms, and don’t put rooms in just to have them. Each
room should have a purpose. Maybe it’s an abandoned
purpose, but each time you create a chamber, ask yourself,
“Why was this room built?” Lastly, avoid symmetrical or
just plain dull structures. Part of the fun of exploring is
being surprised by what you find, and needless symmetry
and repetitive layouts can ruin that surprise.
NUMBER ENCOUNTER AREAS
The next step is to number the encounter areas. You can
then use that numbering system in your encounter notes.
If you are designing multiple sites, or many levels of a
massive dungeon, consider adding a letter designation
before your numbering. The first area of your first site
can be A1, while the first area of your next site can be
B1, and so on.
ADD DEFINITION
With your map sketched and keyed, you can solidify your
sketches with either darker pencil strokes or ink. This
allows you to preserve your map so you can rerun the
adventure or reuse the map for a different adventure. If
you’re feeling artistically inspired, you can color your map
with colored pencils, marker, or paint.
