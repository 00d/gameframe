ASSIGNING SKILL POINTS
At 1st level, a character using the Skill Points variant gains
their initial skill proficiencies as described in the Core
Rulebook. However, at every level beyond 1st, instead
of gaining skill increases, the character gains a number
of Skill Points, as indicated on Table 4–19: Skill Points
by Level. The character can spend these Skill Points to
increase their proficiency rank in various skills, as shown
on Table 4–20: Cost to Increase Rank. A character must
meet the minimum level indicated on the table to increase
their rank, primarily to avoid having a player becoming
unrealistically good at one skill early in their adventuring
career while neglecting everything else. Characters can
save up Skill Points between levels for a more expensive
increase later on.

ROGUES
Because rogues get skill increases at every level in the
standard rules, they also get more Skill Points. Rogues gain
double the number of Skill Points listed on Table 4–19.
RETRAINING
A character can retrain the proficiency ranks they gained
using Skill Points much as they would retrain a skill
increase under the normal rules. With a week of downtime,
a character can reduce their proficiency rank in one skill
by one step to get back the number of Skill Points spent
to gain that increase. For example, reducing a master
proficiency rank to expert would grant a character 4 Skill
Points. The character can then reassign those points as they
see fit or save them for later. Reducing proficiency ranks
for multiple skills or reducing a single proficiency rank by
multiple steps takes additional weeks of downtime.
SKILL POINTS
The default progression of skill proficiency ranks is simple and doesn’t require many
mathematical calculations as a player assigns skills. However, some players prefer a more
granular system with a greater ability to diversify their skills. This variant allows characters
to assign their skill increases more flexibly, potentially having fewer skills at the highest
possible rank in exchange for more skills at a lower rank.
SKILL POINTS IN PLAY
Players using Skill Points have more flexibility to build
characters with a broader range of skills in which they’re
trained or better than normal, and this variant encourages
that flexibility by increasing the cost of specializing. For
instance, a 19th-level fighter could use Skill Points to be
a master in seven different skills, or to
be legendary in three skills. While this
makes the variance in skills slightly
less predictable, it shouldn’t have a big
enough effect on a group’s capabilities
that you need to make any significant
adjustments when you run the game.
