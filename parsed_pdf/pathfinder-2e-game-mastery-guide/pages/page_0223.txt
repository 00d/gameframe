LABORER GAMES
Laborers tend to play games when
the work is slow or while on break.
Common games include Gremlin
Row, which involves rolling dice and
trying to match them, as well as
Fishing with Fire, in which players
try to get all the cards of one type
from a deck without losing all of their
own cards and getting “burned.”
