TRADESPEOPLE
Every settlement needs tradespeople to create new products, facilitate commerce,
and keep the infrastructure from crumbling. Larger cities often have entire guilds
dedicated to the creation of specific goods, managing worker conditions, and
working with local governments.
APPRENTICE
Ambitious apprentices can be found in all cities. These individuals are generally
younger and seek the approval of their masters as they learn their craft. Many yearn
to exemplify the artistry behind their craft, one day becoming masters themselves.

MERCHANT
Small settlements can typically support one or two generalist merchants,
and larger cities house multiple specialists—experts in one type of product.
Merchants can be found anywhere: vendors hustling in the public square,
shopkeepers running small storefronts, traveling salespeople in carriages or
caravans, or wealthy tycoons running entire organizations devoted to commerce.
For encounters involving negotiation or mercantile skill, a merchant is a 4th-
level challenge. A merchant might have an additional Lore skill about a specific
category of item (such as jewelry or magic weapons), with a total skill bonus 2
higher than Mercantile Lore.
