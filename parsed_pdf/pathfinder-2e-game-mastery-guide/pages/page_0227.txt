MERCENARIES
A broad category that includes those wielding arms, spells, or even guile and
cunning, mercenaries hire themselves and their expertise to those with the gold
to pay for it.
BODYGUARD
Hired to protect someone famous or powerful, bodyguards use intimidation,
quick wits, and martial skill to keep their charges safe. Such mercenaries might
be auxiliaries to a noble’s own guards, but with special directives to safeguard
their patrons.

Bodyguard’s Defense  The bodyguard selects one creature they can see
and hear within 30 feet. That creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
as long as the bodyguard is adjacent to the chosen creature and can act; this
bonus lasts until the start of the bodyguard’s next turn.
MAGE FOR HIRE
Not all mercenaries sell brawn and intimidating glares. Some sell their
magical talents to earn a living. While there are many types of mages for
hire, some of the sneakiest are specialized in divination, using their skills
for infiltration and sabotage.

BOUNTY HUNTER
Bounty hunters are constantly on the move, whether within city walls or
the wilderness, trailing their fugitive quarries for capture… or disposal. Often
relying on stealth or deception as much as martial skill, bounty hunters employ
a vast array of talents to accomplish their goals, not to mention to collect
the hefty payout that follows.
BRIBING MERCENARIES
Unless a mercenary prides themself
on their name or reputation, the
PCs might be able to bribe them to
switch sides, or at least stand aside.
You can estimate a bribe by taking
roughly 5% of the Party Currency
value from the row corresponding
to the NPC’s level on Table 10–9 on
page 509 of the Core Rulebook.
