Diplomacy checks, and you now own a small castle in
any open area you wish. You must choose its location
within 1 hour.
• Vizier Upon request, you can learn the solution to any
one problem or the correct answer to any one question,
unless that information is obscured by a deity. This doesn’t
necessarily give you the means to act on that solution. You
have 1 year to take the vizier’s advice or lose its benefits.
• The Void Your mind becomes trapped forever. This card
is fickle, but it often throws the psyche into a prison in
an object on a distant plane or planet. Wish or similarly
powerful magic can reveal your psyche’s location, but it
doesn’t bring you back. Your comatose body continues to
function. Cease drawing cards.
Destruction Trick the Grim Reaper into drawing the Skull card.
ELDER SIGN
ITEM 25
RARE
ABJURATION
ARTIFACT
OCCULT
Usage held in one hand; Bulk 1
This stone tablet is carved with the symbol of a five‑branched
twig. There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each
time one is destroyed, the universe’s doom creeps inexorably
closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (DC 20
Occultism check to do so correctly) allows three different
activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected
to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or
gug; the activations refer to them as “eldritch creatures.”
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder
sign casts a 10th‑level banishment spell on an eldritch
creature. Even if the creature isn’t extraplanar, the elder
sign can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the
Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a
Great Old One, the elder sign banishes it automatically (as
if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder sign
casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature,
using a counteract level of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder sign
casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only
eldritch creatures. Each time the elder sign casts dimensional
lock in this way, the previous dimensional lock spell ends.
Destruction The only way to destroy an elder sign is to use it
to banish a Great Old One.
ESSENCE PRISM
ITEM 28
UNIQUE
ARTIFACT
TRANSMUTATION
Bulk 5
This enormous, multifaceted prism normally rests on a
pedestal, eerily refracting many‑colored lights even when no
light source is present. In reality, the prism refracts the four
magical essences into the visible spectrum (see page 300 in
the Core Rulebook for more on the four essences). A creature
adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact
action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow
from two input streams into the prism, where the prism
combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a
single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and
is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and
stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly
encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until
anyone reverses the prism’s flow or finishes activating the
prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is
gently pushed back and out of the stream.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Requirements The prism has only one
input stream; Effect You alter and rearrange the facets of the
essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single
quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like
a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality;
vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like
an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must
succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated
with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for
instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane
and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you
accidentally set the prism for some other quality.
Activate 1 minute (Interact); Requirements The prism has only
one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in
the input stream; Effect Over the course of the next hour,
the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted
through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the
output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end
of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two
new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is
part of the original, separated from the rest based on the
