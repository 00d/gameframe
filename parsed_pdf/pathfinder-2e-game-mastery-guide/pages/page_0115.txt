Much like coins, gems and art objects are valuable currency
worth their full Price when sold. When making a treasure
hoard, you can choose gems or art objects you like, or roll
randomly using percentile dice.
GEMS
Gems are naturally occurring minerals, typically in a
crystalline form, or, in a few cases, organic material such
as amber, coral, and pearls. All but the largest gems weigh
about half as much as a coin, so about 2,000 gems is 1
Bulk. Unworked gems are worth half the Price of a finished
gem and can serve as the minimum raw materials necessary
to Craft the finished gem. Lesser semiprecious stones are
level 0 items, moderate and greater semiprecious stones
are 1st-level items, lesser and moderate precious stones
are 4th-level items that require expert proficiency to Craft,
and greater precious stones are 7th-level items that require
master proficiency to Craft.

GEMS AND ART OBJECTS
Many people treasure gems for their brilliant colors and for the alchemical or even magical
properties some have. Works of art and their value, meanwhile, vary as widely as the
concept of beauty between cultures. They may be more elegant versions of useful items, or
exist solely to be admired and envied.

ART OBJECTS
These pieces of artwork have listed values, but might be
more valuable to a collector or someone with a personal
connection. When including art objects, consider whether
the PCs could discover this information and secure a greater
reward. For instance, a dwarven crown might be worth
1,000 gp for its exquisite crafting, but even more to the
dwarves who lost the crown of their first queen long ago.
This could also be a plot hook for a later adventure.
On the other hand, the materials used to make an art
object, such as the paint and the canvas of a painting, are
worth far less than the finished object. Some art objects on
Table 2–24 include uncommon or rare precious materials,
though usually not in large enough amounts for other
crafting purposes. If you’re rolling randomly and don’t want
to give out an uncommon or rare material, roll again or
modify the description (for instance, you might change the
mithral crown in the major art objects list to a gold crown).
