vials, and 3 lesser elixirs of life. These items last for 24 hours, or until the next time

Unstable Compounds When an attacker scores a critical hit against the reckless scientist,
one of the scientist’s poorly stowed alchemical items bursts. The GM determines the item
randomly. If it was a bomb, the alchemist takes damage from the bomb, and any creature
adjacent to the alchemist takes the splash damage. Any other item is simply wasted.

ALTER EGO MUTAGEN
A reckless scientist may have a
special mutagen with a 1‑round
onset that transforms them into
another specific NPC or monster of
their level, with the same duration
as other mutagens. All statistics
change, though HP changes only if
the new maximum HP is lower than
the scientist’s current HP.
