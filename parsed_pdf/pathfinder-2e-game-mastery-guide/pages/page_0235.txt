WATCH OFFICER
Watch officers are assigned to a certain area within a city or community. Often
leading a small team of lower-ranking guards, they patrol those areas to maintain
order and enforce laws. Watch officers get the job done, though their methods
are not always gentle or kind. Because the watch officer is responsible to their
superiors for their area, they sometimes need to make tough decisions between
justice and effectiveness.

CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
The captain of the guard leads a troop
of soldiers who serve as security forces
for a powerful individual, most often
a high-ranking noble or very rich
merchant, though this stat block could
also represent a lower-ranking captain
of the guard for the leader of a nation.
A formidable opponent in their own
right, the captain of the guard skillfully
employs their troops to protect the life and
health of their ward.

JAILBREAK!
If a PC or ally gets imprisoned, the
group might plot a jailbreak. For
a complex jail or penitentiary, this
might require use of the infiltration
subsystem (described on page 160).
With a smaller town or city jail with
a simple structure and small staff, it
could require just a bit of force. The
jailbreak might just be the beginning,
leading to additional adventure!
