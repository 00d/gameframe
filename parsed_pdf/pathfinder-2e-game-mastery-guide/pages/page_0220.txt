HUNTER
As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed Erastil,
god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest,
known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all,
the final determination of who is the hunter and who is prey often
depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.

FAMED FORESTS
The Verduran Forest is the largest
woodland on the continent of
Avistan; the druids and rangers of
the Wildwood Lodge earned the
forest great autonomy through
a thousand-year treaty. The
Forest of Spirits stretches over
a thousand miles of Tian Xia and
is the primeval birthplace of the
nature spirits known as kami.
The Fangwood in Nirmathas
and the Gravelands is home to a
secret village of druids, named
Crystalhurst, and to one of the
most powerful green dragons in
the world. The terrible Darkblight
devastated the 7,000-year-old
fey court that once guarded the
wood. The Fierani Forest covers
the majority of the elven nation of
Kyonin and borders Tanglebriar,
home to the Fierani rangers’ great
nemesis, the demon Treerazer.
