DOWNTRODDEN
Unfortunately, every society has people living on its fringes. While good communities
work to grant aid and respite to their downtrodden, sometimes—due to economic
downturn, famine, or war—the ranks of the less fortunate exceed the community’s
capacity to support them. In heartless neutral and evil societies, poverty is seen as
an inevitability that can never be truly eradicated, or even worse, as a tool to be
manipulated for political gain.
BEGGAR
Wherever there is poverty, there are beggars. Beggars are truly the downtrodden of
society—folks who have been cast out into the streets due to a variety of setbacks
or the weight of circumstance. Some beggars work for underworld organizations
as lookouts, spies, or even hired muscle on the cheap—sometimes by choice, but
often not.

COMMONER
Though not every commoner is downtrodden, many live hard lives of toil as
they work to keep their families fed and housed in
relative comfort. While many commoners are just
simple folks who keep to themselves, sometimes
commoners rebel, either rising up to face their
oppressors or persuaded or even duped into
joining nefarious plans and criminal conspiracies.
Commoners benefit from power in numbers, and a
crowd of commoners can accomplish a great deal more than their rulers
often expect.

BRAVING THE MOB
A mob is a violent crowd
(Core Rulebook 514) that works
as greater difficult terrain and
hazardous terrain, dealing 1d4
damage for each square entered. A
creature can spend a single action to
attempt a DC 16 Intimidation check,
clearing the mob from all squares
adjacent to them on a success
(or all squares within 10 feet on
a critical success). This action
has the concentrate, emotion,
manipulate, and mental traits.
