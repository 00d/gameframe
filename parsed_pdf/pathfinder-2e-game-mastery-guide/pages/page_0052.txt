Care when setting up the battle map can also go a long
way to misdirect your players—or at least avoid accidentally
telegraphing what an encounter will be. For instance, if you
always put out statue minis whenever there are statues in
the room, the PCs might at first be overly suspicious of
ordinary statues, but they will be more surprised later on
when a statue turns out to be a construct than if you place
minis only when the statue is actually a construct.
RECURRING VILLAINS
Not every villain dies the first time the PCs defeat them in
combat. Some may escape, perhaps through teleportation,
misdirection, or with other ploys. When a villain escapes
and lives to fight the PCs again another day, it’s good to
have that foe learn from their past failures. In their next
encounter with the PCs, give them additional minions,
spells, or other defenses designed to counteract the
strategies the PCs used against them previously. Even if the
villain doesn’t escape, they might have other tricks up their
sleeves, rising again to oppose the PCs. They could well
return later in the adventure—or they might come back
immediately for a second battle, so long as there is a proper
justification for doing so. For example, a previously living
necromancer might rise again as an undead monstrosity
bent upon destroying the PCs, or defeating an otherworldly
villain’s outer shell might reveal its terrible true form.
SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS
The setup for a social encounter tends to be less detailed. For
the NPCs involved, you’ll just need statistics for their social
skills, Perception, and Will. If you’re making your own, you
can find guidelines under Non-Combat Level on page 72.
You also need to decide the objective or consequences of
the social encounter—what the PCs can achieve and what
happens if they fail—and the form of the challenge. It might
be a public debate, a private audience with a powerful person,
or some kind of contest. Just like with combat encounters,
think about the environment, with a particular eye toward
the other people around. Is there a crowd the PCs can sway?
Are they in an imposing, luxurious throne room or at a city
gate? Is the atmosphere oppressive? Hopeful?
You might find the PCs’ goal ends up being quite different
from what you initially thought they would be. Fortunately,
social encounters can be pretty adaptable. Thinking of their
likely objective helps you construct the scene in your mind
more easily but shouldn’t limit you.
The basics of social encounters are on Core Rulebook
page 494, and page 16 of this book has more advice.
TREASURE BY
ENCOUNTER
The standard rules count treasure over the course of a
level, rather than dividing it up by encounter. If you need to
select treasure for a single encounter, such as in a sandbox
game, you can use the table below. It takes the treasure
budget for each level from Table 10–9 on page 509 of the
Core Rulebook and breaks that down per encounter based
on the encounter threat, similar to how XP varies by threat.
The final column shows extra treasure you should award
if you build an entire level this way. Unlike the standard
table, this doesn’t include items by item level, as the value
doesn’t cleanly break down for most single encounters. It’s
recommended you still give out those permanent items,
but you’ll need to borrow from other encounters’ treasure
to account for their value. Include encounters against
creatures without treasure to account for this.
