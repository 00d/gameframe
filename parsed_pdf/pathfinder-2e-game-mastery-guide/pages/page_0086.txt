Where the item is worn should usually match its effects or
bonuses: shoes help you move, eyepieces affect your vision,
and so on. As with held items, imagine a character wearing
the item to picture how they use its magic.
Apex items are always at least level 17 and should have
unique abilities on top of their bonus, just like other items.
FILL IN THE NUMBERS
You’re almost done! The final step is to fill in the numbers.
DCS
Choose any DCs for the item’s abilities. You can’t go wrong
with the typical DCs in Table 2–18. However, an item with
a narrow function might have a DC up to 2 higher, and one
that forces a save (such as with an aura) is typically 2 lower.
The lower the DC, the quicker the item becomes obsolete.

ITEM PRICES
Use the following guidelines for pricing items.
PeRmanent items
Each item level has a price range. Based on the item’s role
and abilities, decide where in that range to place it. There’s
plenty of variation, and you primarily need to worry about
Price only if you expect the PCs will be able to sell it.
Primary items cost near the highest value for their level.
They have a big impact on combat or player ability. This
includes weapons, armor, and Perception items. The highest
price is for items like magic weapons, magic armor, and
apex items. So a +1 striking weapon is 100 gp at 4th level.
Secondary items, with middle values, give significant
secondary benefits or enhance highly consequential
noncombat or support skills like Medicine or Crafting.
Tertiary items, with low value, are weird or very
specific items, ones not usually core to a character’s build.
Especially strange ones might fall into the gap between
two levels.

the high end.
