PREPARED AND SPONTANEOUS SPELLS
Spell slots work best for creatures that are meant to play
like PC spellcasters. Choose the magical tradition best
suited to the creature. You aren’t strictly limited to that
tradition’s spell list, though sticking close to it will make
your creature’s connection to that tradition more clear. The
decision to use prepared or spontaneous spellcasting should
align with the creature’s theme: a spontaneous spellcaster
fits well as a one-off creature, since spontaneous spellcasting
grants greater flexibility in the middle of battle, while a
prepared spellcaster makes for a great recurring character
who can change their spells between appearances.
For a creature that can cast as many spells as a PC
spellcaster, the highest spell level the creature can cast is half
its level rounded up. It gets five cantrips. If the creature’s
level is odd, it gets two spell slots of the highest spell level
(plus three spell slots of each lower level), or three spell slots
of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level). If its
level is even, it gets three spell slots of the highest spell level
(plus three spell slots of each lower level), or four spell slots
of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level).
Because creatures tend to be “on stage” for only a short
time, you usually don’t need to fill every spell slot. You can
often fill just the top three levels of spells, pick cantrips, and
slot in a few thematic backup spells in the fourth level down.
For a recurring foe, you might give it a full complement.
INNATE SPELLS
Unlike prepared and spontaneous spells, innate spells can
be of higher level than half the creature’s level rounded
up, and you can choose how often they’re used—they
can even be used at will or be constant effects. The most
notable innate spells tend to be top-level ones that make
a big impact but can be used only once, at-will spells
that strongly reinforce the creature’s theme, and constant
spells that give it an ongoing benefit. A spell that’s usable
a limited number of times and falls at a lower level than
the top tier is typically less likely to come up in combat;
however, that’s a great spot for utility and recovery spells,
such as dispel magic or restoration.
Sometimes a strongly thematic innate spell is of a higher
level than the creature would normally be able to cast, but
it’s so fitting that it belongs there. Be careful when doing
this, as PCs might not have access to the appropriate
countermeasures for the spell. This option works best for
support, action denial, or battlefield control spells that
change the odds of a fight without outright killing anyone,
such as the succubus’s dominate spell. These should make
the fight more interesting, not end it. Keep the number of
such spells very low, typically just one.
Though you can achieve all sorts of things with innate
spells, always start with the theme and an idea of how
you want the creature spending its actions. And though
