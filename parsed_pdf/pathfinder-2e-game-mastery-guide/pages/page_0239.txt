PUBLICANS
Countless adventures begin in a tavern or a pub. Maybe it’s because such places
attract the risk-prone, or maybe it’s because everyone needs a little liquid courage
before they decide to take on a group of rampaging ogres.
SERVER
Always on the move from patron to patron, servers are the backbone of any tavern or
eatery. Their work hones both their agility and their diplomacy.

while supplying libations. The best barkeeps have some talent for storytelling
and passing on valuable advice.

Bar Brawler The barkeep has been in enough bar fights to know how to throw
a few punches. When fighting in their bar and making a nonlethal attack, the
barkeep gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and deals an additional
1d4 damage.
Barkeep’s Advice  (auditory, fortune, linguistic, mental) Frequency
once per day; Effect The barkeep gives some pertinent advice to a single
creature other than themself. For 24 hours, when that creature fails a skill
check or saving throw, they can recall this advice and reroll the check, using
the second result instead. Once that creature uses this ability, its effect ends.
A creature that receives the Barkeep’s Advice is temporarily immune to the
ability for 1 month.
