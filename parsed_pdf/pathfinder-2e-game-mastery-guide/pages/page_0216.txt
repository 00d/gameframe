URCHIN
Although their escapades might be notorious, few urchins are thrill-seekers. For some
urchins, when begging alone is not enough to fill their bellies, theft becomes a viable
survival tactic. Many underworld powers also use urchins as spies and messengers,
while training them to become future pickpockets, burglars, and foot soldiers.

PRISONER
Most who end up in a jail, dungeon, or prison are just biding their time until their
imprisonment ends, trying to find ways to make it through interminable days of
boredom and deprivation. Some, however, may use their time on the inside to
strengthen their criminal connections. Using force and intimidation to gain status
among other prisoners, they create makeshift weapons to take down their enemies
and give them an edge if escape becomes possible. Even for prisoners who don’t
become involved in the world of prison politics, learning to stand up for themselves
and projecting an air of toughness can become essential for survival in a place
where people have little left to lose.

WORD ON THE STREET
Privy to all sorts of conversations
from passersby, the downtrodden
can provide eyes and ears on
the street. Finding a reliable
contact can give a character a
circumstance bonus to checks to
Gather Information if they return to
that source. This bonus is usually
+1, but could be +2 or +3 if the
contact lingers in a market where
influential politicians shop, sweeps
a noble estate, or the like.
Befriending NPCs in advance
can also help the heroes in action
scenes. A friendly urchin might
show a character a shortcut to
catch an escaping enemy, a crowd
of fans who frequent a bard’s
performances might throw rocks to
distract someone trying to fight the
bard, and so on.
