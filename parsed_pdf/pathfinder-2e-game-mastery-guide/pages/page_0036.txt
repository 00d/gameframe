RARITY IN YOUR GAME
The rarity system is a powerful tool that helps you and your group customize your story,
your characters, and your world to better match your game’s themes and setting. You can
also use it to keep the complexity of your game low by limiting access to unusual options.
This section supplements the Using Rarity and Access
sidebar on page 488 of the Core Rulebook.
THE FOUR RARITIES
Let’s first review the default usage for the four
rarities in the game and how these already start to
tell a story about your world.
• Common elements are prevalent enough, at
least among adventurers, that a player is assumed
to be able to access them provided they meet the
prerequisites (if any).
• Uncommon elements are difficult to access, but a PC
can usually find them eventually with enough effort,
potentially by choosing a specific character option or
spending substantial downtime tracking them down.
• Rare elements are lost secrets, ancient magic,
and other options that PCs can access only if
you specifically make them available.
• Unique elements are one of a kind. You
have full control over whether PCs can access
them. Named NPCs are unique creatures,
though that doesn’t mean their base creature
type is unique. For instance, an orc named
Graytusk is unique, but that doesn’t
mean it would be any harder for a PC
encountering her to tell she’s an orc—just to
discern specific information about her.
DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
Just because something is common or uncommon in
one context doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the same in
others. This is specifically true when comparing the
commonality of a creature and an ancestry. For instance,
while hobgoblins are a relatively common monster for
adventurers to encounter and are a common creature, in
most settings they are still far less prevalent than humans
or elves and would be an uncommon ancestry.
Because uncommon elements are available in certain
circumstances, it often varies by locale, even within the
same setting. For instance, a katana is uncommon in the
Core Rulebook and in the Inner Sea region of Golarion,
but in Asian fantasy–inspired Tian Xia, a katana would be
common and some western weapons might be uncommon.
Similarly, in an elven kingdom, uncommon elven weapons
like the elven curve blade might be common.
ACCESS ENTRIES
Uncommon elements sometimes have an Access entry in
their stat block. A character who meets the specifications
listed there has access to that option just like they would
to a common option, even though it’s uncommon. These
entries include a statement such as “follower of Shelyn,”
“member of the Pathfinder Society,” or “from Absalom.”
STARTING ELEMENTS
Elements like ancestries, backgrounds, classes, and
heritages that a character must select at character
creation can still be uncommon or rare. Obviously,
there’s no opportunity for the character to search
for them during play, but these rarities still indicate
the prevalence of adventurers with those elements
in the world. You can decide to allow them on a
case-by-case basis depending on the campaign and
the story your group wants to tell. For instance, a
game set in the lizardfolk empire of Droon might
have lizardfolk (normally uncommon) as a common
ancestry while the typical common ancestries are less
common. An official player’s guide for a Pathfinder
Adventure Path might have uncommon backgrounds
that you can access by playing the Adventure Path.
STORYTELLING
You might craft a quest involving an uncommon or rare
subject. For instance, players might encounter a door that
requires a rare spell to open, and need to travel to an
academy to learn it. If a player has their heart set on an
option that’s not common, look for ways to build a story
in which their character acquires that option.
WORLDBUILDING
With the rarities at your fingertips, you and your group can
start building a unique world using rarity as a tool. Imagine
a world where one or more of the core classes are rare.
Maybe the gods rarely answer the call of the faithful and
a PC cleric is one of the only clerics in the world. Perhaps
sorcerers are rare and feared by wizards’ guilds, which have
a stranglehold on spell access. For a grittier feel, you could
make abilities that can remove afflictions uncommon or
rare. You could even create a low-magic setting where all
magic and magic items are uncommon or rare.
You can add, remove, or alter Access entries to fit your
world. For instance, if in your world the goddess of death
guards the secrets of resurrection, you might add an
Access entry to raise dead and resurrection for characters
who worship that goddess.
These are just a few ideas to help get you started. The
number of ways you can vary rarities to adjust your
setting, story, and game are nearly unlimited.
