selection of powerful spells. Most creatures use high or
moderate AC—high is comparable to what a PC fighter
would have. Reserve extreme AC for a creature that is even
better defended; these values are for creatures that have
defenses similar in power to those of a champion or monk.

COMPENSATING WITH HP AND SAVES
You might adjust your creature’s HP, AC, and saves in
tandem. Almost no creature has great defenses in all areas,
as such creatures often result in frustrating fights. A creature
with higher AC might have fewer HP and weaker saves,
and one that’s easy to hit could have more HP and a strong
Fortitude to compensate. This depends on the theme of the
creature. An extreme AC might mean reducing the creature’s
HP to the next lowest category, or reducing its HP by a
smaller amount and making another reduction elsewhere.
SAVING THROWS
You can often set saves quickly by assigning one high, one
moderate, and one low modifier. Some creatures might vary
from this, either because they have poor AC but better saves
or because they should thematically have multiple good
saves and compensate elsewhere. You have more flexibility
with saves, and having one save off the listed number by 1
is rarely a big deal. Pay attention to the creature’s Con, Dex,
and Wis modifiers—these don’t have to correspond to the
creature’s saves exactly, but should inform your choices.
Extreme saves often pair with extreme or high ability
modifiers. Almost no creature should have more than one
extreme save, even at high levels. Assign terrible saves to
creatures that have a clear weak point—for example, a
nearly immobile creature would have a terrible Reflex save.

HIT POINTS
Give a creature HP in the moderate range unless its theme
strongly suggests it should use another range. Spellcasters,
for example, often have low HP. Brutish creatures usually
have high HP, compensating with lower AC, weaker saves,
few tactical options, or other limitations. As mentioned in
the Armor Class section above, you don’t want a creature
with extreme AC to have high HP too.
Hit Points are closely tied in with immunities,
weaknesses, and resistances, so if your creature has any of
those, look at that section before finalizing HP (page 63).
REGENERATION AND HEALING ABILITIES
Your creature might have regeneration, fast healing, or
some other ability to heal itself. These healing abilities
can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast
healing heals some number of hits each round—usually
one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit
Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on
Table 2–10: Strike Damage (page 65) and multiply that
value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the
