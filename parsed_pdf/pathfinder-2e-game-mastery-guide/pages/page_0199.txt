The proficiency rank progression in the Core Rulebook is
designed for heroic fantasy games where heroes rise from
humble origins to world-shattering strength. For some
games, this narrative arc doesn’t fit. Such games are about
hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which
even the world’s best fighter can’t guarantee a win against
a large group of moderately skilled brigands. In games
like these, your group might want to consider removing
the character’s level from the proficiency bonus.
The initial implementation is fairly straightforward:
the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for
expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. We recommend
giving an untrained character a –2 proficiency modifier
instead of a +0 proficiency bonus.
Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so
on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency
bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element.
These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks,
ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells.
Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks to account
for the level being removed. You can just subtract the level
from the DC tables on page 503 of the Core Rulebook,
or you can reference Table 4–17: Simple Skill DCs (No
Level) for a set of DCs that’s easier to remember. The new
DCs make it a little harder for high-level characters to
succeed than it would be when using the default numbers
from the Core Rulebook, in keeping with the theme
mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to flatten
out, with critical successes and critical failures being less
likely across the game. This is particularly notable in
spells, where you’re less likely to see the extreme effects
of critical failures on saves.

ADJUSTING ENCOUNTERS
Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters
can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and
conversely, a single higher-level monster is not much of a
threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in
encounter building, including shifts in the PCs’ rewards.
Under the math in the Core Rulebook, two monsters
of a certain level are roughly as challenging as a single
monster 2 levels higher. However, with level removed
PROFICIENCY WITHOUT LEVEL
This variant presents a change to the proficiency bonus system, scaling it differently for a
style of game that’s outside the norm. This is a significant change to the system.
from proficiency, this assumption is no longer true. The
XP budget for creatures uses a different scale, as shown
in Table 4–18: Creature XP (No Level). You’ll still use
the same XP budget for a given threat level as shown on
Table 10–1: Encounter Budget on page 489 of the Core
Rulebook (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for
a severe-threat encounter, and so on).

While the XP values in Table 4–18 work well in most
cases, sometimes they might not account for the effects
of creatures’ special abilities when facing a party of a
drastically different level. For instance, a ghost mage could
prove too much for 5th-level PCs with its incorporeality,
flight, and high-level spells, even though it’s outnumbered.
ADJUSTING TREASURE
Treasure and the cost of items in the Core Rulebook are
designed to make it as easy as possible for you to build
encounters without worrying about awarding too much or
too little treasure based on whether you use creatures who
carry items. However, using this variant, the PCs might
defeat a creature 5 levels higher than they are, or even
more! Too many encounters with higher-level foes can
wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected,
or vice-versa if they’re fighting weaker foes that put up
more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can nudge
this in the right direction by making periodic adjustments if
the PCs’ treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making
it so they can’t easily sell or buy magic items will mean it’s
harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep
the treasure economy entirely, you can use the automatic
item bonus progression, found on page 196.
