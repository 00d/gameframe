BURGLAR
Burglars specialize in breaking and entering to rob homes and businesses. These
criminals focus on gaining access to secure buildings and bypassing traps and other
security measures while remaining undetected all the while.

FENCE
The longer criminals hold on to stolen loot, the greater the chance they will get
caught. Fences make themselves indispensable in the underworld by paying
for stolen goods in order to resell them later, whether through a seemingly
legitimate business or to a closed group of elite buyers.

FANTASY CRIMES

are similar to crimes in the real
world, certain crimes are possible
only in a world of magic. These
include using magic to win a wager,
malicious uses of curses, violating
autonomy with enchantment
magic, falsifying divinations,
violating privacy with divinations,
or trespassing via teleportation.
