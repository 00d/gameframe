OFFICERS
Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce
laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral
and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect
this), imposing severe punishments on those who can’t pay for mercy.
BARRISTER
Barristers may serve as criminal prosecutors or as legal advocates, defending the rights
of those accused of crimes or named as defendants in civil cases. In a court case or other
legal proceeding, the barrister is a 4th-level challenge.

GUARD
Guards are rank-and-file members of a town watch or city guard, trained to look
for trouble, take down criminals, and follow orders. They are a match for only the
most fledgling of adventurers and criminals, but, given time, the settlement can usually
muster them in numbers sufficient to neutralize most threats.

whistle. If a guard was on the scene,
they sound the alarm immediately.
Reinforcements typically arrive 2–3
rounds later.
