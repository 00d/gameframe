ALIGNMENT VARIANTS
The alignment system has a long history in roleplaying games, and it helps define several
aspects of Pathfinder’s worlds and characters. Yet it doesn’t work well for all games or
groups. Altering or removing it offers new opportunities for your game.
Pathfinder’s alignment system summarizes a character’s
ideals, signals that some of the players’ opponents are
despicable villains, and establishes that truly evil monsters
exist. The alignment system can trouble some players
because it doesn’t simulate the nuance and complexity
of real-world moral issues, which are often not so easily
categorized. What is considered “good” may be heavily
influenced by societal norms or religious beliefs. It’s not hard
to find two kind, generous people who hold starkly differing
interpretations of what good is in specific situations. The
variant alignment ideas below provide examples of other
options and can serve as inspiration for your own games.
MINOR CHANGES
If you want to keep parts of the existing alignment system,
you can use either of the following variants to make
changes without entirely removing or replacing alignment.
Alignment-based effects still exist in both of these variants,
but they might not be as useful as in standard Pathfinder.
EXTREME GOOD AND EVIL
In this variant, some creatures exemplify the concepts of
extreme good and evil by their very nature. Only fiends,
celestials, and other residents of aligned Outer Sphere planes
have an alignment. Remove most alignment restrictions—
such as the cleric and champion restrictions—but not ones
related to those extraplanar creatures. Replace the removed
restrictions with appropriate anathema if necessary.
INCREMENTAL ALIGNMENT
Changing character alignment can be extremely dramatic
under the Core Rulebook rules. Sometimes, this comes as
a surprise to the player, as they find out they and the GM
had differing ideas on how their acts impact alignment.
The incremental alignment variant breaks each axis of
alignment into seven steps that reflect how close a character
is to shifting alignments.
This lets you and the player better understand where the
character falls, and it allows a player who wants to play a
character living on the edge between alignments to see that
represented in the rules. This is not meant to be a highly
granular system or one a player can exploit by repeatedly
making trivial gestures toward a given alignment. It’s
meant to indicate the trends of a character’s behavior and
foreshadow any alignment change that might occur over
time. It’s typically harder to reach the ends of the scale
through minor acts, especially for the evil versus good axis.
A character who commits multiple minor acts toward an
alignment might shift one step, but it would take a truly
reprehensible act to shift them fully to evil all at once—
and to recover it could take a long-term atonement and
commitment to good.
If a rule depends on a character’s alignment, disregard
the “fully” and “somewhat” distinctions. A protection spell
keyed against evil works against both somewhat and fully
evil characters. However, some spells, like detect alignment,
might give more precise information.
MAJOR CHANGES
These two variants massively change how the alignment
system works. In fact, one removes it entirely!
NO ALIGNMENT
The simplest variant is to not use the alignment system
at all. To many players, this feels like the variant closest
to real-world morality. Creatures, NPCs, and players have
complex and many-layered beliefs and motivations, just
like humans in the real world. Not using the alignment
system simultaneously embraces complexity and variance
in what is seen as moral behavior. For example, worshippers
of a powerful sun god might feel that spreading their
deity’s light is virtuous behavior. Some might go so far as
to say this means they should conquer their neighbors in
order to achieve this. Another example might be a large
and powerful government placing safety and security
as its foremost concern, drawing the conclusion that it’s
acceptable to sacrifice some individual liberties in favor of
increasing the safety of its citizens.
