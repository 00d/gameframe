INNKEEPER
The sight of an inn is a welcome one to any weary traveler. Innkeepers can often
be found cleaning the common room, overseeing the evening meal, or settling
in new lodgers. Innkeepers keep an eye on their neighbors’ doings and are often
excellent sources of information.

Font of Gossip The inkeeper’s business gives them insight into the neighborhood’s
happenings. When Gathering Information, a person can gain as much information
chatting with the innkeeper for 30 minutes to an hour as they would gain from
2 hours spent canvassing the neighborhood. Each person can learn gossip from
an innkeeper only once per day, and only if the innkeeper is friendly or helpful
to that individual. Whatever information the innkeeper knows about a given topic
doesn’t change if someone else asks the innkeeper about that topic, unless the
innkeeper has since learned more.

DRUNKARD
Every tavern has one—that person who drinks a little too much and
starts a fight. While many drunkards are relatively harmless, a few have
a hair trigger, and when they’re set off come, no one—even the drunkard
themself—can tell you what started the row.

BAR FIGHT!
Bar fights work better without a
grid. Use the stat blocks here or in
the Downtrodden section for notable

nonlethally with fists or improvised
weapons. Roll one or two attacks at
the end of each round against each
PC in the fight (+4 attack modifier,
1d4+2 bludgeoning damage). Alcohol
rules can be found on page 120.
