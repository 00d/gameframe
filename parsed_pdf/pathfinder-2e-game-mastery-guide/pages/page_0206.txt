* This NPC is a higher-level challenge in their area of
expertise. The NPC’s level during such a challenge is listed
in parentheses.
Call Your Bluff When gambling, the NPC may use Games Lore to
Sense Motive instead of Perception.
Child Care When treating infants, the NPC can use their
Midwifery Lore skill in place of Medicine, and can use
Medicine’s trained actions on infants.
Find Footing [one-action] (concentrate) The NPC attempts an
Architecture Lore, Engineering Lore, or similar skill check
to find a stable path across uneven ground. This grants
them and anyone they share this information with a +2
circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to Balance across
that ground.
Gone Fishing The NPC can use Fishing Lore to Track aquatic
creatures or to Aid checks to Track them.
Local Lore When they first meet a given person from their
home settlement, the NPC can automatically attempt one
check to Recall Knowledge about that person. This uses the
Lore skill for that settlement.
Quick Transcription The NPC can attempt to copy a
document faster than normal, provided they don’t
alter the content. They attempt a Scribing Lore check,
completing the task in half the time on a success (one-
quarter on a critical success).
