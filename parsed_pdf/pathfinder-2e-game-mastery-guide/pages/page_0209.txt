CRIMINALS
Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to
survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld
guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
GRAVE ROBBER
Many cultures have a tradition of burying their dead with a selection of the deceased’s
most precious possessions, and some include gifts that are thought to provide a boon
in the afterlife. Such valuables can be easy pickings for those with no respect for—or
fear of—the dead.

BANDIT
By setting ambushes and traps in concealing countryside, such as
forests and mountains, bandits waylay travelers and plunder their
valuables before disappearing back to their wilderness hideouts.
Many bandits seek only to steal and release their victims alive,
though a few prefer to leave no witnesses.

CRIMINAL SCAMS
Common scams criminals run
include sending fake collectors
for nonexistent charities to seek
donations for the diseased and
downtrodden; rigged games of
chance at local fairs offering
worthless prizes, and flashy
sideshows concealing the work of
pickpockets in the audience; and
plants who offer to help travelers
find accommodations but lead them
to inns with exorbitant prices.
