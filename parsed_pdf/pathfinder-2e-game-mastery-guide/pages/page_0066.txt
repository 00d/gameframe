remember that a d4 counts as 2.5 damage, a d6 as 3.5, a
d8 as 4.5, a d10 as 5.5, and a d12 as 6.5. Usually a damage
expression works best when roughly half the damage is
from dice and half is from the flat modifier. If your creature
deals special damage, like 1d6 fire from flaming attacks,
that counts toward its total damage per Strike. Keep in
mind that a creature using a weapon should have a damage
value that feels right for that weapon. Extreme damage
works well for two-handed weapons that uses d10s or d12s
for damage. On the other hand, a dagger uses only d4s, so
a dagger wielder would need something like sneak attack
to deal extreme damage, or you might compensate for the
dagger’s lower damage per Strike by giving the creature the
ability to attack more efficiently or use other tricks.

SPELLS
Your creature might have magical abilities that are
best represented by spells. If you’re making a highly
spellcasting-themed creature, give it prepared or
spontaneous spells. For a creature that has spells due
to its magical nature, especially if that magic isn’t its
core focus, consider giving it some innate spells instead.
How many spells you should give a creature depends on
how you expect it to spend its actions in combat. If it’s
primarily going to be making Strikes, it might not have
any spells, or it might just have a few to help it move
around better or protect against certain types of magic.
When choosing spells, lean hard into the creature’s
theme. While many PCs choose spells to cover a wide
variety of situations, creatures are more evocative the more
focused they are. Consider selecting about three-quarters
of the spells based on relevance to the theme and the
remainder for other things. However, make sure the spells
aren’t one note—selecting fireball for most of a creature’s
spell slots doesn’t make for a compelling fire creature in the
way a diverse selection of fire spells would.
When choosing spells, some spells won’t be very
useful if cast at an extremely low level compared to the
creature’s levels. Most notably, damaging spells drop off
in usefulness for a creature that’s expected to last only a
single fight. A damaging spell 2 levels below the highest
level a creature of that level can cast is still potentially
useful, but beyond that, don’t bother. Spells that have the
incapacitation trait should be in the highest level slot if
you want the creature to potentially get their full effect
against PCs.
SPELL DC AND SPELL ATTACK ROLL
Set the creature’s spell DC and spell attack roll using
Table 2–11 on page 66. Most creatures use the same DC
for all their spells, even if they have multiple types, such
as a creature with both prepared spells and innate spells.
Use the high numbers for primary casters, and
the moderate numbers for creatures that have some
supplemental spells but are focused more on combat.
At 15th level and higher, the extreme numbers become
standard for spellcasters. A few creatures might use the
extreme numbers at lower levels, but they tend to be
highly specialized, with very weak defenses and Strikes.
Secondary spellcasters can go up to high numbers if
they’re above 15th level and have offensive spells. There
is no low value—the creature shouldn’t have any spells
in the first place if it would be that bad at using them!
MANUFACTURED WEAPONS
As noted in Items on page 61, most creatures have less treasure
than PCs, so those that rely on manufactured weapons are
significantly weaker if you don’t adjust the weapons’ damage
to compensate. The method for determining Strike damage on
page 64 abstracts over the sources of damage so you don’t have
to worry about adjusting the weapon’s damage. If you do decide
to calculate the weapon’s damage, give your creature weapon
specialization or greater weapon specialization much earlier
than a PC would get it. You might also need to add sneak attack
or similar abilities to make the creature deal more damage.
On the flip side, you might want to use a one-off creature as
a source of a particularly high-level piece of treasure, such as
a magic weapon. In these cases, you might want to make the
attack bonus higher for the potency rune or the damage higher
for a potent striking rune so the PCs feel the weapon’s effect
before they obtain it. This will make the treasure feel more
powerful, since they’ve already been on the receiving end.
