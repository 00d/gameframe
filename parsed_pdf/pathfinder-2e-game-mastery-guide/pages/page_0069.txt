invisibLE AbiLitiEs
Avoid abilities that do nothing but change the creature’s
math, also known as “invisible abilities.” These alter a
creature’s statistics in a way that’s invisible to the players,
which makes the creature less engaging because the players
don’t see it using its abilities in a tangible or evocative
way. For example, an ability that allows a creature to use
an action to increase its accuracy for the round with no
outward sign (or worse, just grants a passive bonus to its
accuracy) isn’t that compelling, whereas one that increases
its damage by lighting its arrows on fire is noticeable.
These both work toward the same goal—dealing more
damage this round—but one is far more memorable.
ACTIVE ABILITIES
Abilities a creature uses on its turn have the most flexibility
and scope. You can use Table 2–11 to determine active
ability DCs as well as spell DCs. You can have an ability use
1 to 3 actions as needed (or be a free action in rare cases) and
use just about any type of tactic. Feats, spells, and existing
creature abilities provide a wide variety of examples, so look
for something similar to your idea to use as a basis.
Consider how you want your creature to spend its turns.
Two-action activities pretty much define the creature’s turn,
and single actions work best for supplemental benefits
or normal Strikes. And as you build out your idea of a
creature’s turn, don’t forget about movement! A creature
often needs to spend actions getting into position, especially
early in a fight. This is especially challenging with melee-
only creatures. You can give such creatures abilities similar
to Sudden Charge or the deadly mantis’s Leaping Grab.
Use 3-action abilities sparingly, as a creature can’t use
them if it is slowed or stunned—making a creature’s coolest
or most defining ability use up 3 actions might mean
the creature never gets to use it. These activities should
be reserved for abilities that include some movement
(like Trample) or that the creature is likely to use before
engaging in combat. Don’t make an ability use 3 actions as
a way to balance it—saying “This can be more powerful
than other abilities because it is less likely to work,” is a
recipe for frustration if you’ve made a cool ability that’s
too hard or even impossible for the creature to use.
Be especially careful with activities when designing
boss creatures. They’re likely to get targeted with the PCs’
most powerful detrimental effects, get grabbed, become
slowed, or otherwise have their actions restricted. Bosses
need to have solid options they can use with 1 or 2 actions.
This lets them use their remaining actions to get away, use
a simple ability, or otherwise keep the fight dynamic.
FrEE Actions
Use free actions that don’t have triggers sparingly, and
when you do, they should almost always be used for
support or utility actions, not Strikes or movement. If you
come up with a free action, consider whether it should
be its own action or part of a combo, such as drawing a
weapon and attacking. In cases like the latter, you might be
better off making a single action that allows the creature to
draw a weapon and then Strike.
DAmAgE-DEALing AbiLitiEs
If a special action is a single action with only one target,
you can often set damage using Table 2–10: Strike Damage
on page 65. If it uses more than 1 action or requires setup
in some way, it might deal higher damage than is typical;
often, you can just use the extreme column in these cases.
For abilities that deal damage in an area, use Table 2–12
below. These numbers are based on a 2-action activity
(e.g., most damaging spells). Single actions should deal
much less damage. An ability that has another significant
effect, like applying a condition, should deal less damage;
for this, look at the damage for 2 or more levels lower,
and judge which value would best match based on the
severity of the additional effect. These abilities typically
allow a basic saving throw. The table includes values for
unlimited-use abilities (ones that can be used at-will) and
limited-use ones (which can be used once or, like a Breath
Weapon, once or twice but not on consecutive turns).
You can use the dice given or generate your own
expression based on the damage in parentheses, as detailed
in the Strike Damage section on page 64. If a high-level
effect has a small area compared to similar abilities, you
have it deal more damage.
