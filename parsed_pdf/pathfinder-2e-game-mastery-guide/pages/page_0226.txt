HARBORMASTER
There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows,
marked by the rise and fall of the tides, and the flow of trade. A harbormaster
is expected to know the former two reflexively and encourage the latter while
knowing jurisdictional rules of law. Often old hands of the sea, harbormasters find
themselves anchored to a port by commitment, conflict, or reputation.

WARDEN
Wardens are the chief guardians of borders and frontiers. Whether they stand watch
over a single village or an entire region, wardens keep a vigilant eye out for outside
threats to their charges. Wardens are stalwart folk, often called to duty by Erastil to
protect those around them. Be it times of war or upon the frontier, wardens are often
the balanced edge of a blade between a community and the wilds at its fringes.
