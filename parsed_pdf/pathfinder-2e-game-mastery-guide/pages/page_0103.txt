adjacent inanimate object into an animated object with a
level equal to one-half the relic’s level and appropriate to
the object (so a broom would become an animated broom).
The object pursues a single simple noncombat task you
state when you use Bestow Life, ignoring any subsequent
commands. The object is mindless and pursues the task
single-mindedly and uncreatively. The object remains
animated for 1 hour.
HEALING WAVE
MINOR GIFT
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Aspect life
Activate [two-actions] envision; Frequency
once per hour; Effect You release a

OVERFLOWING LIFE MINOR GIFT
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Aspect life
Life force flows through you, and positive
energy causes your vital essence to burst through your skin
like beads of liquid light. You gain an item bonus equal to half
the relic’s level (minimum 1) to the Hit Points you recover from
positive healing spells; this bonus applies only the first time
per casting that a particular spell heals you.
INEXTINGUISHABLE
MAJOR GIFT
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Aspect life
Your connection to life force makes you more difficult to
snuff out than others. You die from the dying condition
at dying 5, rather than dying 4. If you roll a success on a
save against a death or negative effect, you get a critical
success instead.
VITALITY SIPHON
MAJOR GIFT
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Aspect life
Activate [reaction] envision; Trigger An ally within 60 feet regains
more Hit Points than it is currently down via a targeted
positive healing effect without a duration; Effect Your relic
acts as a relay for vitality. You or an adjacent willing creature
regain a number of Hit Points equal to the amount in excess
of the triggering creature’s maximum Hit Points; for instance,
if the triggering creature was missing 5 Hit Points and was
targeted by a heal spell that restored 12 Hit Points, you or
an adjacent willing creature would regain the remaining 7
Hit Points.

minute, you emit positive energy in a 10-foot emanation
centered on you. At the end of your turn, you (if you are
living) and allied living creatures in the emanation regain 10
Hit Points. If you or an allied creature would die due to an
increased dying value, you can Dismiss the activation as a
free action to prevent the death; if you do, their dying value
doesn’t increase.

additional Lore skills of the GM’s choice that fit the relic’s
history, decided at the time of gaining this gift. If the relic is
9th level, you instead have expert proficiency in these Lore
skills, and if the relic is 17th level, you have master proficiency
in these Lore skills.

emanation, centered on you, must attempt a secret Will
save, after which the creature is then temporarily immune
for 1 day.
