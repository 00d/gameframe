GLOSSARY
and INDEX
healers know the science of anatomy and physiology better than the surgeon.
While their expertise is of grave importance in the medical world, the downside
is that when one is in need of their talents, it is likely the complaint is serious. In
medical matters, a surgeon is a 6th-level challenge.

Medical Malpractice  The surgeon attempts a Medicine check against the
Fortitude DC of one living creature they can see within 60 feet. On a
success, the surgeon’s melee Strikes deal an extra 1d6 precision damage
against that creature (2d6 on a critical success) until 1 minute passes or
the surgeon critically hits that creature, whichever comes first. Using
this action again designates a new target and ends the effect for any
previous target. A surgeon can target an individual creature no more
than once per day with this ability.
PLAGUE DOCTOR
These healers, often seen wearing distinctive masks and burning powders to
defend against airborne plagues, are as much feared as they are respected. To see
a plague doctor signals that disease has infested the land—and that it might have
already taken hold. Despite their devoted work in curing the untouchable, they are
sometimes treated with suspicion, as if they are somehow the cause of the plague.

AILMENTS
Common diseases appear on page
118. These can be treated by most
healers, though they may have
longer-term physiological impacts.
For unusual conditions, like ghoul
fever or mummy rot, you might
impose penalties on a normal healer
attempting to remedy them.
