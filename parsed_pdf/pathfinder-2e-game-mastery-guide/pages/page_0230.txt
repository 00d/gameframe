and they take a –2 status penalty to AC. The cultist can’t voluntarily stop their frenzy.
After their frenzy, the cultist is fatigued.
FALSE PRIEST
Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to
great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against
someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest. Combining their gifts
of deception, a silver tongue, and an impeccable sense of timing, the false
priest can gain influence among the powerful, entice a mark to dispose of
all their possessions, and make a believer out of a cynic.

Deceiver’s Surprise On the first round of combat, if the false priest rolls Deception
or Performance for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted yet are flat-footed to
the false priest.
Fickle Prophecy  (emotion, mental) The false priest convinces someone of their
omnipotence by attempting a Deception check compared to the creature’s Will
DC. If successful, the target gains 1d8+4 temporary Hit Points that last for 1
hour or until the false priest removes them by rebuking the target, whichever
occurs first.
Sneak Attack The false priest deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to flat-footed
creatures. This increases to 2d6 against creatures flat-footed due to the
false priest’s Feint or deceiver’s surprise.
The Jig Is Up  Frequency once per hour; Trigger The false priest critically fails a
Deception or Performance check; Effect The false priest Strides.
