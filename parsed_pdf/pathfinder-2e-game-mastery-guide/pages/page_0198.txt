ADJUSTING ITEMS AND TREASURE
With this variant, you can ignore as much of Table
10–9: Party Treasure by Level on page 509 of the
Core Rulebook as you want, though you’ll usually
want to provide consistent currency. The main area
your choice will impact is in spellcasting items, such
as scrolls and wands.
Remove all potency runes, striking runes, and
resilient runes. Items that normally grant an item
bonus to statistics or damage dice no longer do, other
than the base item bonus to AC from armor. Apex
items do not increase ability scores. If your world
still includes magic items, a safe bet is to continue
to give out consumable items at roughly the rate on
Table 10–9 of the Core Rulebook.
If you choose to eliminate runes entirely, this can
reduce the PCs’ damage since they won’t have
runes like flaming or holy. If you’ve removed
nearly all treasure, challenges might become
more difficult, even with automatic bonuses.
HIGH-QUALITY
In this variant, gear can provide bonuses even if it’s
not magical. This is useful for games and settings
that set out to give fine, non-magical items the same
prominence as magic items. High-quality gear requires
the corresponding proficiency rank in Crafting to Craft.
HIGH-QUALITY WEAPONS AND ARMOR
High-quality weapons and armor give the same
benefits as weapon and armor potency runes (Tables
4–12 and 4–13). To remove magic from weapons
and armor, you can use the devastating attacks and
saving throw potency entries from the automatic
bonus progression variant, or you can have quality
also provide the effects of striking and resilient runes,
using Table 4–14 and Table 4–15. If you choose to
still have magic weapons and armor, the effects don’t
stack with quality.
HIGH-QUALITY SKILL ITEMS
Items with skill or Perception bonuses don’t have
fundamental runes. If an existing skill bonus item
costs less than the listed Price for a high-quality skill
item or has a lower level, it likely has a feature
such as a limitation, so adjust accordingly. A
character in a game with this variant can Craft
or buy a non-magical item to boost Perception
or a skill using the table below.
