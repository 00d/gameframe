those in the Core Rulebook, use the column that best suits
the ancestry. It’s up to you whether these family members
are parents, siblings, grandparents, or other close relatives.

 • If you grew up with no family, you had to learn to
survive on your own. Add a Strength ability boost and
a Constitution ability boost to your options.
 • If you grew up with one or two family members, your
closeness to them made you highly aware of their
feelings, and you. Add an Intelligence ability boost and
a Wisdom ability boost to your options.
 • If you grew up with three or more family members,
you had to mediate family conflicts and negotiate a
crowded home. Add a Charisma ability boost and a
Dexterity ability boost to your options.
STEP 2: HOMELAND
Where you grew up is highly formative. Roll on the
following table to determine the nature of your homeland.
If your character is a dwarf, subtract 3; if an elf, add 2; if
a goblin, subtract 4. For ancestries other than those in the
Core Rulebook, apply a modifier that best suits the ancestry,
if needed. Work with your GM to flesh your homeland out
in further detail. With any of these options, you add a Lore
skill based on your homeland’s terrain to your background
options, such as Forest Lore for a wooded frontier or
Absalom Lore if you grew up in that city.
TABLE 4–6: HOMELAND
1d20
Result
1 or less Underground You grew up in a partly or wholly
underground region, such as a human mining
town, a goblin warren, or a dwarf-held cavern. Add
Engineering Lore, Labor Lore, and Mining Lore to
your background options.
2–3
Frontier You grew up at the edge of a settled region.
This might have been isolated hills if you are a dwarf,
a ranch or farm if you are a human, or another similar
frontier. Add Farming Lore, Fishing Lore, Hunting
Lore, Scouting Lore, and Lore pertaining to a type of
creature that threatened your homeland regularly
(such as Giant Lore) to your background options.
4–5
Trade Town People frequently passed through your
homeland. You might have been raised near a major
thoroughfare or crossroads, or in a small trade town.
Add Accounting Lore, Guild Lore, Mercantile Lore,
Stabling Lore, and Lore of a common ancestry (such
as Dwarf Lore) to your background options.
6–7
Simple Village You were raised in a sleepy village
such as a bucolic gnome hamlet, a close-knit human
town, or an established goblin fort. Add Herbalism
Lore, Midwifery Lore, Milling Lore, Tanning Lore, and
Lore of a type of food, drink, or product the village
was known for producing (such as Alcohol Lore or
Wagon Lore) to your background options.
8–9
Cosmopolitan City You were raised in a community
where no single ancestry predominated. This might
have created tensions, but the community might also
have pulled together from diverse foundations. Add
Art Lore, Guild Lore, Legal Lore, and Underworld Lore
to your background options.
10–11
Metropolis You grew up in one of the largest cities
in the world, such as Absalom or Westcrown. Add
Architecture Lore, Gladiatorial Lore, Guild Lore, Legal
Lore, and Theater Lore to your background options.
12
Front Lines You grew up in a homeland torn by war.
Even if you didn’t personally participate, it was never
far away. Add Heraldry Lore, Scouting Lore, and
Warfare Lore to your background options.
13–14
Itinerant You never had a single place to call home.
You might have been part of a nomadic caravan,
a traveling group of entertainers, or a smuggling
ring. Add Circus Lore, Fortune-Telling Lore, Games
Lore, Labor Lore, and Underworld Lore to your
background options.
15
Another Ancestry’s Settlement Randomly determine
another common ancestry; you grew up surrounded
by that ancestry. Reroll on this table (with a modifier
for the new ancestry, if applicable) to determine
the type of community in which you grew up (for
example, if your gnome grew up among dwarves
and rolls a 3, they grew up underground). Add the
Adopted Ancestry feat and the Lore skill related to
your adopted ancestry (such as Dwarf Lore) to your
background options. If you select this feat instead of
a skill feat, you aren’t trained in a background skill.
16
Coastal Community You grew up along a wide
river, in a wetland, beside an ocean, or on an
island. Add Fishing Lore, Sailing Lore, and Lore of
a specific type of sea creature (such as Shark Lore)
to your background options.
