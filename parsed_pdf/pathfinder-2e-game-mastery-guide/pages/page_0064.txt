high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes
sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy
to overcome—and remember that most regeneration gets
easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to
decrease the creature’s total HP by double its regeneration
value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it
can’t prevent a creature’s death and there isn’t always have
a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature
more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.
If a creature can use an ability that heals it, that ability
typically restores more HP since it costs actions. An at-will
healing ability should be based on a heal spell 2 levels
lower than the highest-level spell a creature of that level
could ordinarily cast (for example, an 11th-level creature
can typically cast up to 6th-level spells, so you would base
its healing ability on a 4th-level heal spell). If the ability
both deals damage and heals, use that same baseline scale
from above but with vampiric touch instead of heal.

IMMUNITIES,
WEAKNESSES, AND
RESISTANCES
If it’s highly thematic for a creature to have an immunity,
weakness, or resistance, consider adding it. Table 2–8 lists
the ranges for weaknesses and resistances by level.
Immunities are generally reserved for creatures made
of an unusual substance (like a fire elemental being
immune to fire). You can also give an immunity if a
creature’s biology or construction would logically cause
it to be unaffected (like a mindless creature’s immunity
to mental effects).
If the creature should be hard to affect with something
but the conditions above aren’t true, give it a resistance
instead. For instance, a giant octopus isn’t actually made
of cold water, so it wouldn’t be immune to cold, but its
life in the ocean depths make it resistant to cold. You’ll
typically use the lower end of the value on Table 2–8 for
a broad resistance that applies to a wide range of effects,
like “physical 5 (except silver)” and the higher end for
something narrower, like a single damage type. A creature
with a resistance, especially a broad resistance or a physical
resistance, usually has fewer HP.
Giving your creature a weakness adds flavor to it and
greatly rewards effective player tactics once your players
identify the weakness. The weakness should apply to one
damage type or phenomenon and use the high end of the
scale. Creatures typically have at most one weakness. If a
creature has a weakness, especially to something common,
give it additional HP. The amount of additional HP might
depend on how tough the creature should feel if the PCs
don’t exploit its weakness; a tough creature might have
additional HP equal to quadruple the weakness value.
A creature with a hard-to-exploit weakness might have
additional HP equal to the weakness value or less.
