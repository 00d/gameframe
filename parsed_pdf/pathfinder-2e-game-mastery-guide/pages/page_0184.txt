EXAMPLE
Merisiel is an elven rogue with the criminal background.
She starts with 10 in all ability scores and reduces her
Constitution to 8 for being an elf. She decides to voluntarily
lower her Strength and Intelligence to 8 each, gaining 4
flexible Ability Points. She has now set her minimum
scores: Str 8, Dex 10, Con 8, Int 8, Wis 10, and Cha 10.
In Step 2, she starts by determining how many points
she has to spend. She gains 2 dedicated Ability Points in
Intelligence and Dexterity for being an elf, 2 in Dexterity
for being a criminal, and 2 more in Dexterity for being a
rogue. She also has 19 flexible points to spend: 15 plus 4
for the two ability scores she voluntarily lowered to 8.
Merisiel purchases an 18 in Dexterity, which costs her the
6 dedicated Ability Points plus 11 flexible Ability Points.
Spending her 2 dedicated Ability Points in Intelligence
brings her to a 10, which she’s happy with. She now has
8 flexible Ability Points left. She’s worried she’ll be too
frail with a Constitution score of only 8, so she spends
4 flexible Ability Points to increase it to 12, leaving her
with 4 Ability Points left over. Finally, she raises Wisdom
and Charisma each to 12 because it’s inexpensive but still
grants her bonuses; this uses all her Ability Points, leaving
her with Str 8, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 12.
When she reaches 2nd level, she gains 2 Ability Points.
She decides to save these until 3rd level, when she gains 2
more. She then spends 3 of her 4 Ability Points to raise her
Constitution from 12 to 14. She then saves up for more
Dexterity, gaining 2 Ability Points each at 4th and 5th
levels, then 3 each at 6th and 7th levels. She spends all 11
Ability Points at 7th level to gain a 20 in Dexterity! Unless
it helps her to have an odd score (for example, to satisfy
a feat prerequisite), it’s usually best to wait until she has
enough Ability Points that increasing a score will increase
her modifier—just in case she changes her mind.
ALTERNATIVE SCORES
The classic ability scores aren’t of equal value in the rules.
Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom tend to be more
important unless a character requires a particular ability
score from among the other three for a specific purpose. If
you’d prefer ability scores to all be of roughly equivalent
value in character building, this variant creates six ability
scores that are in much closer balance with each other.
Make the following changes.
 • Strength does everything that both Strength
and Constitution do in the Core Rulebook, and
Constitution is gone. A character uses their Strength
for melee weapon and unarmed attack rolls, damage
rolls, Athletics, Hit Points, Fortitude saves, and so on.
 • Dexterity splits into two ability scores. The first, still
called Dexterity, represents manual dexterity and
applies to ranged weapon and unarmed attack rolls,
attack and damage rolls with finesse attacks (if better
than Strength), and Thievery checks. Agility, which
represents footwork, applies to Armor Class, Reflex
saves, Acrobatics checks, and Stealth checks.
 • Charisma applies to Will saves instead of Wisdom.
• Wisdom is otherwise unchanged.
 • Intelligence is unchanged.
You’ll need a small number of gameplay tweaks. Anklets
of alacrity become an Agility apex item, both the belt of
giant strength and belt of regeneration become Strength
apex items, and so on. The rogue’s thief racket is obsolete,
so you might allow rogues to choose a different racket but
still gain Thievery. For anything else that references an
ability score, such as feats with a Dexterity prerequisite,
decide with you group whether Dexterity or Agility
makes more sense as the prerequisite. For instance, Agility
would make sense for Feather Step since that feat involves
footwork. Prewritten NPCs and monsters can just use their
Dexterity modifier when their Agility modifier is necessary.
