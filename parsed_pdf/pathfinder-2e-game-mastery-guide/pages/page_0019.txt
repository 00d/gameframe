reach them, or someone Investigating ancient hieroglyphs
might critically fail and lead the party in the wrong
direction. This does not apply for exploration activities
that are discrete and occur when the group is taking a
pause or zooming in on a particular action, such as Treat
Wounds. Characters can always drop out of a continual
exploration activity to perform a discrete one (even if they
are fatigued and can’t sustain an exploration activity as
they travel), and they can change activities at any time.
The Core Rulebook covers how to adjudicate specific
activities—Detect Magic, Follow the Expert, Investigate,
and Search—on page 496.
MORE ON SEARCHING
The rules for Searching deliberately avoid giving intricate
detail on how long a search takes. That’s left in your hands
because the circumstances of a search can vary widely.
If the group isn’t in any danger and has time for a really
thorough search, that’s a good time to allow them to
automatically succeed, rather than bothering to roll, or
you might have them roll to see how long it takes before
they find what they’re looking for, ultimately finding it
eventually no matter the result. Conversely, if they stop
for a thorough search in the middle of a dungeon, that’s
a good time for their efforts to draw unwanted attention!
PCs might get to attempt another check if their initial
search is a bust. But when do you allow them to try again?
It’s best to tie this to taking a different tactic. Just saying “I
search it again” isn’t enough, but if a PC tries a different
method or has other tools at their disposal, it could work.
Be generous with what you allow, as long as the player puts
thought into it! If you know a search isn’t going to turn
up anything useful, make that clear early on so the group
doesn’t waste too much time on it. If they’re determined to
