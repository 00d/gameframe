NATIONS
From the smallest of city-states to a continent-spanning empire, nations define the political
landscape of a setting and inform local culture and traditions. Knowing the details of a
nation can help you as a Game Master, whether your game revolves around international
disputes or you simply need to know what languages the common people are likely to speak.
Nations vary tremendously, from massive empires to isolated
island realms, and their characteristics can give flavor and
depth to your story and the PCs’ adventures. An encounter
in shadowy Nidal, where allegiance to Zon‑Kuthon has
literally blocked the sun from the sky, is going to have a very
different tone than one in sun‑drenched Thuvia. A nation
working to overcome generations of xenophobia, like
Kyonin, might have a different reaction to adventurers than
a long‑established empire like Taldor. A journey into a new
nation can introduce the heroes to a new people (if the party
visits the hobgoblin nation of Oprak), a new philosophy
(such as the materialistic Prophecies of Kalistrade in Druma),
or a new foe (as visitors to the undead‑ridden Gravelands
will certainly learn).
Nations can also provide adventuring inspiration
and hooks. When the heroes are caught in the crossfire
between two nations in conflict, national concerns
become their own. Learning more about a nation’s history
or practices might lead to a great finding—or a loathsome
practice the characters want to eradicate. A party might
get involved in the political machinations of a nation’s
elite power mongers, or they might fall out of favor and
find themselves on the run from the law!
Nations also influence a character’s story on a personal
level. A nation can suggest a character’s ancestry, inform
the languages they speak, and influence their choice of
deity. As a GM, the relationship between a character and
a nation can provide opportunities to better hook that
character into your campaign. Has the character always
lived there, or have they emigrated from elsewhere—and
why? A character who fled due to political persecution
might have long‑standing enemies, while a hero who left
due to ideological differences might have friends and
family who seek to return them to the fold.
NATION STAT BLOCK
The stat block for a nation presents the core information
about a nation in a simple, streamlined format.
NATION NAME
NATION
ALIGNMENT
OTHER TRAITS
As with any stat block, a nation has a list of traits that convey
its properties at a glance. The most significant of these is the
nation’s alignment trait, which indicates the alignment of the
nation and its government as a whole. This doesn’t necessarily
reflect the alignment of its people, though—a nation is rarely
monolithic, and the alignments of its people may differ
drastically from those of the nation as a whole.
Any other traits in the nation stat block reflect overarching
characteristics about that nation. For example, the elven nation
of Kyonin has the elf trait, indicating that it was created by
and remains almost exclusively populated by elves. Similarly, a
nation with an extremely particular focus might have a trait to
represent that, such as Galt, which has the revolutionary trait.
Following the traits is a brief summary of the nation.
Government This names the formal government and describes
the nation’s governmental structure, such as a hereditary
monarchy, an elected council, or a theocratic dictatorship.
Capital This is the established seat of the nation’s government,
with the city’s population in parentheses.
Population The predominant ancestries of the nation are listed
here, ordered from most to least common.
Languages The languages commonly spoken in the nation
appear here, listed alphabetically.
Religions This lists the religions and philosophies commonly
practiced in the nation. If a nation has a state religion, this is
indicated in parentheses following that religion. If a nation
has prohibited any religions, those are listed in a Prohibited
entry following the common religions.
Other Characteristics A nation might have distinctive
features that set it apart from other nations, such as the
predominance of firearms in Alkenstar. Each such feature is
detailed in this entry, though a nation rarely has more than
one or two of these entries, and many don’t have any.
Primary Exports This lists the nation’s primary exports, such as
raw materials, finished goods, services, and other resources.
If the nation has no exports of note, this entry is omitted.
Primary Imports Much like primary exports, this entry details
the resources commonly imported by the nation. Like exports,
if the nation has no imports of note, this entry is omitted.
Allies This entry lists other nations, and occasionally large
organizations, allied with the nation. It is omitted for
nations with no significant relationships.
Enemies Other nations (and sometimes organizations) that
oppose the nation appear here. This entry is omitted for
nations with no enemies to speak of.
Factions Any significant organizations or factions operating
within the nation are listed in this entry.
Threats This entry lists various threats the nation faces, such
as aggression from neighboring nations, natural disasters,
economic instability, magical anomalies, and so on.
Significant NPCs The final section of the nation’s stat block
presents the most significant NPCs of that nation, including
its ruler. These may not be the most powerful or influential
individuals in the nation, and instead are those most likely
to be known by people within and outside of the nation.
