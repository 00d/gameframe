from their long hours of backbreaking labor, and they tend to have a unique
perspective on life and death.

FORCED LABOR
Many creatures and societies still
practice forced labor, whether
through full enslavement or
indebted labor to pay a society for
their crimes. The dockhand, farmer,
miner, and servant could also be
forced laborers. Forced laborers
could become allies or at least
informants to PCs who free them.
