dormant until the weapon hits a creature, at which point black
thorns protrude from the weapon and dig into your body; the
weapon fuses to you and you can’t use the hand that holds
the weapon for any other purpose. If the weapon is
two-handed, it attaches itself to only a single hand
(GM’s choice).
DEGENERATING
CURSE 5
RARE
ACID
CURSED
 NECROMANCY
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
Failure makes the weapon crumble. Whenever you
critically fail an attack roll with the weapon, the
degenerating curse deals 1d10 acid damage to the
weapon, ignoring its Hardness and resistances.
DEPENDENT
CURSE 9
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage curses gear used for skills or a weapon
The dependent curse makes an item function properly only under
certain circumstances. Whenever you use the item to perform a
skill check or use the weapon in combat, your degree of success
is one worse than the result you rolled unless those specific
conditions are met. The most common types of dependent
curses are nocturnal or diurnal—functioning normally only
at night or only during the day, respectively—but more
restrictive curses do exist, such as a curse that restricts
the item’s use to underground or a curse that allows the
item to function effectively only during autumn.
DREARY
CURSE 3
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage curses armor
When you invest this armor, a personal-sized cloud appears
over your head and begins to rain on you, and the armor
fuses to you. This extinguishes uncovered flames and
soaks other objects you are carrying or holding, potentially
ruining them. Cold conditions are one step worse
under the cloud, and at the GM’s discretion it
might cause other problems, such as interfering
with sleep.
ERRATIC TRANSPOSING
CURSE 11
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
This curse bursts with uncontrolled teleportation magic
when activated, unreliably transporting creatures across
the battlefield. On a critical hit with the affected weapon,
you and an ally within 60 feet (chosen randomly) teleport
to switch places with one another. If either of the affected
creatures is unable to entirely fit within its new space, the
creature is placed in the nearest available squares instead.
GRANDSTANDING
CURSE 11
RARE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
Weapons with the grandstanding curse inspire overconfidence
in their wielders, demanding style over pragmatism. Whenever
you reduce a foe to 0 Hit Points, you lose all remaining actions
on your turn, as you are compelled to flourish, gloat, pose, or
otherwise waste your time in response.
OVERDRAMATIC
CURSE 5
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
The weapon flashes excessive light with each attack.
On a critical hit with the weapon, you are blinded
until the end of your turn and take the effects of a
faerie fire spell until the start of your next turn.
RAUCOUS
CURSE 3
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage curses gear or a weapon
While more annoying than deadly, a raucous curse is the bane
of subtlety. Whenever you use the affected item, you must
loudly yell what you are attempting to do with it, ruining any
attempts at stealth. Failure to announce your action or speak
at an appropriate volume automatically causes the attempted
action to become a critical failure.
RAVENOUS
CURSE 1
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage curses a ring, staff, or wand
A ravenous curse draws power from the wielder’s body.
Whenever you activate the item, you become incredibly
hungry and immediately begin to starve (Core Rulebook 500).
You require 10 times as much food as normal for the next day.
STAINING
CURSE 1
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage curses gear or a weapon
This property is associated with a specific color, which is
defined at the time of the curse’s creation. Whenever you use
the affected equipment while taking a manipulate
action with another object, the second object is
permanently stained the associated color. For
instance, if you used a set of yellow staining lockpicks
to open a door, the lock would permanently become yellow. This
color change does not otherwise unnaturally persist and can be
changed via any normal mundane or magical means.
WITHERING
CURSE 13
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
 NECROMANCY
Usage curses a ring, staff, or wand
A withering curse shrivels vulnerable flesh. Whenever you
activate the item, one of your fingers turns black and falls off.
You take a –1 status penalty to Thievery checks and Dexterity-
based attack rolls with a hand missing two or three fingers; if
you lose more than four fingers on one hand, you can’t use that
hand to hold objects or use manipulate actions. These fingers
can be replaced by magic but are otherwise gone forever. The
GM has the final say on how creatures with unusual appendages
or numbers of fingers are affected by this curse.
