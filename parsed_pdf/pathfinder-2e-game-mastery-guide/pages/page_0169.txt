LEADERSHIP
While many groups of PCs are isolated heroes who get the job done on their own, other
groups enjoy gathering allies and building new organizations of their own. The leadership
subsystem allows your PCs to do just that!
Leadership is a long-term subsystem wherein one or more
PCs establish a fledgling organization and accumulate
followers over time. This subsystem provides a flexible
way to reflect the party’s growing influence in and
connection to the world around them through downtime
events and periodic benefits similar to those gained
from joining an existing in-world organization. The
organization can come into play only during downtime,
or it can provide adventure seeds or even play a major
role in a campaign.
ORGANIZATION LEVELS
Every organization has a level from 1 to 20. Any
organization below level 1 has no followers; it’s just an
ordinary group of PCs. Unlike many other subsystems in
this chapter, leveling up an organization in the leadership
subsystem does not involve accumulating points. Instead,
the process of growing the organization itself is what
causes it to level up! As a reward for quests, roleplaying
scenes, or succeeding at other subsystems (particularly
influence or reputation), the PCs can add an NPC follower
to their organization. At first, only a few level 0 NPCs
follow the PCs, but as the party builds up more followers,
they can also gain followers of higher and higher level, as
well as a small number of higher-level lieutenants to lead
groups of followers. Once an organization has recruited
enough followers, the organization itself levels up, which
increases the maximum level of followers, the number of
lieutenants, and the level range of those lieutenants.

BASE OF OPERATIONS
Beyond the very smallest organizations, PCs need some
kind of base of operations the organization calls home.
This allows the organization to function and grow in its
intended role. For instance, if the PCs run a mercenary
army, it might have a keep for training and as a base
for defending the nearby area. While organizations
usually gain a base of operations early in their existence,
they must have one by 6th level unless the story of the
organization demands otherwise. A base of operations is
not necessarily immobile; a caravan, circus, or flagship
(or fleet, for a larger organization) could serve well for
wandering organizations.
ORGANIZATION NPCS
Followers and lieutenants are noncombatant NPCs of the
levels indicated on Table 3–3: Organization Statistics by
Level. When an organization has followers or lieutenants
of several levels, most of them are at the lowest possible
level. As a rule of thumb, an organization has twice as
many NPCs of a given level than of the next-higher level.
This allows you to quickly estimate the level composition
of the organization’s members, but you can of course
change the levels of various followers as much as you like.
When the minimum level for lieutenants increases, either
the lower-level lieutenants level up to the new minimum,
or they become followers of more powerful lieutenants
the PCs recruit, whichever fits best with the story.
Followers and lieutenants are loyal to the PCs and their
organization, working to maintain the organization, its
base of operations, and their own way of life. Because
of this work, PCs don’t need to pay for basic upkeep of
their base of operations or for expansions to house the
burgeoning activity as their organization grows in level—
the followers and lieutenants take care of all of that.
But similarly, these followers and lieutenants never get
involved in the PCs’ adventuring, nor do they provide a
source of free magic or labor.
COHORTS AND NEW PCS
While the followers and lieutenants who define an
organization’s advancement don’t accompany the PCs on
adventures, sometimes the organization is the perfect plot
hook to introduce an NPC who will be traveling along
