NIGHTMARE FEVER
DISEASE 8
DISEASE
NECROMANCY
OCCULT
Thought to be caused by a night hag’s curse, nightmare fever
inflicts you with terrible nightmares, and you awaken with the
wounds you received in your dreams. Some versions cause
you to dream of being wounded by bludgeoning or piercing
weapons, in which case you take that type of damage instead.
Damage and the fatigued condition caused by the disease
can’t be healed until the disease is removed.

fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 4d6 slashing damage and fatigued

Will save against the disease’s DC or become frightened 2 (1

you take slashing damage, you must succeed at a Will save
against the disease’s DC or become paralyzed for 1 round (1
day); Stage 5 6d6 slashing damage and unconscious
BRAIN WORMS
DISEASE 11
DISEASE
VIRULENT
Scholars suspect these brain parasites have an otherworldly
or extraplanar origin. Though transmitted by the bites of
infected targets, the disease remains relatively rare—most
hosts are killed by the effects before they can pass it on. While
infected, whenever you attack due to confusion, you bite your
target (if you don’t have a jaws or fangs attack, you deal
piercing damage as an unarmed attack with damage equal to
your lowest unarmed attack).
 Saving Throw DC 28 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 stupefied 2
(1 day); Stage 2 stupefied 2, and whenever you take damage,
you must succeed at a Will save against the disease’s DC or
become confused for 1 round (1 day); Stage 3 stupefied 3, and
whenever you take damage, you must succeed at a Will save
against the disease’s DC or become confused for 1 minute (1
day); Stage 4 stupefied 4 and confused, damage does not end
the confused condition (1 day); Stage 5 unconscious (1 day);
Stage 6 death
