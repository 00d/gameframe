affinity to elements—air, earth, fire, and water—or types of
energy—like acid, cold, and electricity—have those traits.
Some abilities typical of creatures with the traits listed
above can be found in Trait Abilities on page 70. As with
the other steps, looking at similar creatures will give you
an idea of what traits to use.
Add any traits that have detailed rules attached to
them, like amphibious, aquatic, incorporeal, mindless, and
swarm. You can add traits related to the creature category,
such as dinosaur or werecreature, but most of these traits
are pretty self-evident in play. If at any point you realize
during play that you didn’t add a trait the creature really
should have, you can usually apply it retroactively.
ABILITY MODIFIERS
Next, figure out your creature’s ability modifiers, since
these will suggest what their other statistics should be.
You don’t have to determine the exact numbers, but it’s
good to avoid creating creatures whose ability modifiers
are at odds with their abilities, like creatures with a terrible
Wisdom modifier and very high Perception. Most of the
time, you’ll just be using ability modifiers for untrained
skills, so they’re useful as a guide but not crucial.
Table 2–1 shows some benchmarks for your creatures.
Use high for the creature’s best ability modifiers,
moderate for ones they’re okay at, and low for the rest.
If a creature has a truly bad ability, you can go as low
as –5. That’s the terrible range for ability modifiers, and
doesn’t really change by level. This is most common with
animals, which have an Intelligence modifier of –4 (for
dogs, dolphins, and such) or –5 (for more instinctual
animals like spiders), and for mindless creatures, which
have a –5 Intelligence modifier.
Few creatures use the extreme column. A powerful,
dedicated spellcaster might use an extreme spellcasting
statistic, or a preternaturally charming creature like a
succubus or nymph might have an extreme Charisma
modifier. However, the most common way extreme
numbers are used is for really big, really strong creatures.
This happens with only Large or larger creatures from
1st to 5th level, only Huge or larger creatures from 6th
to 9th level, and only Gargantuan creatures from 10th to
15th level. Beyond that level, a creature doesn’t gain an
extreme Strength modifier from size alone.

BASE ROAD MAPS
You can use the following suggestions to set the baseline when
creating your road map. For example, use brute for a big, tough
creature like an ogre, and skirmisher for a darting enemy. Each
entry is a starting point you can customize as you see fit. Any
core statistic that isn’t listed should typically use moderate
numbers. You can set ability modifiers and add additional
abilities as needed. To make a creature that resembles a
character of a certain class, see Class Road maps on page 73.
Brute low Perception; high or extreme Str modifier, high
to moderate Con modifier, low or lower Dex and mental
modifiers; moderate or low AC; high Fortitude, low Reflex or
Will or both; high HP; high attack bonus and high damage
or moderate attack bonus and extreme damage
Magical Striker high attack and high damage; moderate
to high spell DCs; either a scattering of innate spells or
prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature’s
level (rounded up) minus 1
Skill Paragon high or extreme ability modifier matching
its best skills; typically high Reflex or Will and low
Fortitude; many skills at moderate or high and potentially
one or two extreme skills; at least one special ability to use
the creature’s skills in combat
Skirmisher high Dex modifier; low Fortitude, high Reflex;
higher Speed than typical
Sniper high Perception; high Dex modifier; low Fortitude,
high Reflex; moderate to low HP; ranged Strikes have high
attack bonus and damage or moderate attack bonus and
extreme damage (melee Strikes are weaker)
Soldier high Str modifier; high to extreme AC; high
Fortitude; high attack bonus and high damage; Attack of
Opportunity or other tactical abilities
Spellcaster high or extreme modifier for the corresponding
mental ability; low Fortitude, high Will; low HP; low attack
bonus and moderate or low damage; high or extreme spell
DCs; prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature’s
level (rounded up)
