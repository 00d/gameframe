DRUGS
Drugs offer short-term benefits with harmful side effects
and long-term consequences. These short-term benefits,
such as euphoria, draw many to drugs, but addiction
keeps users hooked long after their first dose. A character
can voluntarily fail their initial save against a drug, but for
each dose they consume, they must attempt a saving throw
against addiction, a disease that represents cravings and
withdrawal. Addiction is unique to each drug, so a character
can be affected by multiple instances of addiction at once.
Certain drugs alter how addiction works for that
drug, adding the virulent trait to the addiction, limiting
the maximum stage a character can reach, or adding
additional stages beyond those listed in the base affliction.
ADDICTION
DISEASE, LEVEL VARIES
Track the maximum stage you reach with each drug’s addiction.
This maximum stage is separate from your current addiction
stage for the drug. The maximum stage can’t be reduced, even
if you fully remove the disease. When you take the drug, two
things happen: you attempt a saving throw against addiction,
and you suppress the effects of addiction for 1 day. Failing
a save against addiction caused by taking the drug causes
you to go to 1 stage higher than the maximum stage you had
previously reached (2 stages higher on a critical failure). If
you’re currently suffering from addiction when you attempt
a save from taking the drug, you can’t improve your stage; if
you succeed at the save, the stage remains the same as it was.
When you attempt your save against addiction each week,
the stage you are currently at can’t get worse—it can only
stay the same or improve. The conditions from addiction
can’t be removed while you are affected by the addiction,
and suppressing addiction by taking the drug only avoids the
effects—it doesn’t remove the disease.
