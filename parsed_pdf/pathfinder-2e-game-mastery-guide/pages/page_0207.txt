COURTIERS
Though adventurers travel through perilous dungeons and across treacherous
wilderness, sometimes the most dangerous place they can end up is in a noble court.
NOBLE
Envied by many and detested by still others, nobles exude confidence and
gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles’ favorite pastimes. Day-to-day
life for a noble is often a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker,
such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties,
and game halls. However, despite what some might believe, life as a noble is
often quite dangerous and requires far more intellect than it
would appear—along with a healthy dose of suspicion.

PALACE GUARD
Every palace has its gatekeepers. Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or
those from long lines of trusted staff, the palace guards are in charge of defending
the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding
doorways, escorting nobles to various locations, and keeping those in their
charge as safe as possible. The statistics below are for the lowest rank-and-file
member of a small nation’s palace guards; they also work well for elite guards of
a lesser noble.
