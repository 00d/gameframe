Trained Animal The beast tamer fights alongside a trained animal ally of its
level or lower, most likely a tiger (Bestiary 53). The animal has the standard
number of actions, uses its normal stat block, and counts toward the
encounter’s XP budget normally.
The beast tamer can spend 1 action to gain the support benefit
appropriate to its trained animal (Core Rulebook 215). Unlike for an
animal companion, this doesn’t require the animal to use any of
its actions.
