SMITH
Most smaller communities have at least one smithy where locals and travelers can
have horses shod or equipment repaired. Larger settlements and cities often have
a variety of smiths, many specializing in blacksmithing, weapon smithing, armor
smithing, or even smelting coins in a mint. The smith is a 6th-level challenge when
competing with smithing or other crafting tasks.

GUILDMASTER
In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form
guilds to set standards of quality, establish common
prices, engage in collective bargaining with business
owners, and lobby local governments for favorable
laws. The guildmaster—often a master artisan in
their own right—also acts as an administrator and
politician, advocating for artisans in their trade. The
guildmaster is a 12th-level challenge when competing in
crafting or their area of expertise (architecture in the
example below).
