BUILDING CHARACTERS
Building a level 0 character is similar to building a 1st-level
character, but you stop after choosing your ancestry and
background. A level 0 character still gets the four free
ability boosts from Step 6 of the normal character creation
process, but not the class ability boost.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
A level 0 character is trained in Perception, all saving
throws, unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, and one
simple weapon of their choice. Additionally, they
are trained in a number of skills equal to 2 +
their Intelligence modifier. The proficiency
bonus for a level 0 character works the same
way as normal, but since the level is 0, the
total proficiency bonus for being trained is +2.
HIT POINTS
A level 0 character adds their Constitution
modifier to their ancestry Hit Points to
determine their starting Hit Points.
STARTING MONEY
A level 0 character starts
with 5 gp (50 sp) to spend on
equipment.
APPRENTICE OPTION
If the story you want to tell is about
characters who have started training to
become a particular class, you can grant
them a small number of additional abilities.
An apprentice character is trained in the
skill or skills specified for their chosen class
(such as Occultism and Performance for
a bard) in addition to the skills they gain
through their initial proficiencies. They
also gain benefits based on the class.
Alchemist
An apprentice alchemist gains the advanced
alchemy ability of the alchemy class
feature. Their advanced alchemy
level is 1, and they have one
batch of infused reagents each
day. They can make only infused
alchemical items.
LEVEL 0 CHARACTERS
Before they were heroes, every PC came from somewhere, whether they worked on a farm
like Valeros or picked pockets on the streets like Seelah. Sometimes, it can be a lot of fun
to play a prequel game years before the PCs’ first adventure as heroes, or you may have
an idea for a low-powered adventure that calls for commoners and apprentices. The rules
below provide ways to easily build and use level 0 PCs in your games.
monk
An apprentice monk gains the powerful fist class feature.
other mArtiAl clAss
An apprentice of another martial class (barbarian,
champion, fighter, ranger, or rogue) is trained in light
armor, all simple weapons, and one martial weapon listed
in the class’s initial proficiencies. If a martial class not
listed here lacks light armor or martial weapon training
(as the monk does), give it a different ability as well.
spellcAster
An apprentice spellcaster is trained in the appropriate
magic tradition and gains two cantrips from their class.
A prepared caster can’t change these cantrips each day.
GAMEPLAY
Combat can be especially dangerous for level
0 characters. For safety’s sake, you might
treat the characters as level –1 when
determining what combat encounters
are appropriate. For skill checks,
they can still accomplish tasks with
a simple trained DC using their
trained skills, but success is less
certain. Since they have fewer skills, the
party might not have anyone trained for a
given task.
If you’re playing these characters for more
than a few sessions, consider advancing them
to 1st level using the fast advancement speed
(800 XP). If your group wants a longer
experience at level 0, start the group without
the apprentice benefits, then level up to
apprentice (gaining those benefits and the
apprentice adjustments for their class), and
then level up to 1st level.
TREASURE
As the characters start with 5 gp, their
adventures up to 1st level should account for
the rest of a 1st-level character’s
starting money. That means you’ll
distribute treasure worth
10 gp × the number of PCs,
a large percentage of which
should be in currency.
