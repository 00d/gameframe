PERCEPTION
Perception is a fairly straightforward statistic. Use Wisdom
as a guide for setting it, and adjust to the high side if your
creature has acute senses or extra training. If your creature
has low Wisdom, for example, it would probably have a
low Perception modifier, or moderate if it’s supposed to
be a great hunter. Don’t make your creature’s Perception
higher just because it’s often used for initiative; creatures
with poor Perception could use a skill check for initiative
instead, such as Stealth.
SENSES
Choose or design any special senses for your creature, such
as low-light vision, darkvision, or scent. If you’re making
a sense from scratch, simply decide what it senses, whether
it has a range limit, and whether it’s precise or imprecise.
For example, a sinspawn (Bestiary 297) has “sin scent
(imprecise) 30 feet.” This means it can smell creatures
bearing its associated sin if they’re within 30 feet, and the
sense is imprecise—about as acute as human hearing.

LANGUAGES
Think about what languages the creature would need
to communicate with other creatures in its home. For
instance, many intelligent undead speak Necril, and many
creatures from the Darklands speak Undercommon. If you
want your creature to be able to speak to the PCs, be sure
it has Common; for a creature with no reason to speak the
common tongue of your setting (such as most extraplanar
creatures in a typical campaign), be sure it doesn’t. Some
creatures can understand language but can’t vocalize; in this
case, you can state that they can’t speak any language. For
creatures that need to be able to infiltrate and communicate
wherever they go, you might give them tongues or a similar
ability as a constant innate spell.
SKILLS
You have lots of flexibility in setting your creature’s skills.
Pick some skills you think are appropriate, and consider
how good the creature is at them. High skills are roughly
on par with a specialized PC of the creature’s level, though
they could be a little lower or higher. Most creatures have
at least one high skill, but no more than three. The best
skills should go with the best ability modifiers, and you
might even want to estimate the creature’s proficiency rank
for these skills. Some skills can get a high bonus for free to
fit the creature’s theme, particularly Lore skills.
CONVERTING FIRST EDITION CREATURES
If you’re converting creatures from First Edition, you won’t
find a direct numerical conversion. Instead, use the original
statistics to create your road map, giving a better AC to a
creature that had a good AC in First Edition, and so on.
Here are the main areas of difference that you’ll want to
keep in mind for your conversion.
• Ability modifiers scale differently, so don’t copy them over
exactly. The highest modifiers tend not to get as high in
Second Edition. You’ll rarely see a +10 Strength modifier,
for example. Creatures also tend to get better low
statistics at higher levels than they used to, particularly
for Dexterity and Wisdom. This is most evident in
high-level First Edition creatures with awful Dexterity.
• Low-Intelligence creatures, particularly animals, tend to
have more special actions than they would have in First
Edition. This is to make encounters with them more
dynamic and distinct. Compare dinosaurs between the
editions for good examples.
• When converting spell-like abilities to innate spells, you
might need to make some substitutions. Some spells will
appear as heightened versions of spells (such as greater
dispel magic now being heightened dispel magic), but
others will require you to find something different. Also,
don’t feel like you need to keep every spell; focus on the
most thematic and potent ones. The Spells section on
page 65 has more advice on this subject.
• Damage reduction has been replaced with two options:
resistance to all damage (possibly with exceptions), or
more HP and a weakness. Immunities, Weaknesses, and
Resistances on page 63 describes the distinction.
• If you want to convert spell resistance, you can give the
creature a +1 status bonus to all saves against magic, or
+2 if it had abnormally high spell resistance for its level.
