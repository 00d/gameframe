Some hazards, even high-level ones, don’t make sense
with a high Hardness value. In those cases, you can skip the
Hardness and use the HP values from table 2–7: Hit Points
on page 63. Especially for complex hazards, you might
want to divide the durability over multiple sections, located
in different positions, to encourage teamwork and mobility.
OFFENSE
Almost all hazards need an attack bonus or a save DC,
and hazards that deal damage need to list a damage
value. Simple hazards deal about twice as much damage
as complex hazards and have an attack bonus even higher
than the extreme attack bonus for a creature (abbreviated
as S. Atk in Table 2–16: Offense). Complex hazards
usually have attack bonuses akin to a high attack bonus
for a creature (abbreviated as C. Atk in Table 2–16). You
can adjust them further using Table 2–9: Attack Bonus
on page 64 if your hazard needs it. Simple hazard DCs
aren’t as high for their level as their attack bonuses are,
since effects with DCs usually have some effect even on a
successful saving throw; use the EDC and HDC columns
for extreme and hard DCs on Table 2–16: Offense below.
The damage columns on the table give a damage
expression you can use, followed by the average damage
in parentheses. If you want to make your own damage
expression, remember that average damage is 2.5 for a d4,
3.5 for a d6, 4.5 for a d8, 5.5 for a d10, and 6.5 for a d12.

DESIGNING SIMPLE HAZARDS
When designing a simple hazard, make sure to select an
appropriate trigger and effect. Often, a simple hazard that
merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump
that slows down the game without much added value, so
think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both
in the story and in the game world, especially when it’s
a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed
in that location. A great simple hazard does something
interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates
with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in
some way (you can find more information on integrating
hazards with encounters in Dynamic Encounters on
page 48).
DESIGNING COMPLEX HAZARDS
Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the
part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all
its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when
designing a simple hazard don’t apply when designing a
complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage
over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim,
and isn’t intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle.
Complex hazards have a lot more in common with
creatures than simple hazards do, and you’ll see that a
complex hazard’s statistics are similar to those of a creature.
A good complex hazard often requires disabling multiple
components or otherwise interacting with the encounter
in some way. For instance, while the Core Rulebook’s
poisoned dart gallery requires only one Thievery check to
disable, the control panel is on the far end of the gallery, so
a PC would need to make their way across first.
Building Routines
A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it
stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap,
instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex
haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make
sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an
environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each
round shouldn’t be able to seek out and precisely target
only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within
range or everything within range, depending on how you
describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be
able to recognize life force and target living creatures.
If you create a hazard that can’t consistently attack the
PCs (like the Core Rulebook’s blade pillar, which moves
in a random direction), you can make it deadlier than
normal in other ways.
The hazard should have as many actions as you feel
it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine
out into several actions, you can also remove some of
the hazard’s actions once partial progress is made in
disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling
of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the
hazard if it appears in a encounter alongside creatures.
