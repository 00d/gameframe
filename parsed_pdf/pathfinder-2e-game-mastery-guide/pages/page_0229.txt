MYSTICS
Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever
transformed—or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a
charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and
treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
ADEPT
Adepts have unlocked only the most minor occult mysteries of the universe. A few
are chosen by accomplished practitioners for further training. Others volunteer to
join a cabal by passing an initiation ritual.

HARROW READER
A harrow deck is a set of 54 cards with symbolic illustrations that serves as a
sacred divining tool. Feared by the superstitious and avoided by those who know
better than to tempt fate, harrow readers live and work in traveling communities,
often moving from town to town as opportunities arise. For encounters involving
social interaction, the harrow reader is a 3rd-level challenge.

Fated Doom While harrow readers try to avoid combat, no throw of the cards can
avoid fate, so a harrow reader learns how to best survive. In the harrow reader’s
first encounter each day, they gain a +1 status bonus to their initiative roll, their
attack rolls, and their AC.
CULTIST
Excessively zealous, a cultist finds exalted purpose in their sect. Never questioning
their leader, they devote themselves to achieving their most perfect spiritual form.
