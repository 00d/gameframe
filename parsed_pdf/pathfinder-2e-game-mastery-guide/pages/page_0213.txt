DEVOTEES
Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees
seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.
ACOLYTE
Underling clerics are still learning the tenets of their faith and answer to a superior
priest. Their days are spent in devotion and learning, sequestered in temples.

not received true divine missives, but have misinterpreted normal dreams.

ZEALOT
Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church’s
followers. This zealot serves Asmodeus, but others might serve Abadar, Calistria,
Iomedae, Norgorber, Pharasma, Sarenrae, or Zon-Kuthon. They often ride a war horse
(Bestiary 209) wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.
SWAPPING DEITIES
Customize an acolyte or priest by
matching their deity’s alignment
and favored weapon, adding the
deity’s divine skill at +14 (or +7), and
swapping spells. An example appears
on the facing page. (An acolyte gains
only the 1st-level spells, domain spell,
and cantrips, and has two 1st-level
heal spells instead of three 3rd-level
heal spells.) If you swap harm spells
for heal, replace Healing Hands with
the Selective Energy cleric feat.
