ASTRONOMER
Different cultures have created stories of the hows and whys of the universe, if
things exist beyond the stars, and if the gods manipulate the heavenly bodies. But
astronomers aren’t interested in folktales—they desire truth.

SAGE
The greatest knowledge comes from experience. Village elders, ancient seers,
and advisors to royalty are examples of individuals who are valued for their
experiences. Sages serve their people as much as their sovereigns. They educate
and try to prevent their people from straying from their cultures’ acceptable
norms and traditions. Sages rarely take power for themselves, as they take their
responsibility seriously to guide wisely and empower those they serve.
