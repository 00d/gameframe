ARCHER SENTRY
Archer sentries slightly outrank the rank-and-file guards, taking positions on walls,

JAILER
A jailer’s primary responsibility is to keep prisoners from
escaping. Jailers must often use force, or the threat of
force, to keep their charges in line, as even the most
carefully crafted cells, manacles, or chains can fail
with time and persistence when the prisoners have
the will to attempt an escape.
