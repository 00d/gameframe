GLOSSARY
and INDEX
ADVISOR
Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance in the ears of
those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their counsel that they make few
decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events.
Advisors are often master manipulators, and their guidance can shape a barony or even
a kingdom—for good or ill.

SPY
No empire would be complete without its spies. The spy is a master of infiltrating
the court and blending in: they might be one of a number of nobles, a beloved
confidante of the queen, or even the court jester. Spies use their skills to subtly
manipulate courtiers, turn enemies against one another, and collect valuable
information either for blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder.
