Most creatures don’t have an extreme skill unless
they are world class for their level, like a succubus’s
Diplomacy. Having an extreme skill is less impactful than
an extreme AC or attack bonus, but still might warrant a
sacrifice elsewhere, especially if the creature also has more
high skills than usual. There’s no need for terrible skill
modifiers, since an untrained skill usually represents that.

SPECIAL MODIFIERS
You can also add special, thematic modifiers for certain
skill uses. For instance, you might give a creature that
secretes adhesive “Athletics +7 (+9 to Climb or Grab).”
This special bonus should still remain at or below the
extreme number, especially if it has a combat purpose like
the Grab bonus above.
ITEMS
If you gave a creature gear equivalent to a PC, your PCs
would gain a huge amount of treasure by defeating a
large group of them. Using Table 2–4: Safe Items can help
you avoid that. A creature can have a single permanent
item of the listed level without issue. For example, if
a 6th-level creature has a +1 weapon, that item’s not
worth so much that the PCs would be massively rich if
they encountered many creatures of that type and sold
everything they found. You can give a creature several
lower-level items too. Just pay attention to your overall
treasure as measured against the guidelines on pages
508–510 of the Core Rulebook. At the lowest levels, a
creature can certainly have multiple level 0 items, even
though normally a creature should have only one item of
the level listed in the Safe Item Level column.
Specific creatures or NPCs have more leeway to break
these guidelines because you can plan the rest of your
adventure’s loot around them. Also, giving a boss villain
a powerful magic item makes the fight and its aftermath
more interesting.

ARMOR CLASS
Because AC is one of the most important combat stats,
you need to be more careful with setting this number
for any creature you expect will end up in a fight. Low
AC typically fits spellcasters, who compensate with their
IMPROVISING A CREATURE
As you get more experienced, you might find that you don’t
need to build some creatures in advance. In many cases,
especially for simple creatures, you can just select values from
the relevant tables on the fly and track its HP. When you do,
track which value you used as it came up. For instance, let’s
say you’re improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it’s
time for initiative, you decide it has moderate Perception and
jot down “Per +8.” Your group’s fighter beats it at initiative and
attacks. You decide the soldier has high AC—looking at Table
2–5, you see that’s 18—and add this information to your note.
The fighter’s Strike hits, and you select the low end of high HP:
36. Well, now it’s 25. Your note says “Per +8, AC 18, HP 25.” If
it gets to take a turn, you can give it a Strike then.
