CLASS ROAD MAPS
You can use these suggestions when creating your road map to
emulate a PC class, customizing as you see fit. You’ll still need to
look through the class to pick feats, weapons, and the like. Any
statistic that isn’t specifically listed can use moderate numbers.
Alchemist low Perception; high Crafting; high Int, moderate or
better Dex or Str; low to moderate HP; moderate attack with bombs;
infused alchemical items, Quick Bomber if a bomber alchemist, a few
other alchemist abilities; it’s usually easier to give the alchemist its
