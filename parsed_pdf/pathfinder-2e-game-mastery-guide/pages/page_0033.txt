NARRATIVE COLLABORATION
The relationship between you, your players, and the story is what makes roleplaying games
successful and memorable. If all the players at the table contribute ideas, the game holds
more surprises for everyone—including you!
While some players like to sit back and let the Game
Master control everything, most players want their
contributions to shape the campaign’s story. This is central
to the concept of player agency—making players feel like
the choices they make really matter, and that the world is
a living place they can change through their decisions. In
some games, the players can step beyond the traditional
divide between GM and players to directly influence how
the story progresses. Below are three methods you can use
to balance the narrative control of your game.
IDEA FARM
Coming up with ideas for a campaign can sometimes feel
overwhelming. This is where your players come in handy!
You can solicit direct feedback from them and implement
their ideas into the game. This style of narrative control
preserve your authority over the game while giving players
the chance to incorporate elements into the game you know
they want to see. It doesn’t venture beyond the traditional
structure of a fantasy roleplaying game.
Plan for a few checkpoints throughout the campaign
where you touch base with your players to get their ideas. The
most crucial comes at the start of the game. It’s best to take
this step before you even set to work on crafting the world
or plot, so that player input can define what’s important in
the game world. Later, checkpoints can coincide with major
story milestones. For example, if the players set off across
the sea, you might ask where they want their voyage to end
and what sites, if any, they’d like to explore along the way.
CREATIVE
COLLABORATION
You might have players develop the stories of some of the
regions or NPCs, while your contributions serve as the
glue that makes it all work together. This breaks somewhat
with traditional RPG structures, in that you might not be
the expert on all areas of the setting and plot.
Your collaboration will depend on the interests of you
and the other players. Maybe one draws a city map, another
makes the stats and personality for an NPC, another
controls some monsters in combat, and a fourth doesn’t
want to do anything beyond playing their character. There’s
a trade-off here, because while you’ll be off-loading some
of your work, you’ll also need to ensure consistency across
these multiple sources of ideas. It can really help to keep a
log of which player is in charge of each part of your setting.
If you expect one of a player’s specialties to appear in an
upcoming session, let them know ahead of time so they can
prepare or discuss their ideas in advance with you.
DECENTRALIZED
STORYTELLING
So what if you want to go all the way and completely
break down the walls between the GM and other players?
What if you want to preside over a game in which anyone
can speak for any of the NPCs, and when someone tries
to determine what’s down the next hallway, it’s just as
likely to come from another player as from you? Now
we’re talking about decentralized storytelling, the least
traditional approach we’ll cover here.
In this approach, one of your biggest jobs is asking
questions or giving prompts. “When you open the door,
what’s beyond?” “How does the king react to Lem’s taunt?”
You can direct your questions to individual players, leave
them open to all, and put forth your own suggestions.
This approach works best when players are comfortable
with one another and willing to both take responsibility in
building the story and accept that some of their ideas will
go unused. It’s well suited for shorter campaigns, or ones
in which players take turns in the GM’s seat.
CHALLENGES
The largest risk of putting narrative control in multiple
people’s hands is losing a cohesive story. When multiple
people have conflicting ideas about the tone of the game or
particulars of the setting, you can end up with something
that doesn’t satisfy anyone. One of your tasks as GM is to
recap events to clarify and reinforce the shared narrative.
Shared narrative control also complicates planning
ahead. The group might need to improvise an encounter,
take a break while you (and maybe other players) prep to
go in a new direction, or even revise their plans. It helps to
limit yourself to creatures that you can quickly find stats for
in a Bestiary volume or in the NPC Gallery of this book to
avoid spending hours of work on creatures you won’t use.
Also, don’t lose sight of your own enjoyment! You
shouldn’t sacrifice how much fun you have for others.
STORY POINTS
If you prefer, you can give players a number of Story
Points at the start of each session (typically 2 or 3). They
can cash these in to determine what happens next in the
story. Having a currency like this means you can keep your
steady hand on the tiller while allowing other players to
interject when it’s important to them. For most groups, a
Story Point should allow the player to suggest a plot twist
that can be resolved quickly, or to establish a relevant fact
or NPC attitude. It can’t determine the outcome of an
entire scene or vastly alter the reality of the setting.
