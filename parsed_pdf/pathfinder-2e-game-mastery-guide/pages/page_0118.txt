OATH OF THE FLESH
CURSE 7
ABJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
When you swear an oath, you must obey that oath or suffer
terrible consequences.
Saving Throw DC 23 Fortitude; Effect Each time you make a
promise to someone, an ornate symbol representing that
promise is magically carved into your flesh. Breaking any
of these promises causes the symbol tattoo to grow into
a gaping wound, dealing 3d6 slashing damage to you;
damage from the curse can’t be healed as long as the curse
is still in effect.

CURSE
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Even the most experienced combat veteran becomes as
reckless as a rookie when suffering from sellsword’s folly.
Saving Throw DC 26 Will; Effect The chaos of combat
overwhelms you. Each time you roll initiative for a combat
encounter, you must attempt a new saving throw against
the curse; on a failure, you become confused for 1 round.
This is an incapacitation effect.
CURSE OF SLUMBER
CURSE 11
CURSE
INCAPACITATION
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
SLEEP
This legendary curse sends you into a sleep indistinguishable
from death.
Saving Throw DC 28 Fortitude; Effect You fall asleep for 1
round (or permanently on a critical failure) and seem to
be dead; a creature must succeed at a DC 30 Medicine
check to realize you are alive. Noise doesn’t awaken you,
but taking damage gives you a new saving throw against
the curse.
REVILING EARTH
CURSE 12

A reviling earth curse usually appears across a specific

This curse kills through dehydration in the same vein as the
curse of the ravenous, but with deadly speed.
Saving Throw DC 32 Fortitude; Effect You gain no benefit from
drinking water or other liquids and begin suffering from
thirst (Core Rulebook 500). Each day, you receive a new
saving throw against the curse.
REVILED OF NATURE

CURSE
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
This curse makes the hunter into the hunted, drawing the ire
of animals wherever you go.
Saving Throw DC 38 Will; Effect Creatures of the natural
world abhor you. Whenever an animal becomes aware of
you, it must attempt a Will save against the curse. On a
failure, it attacks you and fights to the death.
THIEF’S RETRIBUTION
CURSE 19
CONJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
This punishment causes you to lose something dear to you
whenever you rob or steal. If you have nothing to lose, the
curse exacts its punishment upon your body instead.
Saving Throw DC 39 Fortitude; Effect Each time you steal
something, you lose something more valuable—this item
is whisked away and can’t be found again. Typically this
item is one of greater monetary value, but it might be one
of greater value in another sense, such as one of greater
emotional value, or something you need to complete a
task. If you aren’t carrying anything of greater value at
the time of the theft, you lose one of your limbs instead,
taking 10d6 slashing damage and losing use of that limb.
The damage can’t be healed, nor the limb restored, until
the stolen item is returned, even through use of spells
like regenerate.
SWORD OF ANATHEMA
CURSE 20
CURSE
DIVINE
EVOCATION
With divine intervention, followers of a deity can bestow this
curse upon an enemy of the faith.
Saving Throw DC 40 Will; Effect You are marked by the deity
invoked as an enemy of the church. You gain weakness 10
to damage dealt by worshippers of that deity.
GRAVE CURSE
CURSE, LEVEL VARIES
CURSE
NECROMANCY
MAGICAL
A grave curse punishes you for stealing from a tomb or other
resting place.
Saving Throw Will save, with a high spell DC for a monster
of its level (page 65); Effect You are hounded by undead
creatures of the same level as the curse. Every night,
you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, an
incorporeal undead manifests to hassle and harry you
throughout the night, retreating before it can take much
damage and often preventing you from gaining a full
night’s rest. Whenever you enter a graveyard or other
area where bodies are buried, you must succeed at the
same flat check or a body animates as a corporeal undead
(typically a skeleton or zombie) to attack you.
 These undead are temporary and exist only to
harry you; if you take control of the undead, move on,
or otherwise avoid their attacks, incorporeal undead
discorporate and corporeal undead collapse into ordinary
corpses. The curse can be removed by returning the stolen
items to their resting place.
