MAGISTRATES
Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the
machine along under the inertia of the status quo.
JUDGE
These magistrates have the final say on the intent and spirit of the law. Properly
exercised, the duty of a judge is the strict adherence to the law regardless of station,
with minimal sentimentality toward rationalization and justification of why the
law was broken. Yet expectations and practice are not always the same thing. For
every unbiased justice, there is one who is zealously confident in their own agenda.
In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge.

TAX COLLECTOR
Ledgers and marks, positive and negative flows, and levies and
allotments are a tax collector’s daily bread. Where coin is gained, from
whom it is collected, and to whom is it disbursed are their main concerns;
the collector is unconcerned with whether the taxed can afford it or take a
loan to make up for any shortfall. However, tax collectors aren’t immune to
corruption: arrangements can be made, deals discussed, documents altered,
or coin misappropriated. When dealing with matters of taxes and finance,
the tax collector is a 3rd-level challenge.

(Core Rulebook 514).
DELAYING TACTICS
A magistrate can weaponize
the bureaucracy. A judge might
enforce an archaic law generally
ignored yet still on the books. A
tax collector could ask for the seal
of a lord who is out of the region.
The harbormaster could require all
fees in local coin, fully aware money
changers won’t be open for days.
