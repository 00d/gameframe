SCHOLARS
True power comes from knowledge: the power to shape the growth of kingdoms
by mere whispers, staying three steps ahead of adversaries, or even knowing which
flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
LIBRARIAN
Keepers of knowledge, librarians document discoveries, events, and laws. The
best librarians record events twice; once for public record, and again to record
how events truly unfolded. A librarian typically knows four to six additional
languages, often including Elven and Draconic. A librarian is a 3rd-level challenge
for encounters involving research.

Methodical Research (concentrate) When
Searching
through stacks of books, a librarian can find the answer to
almost any question. This allows the librarian to use Library Lore
in place of other lore skills, given enough time. The GM determines
the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically, a
librarian can attempt three or four checks during 1 day of downtime).

TEACHER
The passing of knowledge and traditions from generation to generation is a
time-honored occupation. Teachers exist to strengthen their populations with
literacy, history, and advanced sciences, but most of all with inspiration. Most
teachers provide general knowledge so their students are well rounded, but
some are experts or even masters of a single discipline. A teacher typically
knows three languages in addition to Common. For academic encounters, a
teacher is a 4th-level challenge.

Beside the life and natural sciences
such as arcana, biology, botany,
geology, oceanography, and zoology,
demand is increasing in cities
for more modern disciplines, like
anthropology, economics, sociology,
urban planning, and even art
curation and forensic investigation.
