The combination of more HP and a weakness has a
different feel from standard HP with resistances. If the
creature being an impervious tank really fits its theme, use
a resistance with an exception, such as “physical 5 (except
silver).” If, however, it makes more sense for normal hits
to get through and the creature to simply have great
staying power, use more HP and a weakness. Skeletons
and zombies are a good example of the difference between
these styles. Skeletons have resistances because they’re
bony and hard to hurt. Zombies, on the other hand, have
more HP and a weakness to slashing damage—they’re
tougher, but their bodies aren’t built to deflect weapon
attacks, and slashing attacks can rip them up quickly.
SPEED
Your creature’s Speed should be 25 feet if it moves like a
human. Beyond that, you can set the Speed to whatever
makes sense. Remember that the creature can move up to
triple this number if it spends its whole turn moving, so
if you want the PCs to be able to chase the creature, its
Speed can be only so high. Creatures at higher levels need
ways to deal with flying PCs, speedy PCs, and PCs with
more efficient actions that let them engage and retreat
more easily. This might mean adding a fly Speed, giving
the creature ranged attacks, and so forth.
Creatures can have climb and swim Speeds even at
low levels. While you can give your creature a fly Speed
at those low levels, it’s better to wait until around 7th
level (when PCs gain access to fly) to give your creature a
fly Speed if it also has ranged attacks or another way to
harry the PCs from a distance indefinitely.
STRIKES
When building your creature’s selection of Strikes, use
the following sections to set the Strike’s attack bonus
and damage. Give the attack all the normal traits if it’s a
weapon; for unarmed attacks or weapons you invent, give
whatever traits you feel are appropriate. Note that these
traits might influence the damage you give the Strike.
You might want to make sure a creature has an unarmed
attack if you think it’s likely to get disarmed. At 7th level
and higher, PCs might have the ability to fly, which makes
it more important for creatures to have decent ranged
Strikes to make sure they aren’t totally hopeless against
flying PCs (though they could instead have fast fly Speeds
or something similar).
STRIKE ATTACK BONUS
Use a high attack bonus for combat creatures—fighter
types—that also usually have high damage. A creature
could have a higher attack bonus and lower damage, or
vice versa (for instance, a moderate attack bonus and
extreme damage might fit a creature that’s more like a
barbarian), instead of having a poor statistic in another
category. Spellcasters typically have poor attack bonuses,
potentially in exchange for extreme spell DCs.

STRIKE DAMAGE
Table 2–10 on the next page gives the damage a creature
should deal with a single Strike. You might use a lower
category if the creature has better accuracy, or a higher
category if its accuracy is lower.
A creature that’s meant to be primarily a combat threat
uses high damage for its melee Strikes, or moderate for
melee Strikes that have the agile trait. Ranged attacks
more typically use the moderate value, or even low. A
creature that’s meant to be highly damaging uses the
extreme damage values, but might then have a moderate
attack bonus. As with most statistics, extreme damage is
more likely at higher levels. You can also use the extreme
value for special attacks that the creature can use only
a limited number of times or under circumstances that
aren’t likely to happen every round.
More versatile creatures, such as ones that can cast
some spells and aren’t meant to primarily get their damage
through Strikes, go one category lower: moderate for
their main melee Strikes, low for agile and ranged Strikes.
Spellcasters and other creatures that aren’t meant to be
competent in a direct fight might use the low damage value,
or even less if they completely don’t care about their Strikes.
On Table 2–10, you’ll find a damage expression (a die
roll or rolls plus a flat modifier) you can use as is, or you
can take the damage in parentheses and build your own
damage expression to hit that number. If you do the latter,
