DRUGS IN YOUR GAME
Drugs are socially complex, and including them in your
game has the potential to make some of your players
uncomfortable—particularly players who have struggled
with substance abuse themselves or seen friends and family
members go through that struggle. As with any potentially
difficult subject matter, you should discuss the role drugs
play in your game with your players and ensure that
all the players at the table are comfortable with the
material; if they aren’t, avoid the topic.
If you do include drugs in your game, consider the role
they’ll play. In some campaigns, drugs might simply
be an element of flavor and a tool characters use
to reach their goals; in others, the side effects
and risk of addiction might be a terrible price
to pay. The rules assume something of a middle
path, where drugs are addictive substances
that may provide a short‑term benefit but have
consequences. To make drugs more accessible in
your game, remove some of the more severe stages
of addiction. To make them more dangerous, add
the virulent trait to the addiction affliction, add
more stages with increasingly severe effects, or
increase the DC of the save against the addiction by
1 for every use of the drug, decreasing back to normal
over time as they stop using the drug.
