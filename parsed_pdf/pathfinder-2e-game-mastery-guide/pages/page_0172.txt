current level, perhaps by creating a lower-level encounter
and including notes on how to scale it up. Alternatively,
if you want to run a more challenging or open-world
hexploration, don’t adapt to your players at all. Make a
variety of encounters, some of which are so powerful that
the correct tactic is to flee. You can even create a chase to
make the escape exciting (see Chases on page 156).
terrain
While each hex should have a predominant terrain type,
your terrain can come alive using the info in the Environment
section on pages 512–519 of the Core Rulebook. A hex
might also include a river or road. These can cut through
the terrain, making it easier for the PCs to travel through
the hex, so long as they follow the path. Additionally, each
hex might have special features like resources and secrets
(see the Types of Terrain sidebar on page 172).
GENERATING RANDOM HEX MAPS
If you’d like to create your map randomly, begin by
selecting a hex on a blank map as the starting point. Then
decide the type of terrain for that starting point or roll
it on Table 3–4: Random Terrain Type. From that point
onward, let the players decide which direction they travel.
If they enter an unexplored hex, generate that hex by
rolling 1d20 on Table 3–4 and Table 3–5: Random Terrain
Feature to determine a type and element for that hex.
Apply common sense when producing terrain in this way.
Unless magic is involved, it is unlikely a patch of arctic ice
would appear in the heart of a desert—though figuring
out a way for that to occur could lead to an interesting
encounter or subplot later on.
