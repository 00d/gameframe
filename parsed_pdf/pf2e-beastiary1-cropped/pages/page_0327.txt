WEMMUTH TREASURE
Wemmuths have little interest
in using magical items or
accumulating treasure out of a
sense of greed, but are smart
enough to understand that a few
well-placed trinkets and baubles
work amazingly well as lures.
Wemmuth
Fertilized by large quantities of spilled blood, such as that found on bloodstained
battleﬁelds or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities, wemmuths
are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering, lapping up
blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable
thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to
incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that
comprise a wemmuth’s body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult
wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet
if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient
themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into
massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although
wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip
one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere
of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of
an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from
the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to
bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway
foes with terrifying precision.
Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let
loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a
scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Inﬂuential nobles from
Nirmathas and Molthune both point ﬁngers at one another for
the wemmuth’s creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune’s
close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming
the primal magic commonly employed by
Nirmathas’s many druids and rangers. Several
Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching
the wemmuth’s description attempting to
apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders
from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths
were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari,
former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the
hands of mortal heroes.
