THE GOBLIN SONG
The following ditty is perhaps the
most infamous of goblin songs.
Goblins chew and goblins bite,
Goblins cut and goblins ﬁght.
Stab the dog and cut the horse,
Goblins eat and take by force!
Goblins race and goblins jump.
Goblins slash and goblins bump.
Burn the skin and mash the head,
Goblins here and you be dead!
Chase the baby, catch the pup.
Bonk the head to shut it up.
Bones be cracked, ﬂesh be stewed,
We be goblins! You be food!
Goblin Pyro
Some goblins take their people’s admiration of ﬁre fully into the realm of deadly
obsession. These pyromaniacs can be a great boon to a band of goblin raiders
eager to torch their enemies and wreak havoc. More often, however, their presence
is a double-edged sword; in the heat of the moment, goblin pyros sometimes lose
sight of their tribe’s goals and simply set ﬁre to anything that will burn—including
their own allies.

Goblin War Chanter
While all goblins enjoy singing, goblin war chanters pride
themselves on mastering the art of vocal performance.
Their ballads and jingles are undeniably catchy,
though whether they are actually enjoyable is
entirely subjective.
