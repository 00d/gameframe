Blue Dragon
Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons.
Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often
lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and
gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue
dragon’s lackeys typically don’t even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead
think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a
cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as
a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to
use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.
Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and
hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter
how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs
palatial; they’re universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and
embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efﬁciency.
