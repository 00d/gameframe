GIANT OCTOPUS LAIRS
Giant octopuses favor shipwrecks,
coral reefs, or underwater caverns
as lairs, where they can take
advantage of narrow conﬁnes
for protection. Giant octopuses,
like their smaller kin, are fond
of adorning and decorating their
lairs with found objects—many of
which, in the giant octopus’s case,
are also magical weapons, shields,
or works of art salvaged from
sunken ships or fallen adventurers.
Octopus, Giant
Giant octopuses are found in the heart of deep, dark oceans.

Writhing Arms ʚʖ The giant octopus makes up to four Strikes with diﬀerent arms, each
against a diﬀerent target. Each attack counts separately for the octopus’s multiple attack
penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase the penalty until the octopus has made all
the attacks. If the octopus subsequently
uses the Grab action, it can Grab
any number of creatures it hit
with Writhing Arms.
