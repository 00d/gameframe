SERZILIAN
The great wyrm black dragon
Serzilian rules over the fetid
Graidmere swamp in Ustalav, where
she has resided for over 800 years.
She knows something darker even
than herself resides somewhere in
the swamp, but she has yet to ﬁnd
how to summon such an entity. For
now, she slumbers, waking only to
demand sacriﬁces.
Black dragon lairs are as foul as their souls. The ﬂoors are littered with rotting
meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid
twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes,
and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do
with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure
hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer
substance can’t survive the dragon’s acidic presence.
