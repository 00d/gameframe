unbridled ferocity against their foes. In this way, they embody both the fury of a
raging tempest and the calm of a hurricane’s eye. This can make them valuable
allies who race to the aid of those in need, but their allies remain must be alert
and mindful of their mood, as the giants can be quick to anger or aggressive
when caution is most appropriate.
Most storm giants have complexions akin to the crystal blue of the ocean or the
warm violet of a sky touched by the setting sun. Their hair tends to be dark purple,
blue, or black, and their eyes often have a silvery sheen. A typical storm giant stands
21 feet tall, weighs 12,000 pounds, and lives to be about 600 years old.

two attacks for the giant’s multiple attack penalty.

Wide Swing Ȱɵ The storm giant makes a single greatsword Strike and compares
the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as
two attacks for the giant’s multiple attack penalty.
Rune Giant
Magically crafted and bred by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to
and tyrants among their own kind, who were given power to command and
magically control other giants. The rune giants themselves served even more
powerful masters—potent wizards known as runelords—and in so doing
commanded entire armies of giants on behalf of the runelords’ empires.
In the eons since these empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a
people of their own, though to the outside world they’re little more than
fabled horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants. Rune giants
usually dwell in the most remote and rugged of towering mountain ranges,
but they can also be found in immense ruins atop lost islands, glacial valleys,
or even more remote or magical regions.
Rune giants’ striking charcoal ﬂesh is decorated by dozens of runes, which
are potent manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are towering
creatures, averaging at 40 feet in height and weighing 25,000 pounds.
