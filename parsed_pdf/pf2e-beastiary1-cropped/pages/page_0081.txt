SINFUL DESTRUCTION
While they enjoy causing
destruction themselves, most
demons prefer to trick and tempt
mortals into falling to sin of their
own volition.

Captive Rake Ȱɵ Requirements A creature is grabbed in the glabrezu’s pincer. Eﬀect The
glabrezu pulls the grabbed creature up to 5 feet closer, then makes two claw Strikes
against it. Those Strikes count as one attack when determining a treachery demon’s
multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both Strikes.
Steady Spellcasting When a reaction would disrupt a glabrezu’s spell, the demon can
attempt a DC 15 ﬂat check, avoiding the disruption on a success.
Sudden Betrayal A glabrezu can always use Deception when rolling initiative as
long as they’re aware of at least one opponent before initiative is rolled. When using
Deception for initiative, the demon gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception.
Treacherous Veil A glabrezu’s illusory disguise can allow it to appear as a creature of any size.
Twisted Desires (divination, divine) Once per month, a glabrezu can grant a mortal
humanoid the eﬀects of a miracle spell granted by an Abyssal patron, though the
glabrezu always perverts the miracle according to their own treacherous nature.
Shemhazian (Mutilation Demon)
Shemhazians rise from the souls of torturers and those who reveled in
mutilating the physical bodies of their victims. Standing 35 feet tall, a
shemhazian is well equipped with a wide range of talons, claws, and fangs to
continue inﬂicting such torments on those it encounters.
Shemhazians delight in visiting torment upon mortals, of course, but
more than most demons, these ﬁends revel in sharing the pain with their
own kind. Other demons fear and hate shemhazians for this reason, with
only the most powerful willing to work with a shemhazian to achieve a
shared goal. Even then, the shemhazian is always on the watch for an opportunity
to bring pain and suffering to its allies along with any foe.

non-evil creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a
DC 35 Fortitude save. If it fails, it’s slowed 1 for 1 round, and
if it critically fails, it is instead paralyzed for 1 round.
Succor Vulnerability A shemhazian’s mutilation is a
part of them, and they can’t bear to see it reversed.

damage the shemhazian dealt on their last turn, the
demon takes 3d6 mental damage.

ﬂying, it falls 30 feet.
