KRAKEN TREASURE
A kraken’s hoard includes the
plunder of ships lost at sea and
the wealth of sunken cities.
Virtually anything could be
found in a kraken lair, but they
especially covet scrolls, spell
books, and other tomes of ancient
lore, as well as gemstones and
rareﬁed raw materials found only
in the ocean depths.
Kraken
A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts
ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals,
the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where
they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.

Altered Weather (aura, evocation, primal) A kraken reshapes the weather within 2
miles of it, with the eﬀect of the control weather ritual centered on the kraken and
based on its emotional state, at the GM’s discretion. If the kraken dies, the weather
returns to normal immediately.

Double Attack Ȱɵ The kraken makes two Strikes with two diﬀerent arms or tentacles, each
limb targeting a diﬀerent creature. Double Attack counts
as two attacks toward the kraken’s multiple attack
penalty for further actions, but the penalty doesn’t
increase until after both attacks are made. If the
kraken subsequently uses the Grab action, it Grabs
any number of creatures it hit with Double Attack.
Ink Cloud Ȱɵ The kraken emits a cloud of black,
venomous ink in an 80-foot emanation.
This cloud has no eﬀect outside
water. Creatures inside the ink
cloud are exposed to kraken
ink poison and are undetected
while inside the cloud. The
kraken can’t use Ink
Cloud again for 2d6
rounds, and the cloud
dissipates after 1 minute.
Jet Ȱɵ (move) The kraken

seagoing vessels.
