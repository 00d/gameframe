HYENA LEGENDS
The hyena’s intense cunning,
combined with its unnerving
laughter, has caused hyenas to
become associated with all manner
of evil—hyenas are claimed to rob
graves, steal children, and wield
sinister supernatural powers.
Though normal hyenas are no
more malicious than any other
natural predator, their unearned
reputation often causes witches,
warlords, and ill-natured creatures
to seek out hyenas as pets or
guard animals. The fact that
gnolls in particular have a special
preference for hyenas, considering
the animals to be close relatives,
does little to improve the animal’s
already-poor reputation.
Hyena
Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like
cries, and they aren’t above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.
Hyena
Hyenas are cunning, powerfully built carnivores that bear a heavy resemblance
to dogs and other canines, though they are not themselves canines. Though all
hyenas are often maligned as cowardly carrion eaters, their tactics depend on
their speciﬁc breed: spotted hyenas are active pack hunters that kill most of
their prey themselves, while striped and brown hyenas are more likely to be
scavengers. Their jaws are exceptionally powerful, allowing hyenas to seize a
victim and pull it to the rest of the pack.
