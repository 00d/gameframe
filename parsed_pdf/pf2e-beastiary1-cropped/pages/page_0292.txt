BECOMING MANEATERS
Contrary to popular belief, sharks
are not particularly fond of
humanoids as meals. Only under
the right conditions—such as
when food is scarce or the shark
mistakes its victim for a seal—will
a shark attack a swimmer or small
boat. Such occasions are traumatic
enough for survivors to perpetuate
the myth of shark as maneater.
Shark
Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged,
since primordial times. They are efﬁcient, ruthless predators with multiple
rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny
ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene
of aquatic carnage.
Great White Shark
An apex predator among the coastal surface waters where it hunts, the great
white shark is one of the largest shark species. These silent killers glide gracefully
through the ocean, always in search of their next meal.

Megalodon
Prehistoric sharks of incredible size, strength, and ferocity,
megalodons scour waters deep and shallow to sate their
considerable hunger. The presence of a megalodon undeniably affects
the local aquatic ecosystem.
