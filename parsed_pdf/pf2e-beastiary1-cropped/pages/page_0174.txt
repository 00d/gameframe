Cloud Giant
The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue.
Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral,
but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud
giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested
in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such
giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships
with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist
and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves
and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other
creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate
a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders
often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.
Legends persist of ﬂoating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant
queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims
are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about
the matter.

Storm Giant
Storm giants are looming but benevolent stewards of sea and sky,
often serving as the natural guardians of tropical islands, coastlines,
or rocky archipelagos. Storm giants tend to rapidly shift in mood and
behavior, one moment engaging in peaceful negotiation, the next unleashing
GIANT PETS
As with many people, giants
enjoy keeping pets. Yet for giants,
what constitutes a pet is often
categorized as beast to others.
Large animals like bears and
lions, and megafauna like woolly
mammoths and dinosaurs are
popular, as are more magical
creatures like hell hounds,
manticores, griﬀons, and the like.
