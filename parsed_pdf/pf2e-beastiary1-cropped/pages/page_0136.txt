Desert Drake
Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and
intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush
predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and
supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and
afﬁnity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rust-
brown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they
call home.
Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though
this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and feather-
thin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert
drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as
easy as walking for it.

OTHER DRAKES
The drakes presented on these
pages are far from the only types
that exist. Forest drakes have green
hides, spit acidic clouds, and can be
found in temperate woodlands. Rift
drakes, among the most powerful
of their kind, spit clinging caustic
vapors and dwell in badlands and
regions scarred by devastating
magical disasters. Sea drakes can be
found in oceans across the world,
lava drakes in volcanic crevasses,
mist drakes along coastlines and in
salt marshes, and spire drakes in
ragged, rocky hills. Undoubtedly,
many other types of drakes lurk in
the far corners of the world!
