DAHAK
Dahak, the Endless Destruction, is
an ancient dragon god spawned by
the righteous Apsu. Dahak is the
god of destruction, evil dragons,
and greed. After his birth, Dahak
made his way to Hell where he
roamed for ages before returning
to the Material Plane to ﬁght
against his father and siblings,
reveling in destruction and
pledging to destroy the world.

Manipulate Flames Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, transmutation); The red dragon attempts
to take control of a magical ﬁre or a ﬁre spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a
counteract check (counteract level 10, counteract modiﬁer +32), the original caster
loses control of the spell or magic ﬁre, control is transferred to the dragon, and the
dragon counts as having Sustained the Spell with this action (if applicable). The dragon
can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if it chooses.
White Dragon
The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons
are brutish, predatory, and chieﬂy motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all
other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull,
though this does not make them any less dangerous—in fact, it may mean
the opposite. It’s nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because
they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don’t care to. They are
as difﬁcult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed
at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane
jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking—and when the attack
comes, it’s bloody and relentless.
Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from
people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding
tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds.
They ﬂy out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass
near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy
niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference
for items with high utility—such as tools, trade goods, and ﬁne food—over coins
or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly
to their speciﬁcations, and they take great pride in how they’ve decorated their
homes over the years.
