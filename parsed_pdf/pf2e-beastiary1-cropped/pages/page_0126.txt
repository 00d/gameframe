Silver Dragon
Silver dragons are among the most chivalrous of all dragonkind; they wield frost
and cold as weapons, can walk on clouds, and dwell high upon snowy mountain
peaks or deep in steep, misty valleys. Although they typically make their lairs
among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far
and wide—often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars
of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread
honor, and stamp out evil.
Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much
as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that
silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek
out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins,
and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to
hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors,
APSU
Apsu, the Waybringer, is the god
of good dragons, leadership, and
peace. According to draconic lore,
Apsu spawned the dragon-gods
who created the world. One of his
sons is the destructive draconic
god Dahak. Thus, Apsu is not only
seen as a god and creator to good
dragons, but he also serves as an
immortal father ﬁgure.
