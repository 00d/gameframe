DROW EXILES
While drow society is evil, not all
drow are bound to these norms.
Those who seek something
better in life are invariably exiles
and often flee to the surface to
escape their sinister kin. These
drow often live as hermits, or
they seek out societies where
others have yet to hear the
legends regarding their kind.
