LIZARDFOLK SOCIETY
Iruxis are, as a general rule,
quite religious. Those who
venerate deities typically look to
Gozreh, but some of them ﬁnd
the teachings of Desna to be
compelling. Most iruxis, though,
instead follow druidic traditions,
ancestor worship, and astrological
philosophies in particular.
Lizardfolk Scout
Iruxi scouts are the lizardfolk most often encountered by adventurers, for
these explorers and hunters spend most of their lives on the move, constantly
patrolling the territories held by their enclave. If intruders are driven off, it is the
responsibility of the iruxi scouts to track them, observe them, and learn their ways
and weaknesses so as to report back to the community and aid in the defense
against potential reprisals.

Lizardfolk Stargazer
The tradition of astrology and looking to the stars for both
navigation and prognostication is well-established in iruxi society,
and their wise and observant stargazers are among the people’s
most respected members. Even the lowliest stargazer, as presented
here, has a number of useful primal spells to aid their kin; in larger
iruxi settlements, stargazers wield even greater powers.
