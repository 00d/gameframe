BUGBEAR LAIRS
Bugbears live in small gangs that
often prowl together, working as a
group to sow torment. They keep
their lairs in hard-to-ﬁnd places
deep in the forest or hills.
BUGBEAR TREASURE
Though bugbears don’t have much
concern for treasure, they’re prone
to keeping gruesome trophies.
Some might keep a leather cord
strung with ears from their victims,
while others collect severed ﬁngers
or noses. Bits of valuable jewelry
can sometimes remain on these
grisly prizes.
Bugbear
These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and
tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and
hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their
presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and
arouse suspicion and fear.
Bugbear Thug
The more common bugbear thug specializes in the art of lurking in the shadows.
