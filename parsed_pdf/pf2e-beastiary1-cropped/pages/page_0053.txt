Cat
Few predators of the natural world can match the cat’s talent for stalking
and stealth.
Leopard
Leopards are among the smallest of the big cats, yet they are still dangerous
creatures to tangle with. Leopard statistics can also be used for black panthers,
white-spotted snow leopards, or tawny-coated cougars.

Maul Ȱɵ The leopard makes two claw Strikes against a creature it has grabbed. Both
count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty increases only after both
attacks are made.

leopard began this action hidden, it remains hidden until after this ability’s Strike.
Sneak Attack The leopard deals 1d4 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Lion
Lions are cooperative hunters, ambushing dangerous prey in groups of lionesses
that work in tandem to trap and kill their prey. Male lions are typically larger,
with long manes, and when they hunt, they tend to do so on their own.

Tiger
Tigers are solitary and territorial
hunters, using their striped hides to
blend into the forests and jungles they
call home and preferring to attack
with surprise.
DOMESTICATING BIG CATS
While it’s common practice to keep
a house cat in the home to ward
oﬀ unwanted rodents, keeping
a big cat for a pet is a diﬀerent
matter entirely. Nevertheless,
up-and-coming merchant lords,
impetuous princes and princesses,
and status-obsessed nobles
have tried to do just that, often
resulting only in terriﬁed house
staﬀ and ruined upholstery. Many
among the idle rich will gladly pay
for the services of an unscrupulous
druid or ranger who promises to
help them achieve their dreams
of an oversized feline friend, but
the dire risks of such an endeavor
are enough to dissuade even the
greediest would-be animal trainers
from even attempting the feat.
