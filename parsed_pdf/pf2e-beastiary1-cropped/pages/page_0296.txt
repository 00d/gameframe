SERVANTS OF SHELYN
While simurghs can be found in
the service of most good-aligned
faiths, it is the teachings of Shelyn,
goddess of art, to which these
creatures are most often drawn.
A temple of Shelyn that has
managed to attract the attention
and friendship of a simurgh
typically honors the creature’s
privacy and does not boast of the
alliance, yet won’t hesitate to call
for its aid in times of need.
Simurgh
Desert-dwelling people consider the sight of a simurgh a herald to a lifetime’s
worth of luck, and those who are unfamiliar with the majestic beast might
mistake it for the avatar of a deity. Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan,
the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the
head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in
world-threatening conﬂicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who
spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil
extraplanar beings.
Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are
so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been
aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself
often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such
as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster.
Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can
hardly ﬁnd a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.
