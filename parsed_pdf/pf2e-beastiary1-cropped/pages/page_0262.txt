SERVANTS OF SARENRAE
While phoenixes are not denizens
of the Outer Planes, they have
long been associated with the
goddess Sarenrae. Indeed, many
phoenixes view the Dawnﬂower as
their patron and subscribe to her
mission of redeeming those who
have fallen to evil.
Phoenix
The phoenix is a primordial bird made of heat and ﬂame that dwells in the
most inhospitable regions of the desert. Though highly intelligent and brimming
with compassion, the phoenix is best-known for its iconic ability to resurrect
itself when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of its own corpse. Phoenixes
are often sought out for their knowledge or healing abilities, as they cannot
abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and
irredeemable of creatures.
Phoenixes enjoy the company of metallic dragons, and when the two dwell in
close proximity, they can forge lifelong friendships, sharing their resources and
words of wisdom while keeping each other updated on regional news.
While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a
phoenix loses its way or falls under the inﬂuence of evil, it still retains its strong
appetite for knowledge. Evil phoenixes are known
to assault universities and libraries in their pursuit
for power—not only to gain new information, but
also to set ﬁre to the texts and thus hoard that
knowledge for themselves.

Self-Resurrection (healing, necromancy, primal) When a phoenix
dies, it collapses into a pile of smoldering ashes before returning
to life fully healed 1d4 rounds later, as if subject to a 7th-level
resurrect ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are some
remains to resurrect; for instance, a phoenix killed by a disintegrate spell
can’t use this ability. A phoenix whose remains rest within an area devoted to
an evil deity by consecrate can’t self-resurrect until its remains are no longer in that
area. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year.
Shroud of Flame (aura, evocation, ﬁre, primal) 20 feet. 4d6 ﬁre, DC 37 basic Reﬂex

melee attack or otherwise touches it takes 2d6 ﬁre damage. The phoenix can activate
or deactivate the aura with a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
