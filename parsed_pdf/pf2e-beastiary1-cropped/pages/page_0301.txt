SKULLTAKER INSIGHT
The cooperation of a skulltaker is
a powerful asset, for this whirling
mass of death knows the collective
memories of the creatures whose
bones form its body. Because
mountain travelers come from
far and wide, the breadth of a
skulltaker’s knowledge is often
vast, spanning a range of topics.
Skulltaker
Swirling down from misty peaks and through howling mountain passes
like an evil wind, the vortex of bones known as a skulltaker is a terrible
manifestation of the delirium and agony experienced by doomed climbers and
lost trailblazers just before they met their end. In some places, a skulltaker is
also known as a saxra.

Skeletal Lore (divination, divine) A skulltaker taps into the memories of the creatures
whose bones make up its body. This gives it the Skeletal Lore skill, which it can use
to Recall Knowledge of any kind. In addition, it can speak and understand all the
languages known by the creatures whose bones make up its body (typically including
Common and the regional language of the skulltakerʼs home region). The skulltaker can
use Skeletal Lore as the primary skill check for the legend lore ritual (Core Rulebook
413), and it can cast legend lore without secondary casters.

Shard Storm (air, aura, divine, necromancy) 10 feet. A cloud of bone shards surrounds
the skulltaker. When a creature moves into the emanation or begins its
turn there, shard storm attempts to counteract any death ward effect on
the creature (+30 counteract modifier) and then deals 4d6 slashing
damage and 4d6 negative damage to the creature, with a DC 40 basic
Reflex save.

Bonetaker (divine, necromancy) Whenever a creature
dies within 60 feet of a skulltaker, the skulltaker
draws a portion of the creature’s bones into its
shard storm. The creature must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or rise as a
skeletal champion (page 298) in 1d4 rounds. These skeletal champions
are controlled by the skulltaker.
Energy Drain (divine, necromancy) When a skulltaker hits with a melee
Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or become
drained 2 and doomed 1.
Splintered Ground Ȱɵ The skulltaker causes splintered bones to erupt from all
solid surfaces in a 100-foot emanation, except for surfaces of worked stone.
A creature moving through the bones takes 10 piercing damage and 10 negative
damage for every 5 feet of movement. The ﬁrst time each round a creature takes piercing
damage from these splintered bones, it must succeed at a Reﬂex save or take a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all Speeds for 10 minutes, or a –15-foot circumstance penalty for
24 hours on a critical failure. The bones remain in place until the skulltaker uses this action
again or the bones are manually removed, which takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square.
