GIANT LOCATIONS
As oversized as they are, giants
tend to dwell in remote regions of
the world, where they have the
luxury of claiming
larger territories of
their own.

lands on the ground, it takes bludgeoning damage as though it had fallen the distance

Throw Rock Ȱɵ
Frost Giant
Frost giants are remorseless marauders who
pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near
them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely
territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend
it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in
search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are
ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and
prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim
themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from
their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to
be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the
current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which
the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the
victorious challenger assumes control.
Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their
appearance is reﬂective of a people weathered and hardened by
relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear
metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain
beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their ﬂesh ranges
from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or
dirty yellow color.
A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs
approximately 2,800 pounds.
