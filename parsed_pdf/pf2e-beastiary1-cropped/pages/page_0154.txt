MONSTROUS ELEMENTALS
Some elementals are more than
living incarnations of air, earth,
ﬁre, or water. Creatures like the
genie (pages 162–165), the uthul
(page 317), or the zaramuun (page
339) have their own complex
ecologies and societies. While
these creatures originally hail
from an Elemental Plane, they can
often be found on the Material
Plane as well.
