ELEPHANT RESOURCES
Elephant tusks are a highly sought-
after treasure, the ivory from a
single tusk potentially fetching
hundreds of gold coins. Those
who value the elephant’s majestic
presence are impassioned defenders
of the creatures, making the
hunt for ivory dangerous.
Elephant
Immediately recognizable by their long, prehensile trunks and impressive tusks,
elephants have different characteristics depending on where they are found.
Elephants are used as beasts of burden in many regions, but they are extremely
clever and must be handled with great care.
Elephant
Those who live near elephants have learned to be wary of angering the beasts,
but even with precautions in place, elephants sometimes still rampage. There
is little an individual person can do when even a single elephant becomes
enraged. Furthermore, a herd of angry or frightened elephants can easily
destroy an entire village.
