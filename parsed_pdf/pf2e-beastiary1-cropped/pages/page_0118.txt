Brass Dragon
Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They
particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids,
delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them
haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage
in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics
so they can anticipate future conﬂicts. Along the way, they create extensive
information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all
levels of humanoid society—networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly
assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue
dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice
and equality.
These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all
creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don’t harm
others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short
attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their
twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets
and houseplants that they can care for.
Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity
concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon’s prowess in
battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose
territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe
indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and
unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.
Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and
while they keep their lairs hidden, they often
build near humanoid settlements.
