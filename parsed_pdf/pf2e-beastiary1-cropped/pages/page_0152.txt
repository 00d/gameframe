OTHER MEPHITS
The four mephits presented here
are but the most common of
their kind. Others that rise from
the mixing of elemental energies
exist as well: creatures like dust
mephits (who breathe out a
scouring cloud of grit), ice mephits
(who spit out sickening gusts of
frozen air), magma mephits (which
can assume the form of a pool of
lava), ooze mephits (which spit out
foul-smelling acid), salt mephits
(who can draw moisture out of the
environs and nearby creatures),
and steam mephits (which can call
down tiny squalls of boiling rain).

Water Mephit
Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor
for a good laugh. Just as ﬁre mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil
without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest
of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care
in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can
reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay
for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like ﬁsh
scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed ﬁns than limbs
capable of ﬂight, they can ﬂap their wings to ﬂy through the air as easily as any
other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the
water only when they must.
