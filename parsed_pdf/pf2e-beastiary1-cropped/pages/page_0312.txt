TEROTRICUS MYTHS
The Kellids of Sarkoris dealt with
their fair share of terotricuses
during the era of the Worldwound,
and these people developed
unique rituals to purify tainted
grounds with the help of ancestral
spirits and feathers acquired from
celestials. Far south of there, in
what is now known as the Sodden
Lands, wastelanders who learn of
the presence of a terotricus—or
“swampblight,” as they’re called
there­—carry lanterns blessed by
angels in the hopes that these
lights will keep the terotricus
at bay.
Terotricus
The legendary terotricus is a massive slime-mold that hails from the Abyss.
Its collective consciousness encapsulates entire regions, spreading as far as its
ever-growing cloud of spores will take it. Once it has seeped onto the Material
Plane from the Abyssal realm, a terotricus’s agenda is to feed on all living
creatures, infecting them with its spores, and its presence can spell doom for
any in its way.
Terotricuses move by rapidly expanding and contracting their slimy “bodies,”
which are capable of burrowing through soil, gliding across water, and
scrabbling up steep slopes. These behemoths of rot don’t need to travel to see
their plans come to fruition, though; their spores easily latch onto demons and
other denizens of the Abyss, who in turn bring this blight to the Material Plane
when the ﬁends are summoned.
When a terotricus infects a creature with its spores, web-like fungal growths
start appearing on the victim’s skin until they cover the entire body, at which
point the victim’s mind is also subdued and bent to the terotricus’s will. The
terotricus’s favored victims include animals, elves, and fey, though it is happy to
infect any creature it can catch. Cults of Treerazer occasionally attempt to make
contact with a terotricus, but such acts almost always simply result in a new sect
of spore-blighted slaves.
