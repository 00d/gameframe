WENDIGO WORSHIP
Some humanoids who dwell in
arctic regions oﬀer tribute to
wendigos that hunt near their
villages, treating them as gods
or spirits of nature that must
be appeased. They occasionally
perform rites of cannibalism and
place fetishes throughout the
wilderness to mark the
wendigo’s domain.
Wendigo
Wendigos are incarnations of the fears of starvation, loneliness, and fatal exposure
to cold weather. They haunt the frozen expanses of the world.

Dream Haunting A target that fails its save against the
wendigo’s nightmare is exposed to wendigo torment.
Howl
̂ˬ
(auditory,
concentrate,
enchantment,
fear,
incapacitation, mental, primal); Frequency Three times per day;
Eﬀect The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up
to 1 mile away. Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC
38 Will save or be frightened 1. Any creature that critically fails and is
within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead frightened 3, and is also ﬂeeing
for 1d4 rounds (or until it’s no longer frightened, whichever comes ﬁrst). A
creature frightened by a wendigo’s howl still naturally recovers from its fright
but can’t reduce it below frightened 1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is
used. Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to
that wendigo’s Howl for 24 hours.
Ride the Wind Ǻȓ (air, concentrate, primal, transmutation); Trigger The wendigo
casts wind walk while it has Grabbed a foe. Eﬀect The wendigo attempts
to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it along as part of the
action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will save, it prevents itself
from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms,
automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride
the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo
torment. The target can attempt a new Will save each
round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes
corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds.
Wendigo Torment (curse, enchantment, mental,
primal) A creature aﬀected by wendigo
torment can’t recover beyond stage 1 until it
has been restored to full HP. Saving Throw
Will DC 38; Stage 1 Stupeﬁed 4 (1 day); Stage 2
As stage 1 (1 day); Stage 3 The creature searches
for an individual of its own ancestry to kill and devour.
It then becomes aﬀected by wind walk and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn
away into jagged stumps. As the creature wind walks into the sky, it is replaced by a
new wendigo over 2d6 minutes. Wish, similar magic, or a 9th-level resurrect ritual can
return the victim to life. The new wendigo remains even if the victim is resurrected.
