LINNORM KINGS
In the storied Lands of the
Linnorm Kings, the slaying of a
linnorm is traditionally required for
those who would claim a nation’s
crown. Recently, though, the
Linnorm King White Estrid claimed
her crown not by slaying a linnorm
but by beating it into submission,
gaining a powerful and dangerous
ally to help secure her rule.
Linnorm
Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate
those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inﬂict as much suffering as possible
upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be
the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible
strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
Crag Linnorm
Despite being among the weakest linnorms, the crag linnorm is a devastating
predator, capable of quickly cooking its foes with its magma breath.

Primal Innate Spells DC 33; Constant (6th) freedom of movement; (5th) true seeing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, ﬁre, primal) The crag linnorm breathes out a stream
of magma in a 120-foot line that deals 12d6 ﬁre damage to creatures within
the area (DC 34 basic Reﬂex save). Any creature that fails its
save also takes 4d6 persistent ﬁre damage. The crag linnorm
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds. The magma
remains until the start of the linnorm's next turn. If the
linnorm was on the ground, the magma remains as a
burning line on the ground directly under the line of
the Breath Weapon, and if the linnorm was airborne,
the magma rains downward in a sheet 60 feet high.
Any creature that moves across or through the
magma takes 6d6 ﬁre damage (DC 34 basic Reﬂex
save). At the start of the linnorm's next turn,
the magma cools to a thin layer of brittle
stone on the ground, or the magma rain
ﬁnishes falling and turns to harmless
pebbles. The cooled magma quickly
degrades to powder and sand over the
course of several hours.
