PRIMAL ELEMENTALS
The most well known of all
elementals are the primal
elementals, creatures composed
entirely of air, earth, ﬁre, or water
with roughly humanoid shapes.
Many primal elementals are
named after natural disasters,
ranging from those relatively
small in scale (and roughly the
size of Medium humanoids) to
much larger ones (often the
size of small buildings). Primal
elementals can often be found
in areas where their namesake
disasters have recently struck.
Naturally Invisible The invisible stalker is invisible at all times, though when it takes
a hostile action of any kind, it is hidden instead of undetected until the start of its
next turn, as the vague outline of its humanoid form is faintly visible for a short
period of time.
