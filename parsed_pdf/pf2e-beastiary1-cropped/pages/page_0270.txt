DEFENDING CHAOS
Where proteans go, chaos follows.
To proteans, there is no purer form
of existence than entropy, and
they constantly seek to oppose
the establishment of order in the
Great Beyond. However, proteans
don’t see life as being incompatible
with chaos; rather, they simply
believe beings—immortal or
not—deserve complete
freedom on their
own terms.

Keketars are immune to this eﬀect.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine,
polymorph,
transmutation)
The
keketar can take the appearance
of any Huge or smaller creature.
This doesn’t change its Speed or its
attack and damage bonuses with
its Strikes, but might change the
damage type its Strikes deal.
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d10+15 bludgeoning, DC 42
Reshape Reality (concentrate, divine, polymorph,
transmutation)
When
the
keketar
casts
hallucinatory terrain, it infuses the illusion
with quasi-real substance. Creatures that do
not disbelieve the illusion treat structures and
terrain created through the spell as though
they were real, ascending illusory stairs,
becoming trapped by illusory quicksand, and
so on.
Warpwave Strike (divine, polymorph, transmutation)
A creature struck by a keketar’s jaws or claw Strike must
succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be subject to a warpwave
(page 266).
