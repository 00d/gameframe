OTHER NAGAS
Beyond the sinister dark naga
and the benevolent guardian
naga, many other types of nagas
exist, including the mesmerizing
spirit naga, the multiheaded royal
naga, and the introspective and
mysterious lunar naga.

Guardian Naga
The opposite of dark nagas in many ways, guardian nagas are benevolent and
wise protectors of places of great natural or supernatural signiﬁcance: ancient
oak groves, forgotten holy temples, and vaults of sacred power are just a few
examples of locations that these nagas protect. Guardian nagas believe that the
beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to
such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with
similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors
and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.
Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood,
to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to
protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place,
passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent
nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become
the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the
site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.
It is difﬁcult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of
evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately
for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see
encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and
expand worldviews.
