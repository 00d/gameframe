OTHER DEVILS
The devils presented on these
pages are a small sampling of the
torments Hell has to oﬀer. Other
devils, like the inquisition-focused
bone devils, the cherub-faced and
ﬂy-bodied accuser devils, and the
aquatic drowning devil are a few
examples of these widespread
immortal creatures.
Commander’s Aura (aura, divine, enchantment) 100 feet. Commanded or allied evil
creatures in the aura of lower level than the pit ﬁend gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, saves, and skill checks.
Frightful Presence (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) 20 feet, DC 42
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ The pit ﬁend can make an Attack of Opportunity when a
creature within reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to the usual trigger. The
devil can disrupt triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit,
not only a critical hit.

Melee Ȱɵ jaws +40 (evil, magical, poison, reach 10 feet), Damage 4d10+17 piercing plus

Devil Shaping (divine, downtime, transmutation) The pit
ﬁend reshapes a large number of lemures within a
600-foot radius into more powerful devils to swell
Hell’s legions. The pit ﬁend must have available
the number of lemures listed on the table in the
sidebar on page 92. The pit ﬁend can shape 100
lemures per day, to a maximum of 1,100 lemures
in 11 days. Devils created in this way are in
thrall to the pit ﬁend and follow its orders,
with the exception of created pit ﬁends or
other devils of similar power, which are
always independent. As a result, few pit
ﬁends choose to create peers. At the
end of the Devil Shaping activity, the
pit ﬁend attempts an incredibly hard
Religion check of the desired devilʼs level,
with results as follows.
Critical Success The pit ﬁend shapes
two devils from the massed lemures
instead of one.
Success The pit ﬁend shapes a devil of the
desired type and level.
Failure The devil shaped from the lemures is
2 levels lower than the intended devil.
Critical Failure The pit fiend fails to shape
any devils and draws the ire of an archdevil
for its waste of resources.
Fast Swoop Ȱɵ The pit ﬁend Flies and makes a wing
Strike at any point during its movement.
Masterful Quickened Casting Ȳ˓ (concentrate); Frequency once per round.
Eﬀect If the pit ﬁendʼs next action is to cast an 8th-level or lower innate
spell, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
Pit Fiend Venom (poison); Saving Throw DC 43 Fortitude; Maximum
Duration 10 rounds; Stage 1 6d6 poison damage and drained 1 (1
round); Stage 2 7d6 poison damage and drained 2 (1 round); Stage 3 8d6
poison damage and drained 3 (1 round)
