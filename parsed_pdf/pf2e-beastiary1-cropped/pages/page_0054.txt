CAT LOCATIONS
Leopards are exceptionally
adaptable, able to survive in any
grassland, forest, or jungle, and
even the fringes of deserts.
Lions live in grassy plains
and savannas, although species
adapted for temperate environs
that dwell in mountains exist as
well. Male mountain lions lack
the mane of their somewhat
larger grassland-dwelling kin,
but are no less dangerous.
While tigers are most common
in forests, they also inhabit
grasslands and savannas as long
as vegetation is dense, and their
dens are often found in caves.
Smilodons live in wooded
and grassland areas.
