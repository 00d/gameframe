NYMPH TREASURES
Nymphs sometimes carry magical
trinkets or wear enchanted clothing
or jewelry, but the greatest treasure
a nymph queen can share is often her
inspiration to those seeking a muse.
Primal Innate Spells DC 28; 4th tidal surge (at will; Core Rulebook 397); 1st charm,
create water
Change Shape Ȱɵ (polymorph, primal, transmutation)
Focus Beauty Ȱɵ (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) On a failed
save, if the target was already aﬀected by the naiad queen’s beauty, the image of the
queen sears into the creature’s mind, allowing no further sight and eﬀectively blinding
the creature until restored via restore senses or a similar eﬀect, or until the naiad queen
chooses to remove the eﬀect using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
Inspiration ̂ˬ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal)
Water Healing ʚʖ (concentrate, healing, necromancy, primal) As naiad, but the naiad
queen can heal in any body of water in her domain and regains 28 HP.
Dryad Queen (Hamadryad)
Hamadryads rule over an entire forest, or a portion of an incredibly large
forest, leading and protecting all dryads within. Hamadryads often have
strange relationships with powerful and deadly fey, working together
in a dualistic way despite their differences, with the
hamadryad representing nature’s wonders and the other
fey representing nature’s wrath.
