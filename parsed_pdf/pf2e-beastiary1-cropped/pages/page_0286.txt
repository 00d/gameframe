Scorpion
Chitinous scourges of deserts, forests, savannas, and badlands, scorpions are
deadly arachnids with powerful pincers and a painful sting. Scorpions can be
found in nearly every climate, where they hunt their prey with a mixture of
patient stealth and raw strength. Most scorpions live in underground burrows,
either as lone hunters or part of a larger colony. These arachnids are so feared and
dangerous that in many cultures, they are treated as deities or dualistic symbols
of both death and protection from said death.
Giant Scorpion
These massive, terrifying arachnids are typically 8 feet long from head to the
base of the tail. Giant scorpions are the favored pack animals and war beasts of
various desert-dwelling monsters, particularly gnolls. They are most commonly
encountered in the wild, however. There they lair in mountainside caves or
burrow beneath shallow layers of sand where they lie in wait for prey to wander
near. Sleek, pallid subterranean scorpions also exist, as do still larger species.

Scorpion Swarm
While a single scorpion is itself a menace, swarms of these vermin can be outright
devastating. These skittering droves of death swiftly bring down their prey before
devouring everything short of the victim’s bones.

SCORPION VENOM
While scorpions are often
symbols of death or evil, their
venom can be extracted and used
for a wide variety of medical
applications. A character can
milk an incapacitated giant
scorpion to extract raw scorpion
venom, which can be used as raw
materials to craft giant scorpion
venom or lesser antiplague. To
determine the value of ingredients
you gain each day and the DC of
the appropriate Medicine or Lore
check, use the level 3 task entry
in Table 4–2: Income Earned (Core
Rulebook 237).
