Not all astradaemons limit their hunt to souls. The most notorious of their kind
serve the Horsemen themselves as assassins.

Soul Siphon (aura, divine, force, necromancy) 30 feet. An astradaemon draws power
from the souls of the recently slain. If a Small or larger living creature dies within its
aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon’s
Devour Soul ability. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the
body take 1d8 force damage each round within the daemon’s aura from
the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.
Displacement (divine, illusion, visual) An astradaemon bends light, appearing
shifted from its true position, though still in the same space. Creatures
targeting the astradaemon must attempt a DC 11 ﬂat check, as if the
astradaemon were hidden, even though it remains observed. Eﬀects such as the
Blind-Fight feat and halﬂing’s keen eyes that apply on the ﬂat check against
hidden creatures also apply against a displaced astradaemon.

(divine,
incapacitation,
necromancy) Requirements The astradaemon
hasn’t used an action with the attack trait yet
this turn. Eﬀect The astradaemon draws out
and consumes the soul of a living creature it
has grabbed. The creature must succeed at
a DC 35 Fortitude save or instantly die. If it
dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary
Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 minute, or for 1
day if the victim was 15th level or higher.
A victim slain in this way can be returned
to life normally. A creature that survives is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Essence Drain (divine, necromancy, negative) When an
astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target’s spiritual and
vital essences. The target takes 2d10 negative energy damage and the astradaemon
regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a DC
37 Fortitude save or become doomed 1 and drained 1. If
the target was already drained or doomed, it instead
increases both conditions’ value by 1, to a maximum
of 4.
OTHER DAEMONS
As many daemons exist as there
are awful ways to die. The bloody
sangudaemon personiﬁes death
by blood loss, while the skeletal
thanadaemon represents death
from old age. The most powerful
daemons are the olethrodaemons,
who represent the massive deaths
caused by apocalypses and the end
of entire worlds.
