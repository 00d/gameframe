ELEMENTAL BEINGS
The Elemental Planes—primordial
realms deﬁned by aspects of air,
earth, ﬁre, or water—are home to
a diverse group of beings known
as elementals. Spellcasters on
the Material Plane call upon
elementals for aid, though these
enigmatic creatures can also
travel to the world of mortals via
interplanar gateways and rifts.
The elementals on these pages
exemplify the creatures of the
Elemental Planes, but this list is by
no means exhaustive.
