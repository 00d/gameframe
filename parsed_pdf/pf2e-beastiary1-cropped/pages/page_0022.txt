Appendix
regarding statues suddenly animating and attacking has led many less scrupulous
adventurers to automatically attack any statues they encounter, ruining harmless,
ancient relics.

Giant Animated Statue
As with any humanoid animated statues of Medium size, giant animated statues
are used to guard locations of importance, but their increased size and power
make them most useful in large vaults, spacious chambers, or outdoor locations.
Animated objects of this strength and size are ideal for tasks and responsibilities
usually performed by golems, and more powerful animated objects are thus all
but unheard of.

Ranged Ȱɵ ﬂaming coal +12 (ﬁre, magical, range increment 80 feet), Damage 2d6+6
bludgeoning and 2d8 ﬁre
Brazier The statue carries a wide brazier full of hot coals. To make ﬂaming coal Strikes
or use Burn Alive, the statue must have the brazier held in one hand or otherwise
have it within reach. Instead of targeting the statue with an attack, a creature can
target the brazier directly. The brazier has the same AC and saves as the statue.
Dealing 15 cold damage to the brazier
or dousing it with at least 2 gallons of
water extinguishes the coals. This
prevents the statue from using
Burn Alive and causes its
ranged attacks to no longer
deal 2d8 ﬁre damage.
Burn Alive Ȱɵ
(ﬁre)
The
statue grinds a creature it
has grabbed into the red-
hot coals of its brazier.
The target takes 3d8 ﬁre
damage and 1d8 persistent
ﬁre damage.
GUARDED TREASURES
Animated objects are mindless
constructs. While this leaves
them no concept of the value
of treasure, they are often
used as guardians for vaults or
repositories of valuables. In these
cases, the treasures they guard
can vary wildly, but should be of a
value appropriate for the animated
object’s level.
