Copper Dragon
Capricious and always eager to share a good laugh, copper dragons are among the
wiliest of the metallic dragons, but this by no means interferes with their mission to
spread freedom in oppressive lands. Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to
indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to
pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives
as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are
susceptible to negative inﬂuences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts
performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also
have a difﬁcult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.
Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to
their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes
live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby.
Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped
only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of
Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of
freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical
copper dragon mindset.
A copper dragon’s combat tactics are
as unorthodox as its sense of humor,
as it is more likely to use mockery and
tricks than outright strength to win
its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it
perfects jokes capable of rendering its
foes helpless with laughter.
