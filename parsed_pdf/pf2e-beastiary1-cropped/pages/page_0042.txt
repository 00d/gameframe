BEETLE TREASURES
Beetles do not collect treasure,
but the two light-producing
organs of a ﬂash beetle can be
recovered from the creature
and used for illumination-based
chemical recipes, spell
components, and magic
item creation.
BEETLE SPECIES
Numerous other species of giant
beetle exist in the wilds. Duergars
train deep-dwelling beetles as
mounts and guardians. Bombardier
beetles can spew caustic acid as
a potent attack. And the truly
immense goliath beetles can
devastate entire buildings or even
castles with frightening ease.
Beetle
Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot.
Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate
and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when
threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles
and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant.
Flash Beetle
These 3-foot-long insects boast a pair of glowing organs on the back of the
abdomen that give off bright light and that continue to glow for days, even after
the creature’s death. Flash beetles are commonly herded and harvested by miners
and spelunkers, as their glow is considered safer than torches and less expensive
than lamps. Denizens of the Darklands often domesticate and train these insects,
using them as pets, livestock, or caging them to use as organic sources of light in
areas frequented by visitors unaccustomed to the darkness.

Light Flash Ȱɵ (concentrate, light) The ﬂash beetle creates a brilliant ﬂash of
light. All creatures in its luminescent aura must succeed at a DC 17
Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. The ﬂash beetle’s glow
then goes out, disabling its aura for 24 hours, during which
time it cannot use Light Flash.
Giant Stag Beetle
The giant stag beetle is larger than a horse, and the sight of
one ﬂying (if slowly and somewhat clumsily) on great buzzing
wings is unnerving. Its enormous mandibles are used to impress
mates, intimidate rivals, and discourage predators, for they can
deliver deadly blows. While giant stag beetles are deadly predators,
they can be domesticated by skilled wranglers. In such a capacity, these
beetles serve well as beasts of burden or even as mounts.
Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes,
and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster
of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding
all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects.
