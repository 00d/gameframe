Bear
Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands
and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below,
such as the smaller (but no less dangerous) black bear or the arctic-dwelling
polar bear.
Grizzly Bear
This large and powerful omnivore inhabits forested hills. While it typically
sustains itself on nuts, berries, ﬁsh, and small mammals, it’s ﬁercely territorial
and will chase off or kill any creature it views as competition. Grizzly bears are
especially temperamental when their young are nearby. In combat, a grizzly bear
often attempts to grab and maul its foe with surprising ferocity. It continues its
assault until its foe seems like it is no longer a threat, though if the bear is hungry,
it will not hesitate to feed.

Cave Bear
Larger, stronger, and far more aggressive than its smaller cousins, the cave
bear is a behemoth that avoids civilized lands, preferring to dwell in
remote places. As its name might suggest, the cave bear makes its den in
natural caves, and like the grizzly bear, a cave bear is ﬁercely territorial.
Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will
make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its
prey’s soft ﬂesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often
regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remote-dwelling people,
while they are utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants—stone
giants in particular have an afﬁnity for keeping trained cave bears as
pets or guardians for their homes.

BEAR RESOURCES
A bear den can contain valuable
treasures, such as the remains of
less fortunate adventurers who
stumbled into a hungry bear’s
path. Bear furs themselves are
valued as rugs, while their claws
and fangs make for impressive
jewelry or adornments for armor.
Bear hide is an excellent resource
for hide armor.
