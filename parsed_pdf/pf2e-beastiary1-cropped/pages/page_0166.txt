SHAITAN PASHAS
Shaitan pashas fulﬁll wishes as
eﬃciently as possible. A wish
granted might create a temporary
reality—a wish for a pet dragon
might ﬁnd the dragon lasts only
a day before it vanishes or dies.
Shaitan pashas add the following
to their innate spells: 8th
earthquake; 6th ﬂesh to stone,
stoneskin (at will; self only).
Elemental Planes, or Material Plane only) 5th illusory object; 4th gaseous form,
invisibility (×2); Cantrips (5th) produce ﬂame; Constant (5th) detect magic
Burning Grasp (ﬁre) When the efreeti grabs a creature, that creature takes 2d6 ﬁre
damage, and takes 2d6 ﬁre damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it
remains grabbed.
Change Size ʚʖ (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation); as janni (DC 29).
Combat Grab Ȱɵ Requirements The efreeti has one hand free. Eﬀect The efreeti makes
a melee Strike while keeping one hand free. If the Strike hits, the target is grabbed in
the efreeti’s free hand.
Marid
Marids are capricious but powerful genies from the Plane of Water; among
geniekind, they are rivaled in power only by the ﬁery efreet. Marids embody
the strength of the ocean’s waves and currents, but they also have a gentler side,
loving performance and art such as dancing, music, and storytelling.
Marids regard efreet with hostility but rarely encounter them in their native
environment. They get along with djinn, jann, and shaitans, although the
latter consider marids ﬂighty and annoying, associating only long enough to
close trade deals. Marid society has strict rules of hospitality, and many marid
cities have a magically sealed foreign quarter where marid shahzadas conduct
business with air-breathers.
