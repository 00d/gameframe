SEA SERPENT LAIRS
While an underwater cave will do,
sea serpents prefer to “build” lairs
by sinking ships. A sea serpent
might even create a massive
underwater graveyard by crashing
several ships in the same location
and letting the debris stack up on
the ocean ﬂoor.
Sea Serpent
These fabled beasts resemble massive snakes with long rows of ﬁnned spines down
their back. Temperamental and territorial, sea serpents can capsize a boat with ease,
and most won’t hesitate to do so when hungry or threatened. Stories abound of
aggrieved captains who spend their entire lives hunting down the elusive monster
that sunk their ships and took their livelihoods. These hunts rely on rumors and
glimpses of the beasts, as few survive the catastrophes wrought by sea serpents.
While many ﬁshermen’s tales paint sea serpents as divinely appointed
guardians of the ocean or, alternately, as evil and demonic agents, the truth is
that most sea serpents are simply very large beasts with a knack for avoiding
magical detection.
