DUERGAR COMMUNITIES
Duergar communities are found
deep underground in the ruins
of abandoned dwarven cities.
Generations of duergar occupation
have resulted in the loss of
dwarven history as the ashen
honor their taskmaster deity by
reworking traditional dwarven art
into topics that elevate the exiled
god. That duergars themselves
seem incapable of achieving
the heights of artistry mastered
by their dwarven ancestors is
both a source of frustration and
shame that only fosters greater
resentment of those who dwell on
the surface.

Duergar Taskmaster
Duergar priests of the taskmaster god Droskar often assume leadership roles
within their communities, advancing the goals of their deity through coercion
and displays of force. Often referred to as duergar taskmasters, these leaders
often issue commands to duergar subordinates and slaves in the same
breath, treating the two almost as if they were interchangeable. As a
result, duergar taskmasters are loathed by both slave and slaver alike.
