CALIGNI TREASURE
Many calignis hide shiny
baubles and trinkets beneath
their dark rags, keeping them
out of sight of their greedy kin.
They also keep several doses of
black smear poison on hand to
incapacitate foes.
Caligni
Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make
mischief. Each caligni serves in a speciﬁc role and grows into a speciﬁc form as
determined by supernatural traditions and inﬂuences in caligni society. Regardless
of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale ﬂesh and white eyes. Some
surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t
reﬂect either their appearance or character, only their environment.
Caligni Dancer
Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.
