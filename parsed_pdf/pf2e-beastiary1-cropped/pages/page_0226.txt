DEATH CURSES
The death curses of the linnorms
are often the subjects of tragic
sagas, and those who would think
themselves vanquishing heroes
for slaying a linnorm often meet
their dooms soon thereafter,
succumbing to these curses well
after the death of the linnorm
responsible for bestowing it.
Ice Linnorm
The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks,
or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (cold, evocation, primal) The ice linnorm
spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot
cone that deals 15d6 cold damage to creatures within the
area (DC 38 basic Reﬂex save). The freezing ooze clings
to those struck and hardens into thick sheets of ice. A
creature that fails the saving throw is immobilized by
the ice until it succeeds at a check to Escape or it or
an ally Forces Open the ice (DC 34 for either case). At
the start of its turn, a creature still immobilized by the
ice takes 4d6 cold damage. Another creature can free a
frozen target by dealing a total of 20 ﬁre damage to the
frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in
1 minute on its own. Creatures with the ﬁre trait can't be
frozen in place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures fall if
frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward
the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per round. An
ice linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
