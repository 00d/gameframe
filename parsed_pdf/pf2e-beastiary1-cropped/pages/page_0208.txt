LIVING WITH HOBGOBLINS
With few exceptions, the only
non-goblinoids in a hobgoblin
settlement or army are slaves
(or at least regarded as such).
Hobgoblins occasionally make use
of bugbears as assassins or spies,
and most hobgoblin tribes include
a small group of goblins who eke
out a meager existence on the
fringes of hobgoblin society.
Hobgoblin Archer
Bands of hobgoblin soldiers typically have at least one archer among their ranks.
In smaller groups, the hobgoblin archer also serves as that band’s captain.

Hobgoblin General
Hobgoblin generals serve as leaders of entire armies and rulers of hobgoblin
settlements. A general does not permit the luxuries of rule to soften them. They
lead their forces on the ﬁeld of battle and view this opportunity to excel in a
ﬁght at the head of an army as the true reward for a life spent honing one’s skills
in battle.
