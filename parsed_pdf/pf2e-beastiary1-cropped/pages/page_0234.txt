SACRED INSECTS
Deadly mantises are sacrosanct to
followers of Achaekek, the Mantis
God. His adherents, including the
infamous Red Mantis assassins,
invite or lure deadly mantises close
to their settlements, seeing the
towering creatures as a sign of their
god’s favor. Achaekek’s followers
oﬀer sacriﬁces of livestock or
captured enemies to keep the
massive insects well fed. Clerics of
Achaekek defend a deadly mantis’s
territory as if it were their own,
believing it to be holy ground.
Mantis, Giant
These monstrously oversized insects are silent predators with lightning-quick
forelegs and a bone-breaking bite.
Giant Mantis
These massive cousins of normal praying mantises stand taller than an average
human. They stalk through dense forests, striking at meals from the trees.
