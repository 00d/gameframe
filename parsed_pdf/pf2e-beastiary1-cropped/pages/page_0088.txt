ARCHDEVILS
At any one time, eight archdevils
rule the eight upper layers of Hell,
while the deepest layer is ruled
by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a
unique demigod with a dedicated
role in guiding the infernal machine
forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden
of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while
Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.
Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries,
and Belial designs new weapons
for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the
oldest archdevil and keeper of many
secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs
armies. Baalzebul is a brooding
archdevil who has fallen from
Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty
Mephistopheles was formed from
the plane of Hell itself.
Imp
Imps are inﬁltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are
more than capable of subtly inﬂuencing a weak-willed individual into performing
increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and
act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to
Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and
thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to
pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious
combatants, ﬂying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds
turn against them.
