OTHER DEMONS
The Abyss may be the largest of
the Outer Planes, and mortals
have an equally large capacity to
betray themselves, society, and the
natural order of reality. With this
limitless source for increasingly
specialized sins, the Abyss is
constantly generating new types of
demons to plague reality. While the
vast majority of these are swiftly
destroyed and never rise again,
enough survive that dozens, if
not hundreds, of types of demons
are known to exist beyond those
listed here. The shadowy invidiak
is a demon without a body, born
of envious souls. The goat-faced,
ﬂame-hooved brimorak rises
from the souls of arsonists. Slimy,
horned blood demons spawn from
assassins, boar demons from the
greedy... the list goes on and on.
demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in
power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further
develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the
role of a true demon lord.

Aura of Flame (aura, divine, evocation, ﬁre) 20 feet. A foe that starts its turn in the
aura takes 3d6+10 ﬁre damage, or 6d6+20 ﬁre damage if the balor has grabbed or
restrained it. A creature that hits a balor with an unarmed Strike takes 3d6+10 ﬁre
damage, and weapons that hit a balor take 3d6+10 ﬁre damage.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ The balor can use Attack of Opportunity when a creature within
their reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. They can disrupt
triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.
Death Throes (death, divine, evocation, ﬁre) When a balor dies, their body explodes in
a 100-foot aura of intense demonic ﬂame. All creatures and objects in range take
16d10 ﬁre damage (DC 45 basic Reﬂex save). Because the ﬂame is infused with
Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual ﬁre resistance.
Creatures with immunity to ﬁre use an outcome one degree of success better than
what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual beneﬁt of immunity. The bodies of
creatures reduced to 0 Hit Points by a balor’s death throes are completely incinerated
into ﬁne ash.

Dispelling Strike Ȳ˓ Frequency once per round. Trigger The balor hits a creature, object,
or spell eﬀect with a weapon Strike. Eﬀect The balor casts an innate dispel magic on
the target of the triggering Strike.
Infuse Weapons (divine, evocation) Any weapon a balor wields becomes a +3 major
striking vorpal weapon made of cold iron and silver while the demon holds it. A
weapon that isn’t eligible for the vorpal rune doesn’t gain its eﬀects. The balor can
change its evil damage to chaotic whenever it attacks. The demon can conjure a whip
made of ﬂames with an Interact action. This whip gains the same beneﬁts as other
weapons the balor wields.
Lifedrinker Ȳ˓ (divine, healing, necromancy) Trigger The balor kills a living creature that
is at least 15th level. Eﬀect The balor drinks the triggering creature’s life force and
regains 10d8+80 Hit Points.
Whip Reposition When a balor grabs a creature with a whip Strike, they can move the
creature to any space in the whip’s reach. The balor can move without ending the grab
as long as the creature remains within the whip’s reach, and the balor can move the
creature to any other space in the whip’s reach with an Interact action.
