OGRE HOOKS
Ogres are known for using
immense, curved picks called ogre
hooks. These uncommon weapons
cost 1 gp, deal 1d10 piercing
damage, have 2 Bulk, and require
two hands to use. Ogre hooks are
in the pick weapon group. Ogre
hooks have the deadly 1d10 and
trip weapon traits.
manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent
“games” that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow
manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate
the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to
afford a last-ditch escape from doom.

Ogre Boss
In ogre society, might makes more than right—it makes the rules. The
strongest or most violent ogre in a family (in most cases, this is the same
ogre) is invariably that family’s boss. Quick to hook fallen foes on their
weapons, even other ogres fear the repercussions of displeasing an ogre
boss. When an ogre boss barks out commands, the other members of the
family move quickly to obey.
