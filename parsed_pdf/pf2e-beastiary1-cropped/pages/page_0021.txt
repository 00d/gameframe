Animated Object
Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic,
animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples
of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as
guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack.
Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants
created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
Animated Broom
Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can
step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated
objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and
costly objects.

Construct Armor Like normal objects, an animated broom has Hardness. This Hardness
reduces any damage it takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated
broom is reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged
by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks and its Armor Class is reduced to 14.
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ bristles +6 (agile, magical, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d4 bludgeoning plus dust
Dust A creature hit by an animated broom’s bristles must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude
save or spend its next action coughing. Even if hit by multiple dust attacks, the
creature has to spend only 1 action coughing to clear the dust out. A creature that
doesn’t breathe is immune to this eﬀect.
Animated Armor
Suits of animated armor see use both as guardians and as training partners in
high-end martial academies able to afford the extravagance. They are most often
found in wizard laboratories and ancient dungeons.

Animated Statue
Animated statues are often used to guard crypts, small shrines, or areas in
government buildings where they can be positioned amid normal statues to
hide their true nature until an intruder arouses their ire. Adventurers’ suspicions
ANIMATING OBJECTS
Most animated objects
encountered by adventurers are
permanently animated creatures,
either created by rituals or given
life by infusions of positive energy.
Restless spirits, certain ghosts, and
other haunting undead inﬂuences
can also give rise to animated
objects, although in cases like
the poltergeist (page 264), what
appears to be an animated object
may merely be an evil force using
its magic to hurl furnishings about
as weapons.
