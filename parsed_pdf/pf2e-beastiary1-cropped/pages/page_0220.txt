DEAD LESHYS
When a leshy dies, its body
explodes in a wave of vegetation
as its spirit returns to the natural
world. Though leshy spirits that
are called into new bodies after
death typically keep only vague
recollections of their pasts, they
retain many of the values and
habits of their former life.
Languages Common, Druidic, Sylvan; speak with plants (gourds only)
Skills Nature +5, Stealth +7
Str +2, Dex +4, Con +2, Int –1, Wis +2, Cha +0
Keepsake (abjuration, primal) The leshy can store an item of light Bulk or less in its head,
concealing it as nondetection. If stored for 24 hours, the item beneﬁts from mending.
AC 17; Fort +5, Ref +9, Will +7
HP 20
Verdant Burst (healing) As leaf leshy, except plants regain 1d8 Hit Points and the area
sprouts gourds instead of tree saplings.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +7 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d4+2 bludgeoning plus ensnare
Ranged Ȱɵ seed +9 (range increment 30 feet), Damage 1d6+2 bludgeoning plus ensnare
Primal Innate Spells DC 15; 4th speak with plants
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) As leaf leshy, except
the gourd leshy transforms into a gourd-bearing plant.
Ensnare When the gourd leshy damages a creature with a ﬁst or seed Strike, vines lash
out from the leshy (or seed) and wrap around the target’s limbs. The target must
attempt a DC 17 Reﬂex save. On a failure, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to
its Speed for 1 round; on a critical failure, the target is immobilized for 1 round and the
penalty to Speed lasts for 1 minute.
Fungus Leshy
Fungus leshys guard caves, bogs, and damp, dark places.
Their fungus gardens are bizarre by most standards, but
fungus leshys are extremely proud of their works.

Spore Cloud ʚʖ (poison) A fungus leshy can unleash a cloud of
spores that irritates the eyes and throats of non-fungi
creatures in a 15-foot emanation. Each creature must
succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1 persistent
poison damage. A creature has its vision reduced as long
as the persistent damage continues and can see only
within 20 feet (or 10 feet, on a critical failure).
Spores A creature that takes damage from a fungus
leshy’s spore pod Strike must attempt a saving
throw with the same DC and eﬀect as its Spore
Cloud ability.
