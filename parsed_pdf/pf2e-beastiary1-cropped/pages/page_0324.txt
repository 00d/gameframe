ALTERNATE WARSWORNS
While uniquely terrible, war is not
the only tragedy that can lead to
mass deaths. Other forms of mass
undead, similar to warsworn, can
sometimes arise from causes such
as famine or disaster. Flamesworn
rise from large crowds killed by
ﬁre, while plagueborn rise when
entire townships or even cities
perish to disease.
Warsworn
A warsworn is an animate mass of corpses composed of dozens, sometimes
even hundreds, of victims of battle. They are formed by deities of undeath or
war or, rarely, spontaneously manifest from the devastation of an especially
horrendous battle.

Absorb Ȳ˓ (death, divine, necromancy); Trigger The
warsworn moves into a dying creature’s space.
Eﬀect The warsworn absorbs the dying creature
into itself, instantly killing the creature and
healing the warsworn for a number of Hit Points
equal to the creature’s level. As long as the
warsworn still exists, absorbed creatures
can’t be resurrected except by wish or a
similarly powerful eﬀect.
Animated Weapons (divine, evocation); The warsworn
assumes control of unattended weapons within
100 feet, forcing them to levitate around it. The
warsworn can telekinetically wield these weapons to
make melee Strikes with a reach of 100 feet.
Energy Drain (divine, necromancy); When a warsworn hits with a corpse wave Strike
or damages a creature with Trample, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save
or become drained 2 and doomed 1. On a critical
success, the target becomes temporarily
immune to the warsworn’s energy drain for
24 hours.
Plummet A creature hit by a warsworn’s scrap ball
Strike must attempt a DC 37 Reﬂex save. On a
failure, the target falls prone;
if the target was airborne,
it falls up to 120 feet, taking
damage from the fall and
landing prone if the descent
brings it to the ground. On a
critical failure, the target is
also held under a pile of scrap
(DC 37 to Escape).
Trample ̂ˬ Huge or smaller, corpse
wave, DC 37
