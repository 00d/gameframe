Werewolf
The curse of the werewolf—known as lycanthropy to many—instills in its carriers the
hungry bloodlust and predatory instincts of the wolf. Werewolves tend to dwell on the
fringes of society or in small settlements where, in their humanoid forms, they work
as laborers, hunters, farmers, or trappers. At night, however, these same villagers
transform into violent killers and sadistic stalkers who prey on their neighbors.
Werewolves are the quintessential werecreature, and the ﬁrst that comes to mind
when most people speak of such beings.
Although most werewolves hide their curse by adopting
solitary lifestyles, some retain the pack mentality of true
wolves. A small group of such werewolves typically
forms a family-like pack, with the eldest or most
powerful serving as the leader; new pack mates are
hand-chosen and inculcated into the family as its
inﬂuence grows.

Werebear
Unlike many other types of werecreature, a werebear does not become

WOLFSBANE
Wolfsbane (Core Rulebook 553)
is a poisonous plant that can cure
the curse of the werecreature. It’s
eﬀective only if consumed before the
creature transforms for the ﬁrst time.
If the creature survives wolfsbane’s
eﬀects without using magic to aid in
surviving, the creature can attempt
a new saving throw against the
curse of the werecreature. On a
success, the creature is cured.
