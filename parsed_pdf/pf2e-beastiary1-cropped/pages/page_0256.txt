OTHER OOZES
Many varieties of these nearly
mindless predators exist in the
world. Some are mere variants,
with diﬀerent colored puddings,
jellies, and oozes with little to
diﬀerentiate them from those
presented here other than
their habitat. Others are more
specialized, or even dangerously
intelligent. The shoggoth
(page 297) is one such example,
but another variety of deadly and
powerful ooze is the thankfully
rare blight, a creature composed of
protoplasm and eyes that curses
entire regions with its presence.
ancient cultures would entomb bodies in stone sarcophaguses with ochre jellies to
allow the ooze to break down the ﬂesh and clean and polish the bones.

Perception +7; motion sense 60 feet, no vision
Skills Athletics +13
Str +4, Dex –5, Con +6, Int –5, Wis +0, Cha –5
Motion Sense As sewer ooze.
AC 12; Fort +15, Ref +4, Will +7
HP 150; Immunities acid, critical hits, electricity, mental, piercing, precision, slashing,
unconscious, visual
Split Whenever an ochre jelly is hit by an attack or eﬀect that would deal slashing,
piercing, or electricity damage and the ochre jelly has at least 10 HP, the jelly splits
into two identical jellies with half the original’s HP. One jelly is in the same space as
the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent
space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to
ﬁll a space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or sturdy to push).
Speed 15 feet, climb 10 feet
Melee Ȱɵ pseudopod +15, Damage 1d8+7 bludgeoning plus 2d4 acid and Grab
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+3 bludgeoning plus 1d4 acid, DC 23
Ochre Acid An ochre jelly’s acid damages only ﬂesh—not bone, stone, wood, or
other materials.
Black Pudding
Most often found below ground, these oozes scour caves for objects to dissolve
with their corrosive secretions. This caustic acid is particularly dangerous to
creatures that attack a pudding, as it can quickly damage and destroy gear.

HP 165; Immunities acid, critical hits, mental, piercing, precision, slashing, unconscious, visual
Corrosive Mass A creature that hits the pudding with a metal or wooden weapon must
succeed at a DC 22 Reﬂex save or the weapon takes 2d6 acid damage (after dealing
damage to the black pudding as normal). Thrown weapons and ammunition take
this damage automatically with no save.
Split When the black pudding is hit by an attack that would deal slashing or
piercing damage and has 10 or more HP, it splits into two identical puddings,
each with half the original’s HP. One pudding is in the same space as the
original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no
adjacent space is unoccupied, it automatically pushes creatures and
objects out of the way to ﬁll a space (the GM decides if an object or
creature is too big or sturdy to push).
Speed 20 feet, climb 20 feet; suction
Melee Ȱɵ pseudopod +18 (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8+7 bludgeoning
plus 2d6 acid, corrosive touch, and Grab
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 26
Corrosive Touch When the pudding hits a creature with its
pseudopod, any acid damage is dealt to the creature’s armor or
clothing as well as the creature.
Suction The pudding can climb on ceilings and other inverted surfaces,
though such surfaces are diﬃcult terrain for it.
