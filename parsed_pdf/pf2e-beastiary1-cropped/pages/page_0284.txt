FEARED AND LOATHED
Very few monsters are as hated
by seasoned adventurers as rust
monsters, for these creatures are
not content to merely kill those
who intrude upon their lairs—they
eat their hard-won weapons
and armor! Many innovative
dungeon-dwelling creatures
have seized upon this fact, and
those that can’t arrange for a
rust monster guardian to scare
adventurers away leave rusted bits
of armor with curious markings
strewn about, hoping that the
mere sight of potential rust
monster activity is enough to turn
back would-be troublemakers.
Rust Monster
Found in lost dungeons, deep caves, and abandoned mines, rust monsters are
a bane to any adventurers who rely on armor, weapons, or other metal items.
These strange-looking creatures grow to about 5 feet long, with four insectile legs
and a long tail ending in a four-pronged appendage resembling a tiny windmill.
However, it is the rust monster’s feathery antennae that strike fear in the hearts
of battle-hardened warriors, for a single touch from even just one antenna can
reduce an adventurer’s most valuable tools to a useless pile of rust.
Rust monsters aren’t inherently aggressive creatures, but they’re voracious
oxidivores, meaning they consume the rust created by their antennae. The
creatures savagely attack anything that gets between them and a possible meal,
and they relentlessly pursue any source of metal. A rust monster can be distracted
by a single metal-rich item, but they are often encountered in groups of three or
more, sharply raising the cost of escape.
Rust monsters are a terrible scourge in mining communities. If a group of rust
monsters discovers rich veins of ore, they can multiply quickly. By weakening
tunnels, attacking workers, and consuming the source of the miners’ livelihood,
these aberrations have created many mountainside ghost towns.

Antenna Disarm Ȱɵ The rust monster attempts to
Disarm a metal item a creature is holding using
its antenna (with the same modiﬁer as an antenna
Strike). On a success, the item is subject to the
rust monster’s rust ability (see below) in addition
to the eﬀects of the Disarm, and if the check to
Disarm is a critical success, the rust monster drops
the item on the ground in its own space.
Rust A rust monster’s antenna causes metal to rapidly
rust and corrode. If it succeeds at an antenna
Strike or Disarm attempt with its antenna, the
rust monster deals 2d6 damage (doubled
on a critical hit) to a metal item the target
is wearing or holding, ignoring its
Hardness. If the rust monster
hits
an
unattended
metal
item, the item takes this damage
automatically. If a creature uses the Shield Block reaction
with a metal shield against an antenna attack, the shield is automatically broken, but
no other item is rusted on that attack.
