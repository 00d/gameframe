OTHER PLANAR SCIONS
As many types of planar scions
exist as planes of existence, and
even then there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between scions
depending on the exact nature of
their extraplanar forebears. Angelic
scions are known as aasimars,
ﬁendish scions are called tieﬂings,
and monitor scions are urobians.
Planar Scion
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are
benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons.
And some ﬁt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard
of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the
children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines
for generations to follow. After the ﬁrst generation, this otherworldly inﬂuence
usually lies dormant, but now and then, the inﬂuence can manifest strongly in
descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known
collectively as planar scions.
Tiefling
Tieﬂings are planar scions with ﬁendish blood. One of the most common types is
pitborn, who bear a demonic corruption infesting their mortal bloodline. Some
strive to live above their forebear’s ﬁendish reputation, but many, such as this
tieﬂing adept, simply accept their label and delve fully into evil.
