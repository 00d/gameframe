UNLIFE WITHOUT FLESH
The necromantic energies that
infuse animated undead skeletons
give them the ability to see
without eyes and move without
muscles. Despite being mindless,
skeletons’ instinct to evil comes
from their corrupt vital essence,
perverting negative energy for
creation rather than destruction.

Skeletal horses are sometimes used as mounts by other undead or monsters.
