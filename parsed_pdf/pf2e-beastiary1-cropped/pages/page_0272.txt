Change
Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
polymorph, transmutation) A morrigna can take the appearance of
any Small or Medium animal or humanoid. This doesn’t change their
Speed or their attack and damage modiﬁers with their Strikes, but it
might change the damage type their Strikes deal. Unless they choose
to manifest their web wrappings in their new form, they cannot make
web wrappings Strikes.
Spider Minions ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine) The morrigna summons a giant
tarantula (page 307) or spider swarm (page 306). These spiders have
the summoned trait and remain for 10 minutes or until reduced to 0 Hit
Points, whichever comes ﬁrst. The morrigna does not need to Sustain
the Spell to direct these summoned creatures, and the morrigna can
have any number of summoned spiders in existence at once. The
morrigna can see through the eyes of any of their
summoned spiders at any time.
Spirit Touch As nosoi, but 4d6.
