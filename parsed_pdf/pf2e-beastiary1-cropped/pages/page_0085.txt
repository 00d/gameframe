THE SUN! IT BURNS!
Deros are ﬁxated with curing their
allergy to sunlight. To understand
how the surface dwellers can
withstand the light of the sun,
deros conduct late-night raids on
surface cities, abducting victims and
performing terrible experiments on
them. Those who survive are often
returned with much of their memory
erased and their bodies bearing
mysterious scars. When these
repressed memories surface, they
lead to wild, hazy recollections of
being abducted.
Dero
Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin,
and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious
type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are
the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface
races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and
twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs
approximately 70 pounds.
Dero Stalker
Dero stalkers are those charged with exploring the surface world by night and
seeking out new victims to abduct.
