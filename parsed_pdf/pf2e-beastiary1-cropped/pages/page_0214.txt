DIABOLIC KOBOLDS
Certain kobold tribes eschew any
concept of draconic lineage entirely
and instead place their faith in the
archdevils of Hell. These diabolist
kobolds view those of their kind
who simper at the feet of dragons
as pathetic wretches. That they
perform the same fearful worship
to their chosen devil does not strike
these infernally minded kobolds as
an irony at all.
Kobold Scout
Most kobolds encountered outside of a well-defended warren or lair are kobold
scouts, creatures trained for stalking and the hunt.

Kobold Dragon Mage
Kobold dragon mages use magic to carry out their secret schemes. The
presence of a dragon mage in a kobold warren is one of the greatest
testaments to the kobolds’ claim to draconic heritage.
