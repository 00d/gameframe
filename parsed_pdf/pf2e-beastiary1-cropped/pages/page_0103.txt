RABIES
While many societies adore dogs
and value them for their loyalty as
pets, no aﬄiction other than rabies
can reverse sentiments about these
creatures quite so easily. While
many animals can be aﬄicted with
this debilitating illness, something
about a loyal family pet growing
feral and violent as a result of the
disease makes it that much worse.

Dog
Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, protectors, and
hunting companions. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and
their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most
adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world—from tiny
lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to muscular dogs that stand
nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder—and they can be found in nearly any place
where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller
adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling
sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra. Regardless, many adventurers
ﬁnd value in having a dog.
Guard Dog
The typical guard dog is loyal to and beloved by many communities. Often
adored as pets, they also excel as protectors and trackers, and can be fearless
when defending a beloved master or family member. The statistics presented
below work well for any number of breeds of dog ranging from 20 to 50
pounds in weight. Wild dogs can also use these statistics, but their untamed
nature makes them far more unpredictable and threatening. Feral dogs are
perhaps even more dangerous, for unlike their wild cousins, feral dogs often
lack the instinctual fear of humanity that stops wild creatures from interacting
with people.

Riding Dog
Riding dogs types include larger dogs, such as mastiffs,
wolfhounds, and huskies, and are bred often by halﬂings
and gnomes to serve as mounts. Riding dogs are as loyal and
devoted to their masters as guard dogs, and are ferocious
in battle, regardless of whether they bear a rider or not. As
with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in
nature, and, in some cases, might rival packs of wolves with
regard to the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas.
