WOLF PACKS
Wolf packs claim and defend large
swaths of territory, which they
regularly patrol in search of both
prey and competitors. It takes a
pack roughly 10 days to cover
the entire breadth of its territory,
which can stretch for miles in any
direction but usually adheres to
natural terrain. Wolves keep claim
over their territories by marking
trees with their scent and howling
to keep other packs away. If these
warnings prove insuﬃcient to
drive oﬀ potential competitors, the
pack attacks the intruders directly.
Wolf
Wolves roam forests, hills, and other wild lands, where they hunt in packs to
beleaguer and surround their prey before going in for the kill. Like most predatory
animals, wolves prefer to attack the weakest or most vulnerable prey they can ﬁnd.
Wolf
Wolves live and hunt in packs, which, contrary to popular belief, are not led by
the strongest in the group, but typically consist of a mated pair, their pups, and
juvenile offspring from previous mating seasons. Offspring generally leave their
parents’ pack upon reaching maturity, at which point they seek out mates of their
own to go form their own packs elsewhere.
Humanoids are not traditionally viewed as prey animals by wolves, but
extraordinary circumstances can lead these animals to attack people, especially in
winter months and other situations where traditional prey (deer and elk, mainly)
is scarce. Some beings, such as powerful vampires, can call upon wolves to aid
them in combat.

Dire Wolf
Much larger and more foul-tempered than their common

grounds and appetites. Orcs are fond of using dire
wolves as mounts, ﬁnding their vicious tempers
perfect for hunting and warfare.
