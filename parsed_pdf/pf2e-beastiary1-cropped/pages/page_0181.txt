GOBLIN TREASURE
Although goblin warrens are
generally ﬁlthy dumps, they
sometimes contain actual
treasures stolen from longshanks
or other goblin tribes. Typical
treasures include small pieces of
jewelry, shiny items such as hand
mirrors, and gold teeth. As they
rarely trust each other, many
goblins keep their most cherished
baubles on their persons; these,
might include useful weapons or
minor magic items.
Goblin
These small humanoids have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears.
While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding
members of humanoid communities, most are impetuous and vicious creatures who
delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock,
stealing infants, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They
revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.”
Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with
ﬁre; goblins who master magic or ﬁre earn great respect from their kin. Most other
humanoids ﬁnd it difﬁcult to understand goblins’ outlook: they hate canines but
eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger
creatures but are terriﬁed of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles
a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.
Goblin Warrior
The frontline ﬁghters of goblin tribes prefer to ﬁght in large groups—especially
when they can outnumber their foes at least three to one.

Goblin Commando
The theoretical leaders of goblin raids are called goblin
commandos. In practice, goblin commandos rarely
continue to lead their comrades once a battle has begun.
Most shirk their responsibilities in favor of wading into
the fray and claiming more glory from their tribe-mates.

GOBLIN LOCATIONS
Goblins construct warrens in
forests and coastal regions,
usually near the settlements
of other humanoids for ease of
scavenging and raiding.
