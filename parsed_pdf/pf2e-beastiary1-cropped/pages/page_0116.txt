LOGRIVICH
When Queen Elvanna still ruled
Irrisen, she appointed the young
white dragon, Logrivich, to the
Winter Guard, the force that
maintains order in the nation’s
capital of Whitethrone. He resided
in a clock tower, though he hasn’t
been seen in a few years, leading
some to think that he either moved
away or was killed by adventurers
during the city’s recent troubles.
