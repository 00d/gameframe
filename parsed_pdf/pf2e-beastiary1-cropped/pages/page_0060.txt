CAVE WORM GUARDIANS
Cave worms are notoriously dim
witted, driven primarily by purely
animalistic needs to feed and
reproduce. This hasn’t prevented
attempts to use them as guardians
for their lairs, if not to tame them.
Magic can be used to maintain
control over a worm, but gifted,
patient, and brave animal trainers
can condition cave worms to
serve in all manner of roles, such
as living siege engines, shocking
methods of executing foes, or
merely pets.
