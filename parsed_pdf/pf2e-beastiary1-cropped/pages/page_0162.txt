GARGOYLE TREASURE
The obsessive nature of gargoyles
can result in a variety of treasure
hoards and grim trophy collections,
ranging from stockpiles of arcane
tomes to alchemical potions and
apparatuses to simple trinkets.
Gargoyle
Gargoyles are monstrous hunters made of elemental stone. They use their
resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and
descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a
horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal
of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling
no known creature. A gargoyle’s features are not ﬁxed; city-dwelling gargoyles
who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match
the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for
long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.
Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome
tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become
relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other
creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances
exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive,
and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive
and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim
trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual
subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the
dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash.
Kapoacinth
Kapoacinths dwell not amid cliffs or rooftops, but beneath
the sea, using their wings to swim. These water-dwelling
gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions
and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey.
Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to
create more stable wings for longer periods
of time. Kapoacinths have the same
abilities as the gargoyle presented below,
but with the following adjustments:
they have the aquatic trait, they have
a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of
a ﬂy Speed, and their Clawed Feat
reaction triggers when they are
Swimming instead of Flying.
