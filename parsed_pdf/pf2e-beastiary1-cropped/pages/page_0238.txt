VARIANT MINOTAURS
Most minotaurs are a simple
blend of muscular humanoid and
raging bull, but unusual variants
and unique minotaurs may have
diﬀerent physical features and
abilities. Great-horned minotaurs
can impale foes if they critically
succeed on a charge, but they do
not have the Hunted Fear ability.
Shaggy minotaurs are covered
in thick hair form head to toe,
allowing them to live in freezing
environments with ease and giving
them resistance to cold damage,
but their hooves are broad and
heavy, making it impossible for
them to charge.
Minotaur
Minotaurs are master hunters that dwell in cunning labyrinths or tangles of
underground caverns meant to disorient and demoralize prey. These monstrous
tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in
the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then
will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes
or impaling them on its sharp horns.
Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in
old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary
creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more
powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more
than prey to be hunted.

Axe Swipe ʚʖ The minotaur swings its axe in a wide arc, making greataxe
Strikes against any two foes who are adjacent to each other and within
the minotaur’s reach. The multiple attack penalty does not increase
until after both attacks are resolved.
Hunted Fear Ȱɵ The minotaur snorts and clomps as it hunts its prey,
inspiring  terror. The minotaur makes an Intimidation check to
Demoralize all living creatures within 60 feet that can hear
the minotaur but not see it. Roll once and apply the result
to all creatures. If the targets are in a maze or similarly
diﬃcult-to-navigate structure, the minotaur gains a +4
circumstance bonus to this check. Creatures that become
frightened as a result also take a –2 circumstance
penalty to Survival checks to avoid getting lost for 1
minute. This use of Demoralize doesn't have the visual
trait. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Powerful Charge ʚʖ The minotaur Strides twice, then
makes a horn Strike. If it moved at least 20 feet from its
starting position, the Strike’s damage is increased to 2d8+10.
