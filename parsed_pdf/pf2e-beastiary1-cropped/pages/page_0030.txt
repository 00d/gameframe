OTHER ARCHONS
Many other archons than those
presented here patrol Heaven or
crusade in the ﬁendish planes,
including the resolute hound
archon soldiers and sentinels,
and the supreme bastion archons,
who rank among Heaven’s most
powerful defenders.
Shield Archon
Shield archons defend the fortresses of Heaven against ﬁendish incursions. They
wield their spears and shields in massive formations capable of withstanding any
onslaught. Beneath their armor, they are sheathed in skin of steel. Given their
tremendous strength and imposing stature, shield archons are ideal guardians
of the meek and are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane to ward off the
attacks of great numbers of evildoers.

Morphic Hands Ȱɵ (divine, transmutation) A shield archon’s hands can change
into a +1 holy striking spear and a lesser sturdy shield or
back into hands. Transforming does not restore any
HP to the items, and if either the weapon or shield
is fully destroyed, the archon loses that hand until
it receives a regenerate spell or similar magic. If a
shield archon is slain, its weapon and shield can
be taken, but they fade into nothingness after
24 hours.

Living Shield A shield archon’s shield is the focal
point of its courage and soul. It always has
its shield raised without needing to Raise a
Shield, and it can use Shield Block as a free
action instead of a reaction (Hardness 10,
HP 80). A shield archon can trigger its Shield
Block free action when an ally within 10 feet
is the target of an attack, reducing damage
to that ally instead of itself but otherwise
following the normal rules of Shield Block.

Archon’s Door As horned archon.
Courageous Switch When a shield archon
uses its dimension door innate spell, it
can choose to move into the space of
a willing ally it can see within range.
If it does so, the ally switches places
with the archon, appearing in the
space the archon just vacated, as if
it too had cast dimension door.
