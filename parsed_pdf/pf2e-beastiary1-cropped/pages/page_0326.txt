WEB LURKER LAIRS
Whether alone or in a group, web
lurkers hunt in forests, swamps,
or scrubby hill lands, constructing
structures from their webs high
up in trees or within craggy, high
canyons, and they surround their
territory with traps and snares
constructed of the same webbing
and natural material.
Web Lurker
Web lurkers, known also as ettercaps, are ugly monsters that not only dwell within
