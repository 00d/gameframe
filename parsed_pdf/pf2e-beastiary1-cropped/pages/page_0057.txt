Cave Worm
Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world,
eating whatever material they ﬁnd. Named for their distinctive colorations, these
worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms
of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales
speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray
worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
Purple Worm
The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a
much‑feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable
of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last
long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes
of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to ﬁnd the worm’s
central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.

BELLY OF THE BEAST
The adventure need not end simply
because the party was ingloriously
swallowed whole by a giant cave
worm. Perhaps the PCs ﬁnd an
undigested item that helps them
survive the inhospitable environ,
or maybe the worm regurgitates
them in a cavern far oﬀ from
where they started. Whatever
the speciﬁcs, you can easily draw
from folklore and popular ﬁction
to create your own "belly of the
worm" adventure for heroes who
wind up on the wrong side of the
monster’s scales.
