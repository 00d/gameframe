SNAKE RESOURCES
Snakeskin’s distinctive pattern
and wide variety of applications
makes it a sought-after resource,
and the hides of extra-large snakes
such as giant anacondas can fetch
a ﬁne price in the right market.
Such oversized snake hides can be
used to craft clothing of snakeskin
leather, including boots and gloves,
as well as other items such as
scabbards, backpacks, and even
tents or makeshift boats.
A snake’s hide can be cleanly
removed with a successful Crafting
check or appropriate Lore check.
Snake
Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap
around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes
consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to
move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.
Viper
Each member of this family of venomous snakes has long, hinged fangs that inject
potent venom in their prey. Different vipers inject different types of venom, which
might result in paralysis, extreme pain and swelling, blood clotting, or even the
sudden stopping of the victim’s heart.

Ball Python
This nonvenomous snake’s name comes
from its tendency to curl into a ball when

for its hunting tactic of coiling around
prey and crushing victims with its
powerful muscles. Nonetheless,
brave herpetologists sometimes
keep ball pythons as pets.
