BOGGARD VILLAGES
Boggards prefer to dwell in
swamplands and mires. Though
they are at home in the water, they
prefer to spend most of their lives
on land, and build villages of mud
huts. They often keep guardian
beasts, such as bloodseekers
(page 42), crocodiles (page 67),
giant frogs, or other feral animals
tamed (if only just barely) to serve
as protectors.
Boggard
Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes,
and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, ﬁercely
competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3
years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the
rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their
might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking
swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
Boggard Scout
Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to
speak another language (typically Common) to make it easier to issue threats and
insults toward trespassers.

Swamp Stride A boggard scout ignores diﬃcult terrain caused by swamp terrain features.
Terrifying Croak Ȱɵ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The boggard scout unleashes a
terrifying croak. Any non-boggard within 30 feet becomes frightened 1 unless they
succeed at a DC 17 Will save; those who critically succeed are temporarily immune for
1 minute.
Tongue Grab If the boggard scout hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes
grabbed by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn’t immobilized, but
it can’t move beyond the reach of the boggard’s tongue. A creature can sever the
tongue by hitting AC 13 and dealing at least 2 slashing damage. Though this doesn’t
deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it
regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
Boggard Warrior
Boggard warriors exalt in single combat, and prefer to ﬁght alone so that
none can contest their kills. They have been known to pursue enemies who ﬂee
combat with a single-mindedness that seems almost supernatural.
