FLYTRAP TREASURE
Giant ﬂytraps have enough
instinctual intellect to eﬀectively
ambush prey or to move about to
seek out better hunting grounds,
but they don’t value treasure. Still,
a ﬂytrap tends to accumulate a
small wealth of discarded loot
from those it has eaten, discarding
these shiny baubles in the
periphery of its root system once it
has ﬁnished digesting its meal.
Flytrap
Flytraps are dangerous creatures as eager to feed on humanoids and larger prey
as they are monstrous insects.
Snapping Flytrap
The snapping ﬂytrap is a ravenous, carnivorous plant that is quick to bite at any
creature that passes by. Snapping ﬂytraps typically have two sets of tooth-edged
leaves, each measuring 3 feet wide, at the end of 10-foot-long stalks.

Quick Capture Ǻȓ Trigger A creature hits or touches the ﬂytrap. Eﬀect The ﬂytrap
makes a leaf Strike against the triggering creature. If it hits, the creature is grabbed
in that leaf.
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ leaf +11 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+2 piercing plus 1d6 acid and Improved Grab
Focused Assault ʚʖ The ﬂytrap attacks a single target with both its leaves. The
ﬂytrap makes one leaf Strike. On a success, the ﬂytrap deals the damage from one
leaf Strike plus an additional 1d8 damage for every leaf beyond
the ﬁrst. On a failure, the ﬂytrap deals the damage from
one leaf Strike, but it can’t use Improved Grab. It deals no
damage on a critical failure. This counts toward the ﬂytrap’s
multiple attack penalty as a number of attacks equal to the number of
leaves the ﬂytrap has.
Hungry Flurry ʚʖ The ﬂytrap makes two leaf Strikes at a –2
penalty, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count
toward the ﬂytrap’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all its attacks.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) Medium, 1d8+1 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, Rupture 5
Giant Flytrap
Because they blend in so well with surrounding foliage, giant ﬂytraps can use the
element of surprise to make quick strikes against unsuspecting adventurers and
forest travelers.
