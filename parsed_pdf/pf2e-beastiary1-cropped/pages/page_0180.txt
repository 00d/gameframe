GNOLL LAIRS
Gnolls dwell primarily on dry
savannas and windswept plains.
Thanks to their sturdy constitutions
and strong survival instincts,
they have few qualms about
setting up holdings out in the
open. Many gnolls establish their
encampments—typically made up of
hide lean-tos and tents—atop sloping
hills to better survey the region for
potential prey. Gnolls rarely dwell
in caverns or similar enclosures,
knowing that it is all too easy to get
cornered when there is only
one exit.
Gnoll Cultist
Gnoll cultists serve as their clans’ spiritual guides and conduits to the divine. As
often as not, their inﬂuence drives entire gnoll civilizations to commit atrocious
acts of violence and enslavement. Lamashtu and Rovagug are favored deities of
gnoll cultists, and many gnolls believe their kind was in fact birthed from the
womb of the Mother of Monsters. Some gnoll clans worship lesser-known demon
lords or entire pantheons of sinister patrons.

Gnoll Sergeant
When gnolls band together to form hunting or raiding
parties, the strongest among them is often designated the
leader or sergeant. These gnolls train extensively in the art of
war. Their skill at arms and the respect they command make
them powerful adversaries. In smaller clans or single family
units, a gnoll sergeant might also serve as the group’s leader
in other affairs, such as sorting out domestic disputes or
negotiating with rival gnoll clans.
