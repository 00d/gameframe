OTHER DINOSAURS
A wide range of dinosaurs are
presented on these pages, but any
trip to the movies, exploration
of dinosaur books, or a quick
online search reveals a wealth of
additional creatures that could ﬁt
into your game as well. Armor-
headed pachycephalosaurs,
spike-thumbed iguanodons,
duck-billed hadrosaurs, sail-backed
spinosauruses, and more await
discovery by those who would
seek out the mysteries of the lost
worlds where the thunder lizards
still rule!
exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other
than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim’s ﬂesh with
their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long.
As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to
take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully
train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous
beasts with a steady diet of meat.
Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of
primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of
war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs
as part of executions or ritual sacriﬁces. Some xulgath cults even revere
tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their
part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in
this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers.
Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.
Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such
as the allosaurus, or even larger dinosaurs like the ravenous giganotosaurus.
Even the smallest tyrannosaurs, such as the nanotyrannus, are never smaller
than Large in size, yet despite this smaller stature, they are no less ferocious,
and those who would assume that a nanotyrannus is "safer" to train would
do well to think again!

Requirements
A
creature
is
Grabbed
in
the
tyrannosaurus’s
jaws.
Eﬀect The tyrannosaurus ﬂings the creature into the air
up to 10 feet up from its mouth and 20 feet away. The
creature falls 25 feet (assuming the tyrannosaurus
ﬂings it as high as it can) and takes falling damage
accordingly. If the ﬂung creature lands on another
creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The
creature being landed on can attempt a DC 23 basic Reﬂex save.
Pin Prey Ǻȓ Trigger The tyrannosaurus critically hits a Large or smaller foe with its
foot. Effect The creature struck by the foot is knocked prone and the tyrannosaurus
uses its foot to hold the creature in place. As long as the tyrannosaurus doesn’t
move from its position, the pinned creature is Grabbed. A tyrannosaurus gains
a +2 circumstance bonus to attack a creature it has pinned in this manner, but
it cannot use Swallow Whole on the target unless it uses its jaws to Grab the
victim first.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) Medium, 3d6+8 bludgeoning, Rupture 26
Trample ̂ˬ Huge or smaller, foot, DC 29
