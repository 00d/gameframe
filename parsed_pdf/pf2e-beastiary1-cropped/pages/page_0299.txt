CREATING SKELETONS
Start with a skeleton of the
appropriate size. (Gargantuan
skeletons can use skeletal hulk with
the elite template, Gargantuan size,
and 5 feet more reach.) Add Strikes,
Speeds, or other abilities it would
gain from its shape. For instance,
a chimera skeleton might have a
horn attack with its goat head and
jaw attacks with its dragon and lion
heads, but not a ﬁst attack.
Skeleton
Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, skeletons are among the most
common types of undead, found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemeteries.
Skeleton Abilities
Most skeletons have one of these abilities. If you give a skeleton more, you might
want to increase its level and adjust its statistics.
Bloody The skeleton is covered in dripping blood and gains fast healing equal to its level.
Collapse Ǻȓ Trigger The skeleton is critically hit. Eﬀect The skeleton collapses into a
pile of bones and the attack deals only normal damage. The skeleton can reform in a
standing position as an action, but until it does, it is immobilized and ﬂat-footed.
Explosive Death When the skeleton is destroyed, its bones shatter and explode as the
necromantic energy holding it together is released. Adjacent creatures take 1d6 slashing
damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6) with a basic Reﬂex save.
Screaming Skull ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The skeleton removes its skull and
throws it, making a jaws attack with a range of 20 feet. It then attempts to Demoralize
each foe within 10 feet of the target. The head bounces, rolls, or even ﬂies back, returning
to the skeleton at the start of its next turn. The skeleton is blind until then.
Skeleton Guard
The most common skeletal minions are mere guardians.
