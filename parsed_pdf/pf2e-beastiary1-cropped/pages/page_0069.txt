LOST CIVILIZATIONS
Cyclopes dwell in or near the
remains of their lost civilizations—
notably Ghol-Gan in Garund,
Koloran in northwestern
Casmaron, and various kingdoms
in Iblydos. Ruins of Ghol-Gan
still dot the archipelago of the
Shackles, and untold numbers
of treasures belonging to the
ancient cyclops empire still await
discovery. Pirates and treasure
hunters regularly conduct
expeditions in search of lost Ghol-
Gani relics, but many of these
voyages never return. Among
those that do, survivors speak of
terrible curses, gruesome traps,
and one-eyed undead guardians.
Cyclops
The cyclopes are violent giants with a tragic past. Although they possess only
one eye, they could once see far more than most, possessing occult wisdom and
divinatory magic that gave them the mystic ability of foresight. But their legendary
oracular powers failed to prevent the fall of their society, and the vast kingdoms
of the cyclops long ago collapsed into ruin. Today, cyclopes have forgotten much
of what they once knew, and they skulk among the crumbling remains of their
fallen cities like forgotten kings and queens gone mad.
Cyclops
The kingdoms of the cyclopes date to an age before the rise of humanity,
when dragons and giants and serpentfolk ruled the world. The cyclopes built
enormous stone cities and prayed to ancient gods of brutality and wrath, but
their power to foresee the future failed them, and their civilization collapsed.
Today, most cyclopes have virtually no knowledge of the former glory of their
kind, even though it is not uncommon for
them to dwell among the ruins of their
greatness. Cyclops cities include monuments
and imposing murals which depict their
peoples’ history, but few now among them can
read or interpret these relics of the past.
In addition to their single eye, cyclopes are
also famous for their never-ending hunger, an
appetite so all-consuming that some scholars
theorize it may in fact be some kind of
curse. The ever-present hunger of the
cyclopes seems to have some connection
to the death of their civilization—though
whether this voracity was the cause or a
side-effect of their people’s downfall is likely
destined to remain a mystery.
Although details of the cyclopes’ gods have
largely been lost to the annals of time, what
little is known about these deities suggests they
were vindictive and petty enough to curse their
own people if they felt neglected or badly served.
