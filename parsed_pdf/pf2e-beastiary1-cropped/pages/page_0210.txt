GOBLINS AND HORSES
Goblins have many superstitions
and quirks, but few of them are
stronger than their fear and
hatred of horses. This isn’t a
one-sided aﬀair. Horses also fear
and hate goblins, and some have
been known to go out of their
way to harm a goblin. A goblin
trying to mount a horse is nearly
always subject to a torrent of
violent bucking, as the horse
does everything in its power to
ﬂing the goblin to the ground and
within reach of its hooves.
Horse
Horses serve as mounts and beasts of burden in many societies. They are
loyal and typically gentle creatures, and they are invaluable to those looking
to travel long distances. Smaller folk, like gnomes and halﬂings, often utilize
ponies as mounts, while horses are the favored steeds for humans and other
Medium humanoids. Most horses that the average humanoid encounters are
domesticated, though large herds of these powerful animals can be found in
the wild.
