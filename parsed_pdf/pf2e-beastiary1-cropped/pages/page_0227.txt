OTHER LINNORMS
Linnorms exist in a variety of
forms beyond the four detailed
here. The gaunt cairn linnorm,
the spiny taiga linnorm, and
the aquatic fjord linnorm each
terrorize their own specific
regions of the Material Plane.
Tarn Linnorm
Although more powerful linnorms exist, the multi-headed tarn linnorm can wreak
an awe-inspiring amount of devastation.

creates toxic fumes. At the beginning of the linnorm’s
