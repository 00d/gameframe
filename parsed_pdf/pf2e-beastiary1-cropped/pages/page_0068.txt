CROCODILE RESOURCES
A crocodile’s skin can be used as
leather, and its meat is chewy and
mild, though even a large crocodile
doesn’t usually yield more than 50
pounds of usable meat.
CROCODILE LOCATIONS
Crocodiles often live in warm,
tropical areas, either in fresh or salt
water. Alligators are found in more
varied climates, but only in fresh
water. Deinosuchuses, particularly
the largest and most dangerous of
their kind, prefer estuaries, bays,
or other brackish bodies of water
connected to both river and sea.
Crocodile
Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators
that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands.
Crocodile
Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or ﬂoating
in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from
afar—at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because
they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures
better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable
predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where
they step.
