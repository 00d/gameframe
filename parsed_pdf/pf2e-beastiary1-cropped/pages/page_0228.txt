LINNORM TREASURE
As with true dragons, linnorms
tend to amass immense piles
of treasure in their lairs. These
hoards consist of the weapons,
gear, and belongings of would-be
vanquishers more often than
minted coins or works of art.
Tor Linnorm
Tor linnorms dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains, either within natural formed
caverns or within molten craters. A tor linnorm’s temper can be as hot and
destructive as the magma the creature resembles.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, fire, primal) The tor linnorm expels a 60-
foot cone of flame and ash dealing 20d6 fire damage to creatures
within the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save). At the start of the tor
linnorm’s next turn, the area affected by the breath weapon
is covered in thick, scorching smoke that burns both the
lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 10d6 fire damage
to all creatures in the area (DC 46 basic Reflex save).
A creature that spends an entire round in the smoke
with open eyes must succeed at a DC 44 Fortitude
save or is blinded for 1 minute. The smoke dissipates
after 1 minute; in strong winds, the smoke
dissipates in 5 rounds, and in
more powerful winds, it may
clear even more quickly. The
tor linnorm can’t use Breath
Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

Slashing Claws Ȱɵ A tor linnorm
makes four Strikes with its claws, each

penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t
increase until after the tor linnorm makes all its attacks.
Tor Linnorm Venom (ﬁre, injury, poison) Saving Throw DC 44
Fortitude; Maximum Duration 10 rounds; Stage 1 8d6 ﬁre damage
and drained 1; Stage 2 12d6 ﬁre damage and drained 2.
