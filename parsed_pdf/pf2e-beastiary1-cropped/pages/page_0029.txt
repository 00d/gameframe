Legion Archon
Despite their ﬂaming blades and heavy armor, legion archons are the diplomats of
peace among the archons, preferring justice via compromise and mutual beneﬁt
rather than justice by the sword. Nonetheless, when forced to ﬁght against ﬁendish
powers—especially ﬁends that embody the sin of wrath—legion archons don’t
hesitate in battle, mounting offensives under divine commanders like Iomedae.

ARCHON AESTHETICS
While archons do not seek to
gather or maintain wealth, they
do appreciate beauty and art, and
their domains are often decorated
with valuable crafts and creative
works. Their armor and weapons
are similarly ornate, and they
always clean and polish their gear
after battle. Archons value order—
and thus tidiness—in all things.
of justice. A legion archon can throw its ﬂame of justice as a ranged weapon. If
disarmed or thrown, the ﬂame of justice vanishes after landing or dealing damage
and reappears in the legion archon’s hands again instantly. On a critical hit, the ﬁre
damage from the ﬂame of justice deals maximum damage (6 on the d6) before being
doubled for the critical hit, and the target takes 1d10 persistent ﬁre damage.
