DRAGONS ON OTHER
WORLDS
On the planet Triaxus the
Wanderer, the seventh world from
Golarion’s sun, dragons rule entire
continents. There, ancient dragons
maintain city-states and nations.
In a vast region known as the
Drakelands, chromatic dragons
have subjugated the humanoid
inhabitants and frequently war
among themselves. However, a few
good dragons maintain holdings
there. In the region knowns as
the Skyﬁre Mandate, a diﬀerent
dynamic exists: good dragons who
chose to work in harmony with the
humanoid inhabitants have created
a buﬀer against the tyrants of
the Drakelands. There, creatures
known as dragonkin work
alongside humanoids to patrol
the border, making up a group
known as the Dragon Legion.
