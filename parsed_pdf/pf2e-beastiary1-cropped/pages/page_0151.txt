CONJURING MEPHITS
Mephits are a favorite target for
low-level spellcasters to summon,
both because they have several
useful abilities and because they
are relatively easy to command
and manipulate. Still, care must
be taken when using mephits as
minions, because if left unwatched
or unattended for too long, they
can cause all sorts of mischief.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits—sometimes known as elemental scamps—are little bipedal critters
with bat-like wings who serve stronger elementals on the Elemental Planes or
neophyte spellcasters who summon them to the Material Plane. All mephits
have an inkling of magical power as well as a breath weapon.
Air Mephit
Air mephits are capricious and ﬂighty relative to their kin; they are as likely to
ﬂy blindly into battle as they are to whine in terror at a loud noise. They are pale
blue in coloration and have thin wings that trail small puffs of vapor as they ﬂy
through the skies.

Earth Mephit
Earth mephits are humorless and trudge about their tasks with little enthusiasm.
They are somewhat more stout than other mephits, and their dark-brown or
gray bodies are always coated with layers of dirt and ﬁlth. An earth mephit
can ﬂy, just as any other mephit, but the act of ﬂight is uncomfortable and
unnerving to them—they rarely ascend higher than 5 feet off the ground if
they can help it.

Fire Mephit
Fire mephits are conniving and quick to anger. They aren’t evil, but they delight
in inﬂicting pain, and their love of burning things pushes them the closest to this
alignment of all mephits. They have bright-orange skin, and wisps of ﬂame ﬂicker
along their wings as they ﬂap through the air. The rivalry between ﬁre and water
mephits is notorious, and these creatures loathe working together for any amount
of time.
