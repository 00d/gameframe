SINSPAWN LOCATIONS
Sinspawn are found in regions
where sources for their creation
remain buried in ancient ruins—in
Golarion, this currently limits them
to the frontier lands of Varisia.
But as they spread, so to does the
potential knowledge of crafting
more of them, and ﬂeshwarpers
around the world are hoping to
someday soon craft new sinspawn
of their own.
PRIDeSPAWN
A pridespawn has Intimidation +7 and often wields a maul. They are nearly
skeletal in their gauntness, and often seek out ﬁne clothes or jewelry to wear,
taking strange pleasure in appearing elegant and regal.
Melee Ȱɵ maul +10 (shove), Damage 1d12+4 bludgeoning
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a pridespawn’s sinful bite are
clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
SLOTHSPAWN
A slothspawn has Society +6 and usually carries a longspear. Thick rolls of excess
skin drape the slothspawn’s hunched frame.
Melee Ȱɵ longspear +10 (reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a slothspawn’s sinful bite take
a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
WRATHSPAWN
The most commonly encountered of the sinspawn, a wrathspawn has
Athletics +12 and typically wields a ranseur. These sinspawn are the
bulkiest looking of their kind.
Melee Ȱɵ ranseur +10 (disarm, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d10+4 piercing
Sinful Bite Creatures that critically fail their saves against a
wrathspawn’s sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled
1 for 1 minute.

sinspawn are noted in the Sinspawn Sins section.
