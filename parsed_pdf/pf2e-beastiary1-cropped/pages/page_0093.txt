Rituals DC 33; infernal pact
Slowing Frost (cold, divine, evocation) The ice devil channels the extreme cold of its
body through its appendages and weapons. A creature hit by an ice devil’s weapon
or unarmed attack in melee must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for
1d4 rounds. A weapon used by an ice devil gains the eﬀects of a frost rune while the
gelugon holds it, and the ice devil can throw any such weapon with a 20-foot range
increment, trailing motes of frost.
Tactician of Cocytus Ȱɵ (concentrate) An ice devil’s logical mind devises genius tactics
from its perfect memory. It can telepathically send a tactical repositioning to its
allies, allowing all commanded or allied evil creatures in the range of its telepathy
to immediately Stride (or Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim, if the creature has the
corresponding Speed).
Pit Fiend (Tyrant Devil)
When an army of devils invades to bathe a region in bloodshed and hellﬁre, it
is likely that one of Hell’s most powerful and diabolical generals, the pit ﬁend,
masterminded the incursion. Cunning, powerful, and ruthless, pit ﬁends often
serve the archdevils directly. They rule infernal duchies, subjugate mortal worlds,
and usurp infernal rivals using unparalleled despotism and calculated ferocity. To
realize their tyrannical machinations, pit ﬁends claim mortal souls that they corrupt
into lemure servants, which can then be shaped and transformed through infernal
manipulation into the terrifying devils that form Hell’s formidable legions. They
often select the most wicked and vicious lemures for their armies, drawing upon
these lesser devils’ depravity during powerful magical ceremonies to create hideous
and terrifying abominations that can cow and eviscerate the pit ﬁend’s enemies.
Pit ﬁends themselves are crafted deep within the nightmarish bowels of Nessus,
the ninth layer of Hell, to serve the whims of archdevils and infernal dukes.
Those pit ﬁends that don’t leave Nessus to command infernal legions in the upper
layers of Hell often form the courts of Hell’s elite, gathering cabals and sects that
shape Hell’s political landscape through subterfuge and manipulation. But many
pit ﬁends see themselves as living embodiments of hellﬁre, the all-encompassing
wrath of Hell, and thus prefer to dwell in realms consumed by ﬁre. In Avernus,
Dis, Malebolge, Nessus, and Phlegethon, pit ﬁends build vast citadels of brimstone
wreathed in ﬂame to lord over.
Pit ﬁends tower over other devils, standing at least 16 feet tall, weighing over
1,000 pounds, and brandishing wingspans in excess of 20 feet.
INFERNAL DUKES
Elite members of Hell’s political infrastructure and leadership hierarchy, the
dukes of Hell are chosen from among the most tyrannical, oppressive, and
conniving devils. While not all infernal dukes are pit ﬁends, a pit ﬁend’s natural
disposition toward conquest and oppression often make it an ideal candidate
for this position. To create an infernal duke, adjust the pit ﬁend to be between
21st and 25th level. Because of their physical prowess, manipulative nature, and
powerful spellcasting abilities, infernal dukes make excellent villains for long-
running campaigns.
