VARIANT OWLBEARS
Snowy owlbears trade their
terrifying screech for amazing
stealth and the learned ability to
erupt from the snow to take prey
by surprise. Although incredibly
rare, some owlbears have retained
a limited form of ﬂight, allowing
them to glide almost 20 feet for
every foot of height descended.
Terrifyingly, these gliding
owlbears are entirely silent while
descending on their prey.
Owlbear
With the body of a powerful brown bear and the keen senses of an owl, the
owlbear is a dangerous territorial predator, fearlessly attacking any creature that
strays into its domain. Those who run afoul of an owlbear hear its terrifying
screech only seconds before the massive creature is upon them, ripping them apart
with deadly talons and a powerful beak.
Although their origin is lost to time, owlbears are assumed to be the result
of a magical experiment to make a more cunning predator. According to the
legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the ﬁrst victim of
the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of
features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the
features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble
polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might
resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.
Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which
are hatched from eggs. An owlbear’s territory usually extends to around 5 miles
from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up
trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear
rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found
trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested
bones these monsters leave behind.
