OTHER FLESHWARPS
Grothluts may be the weakest
example of a ﬂeshwarp, and
driders the most successful, but
others exist as well. Ghonhatines
are lumbering ﬂeshwarps formed
from xulgaths, while the tentacled
irnakurses are formed from surface-
dwelling elves. Sinspawn (pages
296–297) are ﬂeshwarps as well, of
course, although their methods of
creation diﬀer drastically from the
techniques mastered by drow.
Drider
The ﬁrst ﬂeshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most
successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that
of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic ﬂeshwarp—the only ﬂeshwarp
known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos
of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders
have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form
with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reﬂection on the
matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.
Although the ﬂeshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment
for drow who fell from grace, the signiﬁcant powers and strengths gained from the
horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of
lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure.
In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian,
soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead
their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is
that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow
have a penchant for working their ﬂeshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in
deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.
Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well
known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider’s innate spells
remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different
types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared
than the drider presented below.
