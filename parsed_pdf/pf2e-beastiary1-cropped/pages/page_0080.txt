DEMONIC POSSESSION
Some demons specialize in the art
of possessing creatures or objects
to spread fear and chaos. In such
cases a demon gains a powerful
disguise with which to work its
evils upon the world, a subterfuge
that delights the demon.
in that case, the eﬀect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the
vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a
20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage
(DC 28 basic Reﬂex save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage
increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing
5d12 damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of
Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation’s size increases by 20 feet
each round, and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.
Spore Cloud Ȱɵ (disease, poison) The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body,
dealing 2d8 poison damage to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way
must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2d8 persistent piercing damage as the
spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing
after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved oﬀ before then. The
vines can be destroyed if the creature is aﬀected by a good spell or if holy water is
applied to the vines (with an Interact action). Once the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the
ability can’t be used for 1d6 rounds.
Stunning Screech Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, incapacitation, sonic) Frequency once per minute.
Eﬀect The vrock emits a shrill screech. Each non-demon creature within a 30-foot
burst must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is stunned 2,
and on a critical failure, it’s stunned 3.
Glabrezu (Treachery Demon)
Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting
mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as
easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to
fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope
into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term
repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a
struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only
to ﬁnd that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the
weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted
in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus
are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
These massive demons have enormous pincers and
a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their
chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess
formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the
souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.

Truth Vulnerability A glabrezu’s lies sustain them, and the truth can destroy them.
Whenever a revelation eﬀect counteracts or reveals the glabrezu’s illusions or the
glabrezu fails a save against an eﬀect that would prevent them from lying (such as zone
of truth), the demon takes 3d6 mental damage. They take this damage only once
per eﬀect, even if the eﬀect reveals multiple illusions or prevents multiple lies.
