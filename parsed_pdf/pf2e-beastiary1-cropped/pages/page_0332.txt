righteous conviction. This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though,
as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has
little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely
even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as
long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in
wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full
and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved
one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it
protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content
to forage and sleep away the night.

Hunt Prey Ȱɵ (concentrate); Requirements
The werebear can see or hear the target
or is Tracking it in exploration mode. Eﬀect The
werebear gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception
checks when it Seeks its prey and a +2 circumstance
bonus to Survival checks when it Tracks its prey. The
werebear also ignores the penalty for making ranged attacks
within its second range increment against the prey it’s hunting. The
werebear can designate only one creature as its hunted prey at a time.
If it uses Hunt Prey against a diﬀerent creature, the prior creature
loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. In
any case, this designation lasts until the werebear’s next daily
preparation.
Mauler The werebear gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage rolls
against creatures it has grabbed.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation)
Precision Edge The werebear deals 1d8 additional precision damage on
its ﬁrst successful Strike against its hunted target on each of its turns.
OTHER WERECREATURES
In theory, any animal could
form the basis for a new type of
werecreature, provided the animal
in question is at least omnivorous—
herbivorous werecreatures are all
but unheard of. Werecreatures that
rise from insects, arachnids, and
similar invertebrate animals are
particularly unsettling, though much
rarer than werecreatures
of vertebrate animals.
