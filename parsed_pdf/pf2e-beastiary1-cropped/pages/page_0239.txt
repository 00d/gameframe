UNDERGROUND MOONS
Mu spores dwell in vast caverns,
their pallid underbellies glowing
softly to give the eerie impression
of a strangely shaped “moon”
adrift near the darkened ceiling
so far above. Caverns can be
faintly lit by this illumination—an
unnerving sight for any traveler
not expecting light in such a
lightless realm.
Mu Spore
A mu spore is a thankfully rare fungoid monstrosity of vast power and strange
intellect. Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from
tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of ﬂying
with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their ﬂight.
Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of
apocalyptic events, but they’re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores
often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this
lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs
or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the
spores are not viable for long once they’ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to
harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.

Enormous A mu spore is a massive creature and takes up a space of 10 squares by 10
squares (50 feet by 50 feet).
Spores (aura) 60 feet. A living creature that enters the area or ends its turn within it
is corrupted by spores. It must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or be clumsy 1,
enfeebled 1, and slowed 1 for 1 round. Fungi and plants are immune.

Cough Spores ʚʖ The mu spore releases a
cloud of burrowing spores in a 400-foot cone.
The spores deal 22d6 piercing damage to all
creatures, objects, and wooden structures in the
area, but not to plants or fungi (DC 46 basic Reﬂex
save). The mu spore can’t use this ability again for
1d4 rounds.
Enormous Inhalation ʚʖ The mu spore pulls all creatures
and objects in a 400-foot cone 400 feet toward its mouth. A
successful DC 43 Fortitude save halves the distance, or avoids
the pull on a critical success. The mu spore automatically
attempts to Swallow Whole each creature adjacent to it at
the end of the inhalation.

creature with its jaws. Eﬀect The spore uses
Swallow Whole.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ 15 bludgeoning, DC 45
