THE CALIGNI LEGACY
The calignis are descendants
of humans who, millennia ago,
ﬂed underground to escape a
devastating cataclysm and begged
malevolent, shadowy demigods
known only as the Forsaken for
salvation. The Forsaken warped the
refugees into tough survivors, but
at a price: every caligni that dies
combusts in a burst of energy that
provides a scrap of soul energy to
the Forsaken. The greatest irony
of the caligni’s bargain is that the
Forsaken themselves mysteriously
vanished long ago and no longer
answer pleas or prayers. Today,
caligni still burst into light upon
death, but their soul energy
no longer feeds a mysterious
pantheon of shadowy divinities.
Death Flash (light) When the caligni creeper dies, their body combusts in a ﬂash of bright
light. All creatures in a 10-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or
be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Creatures with light blindness who successfully save are
still blinded for 1 round. The creeper’s gear and treasure are left in a pile where they
died. As this isn’t a magical eﬀect, the light has no eﬀect within magical darkness.

Double Slice ʚʖ The caligni stalker makes two Strikes
against the same target, one with each of their
shortswords. The stalker combines the damage of
any attacks that hit and applies precision damage,
resistances, and weaknesses only once. Both
attacks count toward the stalker’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty increases only after both attacks.

can Step. Each creeper can beneﬁt from Encircling Command only once per round.
