RAVENOUS TUNNELERS
Cave worms are infamous for
being nearly unstoppable and for
swallowing their prey whole. A
cave worm also ingests earth and
minerals as it tunnels. The worm
processes some of these minerals,
resulting in its armored hide and
toxic sting, while it leaves others
behind—often including treasure or
other valuables that incidentally
serve to lure explorers into the
worm’s proximity and, more often
than not, its gullet. While not
completely mindless, cave worms
are diﬃcult to train, and most
attempts to domesticate them (in
theory, a cave worm would make
an excellent mining resource)
result in disaster.

HP 270
Inexorable The purple worm recovers from the paralyzed, slowed, and stunned
conditions at the end of its turn. It’s also immune to penalties to its Speeds and the
immobilized condition, and it ignores diﬃcult terrain and greater diﬃcult terrain.
Shake It Oﬀ Ǻȓ Frequency once per day; Trigger The purple worm would be aﬀected
by a condition or adverse eﬀect (such as baleful polymorph). Eﬀect The purple
worm negates the triggering condition or eﬀect. Eﬀects from artifacts, deities, or a
similarly powerful source can’t be avoided in this way.

Fast Swallow Ǻȓ Trigger The purple worm Grabs a creature. Eﬀect The worm uses
Swallow Whole.
Purple Worm Venom (poison); Saving Throw DC 32 Fortitude, Maximum Duration 6 rounds;
Stage 1 5d6 poison damage and enfeebled 2 (1 round), Stage 2 6d6 poison damage, and
enfeebled 2 (1 round); Stage 3 8d6 poison damage and enfeebled 2 (1 round).
Regurgitate The purple worm can violently regurgitate a creature or boulder it has
swallowed to make a ranged Strike. The Strike deals bludgeoning damage depending
on the size of the projectile: Tiny deals 2d6+13, Small 3d6+13, Medium 4d6+13,
Large 5d6+13, and Huge 6d6+13. A regurgitated creature takes falling damage from
the height of the target or from 20 feet, whichever is greater.
Boulders occupy space in the worm’s stomach as a creature of equivalent size, and
purple worms often have several boulders swallowed. A purple worm can use a single
action to swallow a new boulder.
Rock Tunneler A purple worm can burrow through solid stone at a Speed of 20 feet. It
can leave a tunnel if it desires, and it usually does.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ Huge, 3d6+9 bludgeoning, Rupture 24
Thrash ʚʖ The worm makes a Strike once against each creature in its reach. It can
Strike up to once with its jaws, up to once with its stinger, and any number of times
with its body. Each attack counts toward the worm’s multiple attack penalty, but the
multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all the attacks.
Azure Worm
The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in ﬂooded tunnels
than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie in
wait within the walls, ﬂoor, or even ceiling of ﬂooded caverns, ready to spring
out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is
particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact
that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from
the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an
azure worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing
a hunting party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.
