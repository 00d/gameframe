DEMONIC LOCATIONS
The sprawling, heaving, changing
realm of the Abyss is the planar
home of demonic life,
but demons can be found
anywhere the capacity to
sin exists. Evil or foolish
conjurers are fond of
calling upon demons for
advice or darker needs.
When the Abyss wears
through the boundaries of
reality to create wound-like
portals into other worlds,
demons can spill over to
wreak incredible havoc.

Enfeebling Bite (divine, necromancy) If the
shemhazian’s jaws Strike damages a creature, the
target is enfeebled 3. The target can attempt a DC
37 Fortitude save to reduce this to
enfeebled 1 (or be unaﬀected on a
critical success).
Focused Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine,
enchantment, incapacitation, visual)
The shemhazian focuses their gaze
on a non-evil creature they can see
within 30 feet. If that creature isn’t
already slowed by the shemhazian’s
paralyzing gaze, it must attempt a save
against the shemhazian’s paralyzing gaze. If that
creature is slowed, it must succeed at a DC 35
Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. A
shemhazian can’t use this ability against the
same creature more than once per round.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
Marilith (Pride Demon)
Mariliths are the generals of the Abyss, formed from the souls of proud evil
mortals, often warlords and despots. They appear as tall and powerfully built
humans from the waist up with snake tails and six arms. Because of Lamashtu’s
prominence over other demonic deities, most pride demons encountered by
mortals take female form, but they can be of any gender.
Mariliths are among the greatest tacticians in the Abyss, and they have an
almost supernatural knack for understanding the ripples of chaos and the
unpredictable nature of demonic life. Their ability to command armies rises as
much from their commanding presence as it does their ability to read into the
potential results of any possible act and a sufﬁcient understanding of the ﬂow of
entropy to allow them to predict likely outcomes.

failure wounds them. If the marilith uses a damaging spell or makes a Strike on
