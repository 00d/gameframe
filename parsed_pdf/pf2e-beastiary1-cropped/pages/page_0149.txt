ELEMENTAL VORTEXES
Where the boundary between
planes wears thin, elementals
manifest in the world through
churning vortexes. Such gateways
might lie at the heart of a volcano, a
deep ocean trench, in regions beset
with earthquakes, or within
great storms.
Elemental, Fire
Fire elementals are destructive manifestations of the scorching Plane of Fire.
