OUTCASTS OF AIR
Uthuls are thought to be an
outcast group of beings that once
dwelled on the Plane of Air. It is
unclear whether their fury was
the reason for their expulsion
from that plane or if they grew
implacable after being banished.
Uthuls do not speak of their
history to anyone and simply
redouble their unending rage on
any who dare to ask.
Uthul
An uthul most often appears to be a dark, swirling cloud ﬁlled with ﬂying debris
and streaked with sudden ﬂashes of lightning. Although they are clearly elemental
in nature, uthuls are nearly always found on the Material Plane, where they hide
among natural cloud formations, especially thunderstorms.

Melee Ȱɵ claw +29 (agile), Damage 3d12+11 slashing
Ranged Ȱɵ debris +29 (range increment 60 feet),
Damage 5d8+15 bludgeoning
Lightning Crash Ȱɵ (electricity, incapacitation,
sonic) The uthul unleashes a powerful bolt
of lightning and a stunning thunderclap.
The bolt deals 6d12 electricity damage
to all creatures in a 30-foot line, with
a DC 34 basic Reﬂex save, and every
creature in a 20-foot emanation must
attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save. The uthul
can’t use Lightning Crash again for 1d4
rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is stunned 1.
Failure The creature is stunned for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds.
Swiftness An uthul’s movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
Whirlwind Form ʚʖ (concentrate) The uthul transforms itself into a swirling
vortex of storm and fury 10 feet wide and up to 40 feet tall. It stays
in this form for 3 rounds or until it Dismisses the eﬀect. While in
this form, the uthul gains resistance 10 to physical damage and can
move through other creatures. Its aura remains active, but it can’t
make debris Strikes nor use Lightning Crash. Instead, any creature
the uthul moves through takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and
2d12 electricity damage. A creature can take this damage
only once per round. A Large or smaller creature
must also succeed at a DC 32 Reﬂex save or be
picked up and held suspended within the vortex.
Suspended creatures move with the uthul. A
creature can attempt to escape by spending an
action to attempt a DC 32 Reﬂex save (or a DC 32
Acrobatics check to maneuver in ﬂight if it has a
ﬂy Speed). Upon escaping, or when the uthul
transforms back into its storm cloud form, a
suspended creature is hurled 1d4 × 10 feet in
a random direction, then falls unless it can ﬂy
or otherwise remain aloft. After returning to
its normal form, the uthul must wait 1 minute
before it can use Whirlwind Form again.
