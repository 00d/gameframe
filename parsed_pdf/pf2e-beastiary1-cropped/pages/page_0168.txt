BUILDING GHOSTS
Note that the ghost mage is built
from the ground up, rather than by
applying the ghost rules to a once-
living creature, so its numbers
don’t exactly match the values
listed above. This is usually the
better way to go if you have the
time, as it allows you to hand-craft
a ghost for the situation.
the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the
object’s square and can’t Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds.
Malevolent Possession ʚʖ The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal
creature. This has the same eﬀect as the possession spell, except since the ghost
doesn’t have a physical body, it is unaﬀected by that restriction of the spell.
Telekinetic Assault ʚʖ (divine, evocation) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as
small objects and debris ﬂy about in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures in this area take
1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 per 2 levels, subject to a basic Reﬂex save.
Ghost commoner
The ghost commoner is an ordinary person who believes they died unjustly,
usually due to foul play or betrayal.
