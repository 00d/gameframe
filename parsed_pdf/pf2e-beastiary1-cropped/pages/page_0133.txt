Jungle Drake
Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters
equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or
their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that
allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in ﬂight
and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run
tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their
victims off to ﬁnish their meals as they please.

DRAKE HUNTERS

is diﬃcult to resist for many
adventurers, but accomplishing
such a task is fraught with peril.

been known to instead hunt drakes
and use trophies harvested from
these creatures to deceive locals.
