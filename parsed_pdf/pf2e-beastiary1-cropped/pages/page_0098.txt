DINOSAUR RESOURCES
As animals, dinosaurs have little
interest in treasure (although
velociraptors and deinonychuses,
like their bird cousins, enjoy
keeping sparkling baubles in
their nests), but the remains of
adventurers strewn about their
lairs often still have valuable gear.
Dinosaurs can also be harvested
for rare and valuable trophies such
as teeth, talons, armor plates, and
the like.

Ankylosaurus
Squat, heavily armored quadrupeds, ankylosauruses are stubborn and irascible.
Although they’re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that
trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.
Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in
spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures
from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone,
which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these
low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their
relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An
ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over
3 tons.
The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called
ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller
dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and
are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively
muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an
ankylosaurus’s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others
that is not a wild creature.
