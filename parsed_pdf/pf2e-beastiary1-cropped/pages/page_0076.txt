Most who dwell in the Darklands
are sinister and cruel. While deep
gnomes are not, those who seek
their aid should remember that
they don’t welcome strangers
with open arms. In the brutal
Darklands, such traits are seized
upon by its denizens and treated
as much as weaknesses as
they are strengths.
