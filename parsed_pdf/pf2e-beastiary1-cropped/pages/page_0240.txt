FROM A GODʼS
NIGHTMARES
The ﬁrst mukradis are rumored
to have spawned in the fevered
nightmares of a sleeping demigod
from a dimension beyond dreams,
who perished as the ﬁrst mukradis
hollowed out its unconscious mind
and used its ﬂesh to transition into
the mortal realm. This legend is
likely nothing more than fancy, but
it certainly speaks to the deadly
nature of these immense monsters.
Mukradi
Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a
devastating array of breath weapons. A Darklands version of the mukradi is rumored
to exist. It’s said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew
a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.

Partitioned Anatomy Ȳ˓ Trigger The mukradi would be confused, paralyzed, slowed, or
stunned. Eﬀect The mukradi conﬁnes the debilitating eﬀect to a certain portion of its
nervous system, ignoring the eﬀect but causing a maw of its choice to go dormant for
the eﬀect’s duration. That maw can’t be used for a Strike or Breath Weapon during that
time. This ability can’t be used if all the mukradi’s heads are dormant.
Spitting Rage Ǻȓ Trigger A creature scores a critical hit on the mukradi. Eﬀect The
mukradi’s Breath Weapon recharges. It can use its Breath Weapon immediately
as part of this reaction. It canʼt use this reaction again until it recharges its Breath
Weapon naturally.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, primal) The mukradi breathes a blast of energy from
one of its three heads; each creature in the area must attempt a DC 36 basic
Reﬂex save. The mukradi can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Acid Maw (acid) 10-foot-wide, 60-foot line of acid dealing 16d6
acid damage.
•	 Flame Maw (ﬁre) 60-foot cone of ﬁre dealing 16d6 ﬁre damage.
•	 Shock Maw (electricity) 120-foot line of electricity dealing
16d6 electricity damage.
Pull Apart ʚʖ The mukradi makes two Strikes with diﬀerent
maws against the same target. If both hit, the target takes
an extra 2d12+13 slashing damage, with a DC 36 basic
Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the creature
is torn to pieces and dies. The mukradiʼs
multiple attack penalty increases
only after all the attacks are made.
Thrash ʚʖ The mukradi Strikes
once against each creature in its
reach. It can Strike up to once with
each maw, once with its tail lash,
and any number of times with its legs.
Each attack takes a –2 circumstance
penalty
and
counts
toward
the
mukradi's multiple attack penalty,
but the multiple attack penalty
doesn’t increase until after all
the attacks are made.
