GRIM REAPER TREASURE
The grim reaper keeps no treasure,
but sometimes lesser deaths hang
on to strange keepsakes from
those whom they have slain—
especially in cases where a lesser
death has set its unholy sight on
an extended family or faction.
Speed 50 feet, ﬂy 75 feet
Melee Ȱɵ keen scythe +40 (agile, deadly 3d10, magical, reach 10 feet, trip), Damage
4d10+23 slashing plus death strike and energy drain
Divine Innate Spells DC 47, attack +37; 10th ﬁnger of death (×4); 7th plane shift; Constant
(6th) true seeing; (3rd) haste; (2nd) see invisibility
Death Strike (death) A creature critically hit by any of the grim reaper’s attacks or that
critically fails against any of its spells must succeed at a DC 47 Fortitude save or die.
Energy Drain When the grim reaper hits and deals damage with its scythe, it regains 20 Hit
Points, and the target must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or become doomed 1. If the
target is already doomed, the doomed value increases by 1 (to a maximum of doomed 3).
Final Death A creature killed by the grim reaper can’t be brought back to life by any
means short of divine intervention.
Infuse Weapon (divine, evocation) Any scythe gains the agile trait, can’t be disarmed,
and becomes a +3 major striking keen scythe while the grim reaper wields it. If the
grim reaper Strikes a creature with a weakness to any speciﬁc type of damage, the
scythe’s damage counts as that type of damage, in addition to slashing.
Lesser Death
No one is quite sure what lesser deaths are, though some
claim that they are avatars of the grim reaper. Unlike that
strange hunter, however, lesser deaths hunt in packs on
rare occasions. More often than not, they manifest from
cursed magic items. Other times, they are just the enactors
of death, hunting in the same way the grim reaper does—
silently, with neither remorse nor quarter. Rarely, multiple
lesser deaths work together to cull a large population, their
scythes cutting through crowds and leaving entire cities
devoid of life, inspiring (hopefully) false rumors of
multiple grim reapers.
