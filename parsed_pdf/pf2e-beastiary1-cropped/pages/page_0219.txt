ASSOCIATED MONSTERS
Because of their relative frailty,
leaf leshys frequently act as
liaisons and call upon more
powerful forest guardians when
their domains are threatened.
Nymphs, sprites, and other goodly
fey may respond to the call of a
leaf leshy, as do arboreals and
other plant creatures.
Leshy
Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or
earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled
practitioner of primal magic—typically a druid—combines a nature spirit with
a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required
to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given
life in an area of great natural signiﬁcance, such as an arboreal’s grove, a druidic
circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder.
Leaf Leshy
Leaf leshys are diminutive protectors of forests clad in pine cone armor and hats
of fruit, ﬂowers, or leaves. They enjoy mock battles but act cautiously in real ones.

Verdant Burst (healing) When a leaf leshy dies, a burst of primal
energy explodes from its body, restoring 1d4 Hit Points to each plant
creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area is ﬁlled with tree saplings,
becoming diﬃcult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment
for these trees, they wither after 24 hours.

Glide Ȱɵ (move) The leshy glides gently through the air, moving
5 feet toward the ground and up to 25 feet forward. As long
as the leshy spends at least 1 action gliding each round, it
remains in the air at the end of each turn. For the purpose of
determining damage from falls, a leaf leshy always treats falls
as if they were 20 feet shorter.
Gourd Leshy
Gourd leshys are guardians of ﬁelds, gardens, and
farms. Many villages beneﬁt from the protection of a
gourd leshy, even if they are unaware of it.
