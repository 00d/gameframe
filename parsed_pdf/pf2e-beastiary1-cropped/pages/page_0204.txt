Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The night
hag can take on the appearance of any Medium female humanoid. This
doesn’t change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her
Strikes, but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically
to bludgeoning).
Dream Haunting (enchantment, occult, mental) If a night hag is
ethereal and hovering over a sleeping chaotic or evil creature,
she can ride the victim’s back until dawn. The creature
endures tormenting dreams as the hag casts nightmare on
it, and is exposed to abyssal plague. Any drained caused
by dream haunting is cumulative. Only an ethereal being
can confront the night hag and stop her dream haunting.
Spell Ambush A creature ﬂat-footed to the night hag takes a
–2 circumstance penalty to checks and DCs to defend against
her spells.

twice per day.
