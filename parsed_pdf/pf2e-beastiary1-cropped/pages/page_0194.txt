GREMLIN “TREASURE”
All gremlins are hoarders, and their
nests are cluttered with objects
both valuable and worthless.
Sorting through a gremlin nest can
reveal unexpected treasures like
pieces of jewelry or minor magic
items, but care must also be taken
to avoid being cut on rusty shards
of metal, picking up cursed items,
or disturbing a hidden nest of
venomous vermin.

Jinkin
Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great
pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and
create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as
when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to
wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and
murder, though they prefer to lead
victims into traps designed to capture
or incapacitate rather than kill outright.
Deep pits are favorites, since victims
who survive the fall face a slow death from
starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering
at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

Sneak Attack The jinkin deals 1d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Tinker (curse, primal, transmutation) A group of six jinkins can work together
for an hour to imbue an item with a curse at a range of 60 feet. While this
process is lengthy, it’s also unobtrusive and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins
prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC
5 flat check or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds
a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a
similar caliber.
