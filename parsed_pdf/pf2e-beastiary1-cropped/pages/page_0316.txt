TROLL AUGURS
Particularly devout trolls, called
augurs, claim to possess the
so-called “gift of sight,” which
they believe was granted them
by the demon lord Urxehl. Augurs
practice a disturbing method of
future-telling, in which a troll
slashes open its own abdomen and
pulls out its entrails to interpret the
prophecies in its quivering innards.
Other cultists prod and agitate their
gutted diviner to keep it conscious
throughout the gruesome ordeal.
well beyond the typical life expectancy for their kind and rally others to follow
their lead. These champions develop a number of talents that make them
worthy leaders and potent hunters—namely their abilities to willingly boost
the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and ﬁre that would
hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators
scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin—
they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll
king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it,
retribution is swift and fatal.
