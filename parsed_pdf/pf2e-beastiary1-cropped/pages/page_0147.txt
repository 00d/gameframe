ELEMENTAL LORDS
The most powerful elementals are
demigods known as elemental
lords. Until recently, only four evil
elemental lords ruled over realms
on the Elemental Planes. However,
recent events have allowed the
previously imprisoned good
elemental lords to return to their
realms, causing massive conﬂicts
that could lead to planar wars.
