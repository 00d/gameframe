Kolyarut
Kolyarut inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail
to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a
humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable
inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among
the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an
encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts
in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.

Pleroma
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation
of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is
a constant state of ﬂux between these two poles, their forms a shifting
cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects ﬂit in and out of
existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature,
self-contained universe.
Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and
malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They
believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this
essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of
the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

Envisioning Pleromas care little for communication with other creatures,
but when they do convey information, they do so wordlessly through a
series of psychic projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100
feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have
a language, though the aeon’s meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often
mysterious. An aeon can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly with any other
aeon on the same plane as itself.
INEVITABLE FATES
The fact that the aeons known
as inevitables seem to be on the
decline is taken by some planar
scholars as metaphysical proof
that entropy is on the rise and the
Great Beyond is past its prime and
on the way to the end of this cycle
of reality.
