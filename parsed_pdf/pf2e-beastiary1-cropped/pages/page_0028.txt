ARCHON LOCATIONS
While commonly found in Heaven,
archons can also be encountered
on the ﬁendish planes in their
endless crusade against evil. On
the Material Plane they are usually
encountered as advisors or saviors
to those in need.
Horned Archon
Horned archons are secretive and tireless sentinels and scouts, patrolling the Outer
Sphere’s untamed wilds for evil to eliminate and keeping small communities safe from
demons, devils, and worse. They resemble muscular humans with the head, horns,
and legs of a stag. When requested to do so by their patrons, especially Erastil, they
journey to the Material Plane and patrol dangerous frontier areas, secretly performing
acts of kindness such as leading hunters to food, helping lost children, and driving off
evil creatures. Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons
are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.

Menacing Guardian (aura, divine, enchantment) 30 feet. Enemies that start their
turn in the area or enter it must attempt a DC 19 Will save. On a failure, they
take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls, spell rolls, and damage rolls against
any other target while in the aura for 24 hours or until they damage the archon,
whichever comes ﬁrst. On a critical failure, they can’t use hostile actions
against any other target while in the area for 24 hours or until they
damage the archon, whichever comes ﬁrst. Regardless of the
result, a creature is then temporarily immune to further
menacing guardian auras for 24 hours.

Retributive Strike with its composite longbow.

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another
creature cast dimension door, it can cast an innate
dimension door (heightened to 5th level) within 1 round
to attempt to follow that creature to the maximum distance
of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s dimension
door has enough distance, the archon appears the same
distance and direction from the creature as before
either used dimension door.
Touch of Charity Ȱɵ (healing, manipulate,
necromancy) A horned archon can touch
another creature to take on that creature’s
wounds, transferring up to 30 of the
horned archon’s HP to the touched
creature.
The
horned
archon
can’t transfer more HP than it
currently has.
