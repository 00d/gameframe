“CIVILIZED” ELEMENTALS
Some elementals, such as invisible
stalkers, xorns, and salamanders,
have speciﬁc cultures and
personalities that elevate them
beyond simple magical creatures
or manifestations of living
energy. These creatures are often
found in larger settlements or
living alongside genies on their
respective planes.

Melee Ȱɵ tail +17 (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage 1d8+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 fire
and Grab
Armor of Flames Ȱɵ The salamander stokes its internal ﬂames. Until the start of its next
turn, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, and when an adjacent creature touches it
or hits it with a physical attack, that creature takes 2d6 persistent ﬁre damage unless
it succeeds at a DC 25 Reﬂex save.
