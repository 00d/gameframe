GUTHALLATH SLUMBER
Entire civilizations have been
swept oﬀ the face of Golarion due
to the devastating rampage of a
guthallath. But there is a light at
the end of the tunnel, for after
some time the guthallath ends its
massacre in a swift yet seemingly
random way. The colossus then
ﬁnds a remote location deep in the
wilderness, where it buries itself,
entering a deep slumber for years—
if not centuries—before awakening
and beginning the destructive cycle
once more.
Guthallath
A guthallath is an enormous construct created long ago by some unknown empire,
probably as a war machine. Nearly 100 feet tall, this massive stone statue typically
resembles a stalwart warrior wearing only a loincloth and skullcap. Few have seen
the entire body of a guthallath, though; most of the time such a relic is buried up to its
neck, covered in moss and stranded in some forgotten place. Yet, every so often, one
of these harbingers of destruction reactivates in response to some unknown stimulus
or rallying call, and when this happens, woe be unto any who stand in its way.
While the guthallath’s ancient enemies are gone, it is an engine of pure destruction,
designed to rampage for weeks or even months. While not intelligent enough to enjoy
or regret its acts, the guthallath cannot be reasoned with—it is unaffected by most
magic, and is unpredictable in how it selects its targets (and creatures it spares).

Erosion Aura (aura, primal) 120 feet. The guthallath erodes away the physical integrity
of all around it. Creatures and objects in the emanation other than the guthallath have
their hardness and resistances reduced by 10. At the start of its turn, a creature in the
erosion aura's area takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage (basic Fortitude DC 39).

activated eﬀects of magic items of lower than 14th level.

Annihilation Beams ʚʖ A guthallath releases two beams of destruction from
its eyes. Each beam is a 120-foot line.
Everything in either line takes the
eﬀect of a hit from a 10th-level
disintegrate spell (DC 41 Fortitude).
There is no additional eﬀect on
creatures in any area where the
beams overlap. The guthallath can’t
use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.
Deadly Throw Ȱɵ Requirements The
guthallath has a creature grabbed.
Eﬀect The guthallath throws the
creature into the air, 100 feet high and
50 feet away. If the ﬂung creature lands on
another creature, the creature it lands on takes
the same amount of bludgeoning damage. The
creature being landed on can attempt a DC 41
basic Reﬂex save.
Powerful Blows If a guthallath hits with an
attack and rolls a natural 19 on the d20 roll,
the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if
the 19 would be a failure.
