FIENDISH RELATIONS
Devils view daemonsʼ constant
hunt for souls as a short-sighted
waste of potential, and demonsʼ
chaotic destruction of society
and ﬂesh as uncivilized and
obnoxious, but they do not loathe
their ﬁendish counterparts.
Indeed, most devils are more
than willing to take advantage
of daemons and demons as they
can to further their
own machinations.
Barbazu (Bearded Devil)
Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous ﬁends
who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s
armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into
battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inﬂict jagged gashes that resist
healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too
close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver
a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s
strength being slowly devoured from within.
Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords
from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they
disseminate murder, misery, and anguish
as they see ﬁt.

Infernal Wound (divine, necromancy) A bearded devil’s glaive Strike also deals 1d6
persistent bleed damage that resists attempts to heal it. The ﬂat check to stop the
bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or
an ally successfully assists with the recovery.
The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal
wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to
use healing magic on a creature suﬀering from an infernal
wound must succeed at a DC 21 counteract check or the
magic fails to heal the creature.
Reposition Ȳ˓ Trigger The devil hits a creature with a glaive
Strike. Eﬀect The devil moves the creature 5 feet in any
direction. The destination square must be within reach of the
devil’s glaive. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
Wriggling Beard Ȱɵ Frequency once per round. Eﬀect The barbazu makes a beard
Strike. This Strike ignores their multiple attack penalty and doesn’t count toward
that penalty.
