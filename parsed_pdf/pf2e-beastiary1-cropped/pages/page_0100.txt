PRIMEVAL LANDS
Dinosaurs ﬁt well into certain
types of settings. They’re
often found in isolated lands
like primeval jungle valleys or
plateaus—regions known as lost
worlds for their inaccessibility
and lack of any encroaching
civilization. In addition to
dinosaurs, other megafauna
can exist in these places as
well, along with giant insects or
aggressive creatures like bulettes,
carnivorous plants, chuuls, and
drakes. Such regions can make for
perilous and intriguing adventure
sites, especially if you combine
them with ruins of ancient
civilizations to explore once the
party has navigated the hostile
wilderness regions.
against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and
obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a ﬁght unless they are
hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to ﬁght to the death for
no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts
for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs’
protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.
Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as
ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses
have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.

Brontosaurus
Brontosauruses are truly gigantic
behemoths, plodding herbivores
large enough to be unafraid of all
but the most massive predators.
Brontosauruses have stout bodies
and long, sinuous necks ending in
small heads, allowing them to graze
from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally
as long as their necks and provide counterbalances.
Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs.
Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings,
these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of
where they step.
Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending
themselves or their young, or when panicked enough
to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the
creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep
in great arcs and their massive feet crash down
heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70
feet long and weighs more than 30 tons.
