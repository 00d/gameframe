HOLLOW WORLDS
Another classic place that
dinosaurs are found in ﬁction are
in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign
settings might not contain entire
isolated worlds within them, but
many, such as Golarion, have
expansive underground lands. The
deepest region of the Darklands
of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is
an optimal place to ﬁnd a hollow
world. Typically infused with magic
that allows for jungles to grow
deep underground (and sometimes
even sunlike orbs that illuminate
the lands from above, simulating
a day‑night cycle), areas such as
Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect
places for dinosaurs to roam.
Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of
which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these
dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it’s likely that even larger
behemoths exist.

Tail Sweep ʚʖ The brontosaurus makes a tail Strike and compares the attack roll to the
AC of up to three foes, each of whom must be within its tail’s melee reach and adjacent
to at least one other target. It rolls damage only once and applies it to each creature
hit. A Tail Sweep counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.

Tyrannosaurus
Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive
predator with a wide mouth ﬁlled with viciously sharp teeth. Thundering
beasts of fury and hunger, tyrannosauruses are bold and fearless carnivores
that eagerly bite off great hunks of large prey and swallow smaller prey—such
as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on
carrion, tyrannosaurs prefer live prey.
Tyrannosauruses stand on two wide, powerful
hind legs that allow them to run quickly,
and their thick tails provide them with
