ADAMANTINE GOLEMS
The incredible amount of
adamantine necessary to create
a single adamantine golem is
worth more than many nations’
treasuries. The powerful heart
of an adamantine golem can be
turned into a legendary forge for
blacksmithing.
ADAMANTINE GOLEM
CREATURE 18
RARE
N
HUGE
CONSTRUCT
GOLEM
MINDLESS
Perception +26; darkvision
Skills Athletics +38
Str +9, Dex –1, Con +9, Int –5, Wis +0, Cha –5
AC 42; Fort +33, Ref +27, Will +29
HP 255, repair mode; Immunities bleed, death eﬀects, disease, doomed, drained,
fatigued, ﬁre, healing, magic (see below), mental, necromancy, nonlethal attacks,
paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious; Resistances physical 20 (except vorpal
adamantine)
Golem Antimagic harmed by acid (9d10, 2d10 from areas or persistent damage);
healed by ﬁre (area 2d10 HP); slowed by electricity
Repair Mode When the adamantine golem is at 0 HP, it isn’t destroyed. Instead,
it enters repair mode, during which it is slowed 1, can’t take reactions, and can
take only the Self-Repair action. Once it has more than 30 HP, it can use any type
of action and can use reactions, though it remains slowed 1 and can’t take any
reactions until the start of its next turn. If a critical hit with an adamantine vorpal
weapon reduces the golem to 0 HP, or if such a weapon hits it while it’s already at
0 HP, then the golem is destroyed.
Vulnerable to Dispelling The golem can be targeted by disjunction and dispel magic.
If targeted by such a spell of 9th level or higher, the golem has its resistance to
physical damage lowered to 15 and is slowed 1 (or slowed 2 if in repair mode) for
1d4 rounds. During this time, if the golem is reduced to 0 HP while
already in repair mode, it is destroyed.
Speed 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ fist +35 (deadly 3d12, magical, reach 15 feet),
Damage 3d10+17 bludgeoning plus destructive
strike
Destructive Strike On a critical hit, the adamantine
golem’s fist Strike breaks the target’s armor,
if any, in addition to dealing damage to the
target. If the target has a shield raised,
the golem breaks the shield instead.
Inexorable March Ȱɵ The adamantine
golem Strides up to its Speed,
pushing back each creature
whose space it moves into and
damaging them if they try to
stop its movement. A creature can
try to bar the way by attempting a DC 45
Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature takes no damage
and its armor takes no damage.
Success The golem halts its movement and
cannot enter the creature’s square.
Failure The resisting creature is damaged
and its armor takes damage as if hit by
the adamantine golem’s ﬁst.
Self-Repair
Ȱɵ
(manipulate)
The
golem repairs itself, regaining 30
Hit Points.
Vent Ȱɵ (fire) The golem vents a 30-
foot cone of superheated steam from
its internal forge. This deals 15d6 fire
damage to all creatures in the cone (DC
40 basic Reflex). The golem can't use Vent
again for 1d6 rounds.
