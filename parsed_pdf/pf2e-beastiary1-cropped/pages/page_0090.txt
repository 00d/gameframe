DIABOLIC LOCATIONS
The nine layers of Hell are the
planar home of all devils, and
they much prefer its tyrannically
ordered environs to anywhere else
in the multiverse. Yet devils can
be encountered anywhere mortals
can be tempted by infernal
bargains or seek diabolic aid. On
Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is
particularly aligned with Hell. Its
government is based upon Hellʼs
organization, and the state church
is that of Asmodeus.
Erinys (Fury Devil)
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing
and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape
of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the ﬁrst erinyes shared
that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser
devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of
torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a
fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The ﬁrst erinyes were all
considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that
time are no longer limited to a single gender.

Furious Fusillade ̂ˬ The erinys hovers in place if they are
ﬂying and ﬁres one arrow at any number of creatures in a
30‑foot cone. Each attack is rolled separately. This counts as
one attack for the purpose of the erinys’s multiple attack penalty.
Rope Snare An erinys carries a coil of rope woven of their hair (use
the statistics for rope) that animates in their hands. When a creature is
hit by the erinys’s rope, a segment of the rope tears loose and wraps itself
around the creature, imposing a 10–foot circumstance penalty to Speed. The
piece that tears oﬀ is 10 feet long for a Medium or smaller creature, and doubles in
length for each size larger than Medium. When a creature Escapes the eﬀect (DC 26),
the detached segment of rope withers away into useless black sludge.
Phistophilus (Contract Devil)
Contract devils are clerks, scribes, and bureaucrats of Hell rarely found outside
the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts,
tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly
desires. If a target is desirable enough, a phistophilus can offer contracts for
