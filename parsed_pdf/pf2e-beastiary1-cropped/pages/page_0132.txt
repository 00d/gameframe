DRAKE TREASURE
Drakes share dragon’s interest
in treasure, but lack dragons’
discerning taste. A drake hoard
will certainly contain coins,
jewelry, gemstones, gear, and
even the odd magic item or
two, but the bulk of the hoard
invariably consists of broken
weapons, shiny rocks, bits of
junk, and other doubtful
pieces of refuse.
River Drake
Although the glistening scales and sleek, ﬁn-like wings on these drakes give them
an appearance reminiscent of river ﬁsh, they are actually distant relatives of the
black dragon. While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable
of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water’s
surface. This ﬂexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from ﬁsh and
boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.

Tail Lash Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within reach of the river drake’s tail uses an action

Caustic Mucus ʚʖ (acid, arcane, evocation) The river
drake spits a ball of caustic mucus up to a range
of 50 feet that explodes in a 10-foot burst.
Creatures within the burst take 4d6 acid
damage (DC 19 basic Reﬂex save). Those that
fail this save also take 1d6 persistent acid
damage and take a –5-foot status penalty to
their Speed. This Speed reduction ends with
the persistent acid damage. The river drake
can’t use Caustic Mucus again for 1d6 rounds.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ The river drake makes one
fangs Strike and two tail Strikes in any order.
Speed Surge Ȱɵ (move) The river drake moves up to
twice its Speed. It can do this three times per day.
Flame Drake
The distant kin of red dragons, ﬂame drakes thankfully
lack the intelligence and ambition of their larger cousins,
but are no less territorial or violent. Flame drakes dwell
near volcanoes and magma, but it’s not unheard of for
one to drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills.
Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky
blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.
