Bat
A wide range of bats dwell throughout the world. Most of these nocturnal animals
are harmless insectivores, but deadly breeds of vampire bats and oversized bats
the size of horses pose much more signiﬁcant threats to adventurers.
Vampire Bat Swarm
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose
a signiﬁcant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can
feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats
is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of
inﬂicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short
span of time.

Giant Bat
While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins
and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true
monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15
feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear
or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors
of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive
animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like
other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals.
They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids,
commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or
underground regions.

BAT LOCATIONS
Vampire bat swarms roost in
colonies wherever they can
ﬁnd shelter from weather, light,
and predators, favoring caves,
trees, and narrow gorges. Giant
bats prefer to dwell in smaller
numbers in deep caves, abandoned
mines, or the attics of abandoned
buildings. Even larger species
dwell in the deeper regions of
the Darklands, where they are
often used as mounts, or even
ritualistically slaughtered and then
animated as specialized undead
guardians of eerie underground
cities and nations.
