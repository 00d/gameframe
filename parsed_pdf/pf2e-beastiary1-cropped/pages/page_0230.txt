OTHER GIANT LIZARDS
The three species of giant lizard
presented here are but the most
common of their kind encountered
in the wilds. Stories of much
larger lizards persist, including
the immense, 20-foot-long
monster known as a megalania,
a truly enormous version of the
giant monitor lizard capable of
swallowing creatures whole. Less
dangerous is the giant chameleon,
although its ability to blend into
its environs makes it a much more
insidious and stealthy threat than
the lumbering, mighty megalania.

Giant Frilled Lizard
Found in warm and tropical forests and savannas, these immense lizards are a
deadly threat to the unsuspecting traveler. When they aren’t sleeping or stalking
prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers
sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their
large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show
of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and
ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures
too large to eat.
A giant frilled lizard’s primary food sources are oversized
arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won’t hesitate to
augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards,
monkeys, and just about anything it can ﬁt into its
mouth—even humanoids. Although capable of short
bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies
perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush
its prey.

Intimidating Display ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental,
visual) The giant frilled lizard Strides. If it ends that
Stride adjacent to at least one other creature, it
suddenly displays its colorful neck frills and issues
a frightening hiss. Each adjacent creature must
succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become frightened
2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). The creature
is then temporarily immune to Intimidating Display for
1 minute.
