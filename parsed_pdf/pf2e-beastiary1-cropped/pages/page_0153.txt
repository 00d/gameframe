OTHER ELEMENTALS
When energies from elemental
planes mix, unusual elemental life
can form. The combination of ﬁre
and earth, for example, can spawn
magma elementals, while air and
water can create ice elementals.
Lightning elementals form from a
conjunction of ﬁre and air, while
water and earth give birth to mud
elementals. It’s possible that in
the vastness of the Great Beyond,
even more unusual elementals
might exist, although they are as
rare as they are strange.
Elemental, Water
Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as
water can bring life to those in need on the Material Plane, its waves can pound
shores and rains can ﬂood cities. Water elementals are similarly difﬁcult to predict.
Brine Shark
Brine sharks are deadly elementals that roam the endless oceans of the Plane of Water.
