BOAR RESOURCES
A boar’s carcass typically provides
enough meat for 100 meals or
more, as well as hide and bristles
that can be used for crafting.
Boar
While domesticated pigs are a staple of farm life, wild boars are much more
dangerous. Foul-tempered warthogs are relatively common, while the lumbering,
primeval beasts known as daeodons are less so. Voracious eaters, boars can
ravage the countryside in which they live. Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars
can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as
they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.
Boar
Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered
a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or
during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra
inch of tissue to protect their organs as they ﬁght off rivals. Of course, in some
cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can ﬁll the
roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they
can become true terrors of the region.

Daeodon
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the
towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although
omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar)
prefers to feed on ﬂesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse
to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or
to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds.
Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as
mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on
daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at
the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

A Medium or smaller creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Reﬂex
save or be knocked prone by the force of the blow.
BOAR LOCATIONS
Boars can be found in almost
any environment, from forests to
deserts, warm or cold, including
even high-altitude mountainous
regions. They tend to prefer
forests, marshes, and meadows.
Daeodons are likewise found
in such regions but generally
prefer remote reaches far from
civilization.
