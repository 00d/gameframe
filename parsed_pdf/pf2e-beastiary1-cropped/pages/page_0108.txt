DEYRUBRUJAN
Responsible for destroying three
separate villages in Avistan after
a lengthy raid to seek hidden
information, this great wyrm blue
dragon maintains a fortress lair in
the desert nation of Thuvia. Called
Hidden Nest, Deyrubrujan’s lair
is a factory where Usij cultists
manufacture all manner of
potions, drugs, and poisons, while
ultimately seeking a way to make
a counterfeit Sun Orchid Elixir.
Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They
make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in
battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to
destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their
desert lairs.
The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and
secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in
comfort—but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can
come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions
conceal the ediﬁce from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a
blue dragon’s true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel—
expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.
