not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of
gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few
grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the
end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make
such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new
abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests,
the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations
that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon
their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options
detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for
barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with
new mutations of your own design.

Mutations The process of consuming corpses to
evolve into a greater barghest results in odd and
unpredictable physiological changes. A greater
barghest has one mutation, typically chosen from
the following options.
•	 Fangs (poison) The barghest grows elongated fangs
that seep poison. Its jaws deal 1d6 additional poison
damage and 1d6 persistent poison damage.
•	 Toxic Breath ʚʖ (divine, evocation, poison) The
barghest breathes a cloud of toxic gas that deals 8d6
poison damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC 25
basic Fortitude save). It can’t use Toxic Breath again for
1d4 rounds.
•	 Vestigial Arm Strike Ȳ˓ Frequency once
per round; Trigger The barghest completes
a Strike. Eﬀect The barghest makes a claw
Strike with a shriveled third arm hanging
from its torso. This attack doesn’t count for the
barghest’s multiple attack penalty, nor does
that penalty apply on
the attack.
•	 Wings The barghest
has malformed wings
extending
from
its
back. It gains a ﬂy Speed
of 25 feet.
BARGHEST CULTS
The barghest hero-gods may
be the only ones of their kind
capable of granting spells to
their clerics, but the idea of
adoring worshippers appeals to
all barghests. A barghest that
completes its transformation into
a greater barghest, and thus is no
longer morbidly distracted by its
hunger, often plays the role of a
deity to ignorant groups of goblins
or other monsters. To them, the
fact that the barghest can’t grant
spells is irrelevant—rather, their
veneration is due the fact that
worshipping the barghest is the
best way to keep it from devouring
the entire tribe.
