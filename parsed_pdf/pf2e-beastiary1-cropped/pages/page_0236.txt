MERFOLK’S SECRET
Some sailors claim that merfolk
face a grave threat—a dark
and sinister power capable of
rendering even the most beautiful
merfolk into a degenerate and
mutated wretch. Such stories
often end with claims that the
merfolk, proud and noble as they
seem, are unwitting puppets to
some unknown entity lurking
in the deepest depths of the
seas. Merfolk themselves are
characteristically tight-lipped
about such claims.
Merfolk
Elegant, mysterious, and graceful; all this and more can be said of the merfolk.
These enigmatic people resemble humanoids with delicate features from the waist
up but with the ﬁns and tail of a massive ﬁsh from the waist down. Found in
nearly all of Golarion’s oceans, merfolk are as varied in appearance as humans,
their skin ranging from pale to umber and all shades in between, while their
gleaming scales shimmer with the majesty of the sea.
Merfolk Warrior
Merfolk warriors form the bulk of the militias of their vast underwater realms
and meet potential aggressors head-on with uncompromising force.
