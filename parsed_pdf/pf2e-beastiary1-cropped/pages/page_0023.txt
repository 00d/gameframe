Ankhrav
Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by
inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.
Ankhrav
These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like
cities, but ankhravs’ predilection for livestock and humanoid ﬂesh ensures that
the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers
whose ﬁelds become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek
the aid of adventurers.

Hive Mother
Ankhrav hive mothers are fearsome predators that one can easily distinguish
from the typical ankhrav not only by their greater size, but the presence of a
large pair of razor-sharp, mantis-like arms.

Frenzy Pheromone ʚʖ The hive mother unleashes a
pheromone that causes all other ankhravs within a 100-foot
emanation to become quickened 1 until the start of the hive
mother’s next turn, and they can use the extra action only
for Burrow, Stride, or Strike actions. The hive mother
can’t unleash the pheromone again for 1d4 rounds.

in a 60-foot cone, dealing 8d6 acid damage and 1d6

ANKHRAV BURROWS
As if the appearance of a hungry
ankhrav in a stretch of farmland
isn’t bad enough, it almost always
indicates the proximity of an
ankhrav hive nearby. A disturbing
number of ankhravs can infest
a lair. However, adventurers
brave enough to crawl through
the tangled burrows are often
rewarded with large amounts of
treasure as ankhravs have a habit
of dragging their victims back
to the deepest corners of their
den to feast, usually discarding
the remains with most of the
gear intact.
