RISEN FROM THE GRAVE
Zombies are often created using
unwholesome necromantic rituals.
Among the living dead, zombies are
most often used as fodder, wearing
down defenses and consuming
resources before more powerful
undead arrive to deal the killing
blow. Zombies cannot speak or
really even think for themselves,
but they can be commanded by
other allied undead and
powerful necromancers.

Corpse Throwing A zombie hulk can throw corpses at foes. While
any Medium dead body will do, they sometimes throw zombie
shamblers, who take just as much damage from being thrown as
the target they hit. A thrown shambler lands prone, but if it’s not
destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally.
Wide Swing Ȱɵ The zombie hulk makes a hunk of meat Strike and
compares the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes, each
of whom must be within the Strike’s reach. This attack counts
as two attacks for the zombie hulk’s multiple attack penalty.
