Crimson Worm
Among the most dangerous cave worms are the ﬁery crimson worms. In addition
to being even larger than azure or purple worms, the crimson worm has a penchant
for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused
it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The molten heart of an
active volcano is an attractive lair for a crimson worm, as are the sprawling ﬁelds
of bubbling magma found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends from
ancient peoples, precursor dwarven societies, and colonists of the Elemental
Planes populated moats of lava with crimson worms likely have some basis in
truth, although the methods such ancients used to keep these “moat worms”
contained and prevented them from chewing their way through fortress
foundations must have been signiﬁcant.
Crimson worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism
creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer
to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending
search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by crimson worms are notable for
the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.
NOTORIOUS WORMS
Some societies view the immense
cave worms as natural disasters
or incarnations of wrathful gods.
Cave worms that have been active
in a region often become part of
that area’s local lore. For example,
in the notorious Cinderlands of
eastern Varisia, Shoanti have
long told tales of Cindermaw, an
immense crimson worm viewed
by some as worthy of worship,
and by others as the ultimate test
of bravery.
