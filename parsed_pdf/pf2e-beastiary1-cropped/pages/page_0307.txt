ASSOCIATED MONSTERS
Though they are vermin incapable
of forming true alliances, spiders
show up alongside many types
of creatures, including web
lurkers (page 325). Spellcasters
sometimes call upon spiders
using summon animal, and spider
swarms have a way of popping up
just about anywhere at the most
inopportune times.
Spider
Few everyday vermin inspire as much dread as the infamous spider.
Spider Swarm
An abundance of food, the sudden hatching of a clutch of eggs, or magical
inﬂuence can cause smaller spiders to gather in terrifying, deadly masses.
