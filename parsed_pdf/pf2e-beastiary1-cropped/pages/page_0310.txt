VARIANT PIXIE ARROWS
Pixies can enchant their
arrows with a wide variety of
eﬀects, though nearly all such
enchantments are designed to
charm or bewilder, never maim.
Some arrows may emulate the
eﬀects of spells such as confusion,
fear, hideous laughter, and
even suggestion.
Ranged Ȱɵ dissonant note +9 (evocation, magical, range 30 feet, sonic), Damage 1d8 sonic
Primal Innate Spells DC 18; 2nd glitterdust, invisibility (self only); 1st illusory disguise;
Cantrips (2nd) ghost sound
Fiddle Ȱɵ (auditory, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A grig can rub its legs
together to create a catchy ﬁddling tune that compels others within 30 feet to dance
about, with varying eﬀects depending on a DC 18 Will save. A listener is temporarily
immune for 10 minutes on a success, but otherwise, if the grig continues to Fiddle
each round, the creature receives no additional saves.
Success No eﬀect.
Failure Flat-footed and –10-foot status penalty to Speeds.
Critical Failure As failure, and also slowed 1.
Pixie
Insatiably curious, overly excitable, and just a bit puckish,
pixies are wanderers and tricksters who use their pixie
dust to create all sorts of whimsical situations, as well as
to defend themselves. Other creatures often have trouble
understanding a pixie’s rapid, rambling way of speaking.

Sprinkle Pixie Dust Ȱɵ (manipulate) The pixie
sprinkles pixie dust onto one of its arrows.
If the pixie hits a creature with that
arrow before the pixie’s next
turn, the arrow inﬂicts one of
the following special eﬀects instead of dealing damage.
Each eﬀect depends on the target’s DC 21 Will save. On
a critical hit, the target treats its save result as one
degree worse.
•	 Charm (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation,
mental) The target suﬀers the eﬀects of a charm spell, except it doesn’t gain a
bonus to its save if the only hostile act was the pixie ﬁring its bow, and the pixie can
choose to direct the target’s adoration toward another creature rather than itself.
•	 Memory Loss (divination, mental) On a failed Will save, the target loses the last 5
minutes of its memory.
•	 Sleep (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, sleep) The target suﬀers the eﬀects of
a 3rd-level sleep spell.
•	 Subdual (enchantment, mental, nonlethal) The target takes 4d6 mental damage,
depending on its basic Will save.
