SACRED STINGERS
Wasps are upheld as sacred
among the priesthood of the
elven deity Calistria, goddess
of vengeance. Some priests of
Calistria summon giant wasps or
wasp swarms as servitors, while a
few nurture giant wasps as pets,
temple guardians, or companions.
Followers of Calistria, both
clergy and laypeople alike, seek
to emulate the wasp’s penchant
for leaving stung victims alive to
suﬀer over a long period: a ﬁtting
model for revenge.
PARALYTIC POISON
The poison of the giant wasp
loses its potency soon after being
harvested, but alchemists have
learned of a way to preserve
some of its properties by adding
a number of harsh additives; this
method makes it even deadlier.
Wasp
While the common wasp poses little threat to a hardy adventurer aside from
an uncomfortable sting, a large and aggressive swarm of these territorial
insects—to say nothing of their oversized kin—can lay low an entire party
of heroes. The wasps represented here are of the common variety also known
as yellowjackets, but many other sorts of dangerous wasps exist, such as a
Garundi variant that swarms in such great numbers that it can decimate entire
villages, and the dreaded extraplanar hellwasps, which build their nests within
the corpses of their victims.
Giant Wasp
Giant wasps are much more dangerous but less common than their smaller kin,
and—to the relief of those who encounter them—they tend to be solitary.

Wasp Swarm
Wasp nests are made of chewed wood ﬁbers foraged from
the surrounding ﬂora, which the wasps make into a material
similar to paper. A single wasp nest can house thousands
of individuals that emerge as a massive swarm. Most
swarms attack only to protect their nest or if otherwise
agitated, though druids and other primal enchanters
can bend these venomous vermin to their will—to deadly effect.
