HELL HOUND MINIONS
On the Material Plane, these ﬁends
are sometimes found in the service
of ﬁre-loving monsters such as
ﬁre giants or efreet, as well as
mortals who seek to tame some of
the raw power of Hell. In Cheliax,
Hellknights occasionally call
upon hell hounds to track down
fugitives and traitors.
Hell Hound
Hell hounds are ﬁendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt
down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of ﬂame. They are temperamental
and quick to aggressive behavior.
Hell Hound
A hell hound’s appearance dismisses any doubts as to its infernal origins—ﬂesh
the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any ﬁend’s pitchfork, and a shroud of
ever-burning hellﬁre are all trademark features.
