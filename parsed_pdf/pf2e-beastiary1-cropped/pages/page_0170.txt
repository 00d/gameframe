GHOULISH SOCIETY
Ghouls are quite intelligent and,
more so than almost any other
undead, prone to forming societies
and cultures (if vile and repugnant
ones centered around ﬂesh eating
and acts of depravity) in tangled
warrens below boneyards, or even
entire cities hidden away in the
depths of the Darklands.
or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as itʼs sickened on a critical failure). While
within the aura, the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease
and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Claws and Jaws As ghoul, but apply ghast fever instead of ghoul fever.
Consume Flesh Ȱɵ As ghoul, but it regains 1d6 additional Hit Points.
Ghast Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill eﬀect (1 day); Stage 2

Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghast the next midnight
Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) As ghoul, but elves are not immune.
