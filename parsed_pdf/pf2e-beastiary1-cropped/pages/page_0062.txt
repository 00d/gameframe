CENTIPEDE SPECIES
Centipedes take nearly countless
forms amid nearly every climate,
with speciﬁc traits and abilities
varying wildly between species.
Tangled forests, arid deserts,
foul sewers, deep caverns, and
abandoned buildings are all
common haunts for centipedes,
from oversized specimens capable
of taking down signiﬁcant prey
alone to carpets of frenzied vermin
gathered into a dangerous swarm.
Larger and more specialized
centipedes than the two presented
here exist, such as the sleek giant
whiptail centipede or the immense
titan centipede.
Centipede
Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a
relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about
with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented
bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey
with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure.
Giant Centipede
Most giant centipedes (known as sewer centipedes when found in cities) nest in
small groups but hunt alone when they seek out food. Attempts to domesticate
giant centipedes for use as guardians or pets generally end poorly, but some
tribes of goblins, kobolds, and mitﬂits have developed effective methods of
utilizing these vermin as guardians. Other tribes and some humanoid societies
roast and eat centipedes, often with pungent peppers as a savory delicacy,
although care must be taken in preparing the meal to avoid tainting the ﬂesh
with the creature’s venom.

Centipede Swarm
Swarms of centipedes are dangerous indeed, ravenous carpets of skittering
hunger capable of devouring a traveler whole in a matter of minutes. Some
alchemists submerge whole centipedes taken from swarms in their elixirs and
some mutagens, claiming such infusions increase potency, though other say this
is nothing more than quackish claptrap. Kobolds and mitﬂits are both known
to incorporate swarms of centipedes into cunning traps, from simple pits ﬁlled
with vermin or more complex affairs involving chutes that dump the vermin
onto the heads of unwary intruders.
