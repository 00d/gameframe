SHADOW LOCATIONS
Shadows might lurk in any dimly
lit area—a corner in a crumbling
ruin, a room lit by ﬂickering
candles, or a shaded forest at
dusk. They travel to and from the
Shadow Plane, though it is unclear
if they do so via their own magic
or by aligning themselves with a
more powerful being capable of
such planar shifting.
Shadow
The mysterious undead known as shadows lurk in dark places and feed on those
who stray too far from the light. Those who parley with shadows, typically by
keeping them at bay with a glowing weapon, may learn great secrets, for they
are ideal spies.

Shadow Spawn When a creature’s shadow is pulled free by Steal Shadow, it becomes
a shadow spawn under the command of the shadow that created it. This shadow
spawn doesn’t have Steal Shadow and is perpetually and incurably clumsy 2. If the
creature the shadow spawn was pulled from dies, the shadow spawn becomes a
full-ﬂedged, autonomous shadow. If the creature recovers from its enfeeblement, its
shadow returns to it and the shadow spawn is extinguished.
Slink in Shadows The shadow can Hide or end its Sneak in a creature’s or object’s shadow.
Steal Shadow (divine, necromancy) Ȱɵ Requirement The shadow hit a living creature
with a shadow hand Strike on its previous action. Eﬀect The shadow pulls at the
target’s shadow, making the creature enfeebled 1. This is cumulative with other
enfeebled conditions from shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If this
increases a creature’s enfeebled value to 3 or more, the target’s shadow is
separated from its body (see shadow spawn). Enfeebled from Steal Shadow
decreases by 1 every hour.
Greater Shadow
Shadows that spend long amounts of time on the Shadow Plane
and absorb its magic become greater shadows.
