RATS AND DISEASE
Rats have a reputation of being
vicious, aggressive animals
that attack food stores in great
numbers and spread disease.
While rats are immune to the most
severe eﬀects of their own ﬁlth
fever, the disease makes them
unpredictable and aggressive.
Some populations of rats carry
even more deadly diseases, such
as bubonic plague.
Rat
Rats are a ubiquitous menace, scurrying through the sewers and on the streets of
nearly every settlement the world over. Though a regular rat darting underfoot
might startle or even frighten the average passerby, giant rats and rat swarms are
far more dangerous.
Giant Rat
Giant rats are enormous versions of the common vermin. They are typically found
in abundant numbers, but since they cannot ﬁt in the nooks where mundane rats
typically hide, they are much easier to locate and exterminate. They mostly live in
sewers where they can scavenge from the streets above, but some families of giant
rats live in more remote locations, such as dank caves or forests and hills. Rats
are incredibly adept survivors and can be found nearly anywhere in the world,
though they tend to favor temperate or warm climates as opposed to cold regions.
Although its bite alone is not lethal except to the very young or very old, the
giant rat carries the ﬁlth fever common to rodents around the world—a pestilence
more than capable of ravaging rural communities.

Rat Swarm
A swarm of rats can cause total chaos within a household or business. Contracting
ﬁlth fever is all the easier when dozens of these agitated or hungry vermin
gather to bite victims en masse, making rat-hunting a viable career in many
parts of the world as desperate townspeople seek relief from the
disease’s spread.
