WARG LEGENDS
Wargs are the subject of many
grim tales and campﬁre stories.
Frightening accounts of wargs
gobbling up children whole have a
disturbing basis in fact, for these
ravenous creatures have jaws that
can unhinge like those of a serpent
to gulp down small prey while the
victim yet lives.
Warg
The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins,
hobgoblins, orcs, and other violent humanoids.
Warg
Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their
cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from
their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple
desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs
and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most
wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are
more than willing to integrate goblinoid ﬂesh into their diet.

Winter Wolf
Winter wolves are related to wargs, but are larger, smarter, and far
more dangerous. They are capable of exhaling plumes of freezing
breath and are big enough to easily serve as mounts for orcs and
hobgoblins—provided the winter wolf is willing, of course. Like
wargs, winter wolves hunt in packs, but unlike their smaller cousins,
they have a notable proud streak. When they deign to serve others, they
reserve this privilege for larger and more dangerous creatures such as
frost giants, renegade yetis, or even white dragons.
