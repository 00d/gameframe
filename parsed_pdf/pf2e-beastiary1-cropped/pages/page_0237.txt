CREATIVE MIMICS
The older the mimic, the more
creative its guise, but within
practical limits. For example, a
mimic can appear as a neatly
organized bookshelf with a single
book out of place, a dried-up
cistern with something glittering
at its center, or an inconspicuous
wooden door with a conveniently
placed peephole.
Mimic
Thought to be the result of a failed experiment meant to animate objects or a
sinister alghollthu creation, mimics are clever monsters that can take the form
of common manufactured objects. Mimics are ambush predators and voracious
eaters, surprising their prey through their uncanny ability to mimic the form
of common furniture and miscellany. They remain disguised until unsuspecting
adventurers happen by, then they lash out in ambush.
Mimics possess complex alien minds, and while often cruel and self-serving,
they also enjoy conversation with their prey from time to time. For unknown
reasons, they are especially interested in humanoids. Mimics have a strong dislike
for others of their kind and tend to live alone. A mimic can remain in its alternate
form for an extremely long period of time, sometimes remaining disguised in a
dungeon chamber for decades. Regardless of how long
it waits, the mimic remains vigilant and alert, ready to
strike at any moment.

Adhesive The mimic is coated in an adhesive slime. Any creature that
hits the mimic, is hit by the mimic, or otherwise touches
the mimic must succeed at a DC 23 Reﬂex save or
become grabbed (Escape DC 23). A weapon that hits
the mimic is stuck to the mimic and can
be removed with a successful DC
23 Athletics check (made as a
single action). A mimic can
have any number of objects
or creatures stuck to it at a
time. The mimic can release
a stuck creature or object by
using a single action, and the
adhesive dissolves 1 minute after
the mimic dies, releasing all stuck
objects and creatures.
