TEKELI-LI
While a shoggoth’s cacophony is
a bewildering and eldritch mix of
sound and dangerous secrets, the
phrase “tekeli-li” is the most oft
repeated cry, and these mysterious
words are always discernible
among their wild vocalizations.
Sometimes, wild birds that dwell in
places haunted by shoggoths seem
to cry out this strange phrase,
while at others it can be heard on
blasts of frozen winds. Attempts
to translate the phrase, even via
magic, have only ever met with
failure, as if the words themselves
actively resist revealing their
secrets to the world.
Shoggoth
Although even raving fanatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the
monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or a thankfully
unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. Shoggoths exist, yet they tend
keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins,
emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.
The ﬁrst shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts
of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them
useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes,
mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile.
Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their
masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.
A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They
remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters,
humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl
upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth
rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulﬁng them in a
gelatinous press of ﬂesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.
Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to
chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be
counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacriﬁce to it.
Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would
hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon
a world is unsettling to say the least.
