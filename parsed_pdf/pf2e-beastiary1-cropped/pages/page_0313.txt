TREERAZER’S CULTISTS
Treerazer is worshipped by cultists
throughout the Inner Sea region.
The majority of these deranged
maniacs can be found within or
near the expanse of the Tanglebriar,
consisting of fungus-corrupted fey,
debased elves, or other sinister
demon worshippers. Beyond
Tanglebriar, his cultists are rarer
and tend to be loners or leaders
of very small groups. Treerazer’s
religious symbol is a bleeding dead
tree that’s been split in half.
Edicts corrupt plant life with
evil or fungal inﬂuences, slay elves,
feast on rotten ﬂesh or fungus
Anathema grant mercy to
elves, plant trees, encourage
natural plant growth

Treerazer
Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, is a powerful demon on the
cusp of ascending to the true power of one of the rulers of the Abyss itself—a
demon lord. For now, even as a nascent demon lord, Treerazer is a dangerous foe.
Treerazer rarely leaves his swampy realm of Tanglebriar—a large thicket of
tainted foliage and rotting detritus just south of Kyonin’s Fierani Forest—but can
be encountered anywhere within that toxic mire, often accompanied by a small
legion of demons, corrupted fey, and other deadly allies. Certain occult rituals
have the power to call him forth from Tanglebriar, granting him the opportunity
to directly work his evils beyond the realm to which he has been exiled. Some
believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he
could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch
and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning
and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the
safety of his nightmare realm.

Aura of Corruption (aura, plant, primal, transmutation) 120 feet. Plants near Treerazer
twist, deform, and transform into thorny or fungoid parodies of their natural shapes.
A living creature in this area must succeed at a DC 47 Fortitude save each round or
become partially transformed into plantlike matter. Those who fail this saving throw
are treated as if they were plants for the purposes of any eﬀect that particularly
harms or inconveniences plant creatures more than other creatures, but do not gain
any beneﬁts of being plant creatures. This eﬀect lasts as long as the creature remains
within the area of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter.

Defoliation ʚʖ (primal, necromancy, plant) Treerazer exudes a pulse of sickly green light
in a 30-foot-radius emanation. All plants in the area (including creatures under the eﬀect
of his aura of corruption) blacken and wither. Non-creature plants immediately wither
and die. Plant creatures take 20d8 negative damage with a DC 49 basic Fortitude save.
A creature that fails its save is doomed 1 for 1 minute and sickened 3. Treerazer can
choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this eﬀect, and generally does
so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants or fungi, or plant creatures that are allied to
his cause. Treerazer can’t use Defoliation for 1d4 rounds.
Dispelling Strike Ȳ˓ (abjuration, primal); Frequency once per round; Trigger Treerazer hits
a creature, object, or spell eﬀect with a weapon Strike or a defoliation attack. Eﬀect
