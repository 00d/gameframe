ELEMENTAL CREATURES
Not all elementals are lumbering,
humanoid-shaped creatures. Some
take on the forms and natures
of animals and beasts from the
Material Plane. These creatures
often behave in ways similar to
their Material Plane counterparts,
even though as elementals they
lack the animalistic instincts
mortal creatures have when it
comes to hunting, reproducing,
and the like. Elemental creatures
are favorites of conjurers due to
their small size, relative ease of
summoning, and varied abilities.

takes damage only once for each square it moves, even if its space covers multiple squares
of spikes). Creatures with the earth trait ignore all eﬀects within the area. The stone mauler
