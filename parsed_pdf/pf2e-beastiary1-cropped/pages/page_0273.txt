ON PRIMEVAL WINGS
Although not true dinosaurs,
pterosaurs are often found in
the same regions as dinosaurs
and other megafauna, wheeling
in the skies above and adding to
the general primeval ambiance of
these lost worlds.
Pterosaur
Pterosaurs are primitive ﬂying creatures. While many are smaller than a human,
the two presented below are quite a bit larger. Each of these creatures could
pose a serious threat to a person.
These ﬂying reptiles can be found in a wide selection of regions, but they tend
to soar above warm or temperate climates.
Pteranodon
Pteranodons are quick and agile reptiles with 20-foot wingspans that enable them
to hover on wind currents for hours. These creatures have long beaks and equally
long crests that protrude from the backs of their heads.

Quetzalcoatlus
Quetzalcoatlus are the largest ﬂying members of the
pterosaur family and are often mistaken for dragons due
to their immense size and 40-foot wingspans.
Quetzalcoatlus are carnivorous, feeding on a variety
of reptiles, mammals, large ﬁsh, amphibians, and other
invertebrates. They are not inherently aggressive
creatures and are happy to scavenge for food, but
when presented with live prey they readily attack
almost any creature smaller than themselves.
