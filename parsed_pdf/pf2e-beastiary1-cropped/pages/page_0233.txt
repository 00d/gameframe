MANTICORE TREASURE
A manticore enjoys taking plunder
from the corpses of its prey as
trophies that ﬂatter its vanity and
testify to its strength. It has little
interest in money, but sometimes
accepts gold and jewels as tribute.
Manticore
The manticore is a monstrous amalgamation of lion, dragon, and human with a
penchant for feasting on human ﬂesh. Its distinctive tail is festooned with large
quills like those of a porcupine, which the manticore ﬂings at prey by whipping
its tail like a sling. These deadly spikes give the manticore the power to slaughter
even well-armed warriors from the safety of the sky.
Although the anthropomorphic face of the manticore suggests a keen intellect,
most creatures of its kind are simple-minded killers. They can be clever liars,
however, and their voices have a strangely musical sound that has lured many
unwitting travelers into an ambush. A manticore discovered by uneducated
humanoids (especially those who are both lawful and evil) can sometimes become
the center of adoration and even worship; a manticore in this situation swiftly
gives in to its laziness and allows its acolytes to bring it tribute in the form of
food and treasure, feasting upon its own followers when offerings become scarce.
Stronger humanoids who encounter a manticore can cow it through intimidation
and violence, sometimes even forcing it into service as a mount. As long as the
manticore is well fed with human ﬂesh and its master leads it to victory, a manticore
mount can prove surprisingly loyal.

Spike Volley Ȱɵ The manticore
ﬂings up to two spikes from its
tail, targeting either two diﬀerent
creatures or a single creature. If
the manticore targets two diﬀerent
creatures, these creatures must be
within 20 feet of one another, and
the manticore makes a separate
Strike against each; this counts as
only one Strike for the manticore’s
multiple attack penalty, and the
penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks. If the manticore ﬁres
both spikes at the same creature, it
makes a single Strike. If the attack hits, it
deals the damage of a single spike, but the target
is pinned in place, rendering it immobilized. A
creature that succeeds at a DC 23 Athletics
check (attempted as a single action) can
pull the spike free.
A manticore can hurl no more than 12
spikes in 24 hours.
MANTICORE LOCATIONS
Manticores prefer lonely places
in the wilderness far from
humanoids, but they adapt
easily to nearly any terrain.
Manticores have been spotted in
jungles, forests, deserts, and
mountains.
