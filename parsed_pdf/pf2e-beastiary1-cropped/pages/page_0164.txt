EFREETI MALIKS
Efreeti maliks take pleasure in
fulﬁlling wishes in pedantic ways
that cause suﬀering, regret, or
pain. A wisher for a thousand
pounds of gemstones might have
the gems delivered as a bone-
crushing avalanche. Efreeti maliks
add the following to their innate
spells: 5th ﬁreball (at will); 7th
volcanic eruption.
Djinni
Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge, and
trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of all
geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting
with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and have
a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a
reputation for arrogance.
Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they ﬁnd shaitans too stiff and
harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants,
they despise war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their
opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when
they encounter efreet).

Shaitan
Hailing from the Plane of Earth, shaitans are proud and brazen genies.
They value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working
with metal and stone. Immense gemstones and veins of precious
metal crisscross their home plane, and the industrious shaitans
have built a vast mercantile empire from these abundant
natural resources.
