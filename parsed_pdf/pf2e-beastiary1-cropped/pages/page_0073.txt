leukodaemons cooperate with each other and those who conjure them to mortal
worlds to spread sickness and plague, eschewing personal glory for end results.

(evocation,
divine)
The
leukodaemon exhales a cloud of corpse-bloated,
biting black ﬂies in a 20-foot cone. Creatures within
the cone take 4d8 piercing damage (DC 28 basic Reﬂex save).
A creature that fails the save becomes sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure).
Daemonic Pestilence (disease) The leukodaemon can telepathically communicate
with the aﬄicted creature at any distance on the same plane; Saving Throw DC 28
Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier (1 day); Stage 2 drained 1 (1 day); Stage 3 drained 2 (1 day);
Stage 4 drained 2 (1 day); Stage 5 drained 3 (1 week); Stage 6 dead
Quicken Pestilence Ȱɵ (divine, manipulate, necromancy) The leukodaemon coaxes
a disease into full bloom. It chooses a target in its aura of pestilence that’s
currently aﬀected by a disease. That creature must attempt a Fortitude
save against the disease as if the interval for the disease’s current stage
had passed.
Astradaemon (Void Daemon)
These unnerving, almost reptilian daemons represent death by direct assault
against a soul or life-force—the same numbing death they bring with their fell
touch. Rarely seen on the Material Plane, astradaemons spend most of their
time hunting the pathways between the living world and the afterlife. There,
they capture migrating souls, snatching them from their rightful rewards or
punishments and dragging them to Abaddon as tribute to their undying masters.
These horrifying predators of the dead can also be found stalking the banks of
the River of Souls in the Astral Plane, where they constantly hunt for new victims.
Psychopomps have a particular hatred of astradaemons as a result, and clashes
between them and these eerie hunters of the recently departed are indeed the stuff
of legend.
THE DAEMONIC PARADOX
Daemons embody a fundamental
paradox—while they are
incarnations of death and seek
to devour all that lives, they are
themselves living creatures. Some
speak of a glorious end time after
which reality will ﬁnally be free
of the contagion that is life itself.
Most daemons give no thought to
this paradox.
