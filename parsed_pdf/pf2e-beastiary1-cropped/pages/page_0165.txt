Efreeti
The efreet are hateful and merciless genies from the Plane
of Fire, where they build metropolises and massive trade
centers that draw extraplanar travelers from across the
multiverse. They are cruel slavers, vengeful warmongers,
and sinister wish-masters; there are many tales of
mortals who made pacts with efreet only to have
their words twisted to suit a genie’s capricious and
malevolent whims.
Efreet do not readily treat with other genies;
they share an eternal feud with the djinn, disdain
marids, regard jann as weaklings unworthy of
the genie title, and only occasionally tolerate
alliances with shaitans. At 12 feet tall and
weighing 2,000 pounds, efreet are formidable
opponents and cow their chosen victims with
a glance.
