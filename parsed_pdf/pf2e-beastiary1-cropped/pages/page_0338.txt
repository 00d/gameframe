XULGATH SOCIETY
Xulgaths respect strength, and the
leader of a community is usually the
strongest of all of them. The leader’s
dominance is rarely questioned
until a potentially stronger xulgath
believes it’s time for a change in
rulership. The two xulgaths then
face oﬀ in a ﬁght to the death, with
the victor claiming rule.
Xulgath Skulker
Xulgath warrens are patrolled—some might say “haunted”—by the community’s
skulkers. These xulgaths specialize in stealth, striking swiftly from the shadows
and otherwise ambushing foes.

of the skulker’s turn.

ﬂat‑footed creatures.
Xulgath Leader
Xulgath leaders are usually the strongest, most violent
members of a community—although in some cases,
particularly in larger groups, xulgath tribes are led by
powerful demon cultists or other monsters who seek to
use the xulgaths as servants or slaves.
