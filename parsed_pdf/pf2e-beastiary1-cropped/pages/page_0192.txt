Create Grave Squire The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which
becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its
squire at any distance, see through the squire’s senses, and cast suggestion as a divine
innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success
as one step worse. If the graveknight’s main armor is destroyed, the squire’s piece
expands to cover the squire’s body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the
graveknight’s new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and
must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.
Dark Deliverance The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level.
Graveknight Armor
Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight’s
essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the
graveknight’s rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the
host, transforming their ﬂesh into the graveknight’s new body. Removing the
curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor
again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while
wearing the armor, or if the graveknight’s rejuvenation
completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer
immediately progresses to stage 3.
Graveknight’s Curse (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse aﬀects anyone
who wears a graveknight’s armor for at least 1 hour. Saving
Throw Will save; Onset 1 hour; Stage 1 doomed 1 and cannot
remove the armor (1 day); Stage 2 doomed 2, hampered
10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); Stage 3
dies and transforms into the armor’s graveknight.
