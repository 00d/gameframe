Gold Dragon
Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their
strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence
of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and
counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin
of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals.
But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and
prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than
rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are,
they necessarily take a wide view of all situations
and never act without considering all possible
options and outcomes. Because of this, gold
dragons willingly converse with any
creature that seeks them out, even evil
chromatic dragons. Mortals might
ﬁnd this behavior strange, considering the long-
standing war between chromatic and metallic
dragons, but dragons know all too well
that desperate situations sometimes call
for drastic alliances. And although gold
dragons might consider brief truces with
their chromatic brethren in the case
of world-ending threats, they also
know when such alliances have run
their course.
When another metallic dragon
faces a quandary or a foe beyond its
own ability to overcome, its best
option is often to seek the counsel
of the eternally wise and gloriously
righteous gold dragons. Locating
these legendary beings is no easy
task, however, for gold dragons are
notoriously reclusive. Their intellect
and wisdom is such that they prefer
to ponder the great questions of life
in seclusion, where they strive to
formulate solutions to the world’s
most pressing problems. As a
result, gold dragons are sometimes
absent when metallic dragons gather
together, or are missing from tribunals
where
their
counsel
would
be
beneﬁcial. Impatient dragons sometimes
begrudge gold dragons for this apparent
unreliability, but such aspersions are
usually a result of jealousy rather than
PARNONERYX
This adult gold dragon had a long
and tragic existence. Formerly an
ally of Iomedae, he was defeated
by a powerful white dragon and
imprisoned in ice. Though freed by
the Glorious Reclamation, he was
soon slain by evil adventurers who
used his head to create a powerful
weapon known as a tathlum—
which was used to lift the siege of
Citadel Rivad and end the Glorious
Reclamation.
