OVERSIZED THEMES
Giants are larger-than-life foes.
While many giants have themes
that tie them to elemental or
magical forces, the primary theme
giants share is that they embody a
classic cultural trope as their basis.
Fire giants, for example, can be
seen as oversized smiths, while
hill giants should evoke the
ﬂavor of an oversized bully.
Giant
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout
the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
Hill Giant
Selﬁsh and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards.
Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the
defenseless but is quick to ﬂee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better
organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their
own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.

Stone Giant
Stone giants are stoic, reclusive herders and artists who have a rich
history and collection of traditions. They dwell in caves in tall
mountains and craggy ranges, where their grayish skin allows
them to blend in with their surroundings and go unnoticed by
imperceptive adventurers. Those benign travelers who come
across a tribe of stone giants need not worry much, however,
for stone giants do not actively invite confrontation or strife.
They are, by and large, a peaceful people who seek wisdom
through exploration of nature and long meditations on
the elements of the natural world. Their elders are the wisest of stone
giants, and use their charisma and druidic magic to lead their tribes to
prosperity and harmony with nature.
A typical stone giant stands 12 feet in height and weighs about
1,500 pounds.
