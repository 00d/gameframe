Harmonize Ȱɵ The choral angel adds
its harmony to a choral angel ally
within its harmonizing aura. The ally
can cast calm emotions or heroism on
its next turn in place of its 3rd-level
sound burst or heighten its 3rd-level sound burst
by 1 level. If ﬁve diﬀerent choral angels use
Harmonize on the same choral angel ally, it
can instead cast divine decree in place of
its 3rd-level sound burst.
Balisse (Confessor Angel)
Balisses, or confessor angels, seek to assist
mortals ensnared by moral dilemmas or
crises of faith. Balisses prefer to guide people
to their own decisions rather than demand
obedience to a higher cause, as intrinsic belief
is even more powerful than blind obedience.
While most balisses are fundamentally honest,
they use their guardian angel ability to seem less
intimidating and decrease the chance the mortal
will simply acquiesce to the opinion of an obviously
divine being. Balisses often form from souls of those who
performed evil acts but were redeemed. Many serve the goddess Sarenrae, but
they can serve other good deities and empyreal lords as well.
ANGELIC LOCATIONS
Angels normally live on Nirvana
or other celestial planes, but their
missions can bring them to the
Material Plane. Spellcasters can
conjure them for aid or advice
in times of need, and they can
even be found, if rarely, crusading
against ﬁends in Hell, the Abyss,
or anywhere in between.
