their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important
messages and other celestial secrets.
Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional
good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls
intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear
physical features that mark them as closely afﬁliated with that deity. An astral
deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of ﬁre, while one
created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could
have butterﬂy wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas
created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.
