KOBOLD ADORATION
Some kobold groups are fond of
chimera guardians or pets, but
few kobolds have the bravery or
resources to keep a chimera happy
for long. While chimeras are often
pressed into service by more
intelligent creatures, it’s also not
unheard of for a chimera to keep
a herd of unintelligent animals—
lions, goats, or even serpents—as
both companions and food supply.
Chimera
The chimera is the archetypal example of an unnatural monster made up of a
monstrous mix of wildly different component creatures: in this case, a lion, a
dragon, and a goat. Wild, hateful, and hungry, it tries to eat any creature it sees,
but sometimes a strong-willed master is able to compel a chimera to serve as a
guardian or even a mount.

Three Headed Any ability that would sever a chimera’s head (such as a critical hit with
a vorpal weapon) severs one head at random. Losing a head doesn’t kill a chimera (as
long as it has one head left), but it does prevent it from making Strikes with the lost
head or using the head’s Breath Weapon.
Triple Opportunity A chimera gains 2 extra reactions each round
that it can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity. It
must use a diﬀerent head for each reaction, and it
can’t use more than one on the same triggering
action. If it loses one of its heads, it also loses
one of these extra reactions.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ dragon jaws +20, Damage 2d6+9
piercing plus 2d6 energy damage (see
draconic bite)
Melee Ȱɵ lion jaws +20, Damage
2d10+9 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ goat horns +20, Damage
2d10+9 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +20 (agile), Damage 2d6+9 slashing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The chimera breathes a
cone or line that deals 9d6 damage to all creatures in the
area (DC 26 basic save of a type indicated below).
The color of the chimera’s dragon head
determines the area of the Breath
Weapon, the type of damage it deals,
and the type of save to avoid it. The
chimera can’t use Breath Weapon again
for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Black 60-foot line of acid (Reﬂex)
•	 Blue 60-foot line of electricity (Reﬂex)
•	 Green 30-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)
•	 Red 30-foot cone of ﬁre (Reﬂex)
•	 White 30-foot cone of cold (Reﬂex)
Draconic Bite A chimera’s dragon head deals an extra 2d6 damage of a
type matching the dragon’s color (see Breath Weapon).
Three-Headed Strike ʚʖ The chimera makes a Strike with its
dragon jaws, lion jaws, and goat horns, each at a –2 penalty
and targeting a diﬀerent creature. These Strikes count as
only one attack for the chimera’s multiple attack penalty,
and the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has made all
three attacks.
