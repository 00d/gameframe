usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even
more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive
clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.
Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens
of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides.
In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil
from taking root in the ﬁrst place, and they ensure mortals under their care are
well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem
overzealous or even eager to join the ﬁght against evil, they know that the best
way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment
at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable
problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for
evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support
of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.
Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating
deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice,
virtue, and redemption.
