SNAKES IN MYTHOLOGY
Snakes appear frequently
and prominently in the myths
and legends of many cultures
throughout the Inner Sea region.
In Ancient Osirion, snakes were
revered and associated both with
the evil serpent god Apep and the
good goddess Wadjet, the Green
Empress. Perhaps the best-known
example of snakes in Golarion’s
legends are the serpentfolk—
serpentine humanoids who ruled
vast swaths of the world in
prehistoric times and worshipped a
foul snake deity called Ydersius.
Giant Viper
The giant viper’s fangs are a frightening sight, with injection tubes as long as
daggers. The sheer amount of venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe
blood clotting and leave a victim utterly drained of vitality.

Giant Anaconda
The monstrous giant anaconda is capable of swallowing whole creatures as
big as horses—to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers
watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above,
giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where
they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras.
