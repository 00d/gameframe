NON-EVIL VAMPIRES
Non-evil vampires are rare and
at odds with their basic nature.
Such vampires typically give up a
fraction of their power in exchange
for some of their lost humanity.
Vampire Mastermind
Vampire masterminds are evil wizards who control entire cabals of the undead
and instill fear in the hearts of mortals far and wide.

the vampire the ability to cast one prepared
spell it had already previously cast today,
without spending a spell slot. The vampire
must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s
other requirements.

Drinking Blood, the vampire regains 10 HP.
Steady Spellcasting If another creature’s reaction
would disrupt the vampire mastermind’s

DC 15 ﬂat check. If the vampire succeeds, its
action isn’t disrupted.
