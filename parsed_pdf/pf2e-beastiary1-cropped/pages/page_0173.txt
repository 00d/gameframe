GIANT BAGS
Giants often keep an eclectic
collection of treasures in their
knapsacks or bags. Among these
can be found a staggeringly wide
range of unexpected and odd
treasures and valuables.
cold damage at the end of each of its turns until it gets free (Escape DC 28). The giant
can’t use Chill Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
Ice Stride A frost giant isn’t impeded by diﬃcult terrain caused by snow or ice, nor does
it need to attempt Acrobatics checks to keep from falling on slippery ice.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ
Wide Swing Ȱɵ The frost giant makes a single greataxe Strike and compares the attack
roll result to the ACs of up to two foes within its reach. This counts as two attacks
for the frost giant’s multiple attack penalty.
Fire Giant
The most militaristic of all giants, ﬁre giants focus obsessively on learning
combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor,
and ﬁnding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their
social and political structures are grounded ﬁrmly in martial
hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the
orders of one’s superior, no matter if you are
accountable to a lowly soldier or report to
a powerful ofﬁcer. As soon as a ﬁre giant
can walk, they are ﬁtted with their
ﬁrst suit of forged armor. This armor
is constantly remolded and replaced
as the ﬁre giant matures, both to ensure they are
comfortable with steel against their skin and also
to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the
burden of ﬁghting to protect their traditions and way of life. To
a ﬁre giant, death is the ﬂame in which the future is forged.
Fire giants are usually identiﬁed by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair
that ﬂickers and dances as if it were aﬂame, and heavy steel armor worn over
garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most ﬁre giants are covered in scars and
refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of
a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical ﬁre giant stands 12 to 16 feet
tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.
