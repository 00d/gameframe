SPRITE PRANKS
Sprite pranks tend to be
kind-hearted in nature; they might
use their abilities to embarrass
a braggart or to trick them into
a convoluted scheme to help
someone notice an admirer who
has been there for them all along.
Their plans are often half-baked;
sprites’ mercurial nature means
they can easily become distracted
by something new before following
through on a previous plan.
Sprite
Elusive, ﬂighty, and ebullient, sprites are what many villagers ﬁrst imagine when
they hear the terms “fey” or “fairy.” While their dispositions vary from the
benevolent grig to the trickster pixie, all sprites share a connection to magic and
diminutive size. This family of fey shares its name with its slightest and most
populous member, the common sprite.
Sprite
Common sprites are primeval guardians that latch onto a person, place, or object
and defend it for their own inscrutable reasons. Their dispositions vary from kind
to spiteful, but all sprites have a capricious streak. Being only about 9 inches tall,
they are wary of animals that might hunt them, particularly house cats, and prefer
ﬂight to a ﬁght. On the other hand, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms
of magic and heedlessly gather around ley line nexuses or other places of power.

Grig
Grigs are kindly musicians of the fey,
often getting themselves into trouble due
to their penchant for confronting evil well
beyond their ability to vanquish. Even so, they
ﬁght bravely and with great cunning, using their
magic and ranged sonic attacks while ﬂying
and leaping using their wings and powerful
cricket-like lower torsos to stay out of reach.
