SPAWN OF CYTH-V’SUG
Treerazer was once the favored
minion and lieutenant (some
even say child) of the demon lord
Cyth-V’sug, Lord of Fungus and
Parasites. After a failed attempt to
wrest that role in the Abyss away
from Cyth-V’sug, Treerazer ﬂed to
the Material Plane. Cyth-V’sug was
unable (or perhaps only unwilling)
to pursue but took steps to ensure
that Treerazer would remain
there by exiling him, severing
Treerazer’s bond to the Abyss—if
the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is
slain, his animus will not return to
the Abyss and reform. Death, to
Treerazer, is a permanent thing.
Treerazer casts his innate dispel magic, targeting the creature he hit with his Strike or
one spell aﬀecting that creature.
Staggering Strike When Treerazer scores a critical hit with a melee attack, the target is
stunned 2.
Blackaxe
Treerazer’s favored and deadly weapon Blackaxe is a potent magical item known
as an artifact—a creation far beyond that of most mortals. Should Treerazer
be defeated and a PC take possession of Blackaxe, they claim the power of the
weapon. Such power comes with a price though, for Blackaxe’s inﬂuence will
drive any who claim it to perform vile deeds and, ultimately, may even compel its
user to restore a defeated Treerazer to power!
