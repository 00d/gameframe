ALLIES IN THE SKIES
Aeries of giant eagles can make
potent allies to those who respect
their territories and approach
without malice in their hearts.
Giant eagles are just as likely to
swoop in and provide unsolicited
aid to those in the lowlands
of their realm against obvious
dangers, but if not oﬀered respect
in turn, giant eagles may abandon
an unpleasant victim to its fate
rather than suﬀer more insults.
Eagle
Few avian creatures can match the beauty and grace of the eagle.
Eagle
These large birds of prey swoop down from incredible heights to snatch ﬁsh and
small mammals in their powerful talons. Eagles nest atop high trees or steep cliffs
that provide a commanding view of the surrounding area. They avoid nesting too
near civilization, but some remote cultures train eagles as hunting companions.

Giant Eagle
No mere animals, giant eagles have a keen intellect and a strong sense of
honor. As guardians of their mountain homes, giant eagles attempt to prevent
the encroachment of civilization upon wild land and the predations of wicked
humanoid settlements. Unlike ordinary eagles, which tend to be solitary creatures,
giant eagles congregate within aeries holding up to a dozen members and work
together to protect their domains.
Giant eagles have wingspans up to 30 feet across and weigh up to 500 pounds.
These impressive birds cannot be easily broken or cowed. A giant eagle may allow
trusted terrestrial friends to ride it, but they invariably resist saddles, harnesses, or
other equipment that might suggest they are mere
beasts of burden rather than trusted companions.
Giant eagles are long-lived and take debts and
oaths very seriously, often remembering slights for
years and remaining slow to forgive.
