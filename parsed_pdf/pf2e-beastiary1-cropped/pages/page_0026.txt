Awakened Tree
Arboreal regents and other wielders of powerful primal magic grant temporary
sentience to trees in order to protect the forest. Invested with a workable set of
instincts and the ability to mobilize and attack, these awakened trees follow the
commands of their master and ﬁght to protect their home. The statistics below
work just as well for foliage that has become animate via other methods, such as a
mystical inﬂuence from another dimension, a capricious fey spirit, or the like.

Arboreal Regent
Arboreal regents—also called treants­—are lumbering, solitary creatures
responsible for guarding an entire forest. They take an especially long view
of affairs and never act brashly or without much deliberation. They
occasionally come together in small groups called groves to share
news and pass their wisdom down to the arboreal wardens that have
sprouted under their watch. In times of grave danger, all the groves in a
region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually,
act upon a threat.
The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and
weighs 4,500 pounds.

Awaken Tree ʚʖ (concentrate, primal) The arboreal regent causes a tree within 180
feet to uproot itself and ﬁght as a minion using the statistics for an awakened tree.
The arboreal regent can control up to two awakened trees at a time, and it can
issue commands to both trees as a single action, which has the concentrate and
auditory traits.
Sunder Objects When an arboreal regent damages an item or structure, it
deals an additional 2d10 damage to that item or structure.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ
FUNGUS NETWORKS
Particularly old arboreal regents
and other powerful arboreals can
tap into the extensive network of
fungus that connects the roots
of all the trees in the forest. By
doing so, the arboreal can learn
of threats throughout the entire
woodland, even from miles away.
