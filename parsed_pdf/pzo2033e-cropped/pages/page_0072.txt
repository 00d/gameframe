CHAPTER 4:
Long Dream the Dead
The fourth level of the Abomination Vaults is one of
the smaller ones overall, yet it’s among the ﬁnest, as it
once served as Belcorra’s personal retreat.
Belcorra’s Retreat Features
Ceilings in this level are 10 feet tall in halls and 15 feet
in rooms. Unless otherwise indicated, rooms are unlit.
The doors are iron-banded wood; ephemeral spirits
gently shut any door left open for more than a minute.
The map for this level appears on page 70.
D1. BELCORRA’S DINING ROOM
MODERATE 4
A pair of brightly glowing chandeliers illuminates a long
banquet table surrounded by luxurious, high-backed chairs.
The table is still set as if for a grand meal, but some of the
place settings are scattered and toppled, as are a few of
the chairs. Four skeletons in tattered ﬁnery are scattered
about the room, some of them clutching their own necks.
When the Roseguard assaulted Gauntlight Keep
so many years ago, Belcorra was dining here with
representatives of a now-extinct Absalomian thieves’
guild whom she was courting as potential allies
against the city. When word came that the Roseguard
was handily overcoming the keep’s defenses, Belcorra
took no chances. She politely excused herself, bade her
guests ﬁnish their meal, and magically commanded her
chef to poison them all and murder the other servants
before taking his own life.
Stairs beyond the north door lead up to area C29.
Creatures: The guests died in excruciating pain,
then later became havens for corpselights seeking
hosts. When a living creature other than Volluk enters
this room, the corpselights within the skeletons begin
to glow, and then the skeletons stagger to their feet
and attack. Each time a corpselight is forced into wisp
form, it ﬂees to one of the adjoining rooms (areas D2,
D3, or D6) to claim another corpse host and return to
the ﬁght.
