ALCHEMICAL POISONS
Poisons can produce a variety of debilitating effects on
the body. Seugathi ﬂeshwarpers use sloughing
toxin on their victims. The heroes
might come across sloughing toxin as
they explore the laboratories where the
seugathis work their wicked science.
Stupor poison is a potent toxin distilled
from sources deep in the Darklands. It’s
popular among drow who consider the
more common lethargy poison to be
insufﬁcient to bring down their foes,
including most drow of Yldaris (who
ﬁght monsters in the Hunting Grounds).

This complex toxin makes the muscles beneath a creature’s
skin loose and malleable, which ﬂeshwarpers ﬁnd useful in
their work. Rough or jerky movements the victim performs
concentrate the toxin in subdermal muscles and eventually
cause skin and muscle to slough away.

Duration 1 hour; Stage 1 1d6 poison damage for each
action with the attack or move trait the victim uses
(1 round); Stage 2 1d6 poison damage and 1d6 slashing

ALCHEMICAL TOOLS
The heroes might obtain specialized alchemical tools
from their Yldaris drow connections. Neither of these
items are available in the Abomination Vaults for the
heroes to ﬁnd as treasure. However, Quara and the
other drow know about them and might recommend
ordering them from Lozardyn if the heroes face
fungal dangers or underwater exploration.
