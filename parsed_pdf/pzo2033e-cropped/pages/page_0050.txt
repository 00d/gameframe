indignity is nothing compared to the fact that he has been
forced to live here on the Material Plane for much longer
than his bargain originally required.
The frustrated Zozzlarin is quick to attack the
heroes as a result; the conditions of his imprisonment
allow him to defend the dungeon from above-ground
intruders. If reduced to 10 or fewer Hit Points, though,
the devil begs for his life, offering to share a “special
memory” as a reward.
If the heroes agree, the zebub uses his Infernal Eye
ability to reveal a signiﬁcant event he witnessed many
years ago: Otari’s ﬂight through the dungeon to hide
out in area B28. Zozzlarin doesn’t know this memory’s
signiﬁcance, but it’s the most recent memory he has of
other surface dwellers, so he assumes the heroes are
interested. A successful DC 16 Society or relevant Lore
check is enough for a hero to recognize the famous
adventurer, who was thought to have been killed long
ago in the clash against Belcorra.

B28. HAUNTED WASHROOM
This ten-foot-square washroom features an iron bathing tub
to the north and a commode to the southwest. The northern
wall glows and shimmers with rippling ribbons of eerie
green light.
When Otari Ilvashti became trapped in the
Abomination Vaults, he did his best to ﬁnd an escape
route. Unfortunately, at that time, many of Belcorra’s
dangerous minions still guarded much of this level.
He made it to this room only to collapse from his
wounds. Fortunately, Belcorra’s death had thrown the
dungeon into chaos, and he wasn’t discovered. When
Otari woke some time later, no longer on the edge of
death from his ordeal, he crept out of the room and
made his way west through area B31 and eventually to
B20, only to be confronted by an angry and oversized
chuul. He discovered the secret door in area B32 and
ﬂed deeper instead.
When Otari ﬁnally died in area D18, his soul
remained as a ghost, and the three locations where
he hid during his ﬁnal days became infused with
desperate echoes of his spirit. These echoes provide a
trail to his remains.
The ghostly energies react to the presence of the
heroes. The ﬁrst time the heroes see the glowing
energy, it slithers into letters to read, “I was Otari...
save me from below!” A moment later, the words
slide off the wall and form a green ribbon of light that
slithers across the ﬂoor like a serpent with a speed of
20 feet. The heroes can follow this ribbon, which lasts
for only minutes, to area B32, where it slips under the
secret door and fades away. The next clue of Otari’s
path is in area C3.
This spectral manifestation can appear once per day.
B29. HALL OF HATRED
LOW 2
Several wide alcoves adorn the walls of this L-shaped
hallway. Each alcove contains a small diorama of the same
city facing diﬀerent perils—a massive ﬁre, a devastating
tsunami, a thunderous earthquake, an attack by an
enormous tentacled monster, and an invasion of an army
of undead.
Each of the scenes in the alcoves depict the city of
Absalom in a different fanciful doom from Belcorra’s
imagination. The stone dioramas are enhanced with
minor illusions; ﬂames ﬂicker, water ripples, and so on.
A tiny Gauntlight, as though miles distant, sits at the
edge of each scene. A hero who succeeds at a DC 16
Religion check while studying the last diorama notes
that the undead are rising from Absalom’s graves as
Gauntlight’s beam shines upon them.
Hazards: In addition to displaying some of her
fantasies about Absalom’s destruction, Belcorra had
Volluk rig several traps in the hall to punish intruders.
One trap is linked to each diorama (see the map on
page 36).
