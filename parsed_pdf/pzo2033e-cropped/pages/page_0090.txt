one of the cave’s many niches, planning to come back
for it at a later time, or used the site as a drop point for
transactions with a buyer. Today, with the recent decline
in smuggling, Otari’s young people camp in the cave
when they need a break from the lumber town.
The map of Smuggler’s Refuge appears on page 88.
Rotted crates, forgotten clothes, and other debris suggest
this cave is occasionally used but rarely cleaned. A cold
campﬁre surrounded by logs sits at the cave’s center. Faint
smells of mildew and smoke hang in the still air.
Like many visitors before him, Carman initially built
a ﬁre here but put it out when he realized there isn’t a
good place for the smoke to vent. A few old cots, heaps
of discarded clothes, and empty crates show that this
cave is occasionally inhabited. Carman uses the best of
the cots and the freshest clothes for bedding.
The east wall of the cave contains an exceptionally
well-hidden secret door that leads into the ﬁfth level
of the Abomination Vaults. A hero Searching this area
must succeed at a DC 28 Perception check to ﬁnd it.
Even if discovered, however, the secret door doesn’t
open from this side. The door’s mechanism causes the
heavy stone wall to swing inward, and it can’t do so
because of a cave-in just on the other side of it. The
heroes might clear this entrance from the other side
later (area E7).
Creature: If Carman isn’t aware of the heroes,
he sits on his cot, chewing on some dried ﬁsh and
turning the Cooperative Blade over and over in
his hands while he thinks. He wonders whether
to return the sword and hope for nothing more
than a stiff ﬁne, or ﬂee to his ancestral homeland
of Nidal.
If Carman knows of the heroes’ presence, he
hides behind a crate and uses Stealth for initiative.
Carman knows the heroes by reputation. He
assumes they’ve come here to take him prisoner,
and he puts up a ﬁght. While defending himself,
he shouts to them, “You’ll never take me alive!”
and “This is my sword! I only took what’s rightfully
mine!” He surrenders if the heroes plainly don’t
reciprocate his aggression, or when he’s reduced to
fewer than 30 Hit Points.
