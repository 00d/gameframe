CHAPTER 3:
Cult of the Canker
The third level of the Abomination Vaults once served
as Belcorra’s sprawling library and rooms related to
research. The servants and librarians once employed
here have become dangerous undead creatures.
Library Features
Belcorra’s library is unlit except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are 8 feet high in halls and 10 feet
high in rooms, although the largest rooms and halls
have vaulted ceilings that rise to 12 feet high. Doors
are made of wood, and many are marked with signs
(described in area C11) to help scholars ﬁnd their way.
The Cult of the Canker is the most widespread
faction active in the library. Originally a collection
of librarians, caretakers, and scribes, this loyal staff
stubbornly kept working after Belcorra died, focusing
their research on ﬁnding a way to restore their leader to
life. When food stores ran low, rather than risk alerting
the Roseguard by making potentially public forays to
the surface, the researchers turned to cannibalism.
There were plenty of other servants to eat, after all, in
the conveniently nearby servants’ quarters. The onset
of ghoul fever tore quickly through their ranks, but the
researchers were so obsessed that they barely noticed.
The scholars’ research now has a distinctly ghoulish
bent: they work to gather enough “cankerous ﬂesh”
to fuel Belcorra’s full resurrection. The fact that the
ghouls’ hunger often compels them to feed on the
ﬂesh they’re trying to collect has certainly slowed their
progress, but it hasn’t slowed their zeal.
The map of the library level appears on page 54.
C1. VISITOR’S READING ROOM 
TRIVIAL 3
This large, cross-shaped chamber contains several long
couches, the leather cushions that once adorned them
cracked with age. Dead plants lie slumped in planter
boxes along the walls, and a long-dry fountain depicting a
lighthouse stands in the middle of the room.
Belcorra didn’t allow visitors into her library except in
this room and the reading rooms to the north. A librarian
would fetch texts for visitors to peruse in comfort. The
fountain and plants here have long since dried up.
