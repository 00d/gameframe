summoning rituals. They currently keep one prisoner
they intend to sacriﬁce: a deep gnome rockwarden
named Calinth Narogblom (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 75).
The unfortunate Calinth came to the Abomination
Vaults searching for evidence that an offshoot of
his people were still living here. He never even met
up with the Children of Belcorra—whose current
state would horrify him—before being captured by
an urdefhan raiding party. They keep Calinth in the
metal box pushed against the wall so he can’t meld
into stone and escape.
Creatures: Three urdefhan tormentors chant and
wail, casting a lengthy summoning ritual with the
assistance of a scarred and cruel blood mage. The
tormentors hope to empower their daemonic pact
ritual to bring in a more powerful daemon; whether
or not they succeed is up to you. All four urdefhans
attack any intruders that interrupt their rite. They ﬁght
to the death.

Side Quest: Calinth carries no gear, but he
nevertheless still wants to ﬁnd out about the deep
gnomes living here. If the heroes show him evidence
of the Children of Belcorra—even their corpses from
past ﬁghts—Calinth is sad but his curiosity is satisﬁed.
If the heroes lead him to one of the exits to the
Darklands, he can make it back to his people. A week
later, Calinth sends them a token of his appreciation:
a jet and opal complete set of the Dark Chase board
game, worth 120 gp. If the heroes told Calinth that
they’re friendly with the Yldaris drow, he sends it by
the caravan route between the outpost and Lozardyn.
Otherwise, he searches the heroes out himself, even
braving the surface world if he must.
I36. THE BLOOD TEMPLE
LOW 9
A raised platform with a bloody altar stands on the east
side of this roughly triangular cavern.
A constant orgy of bloodletting goes on in this
chamber, all part of the strange and gory urdefhan
religion. If interrupted, the participants are anxious to
cover their altar with fresh blood.
Creatures: Two tormentors guide two lashers in the
rites. All of them attack nonbelievers who interfere with
their gruesome rituals and ﬁght to the death.

I37. KHURFEL’S TENT
MODERATE 9
At this cavern’s center sits a single fur-and-skin hovel. A
path to the hovel is ﬂanked with skull-topped spears.
It’s the tradition of this urdefhan cult that the war
champion dwells apart and lives in a home no more
elaborate than that of other urdefhans. The skulls all
belong to rivals that Khurfel defeated to obtain and
maintain his position as war champion. Their teeth are
gone, having been used for the shauth weapons these
urdefhans use (page 226).
Creatures: Once Khurfel notices the heroes, he looks
pleased, his face contorting in a terrifying grin. He calls
out, “We meet on a good day to kill” in Undercommon
as he draws his rhoka sword and strides forward. As
his blood visions foretold his ﬁght with the heroes, he
doesn’t shy away from it, and he neither offers nor
accepts quarter. He keeps the Emerald Fulcrum Lens
on his person at all times, strapped across his back so
it doesn’t get in the way during a ﬁght. He has invested
the lens, so harm spells cast on him heal additional
Hit Points.
Two tormentors advise Khurfel and join any battle
with him. They’re careful not to get in their war
champion’s way, and they use their harm spells to keep
him in the ﬁght. They ﬂee if Khurfel is defeated.
