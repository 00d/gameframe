Gatekeeper’s Will Ȱɵ (concentrate) Lady’s Whisper
mentally causes any doors or portals within the Gate of
Nhimbaloth (areas I60 to I64 and areas J1 through J18)
to open or shut. If Lady’s Whisper wills a door closed, it
must be Forced Open or battered down.
Unwilling Teleportation (conjuration, divine, teleportation)
When Lady’s Whisper hits and damages a creature with
its claw Strike, it can choose to teleport that creature to
any open space within 15 feet, even if Lady’s Whisper
can’t see the destination. The target can attempt a DC 30
Will saving throw to resist this eﬀect.
I62. OBLIVION FALL
Made of the same dark stone as the rest of the temple, this
passage opens into a rectangular chamber.
Hazard: The chamber at the end of the hall has no
ﬂoor. It’s a bottomless pit that, unlike the hazard in
the Core Rulebook, has no trapdoor; nevertheless,
because it’s set into reﬂective black stone, it’s still
difﬁcult to notice. Lady’s Whisper led aspirants whom
it judged to be useless to Nhimbaloth’s cause into this
pit—forcefully, when necessary.

I63. GARDEN OF FAILURES
TRIVIAL 9
A black-stoned passage opens into this octagonal chamber.
The room is a riot of foul-smelling swamp weeds.
Creatures who made it into the Gate of Nhimbaloth
but were, in their hearts, too afraid to undertake
the initiation tests below were brought here. Often,
Lady’s Whisper gave them comforting words about
how they could simply rest and depart in peace,
but this was a lie—creatures were brought here to
be killed, their blood and essence used to fuel the
cavern’s sunless garden.
Creatures: A single dread wisp ﬂoats in this room,
desperate to feed for the ﬁrst time in many, many years.

I64. INITIATES’ CHAMBER
SEVERE 9
The walls of this room are carved from black stone and
feature four large alcoves, two to the east and two to the
west. Three contain large stone basins ﬁlled with reeds,
moss, and other swamp plants. The basin in the fourth
alcove is empty. Stairs lead downward to the north.
The stairs lead down to area J1.
Creatures: Three dread wisps hover here over
three of the stone basins (the fourth dread wisp
once stationed here was slain long ago, and its basin
now contains only desiccated soil). If the heroes are
accompanied by Lady’s Whisper, two of the dread
wisps follow it and the heroes at a distance, ready to
intervene if the heroes become violent. If the heroes
aren’t with Lady’s Whisper, the dread wisps attack.
