Adventure
Toolbox
Abomination
Vaults
The Abomination Vaults harbor many secrets, but not
all of them are dangerous. Some are useful tools or
fantastically powerful artifacts the heroes can ﬁnd as
they journey into the depths. The new rules the heroes
can ﬁnd by delving into the Abomination Vaults are
presented below.
Alchemical Items
The following alchemical items can be found in this
adventure, usually in the hands (or claws) of the
creatures who manufactured them.
ALCHEMICAL BOMBS
Alchemical bombs are martial thrown
weapons with a range increment of
20 feet. Like all alchemical bombs,
necrotic bombs combine volatile
alchemical
components
that
explode when the bomb hits a
creature or object.
Urdefhans
distill
and
use
necrotic bombs against living
foes, since they don’t need to worry
about dealing splash damage to their
allies in melee range of their targets.
Urdefhan death scouts usually carry
several necrotic bombs and are quick to employ them
against their enemies.

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider
disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a
life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb
deals the listed negative damage and splash damage, and
it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage
harms only living creatures. Many types grant an item
bonus to attack rolls.

The bomb deals 1d6 negative damage and 1 negative splash
damage. On a critical hit, the target is sickened 1.
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 10 gp
You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals
2d6 negative damage and 2 negative splash damage. On a
critical hit, the target is sickened 2.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 250 gp
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 3d6
negative damage and 3 negative splash damage. On a
critical hit, the target is sickened 3.
Type major; Level 17; Price 2,500 gp
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls. The
bomb deals 4d6 negative damage and 4
negative splash damage. On a critical hit, the
target is sickened 4.
ALCHEMICAL ELIXIRS
These consumable alchemical concoctions
have unusual effects. Some seugathi
ﬂeshwarpers brew ichthyosis mutagen
from the rare chemicals they use to break
down their victims’ skin; the elixir has the
reverse effect, toughening the imbiber’s
hide. The heroes can ﬁnd ichthyosis
mutagen tucked away in an storage closet
on the Laboratories level.
Skeptic’s elixir is popular with anyone who
anticipates a tense diplomatic exchange or otherwise
expects to be lied to in the near future. Belcorra and
her guards stashed some skeptic’s elixirs on the higher
levels of the dungeon.
