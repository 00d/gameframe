Attack Now! Ȱɵ Salaisa shouts, and a drow ally within 30
feet that can see or hear Salaisa makes a melee or ranged
Strike as a reaction.
Storm of Blades ʚʖ Salaisa Strides up to her Speed. She
can make up to three longsword Strikes at any point
during this movement, each against a diﬀerent target
within reach. These attacks count toward her multiple
attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t
increase until after she makes all of her attacks. If she
moves half her speed or less during Storm of Blades,
that movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
Treasure: Salaisa’s desk contains suspicious items
conﬁscated from visitors, including a ruby idol of the
evil god Mazmezz worth 40 gp.
I15. COMMON AREA
LOW 9
This large room contains several tables with benches and
a few padded chairs. Heads of strange creatures hang
stuﬀed and mounted on the walls.
The heads are trophies of creatures slain in the
Hunting Grounds. They include an albino basilisk, a
chuul, an ether spider, and a seugathi (page 244).
The secret door on the south wall is one-way; it
doesn’t open from this side and can’t be detected here.
Creatures: There are 2d4 wardens here at any time,
eating meals or swapping stories.
