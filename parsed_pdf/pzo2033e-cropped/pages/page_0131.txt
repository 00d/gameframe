their creators. As grothluts are mindless creatures,
training them is an exceptionally slow process, but the
devils have had a lot of time on their hands.
A barbazu is currently drilling six grothluts here. He
uses his magical bracers to encourage compliance, and
the grothluts follow his orders. The devil is immune to
the grothluts’ piteous moaning. These troops attack as
soon as they see intruders, which likely occurs when
the heroes arrive in area G1.

G4. STORAGE CELLS
LOW 7
These rooms stem oﬀ a long hall and obviously functioned
as prison cells, but the doors stand open. The cells contain
stacks of crates, barrels, and quivers full of arrows.
These former prison cells hold barrels of pitch, jugs
of lantern oil, fuse cord, ﬂint and steel, and hundreds of
arrows—sufﬁcient supplies to destroy a small village.
Only one cell door is locked—the isolation cell to the
west (area G4a). The zebub in this hall holds the key;
the door can also be opened by a hero who succeeds at
three DC 20 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or a DC
25 Athletics check to Force it Open.
Creatures: A zebub named Azvalvigander is
responsible for itemizing this equipment, which
Urevian intends to use against Otari. The fussy zebub
has checked the inventory twice over, doing so again to
ensure she didn’t make any mistakes. Four dreshkans
help her with brute labor and defense.

Treasure: The locked storage room contains valuable,
destructive equipment stored for the inevitable assault
on Otari: a standard explosive arrow, three 3rd-level
spellstrike arrows, three young red dragon’s breath
potions, and 10 moderate alchemist’s ﬁres.
G5. HELLFORGE
MODERATE 7
This chamber’s walls are charred black. Chains hang from
the twenty-foot-tall ceiling, suspending shelves holding tools
and metal ingots. A forge ﬁlls an alcove in the north wall;
its mouth yawns open, ﬁlled with jagged teeth like those of
a great beast, and a blazing ﬁre roars inside. Between the
beast-forge’s horns, a hole in the ceiling captures the smoke
belching from its nostrils. An anvil rests near the forge. The
west wall has a trough of sooty water pushed up against it,
and weapon racks ﬂank the double door on the south wall.
This room once served as a torture chamber, but
Urevian repurposed it for a more efﬁcient use: creating
weapons for his inevitable assault on the surface.
The tiny ventilation shaft extends upwards hundreds
of feet before ending in a large, empty chamber in the
earth, where smoke is trapped until it settles.
Creatures: Urevian assigned forge duty to an erinys
named Barcumbuk, a skilled smith who bristles at
having to produce mundane weapons. He derives
more pride from the laborious and lengthy process of
