clear view into the garden. The window is made from
blocks of enchanted stone that are transparent from
this side but resemble ordinary, natural stone when
viewed from outside. The drow stationed here might
have gotten a good look at the heroes passing by in
area H34, were it not for the fact they keep the curtains
closed most of the time.
Creatures: A drow hunter named Nyzuros and
four drow wardens huddle over a map of the
gardens. Their main concern is the goliath spider
that dwells at the crossroads, as it has already
feasted on two drow scouts. They debate whether
to risk attacking the spider, gaining signiﬁcant
glory for vanquishing such a dangerous foe, or
to summon aid from Yldaris. Nyzuros commands
this contingent, even though Iribo in area H44 is
their most respected ﬁghter. Whether the heroes
make it this far without alerting these drow, or
they’re called into battle by noise, the wardens are
hotheaded and quick to attack. Nyzuros is more
circumspect, however, and wants to know how
and why intruders have come. Like the hunters in
area H41, he has an indifferent attitude toward the
heroes, but his attitude can be improved in the same
way (and, if made friendly or better, he personally
escorts them to Yldaris). The heroes have another
option to get into Nyzuros’s good graces: if they’ve
killed the goliath spider in area H34 and promise to
let Nyzuros and his team take the credit for doing
so, his attitude automatically improves to friendly.
Nyzuros’s forbearance isn’t without limits. If the
heroes have slain other drow, he turns against them.

XP Award: Award the heroes 60 XP if they talk
to Nyzuros rather than ﬁght him. Award them an
additional 80 XP if they successfully negotiate
Nyzuros’s escort into Yldaris, but don’t award this
additional XP if the heroes have already arranged an
escort from the drow in area H41 or from Iribo.
H46. PROVISIONS ROOM
The door to this room is locked, and Nyzuros
has the key. A hero can open it with four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or
a successful DC 29 Athletics check to Force it Open.
This room is plainly used for storage. Casks and bundles
are stacked against its north and west walls.
Treasure: The drow on this level keep their supplies
here, including six weeks of rations, three casks of
water, two casks of fungus wine (worth 2 gp each), ﬁve
longswords, six hand crossbows, 50 bolts, and 50 gp.
