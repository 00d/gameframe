A19. SPOOKYWISP
TRIVIAL 1
The exterior door to this room is stuck, requiring a
successful DC 15 Athletics check to Force Open.
This study features several bookshelves, a desk, and two
chairs. The books and objects here lie in disarray with torn
pages strewn haphazardly across the room.
Volluk once pursued his studies and met with
Belcorra for lessons in this room.
Creatures: Today, a mischievous brownie named
Tangletop—a puckish fey whose eponymous blonde
hair stays in a constant state of frizzy disarray on his
head—occupies this chamber. Despite his comical
appearance, Tangletop fancies himself something of a
spooky sort of fey. As soon as he notices the heroes
approaching, such as if they try to Force Open the
door but don’t succeed at doing so right away, he
quickly slips into hiding under the desk before using
ventriloquism to call out in a deep voice. He claims to
be a dangerous “wispy-ghost” named “Spookywisp.”
He then uses dancing lights to create what he hopes
the heroes believe is a will-o’-wisp, ﬂoating the light
up in the air and using ventriloquism to cast his voice
from the light.
Tangletop arrived here only a few days
ago, but he made short work ripping
through the room’s contents before
ﬁnding nothing of interest to
him. He moved on toward area
A23; there, the shiny spyglass
entranced him before the
soulbound doll that guards
it chased him off. Faced with
an actually scary creature,
Tangletop retreated to this
room to plot methods of
securing
the
“shiny”
for
himself. The heroes give him that
method—see the Side Quest below.
If the heroes attack or confront him
with violence, Tangletop shrieks in fear
and ﬂees toward area A23, hoping
to lure the heroes into that room
so that they inadvertently end up
destroying the soulbound doll.
If they do, he tries to steal the
“shiny” therein before ﬂeeing the
area forever.
TANGLETOP
CREATURE 1
Male brownie (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 44)
Initiative Stealth +9
Side Quest: If the heroes speak to Tangletop, either
in person or via his persona as Spookywisp, the
brownie explains to them that he wants the “shiny”
in the room to the southwest. He warns the heroes
that a mean, beak-faced doll will try to stop them
from getting the “shiny,” but he promises that he’ll
tell the heroes three secrets he has learned about the
area if they bring him the “shiny.” Asked to describe
the “shiny,” Tangletop frustratingly says, “It’s shiny!
You’ll know it when you see it!” Pressed further, he
rolls his eyes and describes it as a “sparkling glowing
tube that I want, want, want!”
The “shiny” refers to the bejeweled spyglass kept
on display in area A23. If the heroes retrieve and hand
it over, the brownie reveals what he recently learned
from the books here as well as from reviewing the
paintings in the hallway between here and the room
where he spotted the spyglass.
First, this building used to belong to someone named
Volluk Azrinae. Second, Volluk was an apprentice to
someone else named Belcorra, and even though this
Volluk person seemed like someone who was mean
and dangerous, Belcorra seemed much worse! Finally,
the spooky magic lighthouse can do more than just
shine an eerie light; it can also shoot a beam
full of ghosts (this last description is based
on Tangletop’s interpretation of the
lighthouse painting in area A22,
but it isn’t far from the truth).
A20. REPAIR STORAGE
Shelves laden with tools, lumber,
and planks line the walls of this
ten-foot-square room.
These supplies were used
for upkeep throughout the
upper
works
of
Gauntlight
Keep. Volluk formerly functioned as a
head groundskeeper and managed repairs.
Considering such mundane tasks beneath his
skills, he often called upon Belcorra’s other
servants as needed for these jobs.
Treasure: Heroes Searching this room
discover a large silver key worth 10 gp.
This key unlocks the door to area B2.
A21. STAIRWELL
Moss and fungus coats these tightly spiraling stairs,
which lead down to area B1. From the state of
the growth, it’s obvious that no one has gone
this way for a long time.
