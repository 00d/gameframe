Shanrigol
Fleshwarpers, regardless of their origin or training, create a shocking
amount of waste. When the discarded remnants of aberrant ﬂesh are
heaped together with an accidental mixture of alchemical compounds or
odious energy, the mass can quicken and regain life. Without the guidance
of a ﬂeshwarper, these aberrant body parts form into a shanrigol, a mess
of bone, muscle, and sinew.
SHANRIGOL HEAP
The most basic and common type of shanrigol is called, based on its
general shape, a shanrigol heap. These amalgamations of warped ﬂesh and
shattered bone establish hunting grounds by accident rather than design,
remaining where prey has been plentiful in the past so they can grow larger
and larger as they add to their jumbled forms. Only rare ﬂeshwarpers
create these abominations willingly, as they ignore all commands and
containment to seek out prey.

Sapping Squeeze Ȱɵ Requirements The shanrigol
has a creature grabbed; Eﬀect The shanrigol
squeezes the life essence from its target,
dealing 1d6+5 bludgeoning and 1d4 persistent
bleed damage (DC 18 basic Fortitude save).
The shanrigol regains temporary Hit Points
equal to half the amount of bludgeoning
damage a single target takes; these temporary
Hit Points last for 1 minute.
Shred Flesh A shanrigol rips ﬂesh away from
targets in great chunks. Creatures critically hit
by the shanrigol’s ﬂeshy slap Strike take an
additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage
and are enfeebled 1 for as long as
they are bleeding.
Undulating Step ʚʖ The shanrigol
separates its ﬂesh from its bones to
ﬁt through small spaces. It Strides,
ignoring diﬃcult terrain and ﬁtting through
tight spaces as though it were a Tiny creature.
It can’t use any actions other than Undulating
Step until it occupies an area large enough for its
normal form.
SHANRIGOL TREASURE
Because these undead aberrations
seek only to absorb more ﬂesh, they
don’t care about material things.
When near a shanrigol’s lair, it’s not
uncommon to see bloody armor,
unsheathed weapons, and intact
potion bottles scattered around the
site of a battle. A shanrigol’s fruitful
ambush location is likely to have
piles of overlooked valuable treasure
from past victims.
