MULVENTOK
Sinister ﬂeshwarpers reshape captive urdefhans into these juggernauts
of war. Their clear skin is hardened into a thick, mirror-like carapace,
creating an intimidating exoskeleton. Mulventoks don’t live long;
within weeks—or, at most, months—their hyperdeveloped muscles
split open their toughened skin, and they erupt in a shower of gore. A
mulventok’s creator shapes its mind just as much as its body, directing
its aggression toward a single purpose, such as to raze a fortress or
murder a speciﬁc individual.

Explosive Decay
(necromancy,
negative,
occult)
When
a
mulventok dies, its mirrored ﬂesh
ruptures and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Creatures caught in the blast are
covered with viscera and take 8d6 negative damage (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save).
Stay in the Fight Ǻȓ (healing, necromancy, occult); Trigger An allied creature
within 30 feet reaches 0 HP; Eﬀect The mulventok imparts some of its own
energy to keep the ally ﬁghting. The target creature gains 1 Hit Point, and the
mulventok takes 2d6 mental damage.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ tamchal chakram +18 (agile, deadly 1d6, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage
1d6+8 slashing plus 1d6 mental

Ranged Ȱɵ tamchal chakram +13 (agile, deadly 1d6, magical, thrown 20
feet), Damage 1d6+8 slashing plus 1d6 mental
Fervent Command Ȱɵ (auditory, mental) The mulventok shouts an order
to one of its allies within 30 feet. That ally immediately takes a
Raise a Shield or Step action. A creature can beneﬁt from Fervent
Command only once per round.
Psychokinetic Honing (occult, transmutation) A thrown
weapon gains the eﬀects of a returning rune when a
mulventok throws it. Thrown weapons the mulventok uses
deal an additional 1d6 mental damage, whether used in melee
or thrown.
MULVENTOK LEADERS
Some ﬂeshwarpers forge small
units of mulventoks to pursue a
similar but important goal, thinking
that if some of the creatures don’t
survive, the others can complete
the objective. Mulventoks work
together surprisingly well, creating
hierarchies of command that shift
as needed in the ﬁeld. Although
mulventoks are arguably just
as eﬀective when working with
non-mulventoks, their singular
focus—which even extends to what
they eat and where and how they
sleep—is oﬀ-putting at best.
