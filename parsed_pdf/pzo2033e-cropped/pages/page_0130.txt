Vaults
This chamber provides easy access to the prison’s cell blocks. Most
doors leading from this room are unlocked and open easily, except for
two described in their respective locations: the secret door to area G2 is
both hidden and locked, and the pentagram-inscribed doors to area G10
are magically sealed.
The stairs leading downward connect to area H1, 100 feet below. The
currently impassable stairs take at least a week of labor to clear. This
level’s denizens likely won’t give the heroes this time without harrying
them, so they can’t effectively clear away the rubble while the devils and
other hostile creatures remain. Urevian agrees to clear the way for the
heroes if they negotiate with him, as described in area G10.
An Eye on the Shaft: This room doesn’t have any guards, but the barbazu
drilling the unit of dreshkans in area G3 to the north likely sees anyone
entering it. That barbazu exhorts his soldiers to attack.
G2. LEVEL 7 PORTAL CHAMBER
A hero who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check spots the secret door
to this room. Pressing a particular stone above the door causes it to rotate
inward, but only an inch or so and just enough to reveal a combination lock
made of metal cylinders. The combination is long lost, but a hero can open
the door with a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Force it Open, or four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. A hero who’s a master
in Thievery recognizes the tumblers as the lock’s most vulnerable part and
can open it with a single successful DC 20 Thievery check.
This room’s ﬂoor gleams under a thin layer of dust. Runes ﬁlled with silver inlay
have been carved into the walls.
This room contains an inert teleportation circle like the ones elsewhere
in the Abomination Vaults (area B17). This teleportation circle must also
be reactivated with the awaken portal ritual.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for activating this portal.
G3. DRILL FIELD
MODERATE 7
This chamber’s well-worn ﬂoor attests to its constant use. The walls angle up to
the ceiling twenty feet overhead. The northern wall has a mine shaft elevator, but
a wall of shimmering orange energy blocks the passage leading into it.
Belcorra welcomed her guests from the Darklands here before leading
them upstairs for entertainment and refreshments. The chamber’s opulence
has diminished over time. Centuries of military drills, sparring, and other
abuses have damaged the walls, which are splattered in blood and ichor.
Urevian pulled in favors from infernal contacts to create a permanent,
glowing wall of force that blocks the elevator’s shaft and sheds dim light
throughout the chamber. He has no personal control over the wall; it’s tied
to the essence of Urevian’s contract. It disappears immediately only when
Urevian’s contract with Belcorra is fulﬁlled, or if he’s slain. Details about
concluding the deal are presented in area G10. The elevator descends 100
feet to area H17; its function is described there, as its in the lower position.
Creatures: Jafaki doesn’t pay much attention to the many grothluts
whom the devils defeated, assuming that the devils slew them all. In truth,
Urevian’s forces have trained the grothluts to ﬁght on their side against
CHAPTER 7 SYNOPSIS
Long ago, Belcorra handed over the
prison level to the contract devil
Urevian and his infernal minions.
They now prepare diligently to
invade the surface, and the level is
on reasonably high alert. The heroes
must ﬁght their way through many
devils and ﬂeshwarp minions. They
might ﬁnd some surprising allies,
including an imprisoned bounty
hunter and an imp named Szek
who’s eager to make a deal. Here,
the heroes can also put an end to
the malevolent creature tormenting
Dorianna Menhemes. When the
heroes ﬁnally meet Urevian, he
extends an oﬀer wrapped in a
diﬃcult moral choice.
Environmental Cues: stench of
brimstone, eerie silence, ﬂickering
ﬂames, smoke, cell doors, infernal
runes carved on surfaces (Urevian
has been spying on Carman Rajani
and thus knows a little about the
heroes. You can play up the ominous
atmosphere by having some of the
heroes’ opponents call them by
their names or predict their general
tactics—particularly anything they’ve
used or discussed around Carman.)
