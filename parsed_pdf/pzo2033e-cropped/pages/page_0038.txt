CHAPTER 2:
The Forgotten Dungeon
While the heroes are free to enter the dungeon below
the keep as soon as they discover any of its entrances,
an important event should take place before they dive
too deeply into the Abomination Vaults. It’s best if this
event takes place at night while the heroes have line of
sight to Gauntlight’s cupola, such as when they retreat
to rest or perhaps even right after they’ve defeated
the vampiric mist in area A25. In any case, the heroes
should be 2nd level for this event. When the timing is
right, begin Deadtide for Otari.
Deadtide for Otari
Gauntlight isn’t yet fully functional, but enough of
its magical power has been restored that Belcorra
activates it as a test ﬁring before proceeding with
the more-involved process of restoring the artifact
to full use. She targets Otari’s graveyard, animating
the dead within it. The ghost then watches through
Gauntlight’s lens, but she can’t do much beyond

deep in the Abomination Vaults. Read or paraphrase
the following to begin this event.
Gauntlight shudders and its light suddenly blazes with a
sickly, pale-blue illumination. This beam arcs south, falling
not directly on Otari, but onto the sprawling graveyard
located at Otari’s western edge.
The light remains ﬁxed on the graveyard and is
visible all the way from Gauntlight to the town. There
isn’t any way for the heroes to impede the beam, as
it emanates magically from Gauntlight and can’t be
stopped from its origin point except by Belcorra’s will.
As the dead are buried, it takes most of them some
time to dig free. Although the heroes might hurry
directly to the graveyard given the sinister implications
of the eerie light, you can still run these events as
written if the heroes ﬁrst take some time to tend to their
wounds or otherwise delay. If the heroes take more
than a couple of hours to arrive, town guards have
already erected a barrier around the cemetery but are
afraid to enter the grounds for fear of the occasional
shufﬂing corpse that pulled itself free sooner than
the others. Dealing with the undead should fall to
the heroes; if they aren’t self-motivated to enter the
