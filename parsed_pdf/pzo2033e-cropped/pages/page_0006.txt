The ghost sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex is the primary
villain of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The
story behind her spiteful rage is one of exile and loss.
Belcorra’s History
The Haruvex family tree both sprawls and surges
with sorcery. The family’s strongest bloodlines have an
aberrant strain, which provides family prestige as well
as sorcerous power. Generations of Haruvexes married
within the family to strengthen this lineage, and the
most powerful Haruvexes lived in Absalom 500 years
ago. These Absalom Haruvexes made secret obeisance
to the Outer Gods for great wealth and greater power.
But none in the family approached the power of their
youngest scion, Belcorra Haruvex. Belcorra had been
told, every day for as long as she could remember,
that she was the harbinger of Nhimbaloth, the Empty
Death, and that she was her family’s greatest hope for
power and prosperity.
The Haruvexes enacted abhorrent rites in their
worship,
including
bloody
sacriﬁces,
and
the
authorities eventually caught wind of their crimes. The
Haruvexes were ﬁnally driven from the Isle of Kortos
in 4219 ar, forced to leave their estates and luxuries
behind. Belcorra was only 6 years old at the time, but
as she grew, her rage at losing her home solidiﬁed into
an overwhelming hatred of Absalom and everyone
in it.
Most of the exiled Haruvexes died in poverty,
but Belcorra grew strong and proud. At 17, she
interpreted visions from Nhimbaloth that led her
back to the Isle of Kortos to plan her revenge. Far
above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called
the Empty Vault, in a lonely stretch of wooded coast
a few dozen miles from Absalom, Belcorra erected a
magical lighthouse and called it Gauntlight. She dug
deep beneath it to reach the shrine she had seen in her
visions, and while she worked, she began to plan her
revenge. She would draw subterranean monsters and
violent beasts into her secret dungeons—which she
called the Abomination Vaults—and use Gauntlight’s
magic to send them into Absalom to wreak havoc.
She enacted the ﬁrst part of her plan, expanding
the Abomination Vaults and raising a defensible
keep around the lighthouse. She leveraged family
acquaintances to acquire powerful retainers and
champions to lead her monstrous forces.
Belcorra was still stocking her Abomination
Vaults with aberrations when rumors of her villainy
reached Absalom. The Roseguard, a group of heroes
headquartered in Absalom, set out from the city to
confront and vanquish her. The Roseguard faced
Belcorra within Gauntlight Keep and killed her there.
One of the four members of the Roseguard, a rogue
named Otari Ilvashti, died in this ﬁght. Grieving their
lost friend, the Roseguard left, sealed up the keep,
founded what would become the town of Otari, and
retired there. They never knew of the keep’s lower levels
or the many creatures still remaining within them.
A DUNGEON FULL OF MONSTERS
The horrors trapped in the Abomination Vaults
developed some measure of ecosystem in the following
centuries. While many monsters beneath the citadel died,
others have prospered, and now several communities
of morlocks, urdefhans, ghouls, and stranger creatures
call the dungeons home. Only the longest-lived
remember any life other than the dungeons. Belcorra
had bound several devils to serve her as overseers and
administrators, and many of these still maintain order.
Apart from the regions maintained by these devils
and a drow outpost in one of the lowest levels, the
Abomination Vaults are lawless and dangerous.
The Abomination Vaults consist of 10 levels,
including the ruins around Gauntlight on the surface.
They’re, from top to bottom, the ruins of Gauntlight
Keep, the servant’s quarters, the library, Belcorra’s
former living chambers, the arena, the laboratories, the
