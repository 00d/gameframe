Creature: Belcorra recently sent a gug named Aulr
to check on Urevian’s progress. Aulr’s unexpected
and unwelcome arrival was one of the intrusions
that convinced Urevian to ﬁnally block access to
the lower levels. Urevian has put off talking to Aulr
because he doesn’t really want to renew or revisit
his deal with Belcorra. Aulr has grown tired of
speaking to Urevian’s underlings and demanded
to have her next conversation with Urevian
himself. If the heroes disturb the gug, she
mistakes them for yet more lackeys and reacts
with sudden and startling violence. She allows
foes who ﬂee to retreat, but she otherwise
ﬁghts to the death.

G9. OBSERVATION ROOM
This tall chamber reaches a height of thirty feet.
Transparent stone makes up the southern wall, which
looks into a vast room ﬁlled with square, transparent
pillars surrounded by a catwalk. A jumble of metal scrap
lies against this transparent wall.
While transparent from this side, the
southern wall appears opaque from the
other side. Strategists could look out over
the stasis chamber to the south to select
creatures to transport with Gauntlight. The
metal scrap used to be a high catwalk, but the gug
in area G8 wrecked it in a fury when Urevian sent
a barbazu to provide a summary report rather than
personally meeting with her.
Creature: An imp named Szek ﬂutters near the
ceiling, holding a small notebook and charcoal pencil.
She records observations about the various prisoners
with recommendations on how to use them in the
upcoming invasion of Otari. Sample entries include
“gibbering mouther—ground manipulation could
disable or destroy bridges, such as the tavern bridge
near river mouth.”
When Szek detects the heroes, she casts invisibility
and attempts to parlay rather than ﬁght.
“Close the door! Close the door! I don’t want to get caught
talking to you—you’ll get us all tortured. So, surface
dwellers, eh? Glad to see you. You’re taking down Urevian,
right? Nasty devil. Bad business keeping him around—
yup, yup, yup. How about we leave each other alone and
pretend we never saw each other?”
Although perfectly happy if the heroes leave, Szek
will speak to them if broached. Her starting attitude
is indifferent, and she remains invisible until the
heroes change her attitude to friendly, which requires
a character to succeed at a DC 17 Diplomacy check to
Make an Impression (as that’s Szek’s Will DC).
Szek tires of running menial errands for Urevian.
She’s looking for someone more pliable to serve
and hopes to enter into a devil’s luck infernal
contract (page 218) with someone. If
the heroes improve her attitude, she not
only offers this contract, but answers
questions as best she can (whether or
not they take the contract).
