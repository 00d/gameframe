Murmur isn’t likely to pose much of a challenge
for 8th-level characters, but she’s an indication that
something strange is afoot. She ﬁghts with her bow,
which she only barely remembers how to use, if
creatures remain at a distance. If foes close in, she drops
her bow and ﬂees into area H29 to join her master.
MURMUR
CREATURE 7
Female feebleminded medusa (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 234)
Initiative Perception +10
Side Quest: Restoring Murmur’s mind is a challenge,
but it isn’t impossible. If the heroes restore her, the
medusa introduces herself as Moadenn and offers to
ﬁght alongside them for a few days before striking
off on her own. She’s bossy and cruel, so the heroes
might not want her aid; she’s perfectly happy to depart
sooner if the heroes don’t want her around.
H39. LAIR OF THE DREAMER
MODERATE 8
Three alcoves in this square chamber are overgrown with
a tangle of thin mushroom stalks and creeping, ﬂowering
vines. The air smells sweet and heady.
The alcoves each contain stone basins, like those in
areas H2 and H11. They used to provide a connection
to the swamps below, but the nilith lairing here didn’t
want the interruption. It pulled the muck from the
basins, coated their interiors with a fungal resin, and
repurposed them as planters to grow vegetation that
remind it of its former home in the Dreamlands. If the
heroes clean them out, they reﬁll with fetid swamp
water once again, and a will-o’-wisp (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 333) appears above each. Their observation
triggers the Belcorra Attacks! event, as described in the
sidebar on page 146.
Soporific Pollen: The pollen in the air gives living
creatures in the room (except the nilith) a –1 circumstance
penalty on Will saves. This is an olfactory effect.
Creatures: The nilith climbs around on the vines in
this room, idly tending the ﬂowers. It is bored with
Murmur and is looking for other minds to twist, but
it’s willing to engage in conversation ﬁrst if the heroes
seem amenable. It talks about how the basins connect
to some malignant swamp far down, and it proudly
shows off its means of sealing them with resin to grow
its own strange garden. As it talks, it tries to rank the
heroes from the weakest mind to the strongest, so it
knows who to target best with its mental attacks. It
might propose puzzles or riddles to ﬁnd this out or ask
the heroes about their recent dreams.
