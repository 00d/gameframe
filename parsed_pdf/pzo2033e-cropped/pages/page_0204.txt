A circular pool of swamp water sits at the center of this
square chamber. The pool is fed by a channel in the west wall,
between two sets of black stone double doors. The water
ﬂows out to the north, through a metal dam. A thick knot of
writhing reeds, like a grotesque tree, rises from the pool.
The pool and channels are only six inches deep, which
is why the room ﬂoods so easily when the dam is closed.
Creature: The writhing here is caused by an isqulug
infestation. When the heroes arrive, the grotesque
aberration moves out of the reeds to attack. While a
malevolent creature, it isn’t afﬁliated with Nhimbaloth
and recalls very little about how its larvae came here ages
ago. If reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, the isqulug
casts control water to raise the water in this room by 10
feet and, it hopes, gain an advantage in the ﬁght. When
destroyed, its larvae scatter in the water and slip into the
swamp below—in time, to grow a new host body.

J18. MAW OF THE GODDESS
LOW 10
The vaulted ceiling of this massive chamber reaches eighty
feet high and is carved with intricate patterns of bones,
swamp weeds, and misty swirls. To the south stands a huge
dais, its stone carved into crooked, cracked teeth. Upon the
dais rests a massive skull, its eye sockets empty and its visage
menacing. A channel of ﬁlthy water cuts across this room,
emerging from the base of the walls on the east and west side.
Double doors bracket each channel outlet.
The wall behind the giant skull hides a secret door,
partially outlined in moisture and easier to find than
normal. A successful DC 20 Perception check while
Searching this area locates it.
Creature: If the heroes have yet to defeat Lady’s
Whisper, it’s waiting on the dais. It doesn’t point toward
any direction, but instead walks slowly toward the
heroes. It whispers, “I know that you are pretenders.
Deﬁlers. You should not be here. Nhimbaloth thinks
you serve some purpose to her plans, but I disagree.”
Lady’s Whisper then attacks to stop the heroes’
progress. It uses its unwilling teleportation ability to
shunt the heroes into area J14 if it can, so they have
to take the time to come around through the swamp
again. Lady’s Whisper ﬁghts until destroyed.

J19. PASSAGE TO THE DEPTHS
SEVERE 10
A smooth, natural cavern winds its way through the
darkness, ending in a larger chamber with a wide pit at the
far side. A corpse is slumped at the pit’s edge.
The pit is hundreds of feet deep and leads to even
deeper places in the Darklands. Its challenges are
beyond the scope of this Adventure Path.
The corpse is a messily killed humanoid of a strange
appearance: two heads and a chitinous body. The
irlgaunt in the pit hollowed it out and ﬁlled it with
gravel, so it makes a clattering noise when disturbed
unless it’s handled very carefully.
Creatures: Although this passage hasn’t been used
in centuries, it isn’t wholly abandoned. A crab‑like
irlgaunt from deeper in the Darklands lurks in the pit.
When the irlgaunt hears activity in the room above,
such as the clattering of gravel from the gruesome
alarm it made, it skitters up the pit and arrives in 2
rounds. It retreats, abandoning its potential meal, if
reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points.

Treasure: The odd corpse still wears a strange

J20. EMPTY VAULT
EXTREME 10
This strangely shaped chamber is humid and oppressively
clammy. The room’s four wings each contain a massive
pool of bubbling swamp water. Flickering motes of light
and darkness play underneath the surface of the pools. The
chamber’s center is partially blocked by a circle of towering
black standing stones, which crackle with eerie energy
that shoots up into a shaft in the ceiling. Seven narrow
channels, as though dug into the stone by a seven-ﬁngered
hand, run from each pool and three of the walls to a moat in
the center of the room. From there, the water ﬂows under
the wall to the east, between a pair of black stone double
doors. An island in the moat holds a smooth altar topped
with a black lens the size of a ﬁst.
The Empty Vault has always been a generation pit for
the wisps who serve Nhimbaloth. A funnel of swamp,
despair, and ghostly energies, it’s mystically connected
to the various swamp plant basins throughout the lower
Abomination Vaults. Any follower of Nhimbaloth can
telepathically communicate with wisps adjacent to the
basins from here.
