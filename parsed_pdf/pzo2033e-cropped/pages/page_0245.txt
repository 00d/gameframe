Seugathi
The wicked, alien neothelids (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 181) impregnate
themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor
creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic
drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids’ far-reaching
plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward
humanoid life.
SEUGATHI SERVANT
The most common seugathis spawned by neothelids are seugathi servants.
Their masters equip them with tools useful in their tasks (often a wand
and a weapon), and they rarely value other material things beyond their
usefulness in completing their imprinted mission.

Mindfog Aura (enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn
in the aura must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become confused
for 1 round; on a success, that creature is temporarily immune
for 1 minute. A seugathi can suppress or activate this aura
as a single action with the concentrate trait.
Command Confusion Ǻȓ Trigger A creature fails
its save against the seugathi’s mindfog
aura; Eﬀect The seugathi determines
who the confused creature
attacks for that round, instead
of the target being randomly determined
by the GM. If the chosen target
is the confused creature’s ally,
the creature can immediately
attempt a DC 21 Will save;
on a success, its target is
determined randomly as normal
for confusion, and on a critical
success the target is no longer
confused.

SEUGATHI OBSESSIONS
Because of their singlemindedness,
seugathis often come across as
eerily obsessive. These obsessions
can include corralling 100 deros
into a cave, collecting skulls of a
certain shape, or even more unusual
tasks that either have no apparent
result or are harmful to the seugathi
themself. A seugathi that completes
their mission nearly always ﬁnds
another to replace it buried in its
psyche, creating a centuries-long
chain of inscrutable—and sometimes
even contradictory—commands.
