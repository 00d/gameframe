C37. SECRET SCRIPTORIUM
A worktable covered with blank scrolls and papers
sits against the eastern wall of this room. A
cabinet with several closed drawers stands to
the north.
There are ﬁve locked drawers in
the cabinet; each can be opened
by a hero using the key from area
C36, succeeding at three DC 20
Thievery checks to Pick a Lock,
or with a successful DC 16
Athletics check to Force it
Open. Several books are
stored within—copies of
texts produced by scribes and
once intended for sale or as
gifts to Belcorra’s allies in other
lands, all of whom are now dead.
These books consist of 2 Bulk for
Morlibint, though.
Not all of the scrolls on the desk are
blank; one tucked beneath the others
is an infernal contract. This contract
was meant to be stored deeper in the Abomination
Vaults, but it never quite made it there. A character
who can read Infernal and takes 10 minutes to look
over the contract learns that this is the devil Korlok’s
contract that binds him as a guardian. A reader who
succeeds at a DC 18 Perception or Society check, or
who’s trained in Legal Lore, notes a loophole that
can release the devil if it’s brought to his attention
(area C8).
Treasure: There are 2 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint.
C38. AUTHORS’ HALL
MODERATE 3
Long shelves with several chairs drawn up to them ring
this room on all sides, save the north. Rancid stains of old
blood and decay cake the shelves and ﬂoor.
Belcorra’s scribes once used this room to pen new
works. The Cult of the Canker now use it as a place to
store victims of ghoul fever until they die and arise as
ghouls. There are no bodies stored here now, but the
heroes can ﬁnd ample evidence of the suffering and
death that has occurred here.
A hero who Searches the south wall and succeeds at
a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds a section of shelving
that folds down to allow access to a secret door
leading to area C39.
Creatures: A pair of ghoul cultists are having a
spirited debate on whether or not ﬂesh “ripened” by
violet fungi tastes better than naturally decayed
meat. They’re distracted enough that they don’t
overhear the sounds of combat in area C33,
but they attack any intruders they notice.

C39. GUARD ROOM
A
small
alcove,
its
ﬂoor
decorated with a silvery circle
of inlaid runes, sits in the
eastern wall of this empty room.
This room once housed a
bound devil who served as one
of Belcorra’s guardians, but this
creature’s contract expired long ago,
releasing her back to Hell.
C40. POOL
MODERATE 3
The dripping, sloshing sound of water ﬁlls this large cavern
chamber. The air is cold and damp, and to the east sits a
sizable pond. A lazy rivulet of overﬂow trickles to the north
down a sloping tunnel, while a ﬁve-foot-diameter opening
gapes in the ceiling above the center of the pool.
The pool here is 5 feet deep and was once used as
a source of drinking water for these levels; the hole in
the ceiling 15 feet above leads up 25 more feet to the
well in area B23, while the downward sloping tunnel
to the north leads to area D14.
Creatures: A gibbering mouther has dwelt in this
cavern for decades. It periodically crawls along the
tunnel to area C2 to hunt bats and rats. It immediately
attacks intruders and pursues foes as best it can. The
monster doesn’t differentiate between the heroes
and other denizens, so a canny group might lure
the gibbering mouther into a ﬁght against ghouls,
morlocks, or other creatures.

Treasure: Heroes Searching the pond discover 190
cp and 64 sp under the well opening. These offerings
were tossed here by superstitious servants ages ago.
