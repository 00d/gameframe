18. DAWNFLOWER LIBRARY
Otari’s largest temple stands at the
town’s westernmost edge, atop an
upraised shelf that juts out far
below the clifftop. The library is
constructed in the Qadiran style
of Sarenite temples, with two
smaller minarets ﬂanking a golden
dome. The building’s position allows it
to catch the rays of the rising sun,
which transforms the dome into
a brilliantly glowing testament to
the sun goddess—at least, on days that
aren’t fogged in or overcast.
A dozen acolytes of various faiths
attend to Dawnﬂower Library. Shrines to
Cayden Cailean, Erastil, and Gozreh can be found in
the western portion of the building, while the primary
shrine to Sarenrae takes up the eastern portion. The
rest of the building contains the stacks. Dawnﬂower
Library has a wide range of books ranging from
ﬁction to history, satire to textbook, and even includes
a sizable collection of (mostly) tasteful erotica. The
current head priestess of the library is a chatty halﬂing
woman named Vandy Banderdash, a devotee of
Sarenrae. Always eager to greet newcomers regardless
of their faith or vocation—with the exception of
thieves, whom she can’t abide—Vandy has a strange
knack for recommending literature tailored to the
tastes of people she only just met.

19. STONE RING POND
Two dozen standing stones, each exactly 12 feet
high, stand sentinel around the shores of this shallow
pond. These stones were raised generations ago by the
church of Gozreh soon after Otari was retaken from
the Stonescale kobolds and have remained a place of
worship for druids, rangers, and naturalists ever
since. The waters of the pond are unusually
reﬂective but, despite whispered rumors,
aren’t magical.
A small cabal of nomadic clerics and
druids faithful to Gozreh include Stone
Ring Pond in their peregrinations,
and there’s always a few temporarily
camping nearby. For the most part,
these travelers have avoided contact
with Otari for 30 years, ever since one
of their number, Jaul Mezmin, soured
their relationship with the town. A
werewolf who had kept his nature from
even the other priests, Jaul lost control
one night and slaughtered a half dozen
locals before he was driven over the
cliffside into the ocean below. His body
was never recovered.
About
ﬁve
years
after
Jaul’s
disappearance, an idealistic gnome druid named
Worliwynn heard of Jaul’s rampage and came to Otari
speciﬁcally to repair the damage the werewolf had done
to the Gozrens’ reputation and guide locals interested
in living in greater harmony with the land. A generation
later, Worliwynn has been largely successful, with the
signiﬁcant exception of still-grieving Keeleno Lathenar.
Worliwynn shares more than grief with Keeleno.
She also suspects that Jaul survived his fall from the
cliff. She patrols the Otari hinterlands nightly, vigilant
for any sign that Jaul might have returned to his old
hunting grounds.

or capturing him.
