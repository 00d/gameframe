Cheek Pouches Ryta has stretchy cheek pouches that can
store up to 1 cubic foot of objects (though no more than
four light items). She can remove or store an item using
the Interact action. As long as she has at least one
object in her cheek pouches, her speech is noticeably
diﬃcult to understand.
Swarming Ryta can end her movement in the same square
as an ally that also has this ability. Only two such
creatures can share the same space.
Vocal Warm-Up Ȱɵ Ryta sets up devastating vibrations that
echo in her throat and her cheek pouches. Until the start
of her next turn, her fangs Strikes deal an additional 2d8
sonic damage. Ryta can’t use Vocal Warm-up if she has
an object in her cheek pouches.
F19. BACK STAGE
Stands for music, a folded velvet curtain, and the wooden
cutout of a tree clutter this small space.
Props for the stage are stored here when not in use.
Gulzash usually sleeps on the folded curtain.
Treasure: The velvet curtain is in very good
condition and worth 10 gp, although it weighs 5 Bulk
and smells vaguely of xulgath stink. Folded up within
it is a clandestine cloak. Anyone Searching the room or
taking the curtain as loot discovers the cloak.
F20. LOWER OBSERVATION DECK
MODERATE 6
This long chamber is rounded on both ends with a door
to the north and a curved wall of transparent stone to the
south. A faint stink wafts from an exit in the west wall.
This observation area permits an intimate view
of the arena ﬁghts. Since viewing the spectacle is a
bit better from the higher arena balconies, usually
trainers or ﬂeshwarpers watched the ﬁghts here to get
a close and detailed view of the action.
Creatures: A seugathi servant observes the shanrigol
behemoth in the arena and takes notes in a large tome.
Their two dreshkan bodyguards stand ready to defend
them from any trouble. The seugathi fanatically
protects their research, screeching for the dreshkans to
enter melee while the seugathi wields a sword in one
tentacle and uses the other to keep their book away
from foes. The seugathi also carries a tarnished silver
key that unlocks the door to the main laboratory
(area F25).
