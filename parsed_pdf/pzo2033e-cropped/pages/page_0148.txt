bioluminescent fungus is common in overgrown areas. The caverns reach
50 feet high, but the ceilings in rooms carved out of the stone are much
lower. Ceilings in the areas claimed by the Cult of Urthagul (areas H2
to H10) are only 10 feet high. Ceilings in other interior areas are sized
for the Children of Belcorra and are only 8 feet high. Sturdy planks of
fungal wood form the doors. They are crusted with mold and give off an
unpleasantly earthy, rotten smell.
The map of the Farm level appears on page 144.
H1. OVERGROWN STAIRS
The smell of rot and mildew pervades the air of this enclosed staircase. At the
base, a moist carpet of fungus, slime, and mold grows thickly on the walls.
The western wall of the passage contains a secret door leading into
Gauntlight’s footprint (area H37) that’s magically locked and can’t be
broken open. A hero spots the door’s faint outline with a successful DC
15 Perception check. It has a concave indentation, and it only opens when
touched with a fulcrum lens.
H2. HALL OF EYES
MODERATE 8
Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to the south. The four
easternmost alcoves each contain a large stone planter ﬁlled with muddy water
that reeks like a dismal swamp. Two scorch marks on the ground near the
eastern door surround piles of dark rags. The pommel of a blade peeks out from
underneath one of the rag piles.
The basins are magically connected to the swamp in the Temple level
far below (area J15). They remain ﬁlled with the swamp’s waters, and the
will-o’-wisps here can use them to transmit images to Belcorra.
The scorch marks and rags are the remains of two calignis who ran
afoul of this room’s denizens.
Creatures: A will-o’-wisp hovers over each basin, although they
appear at ﬁrst to be merely decorative lights. They telepathically report
on the heroes’ actions until they’re attacked or until the heroes try to
leave this chamber. At that point, the will-o’-wisps spring into action and
ﬁght until destroyed.
Belcorra should attack the heroes (see the sidebar on page 148) sometime
shortly after this encounter.

H3. HAZY SHRINE

An unusual scent, as of burning fungus, is apparent to anyone approaching
any of the doors to this chamber.
A haze of smoke with a pungent but not entirely unpleasant scent emanates
from a large copper cauldron atop a bed of coals on a dais to the east. A metal
CHAPTER 8 SYNOPSIS
The chapter begins with the heroes
descending into the overgrown
Farm level from either entrance in
the Prison level above. The primary
denizens, other than feral monsters,
are listless undead gnomes and
addled caligni cultists, both of
whom can provide some clues about
Belcorra’s return. The heroes will
likely face Belcorra in person for the
ﬁrst time—but certainly not the last!
Environmental Cues: glowing
moss, creeping tendrils of mold,
decaying wood, distant splashing,
foul mists, muddy footprints, smells
of earthy rot, towering fungi
