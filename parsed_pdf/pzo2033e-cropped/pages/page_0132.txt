creating hellforged weapons, so his overall productivity
over the centuries has been relatively modest.
The devils realize that the heroes must have
defeated Azvalvigander and her bodyguards to get
here, and they’re openly appreciative of the exacting
zebub’s demise. They still attack the heroes, however.
Barcumbuk ﬁghts with his ﬁery forge hammers; he has
the ﬂames of fury ability common to erinyes, so any
weapon he holds gains the effects of the ﬂaming rune
while he holds it. The barbazu uses a magical hellforged
glaive (making its damage considerably greater than
that of a typical barbazu). The devils ﬁght to the death.

The Hellforge: The heroes lack the skills to use
the evil hellforge as anything but an ordinary
forge, but they can certainly destroy it. A hero
who succeeds at a DC 22 Crafting or Religion
check to Recall Knowledge remembers that even
a small amount of holy water splattered on
an infernal forge can destroy it (on a critical
success, the hero also remembers that doing
so releases a blast of energy). If the heroes
splatter the hellforge with holy water, it
cracks down the middle with a mighty
groan. It deals 4d6 sonic damage and 4d6
evil damage (DC 23 basic Fortitude save) to creatures
in the room.
Treasure: Special metals Barcumbuk hasn’t gotten
around to forging are stacked neatly near the anvil: ﬁve
cold iron chunks (10 gp each), two silver chunks (10 gp
each), and an adamantine chunk (500 gp).
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for destroying
the hellforge.
