E26. ARENA BALCONY
This section represents only the top half of a massive
arena. The arena ﬂoor (area F26) holds the majority of
the threat here.
A wide walkway around this cavernous chamber looks out
over a stone arena ﬂoor thirty feet below. Six balconies
with built-in seating provide the best view. Each balcony
has a bright torch jutting from it, illuminating the
entire arena while leaving this viewing level shrouded
in shadows. An enormous metal gong on the eastern
end of the chamber hangs on thick chains. Two steep
staircases lead down from the central balcony on the
north side of the arena ﬂoor.
Belcorra and her guests watched the blood
sports from sumptuous seating here, cheering
on the gladiators as they faced off against each
other or against terrifying monsters. The north central
balcony has two large levers and crank wheels to
control each of the portcullises at the bottom of the
stairs that lead to the arena ﬂoor. Anyone exploring
this balcony likely draws the attention of the basilisks
lairing nearby in the grand concourse (area E10).
The heroes can easily see the gargantuan shanrigol
behemoth on the arena ﬂoor from here. Unless
they make an absurd amount of noise or attack the
shanrigol, it remains dormant (probably for the best if
the heroes are still only 5th level).
A secret door on the eastern balcony is difﬁcult to
spot. A character who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception
check locates it, and they also determine the special
series of knocks that turns the door ghostly and
incorporeal, allowing the heroes to pass through.
Treasure: The six torches burning at the balconies
are all everburning torches and take a minimal amount
of effort to remove.
