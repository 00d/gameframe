Creatures: Murschen is a rare skulk who enjoys
public attention. Once lauded as his town’s best brawler,
he started exploring the world in search of fame and
wealth, and to further his ability to hurt people who
consider themselves strong. Eventually, Murschen came
here with the notion that the seugathis could make him
an even better warrior. Jafaki believes Murschen will
make an excellent candidate for ﬂeshwarping, so they
shower the skulk with treasure and pit him against their
ﬁnest monstrosities in the testing grounds (area F9). A
sigil on Murschen’s forehead reads “victor” in Aklo.
Murschen hasn’t ﬁgured out that the seugathis don’t
intend to let him leave once they’ve experimented on
him or that their experiments will likely result in a
tortured existence. He feels like he’ll be able to take
whatever physical improvements the seugathis offer
and return to a life of seeking championships on the
surface again.
Murschen doesn’t like being outnumbered and
therefore doesn’t pick a ﬁght with the heroes right
away, yet he doesn’t want to simply let them go.
He attempts to make his way past the heroes to the
lever to release the ghasts. Once the undead have
softened up the heroes, Murschen plans to beat them
to death. He doesn’t realize that the ghasts are just
as likely to attack him as the heroes. Murschen ﬂees
the Abomination Vaults altogether if reduced to fewer
than 20 Hit Points.

Flurry of Blows Ȱɵ Frequency once per turn; Eﬀect
Murschen makes two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the
same creature, combine their damage for the purposes
of resistances and weaknesses. Murschen’s multiple
attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes.
Red Ruin Stance Ȱɵ (stance) Requirement Murschen is
unarmored; Eﬀect Murschen takes the stance of the
red ruin, designed to tear away chunks of ﬂesh like a
ferocious beast. Murschen can make red claw unarmed
attacks. These attacks deal 1d10 slashing damage; are
in the brawling group; and have the ﬁnesse, sweep, and
unarmed traits. While in this stance, when Murschen
would reduce his frightened condition value by 1, he
reduces it to 0.
Sneak Attack Murschen’s Strikes deals an additional 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Side Quest: Murschen has met the urdefhan pugilist
Vischari a time or two. If the heroes take the time to talk
with the skulk, he mentions that he wants nothing more
than a one-on-one brawl with her to determine who’s
best. Vischari has never taken Murschen’s challenges
seriously, and the seugathis consider her too useful as
the manager of the Warped Brew to force her into the
arena. If the heroes agree to set up a match between
them, Murschen lets them leave to do so.
Vischari won’t agree to a ﬁght unless the heroes are
on good terms with her (such as if they bested Shadow
Malice). To convince her, a hero must succeed at a DC
23 Diplomacy check (Vischari’s Will DC) convinces
her to accept Murschen’s challenge. The two set up an
exhibition match on the Warped Brew’s stage, wagering
Murschen’s magical handwraps against the contents of
Vischari’s ofﬁce safe. The two are evenly matched, so
you can decide who wins; neither combatant will be
in any shape to challenge the heroes in the aftermath.
Whether or not the heroes threaten to pounce upon
them in this moment of weakness, the victor considers
the possibility and offers the spoils from the ﬁght if the
heroes agree to leave them alone thereafter.
Treasure: The heroes can ﬁnd the skulk’s treasures
stashed under a bench: a gold and emerald ring worth
40 gp, a ruby-encrusted dagger worth 70 gp, and a ﬁne
mithral bracelet worth 20 gp.
F23. STORAGE CLOSET
Cluttered tools, scraps of wood, and furniture are
haphazardly stacked in this cramped room.
