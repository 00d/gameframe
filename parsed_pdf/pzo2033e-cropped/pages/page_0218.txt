Icons of the Roseguard
The founders of Otari each had a single item imbued
with the essence of their abilities as adventurers. Two
of these are mundane items, invested with a spark
of magic sufﬁcient to keep them from deteriorating
over the years: Otari Ilvashti’s inﬁltrator’s thieves’
tools (which the heroes can ﬁnd in area D18) and
Zarmavdian’s spellbook, Thresholds of Truth. Vol
Rajani’s sword and Aesephna Menhemes’s brooch are
magic items. Otari’s thieves’ tools
are no different than standard
inﬁltrator’s thieves tools; the
other three items are described
here in detail.
The Roseguard didn’t realize
that these items would become icons
imbued with their essence, of course;
this occurred after their deaths, when
they’d already put their adventuring gear
away for their well-earned retirement. (Of
course, each member of the Roseguard had
other useful, if mundane, adventuring gear,
much of which is on display in the town
museum in Menhemes Manor as historical relics.)
Otari Ilvashti only learned that these speciﬁc items
are critical to bypassing the ward that blocks the
Abomination Vaults’ lower levels once he returned as
a ghost and witnessed the barrier’s creation.
COOPERATIVE BLADE
This longsword has been in the Rajani family for
years, and Vol Rajani carried it throughout her
distinguished adventuring career. Despite
its pristine and gleaming appearance, the
Cooperative Blade is incredibly ancient,
created in pre-Earthfall Nidal. The
Cooperative Blade is normally on
display at the Dawnﬂower Library,
but Carman Rajani steals it from the
library at the beginning of Chapter 5.

Price 250 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This +1 striking longsword has a mirror-like
blade free of tarnish despite being millennia old. While
wielding it, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to Aid. If
you’re an expert with the skill or attack roll you’re using
to Aid and you critically succeed, you grant your ally a +3
circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a
+2 bonus.
HUNTER’S BROOCH
Aesephna Menhemes, a cleric of Erastil, wore this
brooch during her time as an adventurer. She passed
it down to her descendants, and it’s now on display in
Menhemes Manor.

TRANSMUTATION
Price 80 gp
Usage worn; Bulk L
While wearing this silver religious symbol
of Erastil, you can cast the disrupt undead
cantrip as an innate divine spell.
Activate ̂ˬ command, Interact;
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect By
touching a weapon you wield to
the symbol and uttering a plea for
Erastil’s steadying hand, you
grant that weapon the deadly
d12 trait. Against undead, the
weapon instead gains the fatal
d12 trait. This blessing lasts
for 1 minute, until you score a critical
hit with the weapon, or until you aren’t
wielding the weapon.
THRESHOLDS OF TRUTH
Zarmavdian’s spellbook, Thresholds of Truth, was
once a straightforward treatise on arcane and occult
lore containing several useful spells. It’s been so heavily
annotated, however, that the original text is hard to
read. It’s clear that Zarmavdian wanted to prevent
eldritch creatures from manipulating innocent
minds, but his spellbook is a treasure trove for
those seeking dangerous or inscrutable lore. The
bookseller Morlibint currently keeps this book in
his collection at Odd Stories.
Thresholds of Truth provides
access to the Eldritch Researcher
archetype (page 228) and contains
the following spells.
Cantrips: chill touch, dancing lights,
daze, detect magic, electric arc, ghost
sound, mage hand, light, prestidigitation,
read aura, shield
1st Level: alarm, charm, color spray,
mage armor, magic missile, true strike,
unseen servant
2nd Level: comprehend language, dispel magic, false
life, glitterdust, web
3rd Level: haste, lightning bolt, locate, paralyze, slow
4th Level: clairvoyance, daydreamer’s curse (page
224), resilient sphere
