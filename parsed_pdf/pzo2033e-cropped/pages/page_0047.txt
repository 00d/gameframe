B18. RUINED BOAT LAUNCH
At the north end of this small cave, the mouth of a swampy,
ﬂooded cavern yawns. A few ruined rowboats lie in heaps
on the ﬂoor of this cavern, strewn next to tangled coils of
rope. Remnants of a pulley system hang from the ceiling.
When Belcorra’s servants lived, they used this area to
move supplies from the boathouse (area A16) using a
pulley system to ferry a ﬂoating platform between here
and the pier, but that setup fell into disrepair long ago.
Several swaths of disturbed earth litter the muddy
ﬂoor between this cavern and the ﬂooded cavern to
the north, as though left by the movement of a large,
serpentine creature. A hero who Investigates the tracks
and succeeds at a DC 18 Arcana check to Recall
Knowledge realizes they were left by a drake (on a
critical success, the hero knows it’s a river drake).
B19. FLOODED CAVERN
LOW 2
Tangles of roots hang from the low ceiling of this ﬂooded
cavern, the roof of which is a mere three feet above the
murky water.
During the day, muted sunlight ﬁlters into this
cavern from an exit to the northwest, but even on
rare sunny days, the overhanging pier at area A17 and
dangling roots keep this room dim. The water in the
cavern is, on average, 10 feet deep.
Creatures: A river drake named Freznelkesh
has dwelt in this cavern for nearly two years. She’s
careful to limit her hunting to Fogfen, so no one in
Otari knows she exists. She was out hunting when
the Crook’s Nook thieves
came
through,
but
she
returned soon after and
cut off their easy escape
route (leading to their
eventual capture by
the morlocks).
Freznelkesh is likely
to be sleeping in the
water in the middle
of the cavern, and she
swiftly wakes up if she
hears the splashing of
potential food swimming
above. If reduced to fewer
than 10 Hit Points, she ﬂees
and doesn’t return for a few
days. She pursues foes that ﬂee
into area B18 or out into the
swamp, but she learned the hard
way about the dangerous mold at area
B20 and won’t pursue potential prey there.
