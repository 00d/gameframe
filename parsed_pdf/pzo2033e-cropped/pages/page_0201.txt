J11. PATH OF FAILURE
This path widens and turns south opposite the single
narrow door. Its walls are a riot of swirling images.
The occult magic in this hall pulls personalized
memories from the viewer, as in area J10, but these
memories are all failures: mentors scolding the viewer,
authorities punishing them, or lost friends crying. You
can also pull from any signiﬁcant failures a hero had
during this Adventure Path, such as needing to ﬂee a
signiﬁcant foe or triggering a damaging trap.
Hazard: This room’s images worm into the victim’s
mind. The heroes can Avert their Gaze (Core Rulebook
472) from these images and gain that action’s bonus
to saving throws required by this hazard, even though
these illusions are more than merely visual.
IMAGES OF FAILURE
HAZARD 12
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 35 (expert) to realize the illusory images conceal
a magical trap (noticing the images has a DC of 0)
Description Psychically enhanced illusions ﬂood the minds
of creatures in the 40-foot-long, 15-foot-wide hallway
(the white dotted box on the map) with memories of
their past failures.
Disable DC 32 Occultism (master) or dispel magic (5th
level; counteract DC 26) to weaken the images; three
successes are required to disable the trap
Echoes of Defeat Ȳ˓ (curse, emotion, enchantment, mental)
Trigger A creature ends a move action within the trap’s
area; Eﬀect The triggering creature takes 2d10+10
mental damage (DC 32 basic Will save) as it recalls its
past failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft
whisper oﬀering, “Let me take something from you and
I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access
to a random skill feat that isn’t a prerequisite for another
feat, and the creature doesn’t take further damage from
Echoes of Defeat. This eﬀect lasts for 1 week and can be
ended by eﬀects that remove curses.
Reset The trap resets immediately and can aﬀect the same
creature multiple times on the creature’s turn.
J12. PATH OF POWERLESSNESS
The walls, ﬂoor, and ceiling of this long hall swirl with
overlapping, shifting images.
This hall’s occult magic manifests images drawn
from the viewer’s mind, as in areas J10 and J11, but
these images predict failure in the future. Viewers see
themselves growing inﬁrm, succumbing to disease, or
falling in battle against Belcorra.
The secret door leading north doesn’t open from
this side. The secret door to the east is the only way
to leave and complete the Challenge of Despair; those
who couldn’t ﬁnd this hidden exit eventually died
from the torment in the images. Anyone more than
20 feet from the secret door can’t see it due to the
overlapping images, but anyone within 20 feet who
Seeks in the area discovers it with a successful DC 27
Perception check. A hero who Searches the hall (which
isn’t possible while the trap is active, as the heroes
are in encounter mode rather than exploration mode)
ﬁnds the secret door automatically.
Hazard: This trap is similar to the one in area J11,
though its area is much larger, as it ﬁlls the entire long
hallway. The heroes can also Avert their Gaze from the
images in this trap as well, if they choose.
IMAGES OF POWERLESSNESS
HAZARD 12
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 35 (expert) to realize the illusory images conceal
a magical trap (noticing the images has a DC of 0)
Description Psychically-enhanced illusions ﬂood the minds
of creatures in the 95-foot-long, 15-foot-wide hallway
(the white dotted box on the map) with visions of their
failures yet to come.
Disable DC 32 Occultism (master) or dispel magic (5th
level; counteract DC 26) to weaken the images; three
successes are required to disable the trap
Flood of Despair Ȳ˓ (curse, emotion, enchantment, mental)
Trigger A creature ends a move action within the trap’s
area; Eﬀect The triggering creature takes 2d10+10 mental
damage (DC 32 basic Will save) as it considers its future
failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft
whisper oﬀering, “Let me take something from you and
I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access
to a random class feat that isn’t a prerequisite for another
feat, and the creature doesn’t take further damage from
Flood of Despair. This eﬀect lasts for 1 week and can be
ended by eﬀects that remove curses. The creature also
immediately detects the secret door at the end of the hall,
no matter how far away from the end of the hall they are.
Reset The trap resets immediately and can aﬀect the same
creature multiple times on the creature’s turn.
J13. CHAMBER OF REFLECTION
The walls of this bare room are white and plain.
Initiates who passed the Challenge of Despair were
permitted to stop in this psychic refuge to recover
before facing the next test.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for reaching
this room after passing the Challenge of Despair.
