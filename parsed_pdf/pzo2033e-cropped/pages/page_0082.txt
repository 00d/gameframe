heroes encounter Otari’s ghost and drive off the wisps
that torment him, he relates his tale of woe. He has
difﬁculty remembering much of his life but becomes
very emotional if he learns that the other members
of the Roseguard survived and founded a town they
named after him.
While Otari’s information about the dungeon is
centuries out of date, his supernatural link to the
Abomination Vaults affords him glimpses into the inner
workings of the dungeon and its key players. As Otari
speaks to the heroes, make sure he conveys the following
key points of information to them, either in the form of
answers to questions or volunteered information.
•	 Belcorra harbored a grudge against Absalom and
intended to use her sinister lighthouse, Gauntlight,
as a weapon against the city. The Roseguard
never discovered its actual use, other than that it
had something to do with the ability to transport
creatures across signiﬁcant distances and could
animate the dead with its light. None of the
other Roseguard members knew about the
Abomination Vaults beneath Gauntlight. Otari
learned about them only in his last few days alive.
•	 Some property of the Abomination Vaults
increases the manifestation of ghosts, spectral
undead, and haunts within their domain. Otari
initially believed this was a side
effect from Gauntlight but has
now come to suspect a link to a
much more ancient and ominous
source deep below this level. He
knows nothing of Nhimbaloth, but if the
heroes tell him of the Outer God, he suspects
her inﬂuence is the source.
•	 Belcorra herself is now a ghost,
although she can’t move far from
the site to which she’s anchored.
Otari can sense her somewhere deep
underground and is also aware that the
range of her movements is slowly expanding.
•	 Otari suspects Belcorra intends to fully
reactivate Gauntlight and use it to begin her
long-delayed attack on Absalom. She must
be put to rest before she can ﬁnish this task.
Otari isn’t sure how to stop her, but believes
that clues await discovery in the deeper levels
of the Abomination Vaults.
•	 Finally, Otari feels the barrier in area D12
blocking progress deeper into the Abomination
Vaults. He understands that it’s powered by the
souls of Belcorra’s defeated enemies. Fortunately,
he also understands how to take the barrier
down. The Roseguard were the adventurers who
ﬁnally killed her, and their psychic resonance can
drop the barrier. The heroes must ﬁnd and place
four icons the Roseguard once held dear onto the
altar in area D13 to do this. Otari’s thieves’ tools
are here with his bones and serve as his icon. The
other icons are the brooch belonging to the cleric
Aesephna Menhemes (which bears the religious
symbol of her god, Erastil), the spellbook
belonging to the wizard Zarmavdian, and the
Otari Ilvashti
