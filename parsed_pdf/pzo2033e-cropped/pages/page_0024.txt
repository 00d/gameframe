CHAPTER 1 SYNOPSIS
The upper level of the Abomination
Vaults—and the only level
aboveground—is the ruin of a large
structure called Gauntlight Keep.
Although the upper levels of the
keep have collapsed into the lower
level (ﬁlling many of the remaining
rooms with rubble), one prominent
structure remains: Gauntlight,
a massive lighthouse placed
incongruously in the middle of a
large swamp called the Fogfen. Here,
the heroes can encounter hapless
but vicious mitﬂits, dangers left from
Belcorra’s day, and evidence that
Gauntlight draws upon power from
somewhere deep below.
Environmental Cues: crude graﬃti,
evidence of prior squatters, mounds
of rubble, overgrowth of mold and
creeping plants, puddles of standing
water, scuttling vermin, splashing
water, swampy odors.

loyally follows Boss Skrawng, working hard to keep intruders—like the
heroes—out of “their” ruins.
As a reminder, you should take note of what the players have their
characters generally do as they explore. You can have them choose from
the list of exploration activities in the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook, or you
can ask each player to describe what their character does and decide
which exploration activity best ﬁts their description. Certain effects are
listed in the rooms based on whether a hero is Investigating, Searching, or
performing another exploration activity.
The map for this level appears on page 20.
A1. DAMP ENTRANCE
LOW 1
Swaths of mildew and mold cover the damp surfaces of this watchtower,
appearing as green and black smears on the dull stone walls. The door frames in
the walls to the north and south rotted long ago, while a few collapsed chairs lie
on the ﬂoor amid small heaps of foul-smelling gray lumps. Thick sheets of dusty
cobwebs hang from above, obscuring any view of the ceiling.
Once the primary entrance to Gauntlight Keep, this one-story
outbuilding is constructed of sturdy stone. The opaque sheets of dusty
cobwebs function as a drop ceiling at a height of 7 feet, leaving a 3-foot
space between the cobwebs and the stone ceiling above. The Mudlicker
mitﬂits have rigged a slipshod network of soggy ropes and planks in
the space above the cobwebs to clamber around on; a successful DC
12 Perception check can spot this feature through the webbing, and a
critical success also reveals a 3-foot-diameter hole in the roof in the
northwest corner, which the gremlins use to come and go. A successful
DC 15 Nature check to Recall Knowledge identiﬁes the deposits of gray
material as mitﬂit dung. Apparently the mitﬂits use this room as a latrine
as well as an advance guard station.
Creatures: Three mitﬂits lurk above the cobwebs but can’t resist a
chance to torment and trick the heroes once they enter the room below.
By crouching down on the planks and vines and peering through the
cobwebs, the three mitﬂits wait until at least two heroes have entered
the room below before calling out in their best imitation of high-pitched
pixie voices. They welcome the heroes into their parlor, warn them about
the mean bugs that live in the nearby keep, and suggest the visitors
partake of the “magic pixie mud” on the ﬂoor. Of course, the fact that
the mitﬂits lack any skill at Lying (they have a –1 Deception modiﬁer)
and can only speak in Undercommon means that they have slim chances
of success, but if they do, they’re overcome with guffaws of laughter and
can’t help but reveal their presence.
If confronted (either the heroes spot them or fail to fall for their
tricks), the mitﬂits shriek in anger and fear. One of them clambers up
through the hole in the roof and tries to climb across the vine stretching
from area A1 to A9 to warn his boss in area A10, while the other two
throw darts at the heroes. As soon as any mitﬂit takes damage, they
shriek in fear, cast bane, and then ﬂee to area A9. The mitﬂits keep a
nasty-smelling chunk of giant maggot meat handy for a snack, but if
forced to ﬂee, one tosses the maggot steak onto the shore of the pool in
area A3, hoping to cover their retreating by luring the slurk living there
onto shore to attack the heroes.
