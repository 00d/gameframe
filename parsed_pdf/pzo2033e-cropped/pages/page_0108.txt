CHAPTER 6:
Experiments in Flesh
Under Belcorra, the Abomination Vault’s sixth level
was split between support for the arena above and the
laboratories that created new and terrible monsters.
The two activities weren’t all that separate since
the most powerful of the monsters created in the
laboratories fought in the arena, where the survivors
joined Belcorra’s growing ranks of monsters to assault
Absalom. Conversely, failures in the arena became
fodder for further experiments in the laboratories.
When Belcorra died, the overbearing control of a
bone devil named Tarkannah initially kept inﬁghting
on this level at a minimum, but many creatures chafed
at Tarkannah’s control. The seugathi ﬂeshwarper
Jafaki organized a coup and murdered the bone devil,
taking control of the entire ﬂoor. Since this rebellion,
Jafaki has maintained the level as the seugathis’
domain, believing their resources are better spent
on the relentless reﬁning of experiments rather than
expanding territory.
Due to Jafaki’s relatively relaxed disposition toward
administration, creatures on this level tend to look
after themselves. Many are more recent arrivals who
have come seeking the seugathis’ skills and are willing
to risk experimentation for the chance of becoming
stronger. Creatures who haven’t been slated for
ﬂeshwarping yet spend most of their time drinking
and relaxing in a large, central chamber that has
long served as a tavern called the Warped Brew. The
urdefhan Vischari manages the Warped Brew, keeping
cooks, bartenders, and even a band on retainer.
Laboratories Features
This level feels more cramped than the lofty arena
level above because of its lower ceilings, which average
10 feet high in halls and 15 feet high in rooms, unless
otherwise indicated. None of the rooms on this level
have light, as the denizens can all see in the dark.
The stone doors throughout this level have sturdy
iron hinges; most can be simply pushed open, which
the seugathi do to move around. The smell of acrid
chemicals lingers throughout this level, except near the
Warped Brew Tavern (area F11), where the smell of
spilled fungus beer replaces it instead.
The map for this level appears on page 106.
