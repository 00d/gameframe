C16. LEVEL THREE PORTAL CHAMBER
The walls of this circular chamber are decorated with
intricate, intertwining runes and shapes carved into deep
into the stone and ﬁlled with dull, silvery metal. The ﬂoor
and ceiling are polished to a
reﬂective sheen.
This room contains an inert
teleportation circle like the one
in area B17. Just as with that room,
this teleportation circle must be reactivated
with the awaken portal ritual in area C35
before it can be used.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for
activating this portal.
C17. FIREFIGHTING SUPPLIES
Several buckets of sand and a number of large barrels
crowd this cramped storeroom. A simple wooden case
with a closed lid is attached to the back of the door.
The supplies kept here are available to extinguish
ﬁres, a signiﬁcant threat in any library. The barrels
once held water but now contain only mildew.
Treasure: The case on the door is latched and holds
a wand of quench (Advanced Player’s Guide 223).
C18. TEMPORARY BUNKS
LOW 3
Three plain beds have been awkwardly stacked against the
west wall of this room, leaving room for a single low table
heaped with foul-smelling chunks of ﬂesh and bone.
While most servants who toiled in the library kept
quarters aboveground, some needed rest during long
stretches of research. The ghouls don’t need the beds
and simply stacked them out of the way.
Creatures: This room now serves as a dining room
for three ghouls who are feasting on the remains of a
morlock. They attack the heroes on sight, but the ﬁrst
one injured tries to ﬂee to area C19 to recruit Aller
Rosk’s aid.
