BEFUDDLING GAS TRAP
HAZARD 11
COMPLEX
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +21 (expert) or DC 31 (expert) to notice the hidden override mechanism
on the north wall.
Description Seven nozzles hidden within holes in the 15-foot-high ceiling release
a poison gas.
Disable DC 33 Thievery (master) to disable the hidden mechanism on the north
wall, immediately sucking the gas from the room, or DC 29 Thievery (expert) to
adequately plug one of the seven nozzles. When all seven nozzles are plugged
or destroyed, the trap is deactivated.
AC 31; Fort +24, Ref +18
Nozzle Hardness 20; Nozzle HP 32 (BT 16); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Gas Release Ǻȓ (inhaled, mental, poison) Trigger Both secret doors are closed
and at least one creature is in the room; Eﬀect Gas ﬁlls the chamber. Creatures
within the chamber must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or become
stupeﬁed 1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The gas intensiﬁes. Each creature in the room must make a DC
30 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and becomes temporarily immune
to the gas for 1 hour, though if the creature has already been stupeﬁed by
the trap, that condition remains for its normal duration.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 24 hours. If the target is already
stupeﬁed, the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4)
and the target takes 8d6 mental damage.
Critical Eﬀect As failure, except the target takes double the mental damage.
Reset After an hour, the trap deactivates; the gas disperses slowly, and the doors can
be opened again. After 24 hours, the gas builds up and the trap can be triggered
once more.
J5. LEVEL TEN PORTAL CHAMBER
MODERATE 10
Belcorra added this room to the temple to connect her network of
permanent teleportation circles. Its door is locked, and the key is long lost.
A hero can Force it Open with a successful DC 25 Athletics check or Pick
the Lock with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks.
Swirling, silver-ﬁlled runes adorn the rounded walls of this chamber. Sheets of
reﬂective metal cover the ﬂoor and ceiling.
The heroes can reactivate this portal chamber and connect it to others
throughout the Abomination Vaults, as described in area B17.
Creatures: As the lowest portal chamber, Belcorra ensured this room
was well-guarded. A powerful stone golem is built into the wall, in an
open space between the silver-ﬁlled runes. It steps out and attacks anyone
who isn’t accompanying Belcorra.
ELITE STONE GOLEM
CREATURE 12
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 6, 187
Initiative Perception +19
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for using the awaken portal ritual
to reactivate the teleportation circle here.
CHAPTER 10 SYNOPSIS
The heroes have their ﬁnal
confrontation with Belcorra in this
chapter. On the way to the Empty
Vault, where Belcorra can be found,
they pass through several challenges
that aspirants of Nhimbaloth faced
back when this was an active temple
to the Empty Death. Ironically, this
lowest level of the Abomination
Vaults is one of the safest, in that its
denizens generally stay put and the
heroes can rest for as long as they
need in empty chambers. They’ll
need to be in top form to tackle
Belcorra; if they haven’t collected all
three fulcrum lenses by now, they
might need to retreat, recover them,
and face Belcorra again.
Environmental Cues: black stone,
carvings of bones or mist, clammy
air, eerie lights, fog, swamp plants
