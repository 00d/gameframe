Though the immense metropolis of Absalom has long
dominated the urban scene on Starstone Isle, civilization
has always thrived across the island. Otari’s beginning
is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along
the way. When Belcorra Haruvex arrived in the region
in 4230 ar, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the
coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she
built Gauntlight, the keep surrounding the area, and
the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without
attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as
the Roseguard eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy
and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a
rogue named Otari Ilvashti.
Having lost both their friend and their taste for
adventuring, the three surviving members of the
Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their
savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier
in a sheltered cove south of the site of their ﬁnal battle.
Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle
down in a small seaside village, they named this new
village after him.
For some decades, Otari prospered as a ﬁshing
village, though its population never grew beyond
a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard
adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing
away from natural causes—an accomplishment many
adventurers never achieve.
With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna
Menhemes, in 4290 ar, Otari’s fortunes began to
dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had
all drifted elsewhere. Otari lay abandoned for decades
before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved
in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships
during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal
their cargo, it didn’t take long for new adventurers to
arrive and vanquish them.
While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter,
their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind.
Maklanni, Aesephna’s granddaughter, conceived a plan
to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained
dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored,
after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill
and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated
Maklanni’s plan—the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding
Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difﬁcult.
Maklanni’s solution was ingenious—she constructed
a wooden ﬂume that allowed for the easy transport of
lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there,
down an astounding loading ramp that extended
from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor
below. The mill and ﬂume made Maklanni wealthy
and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy
of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold
on the island’s lumber industry. Two other small
lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium
and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of
Maklanni’s invention.
Today, Otari is a thriving settlement—the largest
on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni
is long dead, but her descendant Oseph carries on
the family trade and also serves as the town’s mayor.
Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium
have secretly inﬁltrated Otari and seek to undermine
the town’s security. However, a far greater threat looms
over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to
light the baleful ﬁres of Gauntlight once again!
Otari at a Glance
Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two
looming cliffs. To the west, the cliffside rises to meet
a well-cared-for graveyard. To the east, a fantastic feat
of engineering draws the eye—the trestle supporting a
wooden loading chute extends down from the clifftop to
a loading platform built into the harbor. This ingenious
construction swiftly delivers lumber processed further
inland at the mill to waiting ships below.
The people of Otari are friendly and welcoming
for the most part, although they tend to react with
OTARI
