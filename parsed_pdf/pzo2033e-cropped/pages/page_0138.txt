Distracting Declaration Urevian keeps a few sly words at
the ready to distract enemies. He always uses Deception
for initiative.
Ward Contract Any signed contract Urevian carries
(including any draped over his horns) is immune to
damage from creatures other than Urevian. In addition,
Urevian is immune to mental eﬀects that would make
him alter, nullify, or destroy a contract.

Draft Contract ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine, manipulate)
Urevian produces an infernal contract for a single
living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of
abilities and eﬀects, akin to the power of a wish spell but
fulﬁlled to the letter by Urevian. To receive any of those
beneﬁts, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to
the contract. At that point, the mortal’s soul is bound to
Urevian and to Hell.
While the contract is in eﬀect, the mortal can’t be re-
stored to life except by wish or similar magic. If the mortal
is restored to life by those means, Urevian knows which
mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures
who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the eﬀects
of a locate spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of
an infernal contract is diﬃcult and often dangerous.
Infernal Wound (divine, necromancy) Urevian’s Strikes also
deal 2d6 persistent bleed damage that resists attempts
to heal them. The ﬂat check to stop the bleeding starts
at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding
creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery.
The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an
infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item
using healing magic on a creature suﬀering from an in-
fernal wound must succeed at a DC 28 counteract check
or the magic fails to heal the creature.
Right of Inspection Urevian can cast his innate scrying
spell at will, but only to target a creature with which he
has a contract, a speciﬁc creature named in a contract
he has, or a descendant of any of those creatures. The
outcome of the target’s saving throw is one step worse
than the result it rolled.

RECOVERING CARMAN
How easily the heroes can recover Carman depends on
his fate in Chapter 5. If they released him, the heroes
likely ﬁnd him still brooding in Smuggler’s Refuge, as he
hasn’t yet summoned the courage to depart. He certainly
won’t go with the heroes willingly if they explain what
they want with him, but the heroes could trick him. If
Carman knows what he’s in for, he does his best to ﬂee
the area, and the heroes probably have to work with
Urevian to scry his new location—which the contract
devil certainly makes them pay for, one way or another.
If Carman is in jail, the heroes can simply fetch him
from custody. Longsaddle doesn’t mind turning him
over to the heroes, as they captured him in the ﬁrst
place. If they’re up-front about why they want Carman,
he’s surprisingly agreeable to turning the scoundrel over
to the devil (see the sidebar on page 136).
If Carman is dead, the heroes must go to the place
of his death to trap his spirit. Urevian explains that
the heroes must perform the call spirit ritual (which
he can teach them) while holding a specially-prepared
gemstone (that he also provides). The heroes are
responsible for performing the ritual and paying its
cost. If they call Carman’s spirit, it’s automatically
drawn into the gemstone.
Delivery: If the heroes bring Carman Rajani to
Urevian alive or give him a soul gem with Carman’s
soul inside, Urevian ﬂicks a hand toward his desk.
All the contents magically pack themselves into smaller
and smaller boxes, eventually into a single valise that
one of the barbazus picks up. The other barbazu takes
