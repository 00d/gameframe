A13. BELCORRA’S SANCTUM
This triangular room might have once seemed comfortable,
but after years of rain and exposure to the elements
through the two arrow slits in the northwestern wall, the
room’s divan, armoire, and tapestries have fallen to decay.
Belcorra maintained this private room to relax and
constructed a secret entrance to the shrine to easily
access it. A rusted ring of keys sits under the divan, and
any hero Searching this room ﬁnds it. Rust has ruined
six of its iron keys, but two bronze keys remain usable:
the one decorated with a lighthouse unlocks the trap
door to Gauntlight’s cupola (area A25), and the other
decorated with a book unlocks the door to Belcorra’s
private reading room (area C27).
A tapestry formerly concealed a secret door, but
it rotted and fell long ago, so the door has become
slightly easier to ﬁnd. A hero Searching this room
who succeeds at a DC 16 Perception check locates the
secret door that leads into a small area that connects to
the shrine. Characters can obviously spot the second,
partly ajar secret door within this space, as described
in area A15.
A14. SCORPION KENNEL
MODERATE 1
The ceiling of this room has fallen in two places. A smaller
collapse destroyed a ﬂight of stairs that once led up to the
now-ruined upper ﬂoor. A larger collapse mostly buried the
southern double door, leaving a hole in the roof partially
blocked with several crossed timbers. A second double
door to the north has a stone face carved with skulls caked
with tangles of moss.
This room serves as a kennel for the Mudlickers’
ﬁrst signiﬁcant acquisition—a giant scorpion. The
mitﬂits lured the monster into this room with minimal
loss, then collapsed several timbers in the rubble to
keep it penned in. A Medium or smaller creature can
clamber through this tangle, but unless it’s signiﬁcantly
tormented, the giant scorpion won’t think to smash
through the timbers to leave the room.
Although the tangles of moss growing on the skull
carvings seem like part of the overgrowth prevalent
throughout the ruin, they belong to the original
design. The mossy skull is the religious symbol of
the Nhimbaloth, the Outer God of ghosts, despair,
swamps, and will‑o’-wisps, whom Belcorra reveres
as her patron. Nhimbaloth’s lore is rare and hidden,
however, so a hero must succeed at a DC 25 Religion
check to Recall Knowledge to identify the mossy skull
as Nhimbaloth’s symbol. Although ﬂedgling heroes
might not recognize evidence of Nhimbaloth, Wrin
Sivinxi in town knows of the sinister Outer God and
can enlighten the heroes if they report their ﬁndings
to her.
Creatures: The mitﬂits keep the giant scorpion well
fed and content, but it attacks other creatures at once.
It can skitter easily over the rubble in this room and
doesn’t treat it as difﬁcult terrain. The scorpion can
climb the rubble to the south and Force Open a path to
pursue heroes with a successful DC 18 Athletics check
if necessary, but it’s unlikely to do so unless attackers
are harrying it from the other side of the rubble.
The scorpion is a particularly dangerous foe for
1st-level characters, so you might encourage the
heroes to retreat if they’re having a hard time with
it and have the scorpion retreat back to this room
rather than pursue ﬂeeing heroes very far.

A15. NHIMBALOTH SHRINE
SEVERE 1
The air in this large chapel feels colder and damper than
elsewhere in the ruins. Condensed beads on the walls
run in rivulets across the countless skulls carved into the
stone. A moldering human corpse lies slumped against a
wall, his hands wedged into a crack as if he died trying to
pry a brick loose. Three short ﬂights of steps lead upward
to a wider chamber to the north, where a semicircular
dais supports an altar of white stone. Beyond the altar
loom four stained-glass windows, each twenty feet tall
and depicting four haunting scenes of ghosts rising from
overgrown graveyards toward a four-pointed orange star
high above.
Belcorra made no secret of her faith in Nhimbaloth,
and she maintained this sizable shrine to the sinister
entity both as a place of worship and an intimidating
setting to meet visitors. The shrine has an ominous
atmosphere, as if something immense and distant
watches through the stained glass windows. A hero can
identify this room as a shrine to Nhimbaloth with a
successful DC 25 Religion check to Recall Knowledge.
The corpse to the south lies slumped next to the
secret door leading to area A13. Once a human man,
this thief snuck into the temple through the secret doors
from area A13 months ago in search of a treasure, only
to ﬁnd himself outclassed by the corpselights lurking
in this room. He perished just before could reopen
the secret door to escape from them. The thief left the
door slightly ajar with the rotating skull that opens it
