Vaults
projectile from objects it carries or that are readily accessible in adjacent
squares. Where unusual materials are available, an improvised projectile
might deal damage other than bludgeoning or piercing—for example, a
morlock engineer by a campﬁre could build a projectile that deals ﬁre damage.
Sneak Attack The morlock deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
Swarming Stance As morlock scavenger.
Uncanny Tinker ʚʖ The morlock engineer tinkers with an adjacent construct or
mechanical hazard. They attempt a Crafting check against the construct’s or
hazard’s Fortitude DC. The morlock can’t get an outcome better than failure if
the target’s level is more than double the morlock’s. This ability reﬂects hasty
battleﬁeld repairs; once a construct or hazard regains Hit Points from this
ability, it can’t do so again until it’s been Repaired.
Critical Success The target regains 8d6 Hit Points and a +1 circumstance
bonus to attack rolls for 1 minute. Alternately, the morlock can deal 8d6
damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as chosen
by the morlock engineer) to the construct or hazard.
Success As critical success, but the target regains 4d6 Hit
Points or the morlock deals 4d6 damage.
Critical Failure The morlock injures themself, taking
3d6 damage (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing, but potentially a diﬀerent type at the
GM’s discretion).
MORLOCK CULTIST
Morlocks who serve as priests in their conclaves
usually dabble in eerie occult magic.

normally takes two actions or fewer to cast.
Sneak Attack The morlock deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
MORLOCK CULTS
Morlocks led by cultists don’t always
follow an established religion, in part
because their insular background
limits contact with the rest of the
world. In many cases, a morlock
cult worships some ﬁgure from the
group’s past, be it a revered (or more
often, feared) ancestor, or even the
strange machines or statues left
behind from a mysterious civilization
that once ruled the place where the
morlocks now live.
