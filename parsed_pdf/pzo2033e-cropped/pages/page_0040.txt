those in Gauntlight Keep above. When Belcorra was killed, the servants
here panicked. Some ﬂed, others hid in their rooms, and still others became
food for the cannibal librarians the next ﬂoor down. Today, the servants’
quarters are largely in ruins.
Areas are unlit unless otherwise noted, and the ceiling heights are
typically 8 feet in hallways and 10 feet in rooms. The doors are sturdy
wood, swollen shut with moisture. A hero trained in Athletics can open
doors on this level with a single Interact action, as normal; characters who
aren’t trained in Athletics must spend 2 Interact actions to open a door.
The largest faction presently active in the Servant’s Quarters is a group
of morlocks who call themselves the Children of the Ghost Queen. These
morlocks once dwelt deep below this level in caverns adjacent to the
Abomination Vaults. When Belcorra wakened, they clambered into the
higher levels to prepare the way for her, enduring a devastating clash with
the Cult of the Canker ghouls and later driving out the Mudlicker mitﬂits.
Belcorra always considered morlocks to be pests (and still does, even as a
ghost), but the morlocks’ leader, Graulgust, hopes to change her mind by
building her a temple. But, just as Belcorra’s eldritch patron Nhimbaloth
cares little about how she’s honored, the morlocks’ Ghost Queen doesn’t
care whether these devout morlocks live or die.
The Servant’s Quarters map appears on page 36.
B1. STAIRS UP
These tightly spiraling stairs lead up to area A21.
B2. VOLLUK’S WORKSHOP
The door to this room is locked. A hero without the key from area A20 can
Force Open the door with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or Pick the
Lock with three successful DC 20 Thievery checks.
Seven square alcoves, each containing strange magical apparatuses or alchemical
sets of tools, ring this damp stone chamber. The alcove to the north contains a
large glass tank ﬁlled with liquid. A goblin’s corpse, clad in outdated servant’s
clothing, ﬂoats inside it. A semicircular worktable covered with tools, moldy
papers, and a large open book stands in front of the tank.
Volluk Azrinae once used this chamber as his personal workshop. The
worktable in front of the tank holds the bulk of Volluk’s notes. A hero
Investigating these notes who succeeds at a DC 12 Arcana or Occultism
check to Recall Knowledge learns that the workshop is devoted to both
construct construction and necromancy. A critical success on this check also
reveals the workshop’s emphasis is transferring mortal souls, including into
a construct or a swarm of vermin.
The goblin in the tank is the preserved corpse of Borbo, once Volluk’s
devoted servant. Borbo volunteered his body and soul for a technique that
Volluk promised would grant immortality, though being turned into the
soulbound doll named Mister Beak wasn’t exactly the immortality that
Borbo had in mind. Still, Borbo, as Mister Beak, has thus far remained
loyal to Volluk. The corpse is well-preserved in the tank; even if removed,
it takes months to decay.
A search of the other alcoves reveals little of interest, with two
exceptions: a secret door in the southwestern alcove and an incomplete
soulbound doll in the northwestern alcove.
CHAPTER 2 SYNOPSIS
The Abomination Vaults’ second
level—its highest underground level—
harbors several old traps and ﬁercely
independent denizens who hunt on
the surface. It also contains a small
group of morlocks pushed up from
below. Before the heroes get too
far into exploring this level, though,
Belcorra activates Gauntlight in a
devastating test as she reﬁnes the
artifact’s power.
Environmental Cues: broken
low‑quality furniture and tools,
cobwebs, distant banging noises,
moisture beading on the walls, smells
of mold, unpleasant dampness.
