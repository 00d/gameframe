circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. After the attack, the
swarm can Stride up to its Speed in a straight line as part of the reaction.
Speed 20 feet
Bounding Swarm The gibtas spawn swarm moves in loping bounces. The swarm
ignores diﬃcult terrain.
Swarming Bites Ȱɵ Each enemy in the swarm’s space takes 2d8 piercing damage
and 1d6 acid damage (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). A creature that fails its save
against Swarming Bites also takes 1d4 persistent acid damage.
GIBTANIUS
When a gibtas feeds regularly but never receives sufﬁcient food
to procreate, it grows into a mighty gibtanius. They become surly,
uncontrolled predators, forsaking their bonded masters to satiate their
unending hunger.

Powerful Stench (aura, olfactory) 20 feet. A creature that
enters the aura must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save.
On a failure, the creature is sickened 2; on a critical failure,
the creature is also slowed 1 for as long as it is sickened. A
creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for
1 minute.

Bouncing Crush ʚʖ The gibtanius Leaps
and can end this Leap occupying the
same space as other creatures. It deals
5d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature
in the space it Leaps to (DC 26 basic Reﬂex
save), then Shoves each of those creatures. If it
fails to Shove any creature out of its space, it
bounces to the closest available space of
its choosing that does not contain any
creatures. Bouncing Crush counts as one
attack when determining the gibtanius’s
multiple attack penalty.
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (acid, evocation, primal) The
gibtanius vomits a stream of acid that deals 9d6
acid damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line (DC 26
basic Reﬂex save). It can’t use Breath Weapon again for
1d4 rounds.
GIBTAS COMPANIONS
A gibtas can make for an unusual
animal companion, with the GM’s
permission. Use the statistics for a
bear animal companion (Pathﬁnder
Core Rulebook 215), except the
companion has the rare trait,
is an aberration rather than an
animal, has darkvision rather than
low-light vision, and gains the
gibtas bounder’s Bouncing Slam as
an advanced maneuver instead of
Bear Hug.
