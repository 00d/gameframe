Vaults
it for a loophole. He suggests a trade—he’ll let the
heroes go just this once, but the next time they return,
he’ll arrest them if they don’t present him with his
contract. He isn’t sure where the paper is stored but
suspects it’s hidden somewhere in the library.
If the heroes present the contract, Korlok studies it
and discovers that his service was meant to end if 99
weeks and 99 days passed without a new order from
Belcorra. Before he vanishes back to Hell, the thankful
devil explains that he knows of other devils in the
Abomination Vaults: a zebub janitor on the level above
and a contract devil named Urevian on a lower level
(page 134). Korlok has nothing but scorn for the zebub,
but he says that Urevian is shrewd but well-known for
keeping his word.
C9. PRISON
An overturned chamber pot lies next to a rectangular patch
of fungus that might have once been a mattress in the corner
of this room. A skeleton is just visible within the fungus.
The skeleton is all that remains of Belcorra’s ﬁrst
chef, a hapless man who had the misfortune of
over‑spicing a meal. Perhaps due to some lingering
effect of the fastidious chef’s spirit, the fungus here is
not only edible but rather tasty.
C10. TWIN STAIRWELLS
This hallway is a landing for two staircases: one leading
up to area B2 in the north and one leading up to area
B32 in the south. Splintered, rotten wood lies scattered
around this hall, left over during the morlocks’ ﬂight
from this level.
C11. MAIN LIBRARY
MODERATE 3
Hundreds of stone shelves are carved into the
walls of this ﬁfteen-foot-wide hallway. While
there are many gaps in the collection, a staggering
number of books, scrolls, and folios remain. Signs
hang above several doors oﬀ of this hall. A faint,
blue glow ﬂickers beneath a sign to the south.
The books kept here cover a wide range of
subjects, and the Cult of the Canker keep the
stacks organized. A hero with the luxury of
pursuing these tomes for 8 hours learns the
library’s organization and gains a +1 item
bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge
on regional history, arcane topics, or
occult topics when using the Investigate
exploration activity here.
The signs here are all in Undercommon. The one
above area C15 to the south reads, “Reading Room.”
The ones over the smaller doors are labeled as follows:
area C12 is “Repair Storage,” area C13 is “Workroom,”
