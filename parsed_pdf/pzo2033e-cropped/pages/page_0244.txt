Scalathrax
These slippery, scaly horrors dwell in remote cave networks in the
Darklands, preferring to nest in narrow ﬁssures. When on the hunt, they
ﬂick barbs from their long legs, or spray down their foes with a clear,
toxic oil. The same oil coats the scalathrax’s body, all of which is quite
ﬂammable—whether it’s coating a victim or the scalathrax itself.
While a scalathrax appears feral, it’s more intelligent than it seems
and is capable of speaking in a wet, slithery voice. The vast majority of
scalathraxes are foul-tempered and quick to anger, and most of them
enjoy killing. It’s possible to forge an alliance with a scalathrax, but doing
so requires either constant bribes of new creatures to kill or a particularly
intimidating personality—scalathraxes often respect bullies, seeing in
them a mirror of their own cruel values.

Oily Scales A scalathrax constantly sweats a glistening oil that makes it
exceptionally slick. It treats the results of Acrobatics checks to Squeeze or
of any skill check to Escape as one degree of success greater than the rolled
result. A scalathrax loses this beneﬁt for 1 minute after it takes any amount
of ﬁre damage.

again for 1d4 rounds.

and whenever the creature critically
fails with an attack roll with a wielded
weapon, it drops the weapon.
Critical Failure As failure, but 4d8 poison damage.
SCALATHRAX OIL
Scalathrax oil is a valuable
alchemical component, but it’s
diﬃcult to harvest and preserve.
By spending 10 minutes and
succeeding at a DC 21 Crafting
check, a character can extract 1
Bulk of scalathrax oil worth 20 gp
from a recently killed scalathrax.
If scalathrax oil is used to Craft
an alchemical item that deals ﬁre
damage or would beneﬁt from
the slippery quality of the oil, the
crafter gains a +1 item bonus to their
Crafting check. Scalathrax oil can be
used as lantern oil, though it’s often
considered too valuable for such a
mundane use.
