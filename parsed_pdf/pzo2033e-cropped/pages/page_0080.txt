too much, he grows frustrated and uses his magic
to attack from afar. Depending on the questions the
heroes ask, Jaul might reveal his name or who he is,
but it’s likely only a matter of time before the paranoid
werewolf loses patience and attacks.
If Jaul is reduced to 30 or fewer Hit Points, he begs
for mercy and promises to give the heroes a reward if
they spare him. This reward is Ayla’s necklace. Heroes
who show Jaul mercy can get him to talk further;
Jaul is somewhat familiar with the eastern half of this
level (areas D14 to D19). For example, he can warn
the heroes of the shadowy ghost on the island to the
south (area D18) and tell them that if they enter the
“nightmare stairs” to the north (area D19), they’d
do well to keep their eyes closed if they want to ever
escape them. If the heroes let him go, he exits through
the sea caves and ﬂees the region. Whether or not he
resumes his murderous ways is left for you to decide.

Side Quest: The heroes can bring Jaul in, dead or
alive, to Otari for a 50 gp bounty. If the heroes don’t
realize who he is right away, allow a hero who looks
over the inscription on his necklace to attempt a DC
18 Society check (DC 13 if the hero is afﬁliated with
the Otari Market). On a success, the hero recognizes
the name as Ayla Lathenar, the dead wife of the Otari
Market merchant, Keeleno Lathenar. Approaching
Keeleno with proof that the werewolf is dead—as the
bitter man won’t accept his wife’s murderer remaining
alive—earns the heroes a 20 percent discount for all
purchases at the Otari Market for life.
D15. TWISTING TUNNEL
Several slippery ledges lead up and out of area D14,
joining a small complex of caverns that stretches
between Fogfen and the coast. It was via these tunnels
that Jaul Mezmin arrived, and he leaves through them
occasionally to hunt for food. The tunnels connect
to the coastline west of Otari in a sea cave that’s
underwater even at low tide. The actual contents of
these caverns are beyond the scope of this adventure,
but they likely contain other predators and dangers.
Feel free to expand them if the heroes wish to explore
them and are in need of additional XP.
