Dorianna’s Dreams
Although the heroes can ﬁnd plenty of
adventure in the Abomination Vaults,
other mysterious events are afoot
in Otari. The most signiﬁcant of
these occurrences centers around the
mayor’s eldest daughter, the teenaged
Dorianna Menhemes. Dorianna is
on the cusp of developing psychic
powers. While no one on the surface
is aware of this, a denizen of Leng
named Ysondkhelir (area G18) has
become aware of her power. With
the barrier to the lower levels down, he
can twist her dreams into nightmares
and take the role of her savior. He
intensiﬁes this long plan over weeks
of nighttime adventures with her in
the Dimension of Dreams. Ysondkhelir
intends to eventually thrust Dorianna
physically into the Dimension of Dreams
to augment other denizens’ plots.
Two nights after the heroes open the seal
to the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, Dorianna
Menhemes begins having horrifying nightmares.
She awakens several times each night, screaming
and clutching a stuffed griffon she hasn’t touched
in years. When asked, she doesn’t recall the speciﬁcs
of these nightmares beyond her fear and the
appearance of a man shrouded in mismatched fabric
who comforts her.
If the heroes have earned the support of Menhemes
Manor, they’ve met Dorianna, and they hear about
her nightmares from the other children. Otherwise,
the mayor seeks out whichever hero is best known
as a healer or as an authority on Occultism. He
mentions his daughter’s nightmares and the “motley
man” who acts as a protector and savior within
them. He asks them to discreetly look into the
matter and help his daughter.
Asking Wrin: Mayor Menhemes views Wrin
Sivinxi of Wrin’s Wonders as an unreliable eccentric,
so he doesn’t think to involve her in his family’s
troubles. However, she’s an expert in Occultism;
she gladly accompanies the heroes to help Dorianna
if they ask, so long as she doesn’t need to meet with
the beleaguered girl indoors. If the party lacks
someone with Occultism training to get to the
bottom of these mysteries, Wrin’s involvement is a
possible solution.
EXAMINING DORIANNA
Even the ﬁrst time the heroes examine Dorianna, she
already appears gaunt and pale as if she had caught a
severe malady. A character who succeeds at a DC 15
Medicine check veriﬁes that she’s nevertheless
in good physical health. The heroes initially
ﬁnd no evidence of any magic or curse upon
her. A search of Dorianna’s room discovers
that several of her childhood toys have
been brought back out for her to play with.
Dorianna states vaguely that she just missed
them and wanted to play with them again.
Dorianna’s nightmares are tenacious; any
magic the heroes use to help Dorianna
get a good night’s sleep fail unless
the caster succeeds at a secret
DC 27 counteract check.
XP Award: Award the heroes
30 XP for taking the care and time
to help Dorianna, even if they can’t
ﬁgure out what’s wrong just yet.
DORIANNA’S DECLINE
Dorianna’s condition worsens over time.
Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she
feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins
to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend
even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else.
Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she
often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings
don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents
ﬁnd her hard to put up with. She’s been afﬂicted by
Ysondkhelir’s outcast’s curse spell, which the heroes
might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir
casts it on her again the following night.
With a successful DC 26 Diplomacy check, the heroes
gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If
they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have
a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Only one hero
can attempt this check each day (on a critical failure, they
must instead wait 1d4 days). On a success, Dorianna
insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of
the following two subjects with them (on a subsequent
day’s success or an initial critical success, she reveals both).
Gifts: The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form
of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the
stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that
something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters
who open it up ﬁnd a large, ﬂawless ruby worth 30 gp.
Even if the heroes take this ruby, the next time Dorianna
dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from
wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave
her for long.
