Gamemaster Advice
While each level of the Abomination Vaults is
built with the assumption of a group of heroes at a
particular character level, each has more than enough
encounters for a party to level up. Part of the joy of a
large dungeon crawl is the exploration of every nook
and cranny, and a party who faces every encounter
might gain enough experience points to reach higher
levels well before the end of this Adventure Path—and
that’s ﬁne! Some later encounters challenge a high-level
party well enough, even if the heroes have to retreat,
rest, and recover less often.
The dungeon provides lots of freedom to explore,
particularly in the middle levels. Let the players gauge
whether their characters are in over their heads and
retreat (or ﬂee!) if the situation demands it. When the
heroes face harder-than-expected challenges for their
current level, they earn more XP, and when they face
easier-than-expected ones, they earn less. This keeps
their progression on roughly the same track. That said,
if you want a slower-paced game, Abomination Vaults
works well with a slow Advancement Speed (Pathﬁnder
Core Rulebook 509).
Story-based progression can be tricky for a giant
dungeon crawl since the heroes can move between
levels through multiple routes. If you prefer story-based
progression, rather than automatically allowing the
heroes to level up simply because they quickly reached
a lower dungeon level, consider requiring them to
complete speciﬁc milestones to level up, as detailed in
the Advancement Track.
The ﬁnal three levels are where the story of the
Abomination Vaults comes to its head. It’s critical that
the heroes discover the three fulcrum lenses in the lower
levels and learn how they work—speciﬁcally, how they
can permanently destroy Belcorra. Yet Belcorra has
more freedom to harry the heroes throughout these
lower levels, and by the time the heroes face her in
the Empty Vault, they’ve earned her ire. With luck, the
heroes can defeat Belcorra and topple Gauntlight.
