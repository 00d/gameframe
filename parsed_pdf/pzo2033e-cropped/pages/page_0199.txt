J6. CREMATORIUM
MODERATE 10
Two pools of bubbling magma sit side by side in the center
of this large chamber.
This crematorium is extremely hot (Core Rulebook
518), dealing 2d6 ﬁre damage every 10 minutes (the
scorpions are immune). Immersion in the 25-foot-deep
magma pools deals 20d6 ﬁre damage each round.
Creatures: Bound ﬁre elementals have maintained
the heat in this room for centuries. They climb out
of the magma pits to attack intruders, pursuing
aggressively and ﬁghting until destroyed.

J7. SOUL EXTRACTORS
MODERATE 10
This strange, irregular hall features several wide alcoves,
each with a standing rack bearing crystals and levers, like
bizarre torture devices.
Failed initiates were brought here and strapped to
the strange standing racks. These occult machines
extracted the initiates’ souls into crystal globes as
special glass golems sliced their bodies to pieces.
Cultists took the soul-infused globes (which were far
too delicate for the blade-handed golems to handle) to
the dread wisps in area J8.
Only three of the occult machines still function,
and each holds a crystal globe containing the soul of
an initiate killed centuries ago. A hero Investigating
a functional machine and succeeding at a DC 30
Occultism, Religion, or relevant Lore check (such as
Spirit Lore) realizes what the globes are
and how they were created.
Creatures: The four golems
remain here and do their
best to slice intruders to
ribbons. Their greenish
glass
bodies
emit
an unsettling glow,
giving them the Grim
Glittering ability instead
of Dazzling Brilliance.
