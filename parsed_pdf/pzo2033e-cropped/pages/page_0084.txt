Vaults
When Belcorra ﬁrst began construction of the
Abomination Vaults, these chambers served as her
personal suite. She lived here for many years as she
oversaw the construction of the dungeons both
above and below, but once the project was complete,
she abandoned this home for one even deeper
underground. She moved her belongings deep below
as well, leaving these chambers abandoned and
empty, but when she became a ghost, her spiritual
energy reacted in much the same way Otari’s did
by manifesting lingering images within these rooms
where she spent so many hours.
As a result, each time the heroes step into one of
these four rooms, they’re greeted with a brief ghostly
image of the room as it once was. Each time, they
also see a vision of Belcorra herself within the room.
Descriptions of each room’s visions are given below,
but chances are good that the heroes won’t have time
to study the scenes at ﬁrst—see Creatures below.
D20a: This room was once a comfortable sitting
room with two chairs and a low end table between
them. In the brief vision, Belcorra is meeting with the
drow Volluk (as he was in life, as a drow). Although the
image has no sound, Belcorra is speaking animatedly
about something, and Volluk is listening attentively.
D20b: Originally a lounge with two plush divans,
this room ﬂashes an image of Belcorra relaxing while
reading a large tome. A hero who succeeds at a DC
18 Perception check sees that the book is titled The
Whispering Reeds (this book is currently in area C35).
D20c: A well-set table reveals this to have once
been Belcorra’s private dining room. In the image, she
sits alone at the table, drinking a glass of wine and
enjoying an elegantly plated roast arm that looks
disturbingly human.
D20d: Belcorra’s bedroom features a large bed
along the west wall. The stone archway to the north
shimmers as a portal opens and Belcorra steps
through with a cruel smile on her lips and blood on
her hands.
Creatures: A powerful and horriﬁc entity known as
a voidglutton has dwelt within these chambers since
Belcorra abandoned them. Unlike many of Belcorra’s
minions, the voidglutton came to her of its own free
will, drawn from across the dimensions by echoes of
Nhimbaloth’s presence. It volunteered to aid Belcorra
as a guardian of the upper shrine (area D13), but once
she relocated her personal effects to deeper within the
Abomination Vaults, it took over these rooms. It basks
in the latent fears and pains of the dungeon’s haunts
and ghosts.
When Belcorra rose as a ghost, the voidglutton took
note and visited her, learning of her plans to reactivate
Gauntlight and realizing it would take time to awaken
the dormant artifact. The voidglutton helped her reﬁne
the plans to testing Gauntlight and has recently done
so with Volluk’s aid (as the heroes experienced at the
beginning of Chapter 2). Since then, the voidglutton
has lurked here, understanding that it’s just a matter
of time before Belcorra contacts it again to enact the
next stage of her plan.
The voidglutton moves from room to room in this
area, as it ﬁnds the echoes of Belcorra’s spirit soothing.
It therefore has an equal chance of being in area
D20a, D20b, D20c, or D20d when the heroes arrive. It
notes the heroes’ intrusion immediately, however, and
swiftly moves to confront them. The creature has no
interest in negotiation; it attacks at once and ﬁghts to
the death, but it doesn’t pursue heroes who ﬂee these
rooms. If the voidglutton clearly has the upper hand
over a group of intruders, it might offer to let most of
them ﬂee if they leave it a single survivor to torment to
death over a few months.

D21. TROPHY VAULT
The walls of this octagonal chamber are sheathed
in a foul‑looking, moist webbing made of stringy,
semi‑transparent slime. The bodies of three creatures have
been mounted on the walls in this webbing, as if on display:
a lavender-skinned elf, the legless body of a spider-like
humanoid, and a hideous humanoid with transparent ﬂesh.
Belcorra took all of her treasure with her when she
left, but the voidglutton has used this place as a den
for many years and has placed a few of its favorite
trophies here—bodies of creatures whose minds it
fed upon and found to be particularly delightful,
along with some of their potent gear and treasures.
The bodies themselves are encased on the walls by
the voidglutton’s ectoplasmic webbing and must be
cut free before they can be searched. Once freed, the
bodies swiftly begin to decay, no longer held in stasis
by the effects of the voidglutton’s webs.
Treasure: The upper torso of a drider from the
ﬂeshwarping labs on the sixth level of the Abomination
Vaults carries a vial with a lesser mistform elixir. A
drow outcast from the outpost of Yldaris on the ninth
level of the Abomination Vaults wears a strand of holy
prayer beads on one wrist. The body of an urdefhan
from the same level carries a +1 striking composite
longbow in a case.
