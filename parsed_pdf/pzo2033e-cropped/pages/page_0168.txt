CHAPTER 9:
On the Hunt
As any explorer of the Darklands can tell you, the
farther you descend, the wilder and stranger things
become. As Belcorra dug the Abomination Vaults
deeper, she found an extensive system of caverns.
Unlike the self-contained Farm level, these caverns
were truly wild. At ﬁrst, she fought against the ﬁerce
denizens and tried to close off the passages to deeper
places, but the task was futile. She dubbed the place
the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save
for building alliances with the communities there.
Belcorra established only a few strongholds in the
area, including a lodge, a vault, and the entrance to the
Gate of Nhimbaloth, the subterranean temple holding
the Empty Vault and the source of Gauntlight’s power.
The Urdefhan Cult
Urdefhans are vampire-like humanoids who largely
pursue lives of violence and slaughter. As brutal killers
obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the
urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves
to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds
were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for
her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming
attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer
called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened.
Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard
of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the
Emerald Fulcrum Lens to the war champion as a token
of her favor until then. Generations passed, and the
war champions passed down the fulcrum lens as their
symbol of leadership.
Drow Allegiance
With the deep gnomes cowed and the urdefhans awed
by her power, Belcorra next turned to the drow of
the Hunting Grounds. From their secure stronghold
of Yldaris, the drow ranged through the caverns like
deadly apparitions, retreating in the face of signiﬁcant
danger. Belcorra knew that she must trap the drow into
an alliance, so she captured and imprisoned more and
more of their hunters until Yldaris’s leader agreed to
meet with her. She traded the captives for a promise that
the drow would keep the Ochre Fulcrum Lens safe and
provide aid in her attack on the surface.
