Area E7c has a secret door in its west wall that
opens by manipulating a hook on the room’s weapon
rack. With a successful DC 20 Perception check, a
hero Searching this room locates identiﬁes this door
and how to open it.
Creature:
Belcorra’s
chief
assassin,
Siora
Fallowglade, tried to ﬂee the Abomination Vaults
during the chaos following Belcorra’s death. She
murdered the two guards stationed here to hide the
evidence of her ﬂight, but one of the guards managed
to inﬂict a mortal wound. Siora died before reaching
the other end of the tunnel.
At Belcorra’s death, a surge of negative energy swept
through this area, tethering Siora’s soul to this area as
a shadow. Siora is eager to create minions to serve her.
She thus focuses on one enemy at a time; she steals
their shadow, marks them for death, then murders
them. She retreats if badly damaged, but only to set up
an ambush later. An implacable foe, she continues her
attacks until destroyed.

E8. ASSASSIN’S QUARTERS
The secret doors providing entrance to this room—one
at the end of the hall that leads north and another at
the end of the hall leading south—are both obvious
from this side.
Dust and neglect cover this chamber’s narrow bed,
warped wooden wardrobe, and large footlocker.
Siora Fallowglade once lived here, but
no one has come here since her death
centuries ago. The bedding and clothing
have all decayed into threadbare
scraps.

The
footlocker
contains
a
wide-brimmed
red hat with a large black
feather (a greater hat of
disguise), a pouch of tiny
emeralds worth a total
of 25 gp, and Siora’s
poison codex. This book contains the formulas for
hunting spider venom, giant scorpion venom, giant
wasp venom, and malyass root paste. The book is
