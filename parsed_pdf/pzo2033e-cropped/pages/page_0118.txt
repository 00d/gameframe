F18. DRESSING ROOM
MODERATE 6
Oversized furniture, certainly intended for rooms larger
than this one, has been jammed into this small room. An
acrid smell, like burning paint, ﬁlls the air.
Shadow Malice’s members hang out in this
room when not on stage. The smell comes from a
cracked and barely functioning hookah, but the band
members nevertheless use it with whatever substances
they ﬁnd.
Creatures: The four members of Shadow Malice are
Gulzash, Kragala, Nox, and Ryta. If encountered here,
they simply insist that the heroes leave them alone. If
the heroes seem up for a challenge but aren’t overtly
hostile, Ryta challenges them on the Warped Brew’s
main stage in area F11, in the performance challenge
described there.
If things come to blows with Shadow
Malice, Gulzash swings his battle lute
while Nox ﬁghts with their kukri.
Kragala and Ryta prefer to cast
spells to harass enemies from
a distance but can ﬁght
in melee if it becomes
necessary: Kragala clubs
foes with her drumsticks and
Ryta gnaws her enemies. Any
band member reduced to
fewer than 15 HP ﬂees, taking
their cherished instrument with
them to seek a safer gig somewhere else.
