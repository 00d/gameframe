Yldaris, I renewed the vows my grandfather made. But I’ve
never felt bound by mere words. I won’t help her. I’ll help
you. You’re welcome in Yldaris as long as you’d like.”
The heroes can ask Quara more questions if they’d
like, but she knows little else. Before the conversation
winds down, however, Bhazrade and Klathor speak.
“There is more…” one of the twins says. They move their
mouths in unison, making it hard to tell which is speaking.
“…you should know,” the other drow continues.
This plainly piques Quara’s interest, and she motions for
the brothers to go on.
“The ochre lens lies in a dark and wet place. Khurfel didn’t
claim it. Larathols dropped it in the water to deny it to his
enemy. He died attempting to learn more of its purpose,
more than the partial truth we know,” one twin speaks.
“We have seen in a vision that the stones both empower
the Ghost Queen and hold the key to her demise. They are
slivers of something ancient, alien, evil, and hungry,” the
other continues.
“We saw eyes of Empty Death!” they cry in unison.
“She separated the lenses because, together, they draw
the baleful attention of the Empty Death. Even the Ghost
Queen cannot withstand the Empty Death when their
powers are joined within her. The secrets to the lenses are
in the old treasure vault, which overlooks the lake.”
“Find the lenses and the answers Larathols sought.”
The twin seers fall silent again, and Quara looks
back to the heroes. She explains, “I would say you
get used to Bhazrade and Klathor, but one never
does. Let me assure you that when they do
speak, it’s important. This is all news to me, but
when their words beneﬁt Yldaris, and you as well.”
Consulting the Whispering Reeds: The heroes
might have recovered a book of Nhimbaloth’s lore,
called The Whispering Reeds, from higher in the
Abomination Vaults. A hero who consults this tome
ﬁnds references to the fulcrum lenses without a check
to Recall Knowledge and without suffering from
the book’s curse. The Whispering Reeds speaks
of slivers of Nhimbaloth’s essence existing in the
fulcrum lenses, perhaps as a means to contact the
Outer God. The fulcrum lenses possess different and
powerful (but, in the text, unspeciﬁed) abilities. Yet the
fulcrum lenses are dangerous in close proximity, and
even Nhimbaloth’s worshippers fear to bring more
than two or three together. Using their powers draws
Nhimbaloth’s scrutiny and invites destruction.
Side Quest: Finding the fulcrum lenses and using
them against Belcorra is the primary goal of the
Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. But Quara has
a side task that’s personally important to her: she’d
like Khurfel killed and his rhoka sword brought to her
as a trophy. As pragmatic as Quara is, she carries the
common drow vice of vengeance. She emphasizes to
the heroes that Khurfel would never part with the lens
while he draws breath, so defeating him is necessary
in any case.
XP Award: Award the heroes 120 XP for
allying with Quara and the Yldaris drow.
