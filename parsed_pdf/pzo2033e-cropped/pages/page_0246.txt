SEUGATHI REALITY WARPER
Seugathi reality warpers create and destroy inhospitable environments on
a small scale by manipulating the forces of raw chaos. A neothelid might
spawn such a seugathi to create habitats for unique slaves or guests, or
to destroy the ecosystem of a troublesome species. Darklands scholars
refer to reality warpers as veterans in the seugathi ranks, but they’re more
accurately compared to aggressive landscape architects.

Warp Reality ̂ˬ (concentrate, occult, transmutation) The seugathi bends
reality in their choice of a 10-foot emanation or a 60-foot line, altering the
terrain of the area. The terrain becomes a diﬀerent type of terrain (such as
aquatic, arctic, or desert) and becomes normal or diﬃcult terrain, as the
seugathi chooses. Structures, general geographic features, and creatures in
the area aren’t transformed, but creatures in the area take 5d6 chaotic damage
(DC 28 basic Fortitude save) as reality tries to bend them along with the
terrain. Though changes to the area are permanent, the natural environment
might eventually revert the land back to its original state (aquatic areas drain,
arctic areas thaw, and so on).
UNUSUAL EQUIPMENT
Most seugathi carry a magic wand—
either one gifted by their neothelid
master to serve a particular end or
simply one they’ve discovered to
be particularly useful. A wand of
2nd-level magic missile is common,
but speciﬁc equipment is as varied
as the seugathis’ inexplicable
missions. A seugathi might instead
carry alchemical equipment, a
strange tool, or another magic
item. One is just as likely to have
a traveler’s anytool as a jar full of
eerie, unstable explosives.
