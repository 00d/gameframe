an afterlife in the way a sleeping person could dream
several different lives in the span of a single night.
Whether a dreamer wakes with the dawn or dies in
their sleep, all dreams eventually come to an end. Just
as when the Empty Death comes to call, even death
knows oblivion—and even death may die.
Holy Text
Mentions of Nhimbaloth are rare, even for the esoteric
topic of the Outer Gods. The dread Necronomicon
mentions her, and certain translations of that book
purportedly contain descriptions of her true form,
which might be the only place where Nhimbaloth’s
true form is set down in print. This information isn’t
even present in the text most often associated with her
worship: a rare tome called The Whispering Reeds.
The genesis of The Whispering Reeds lies not in
those who worship the Empty Death, but in those who
sought to oppose her. The book consists of stories,
myths, parables, and encounters with Nhimbaloth
gathered from hundreds of regions in dozens of worlds.
The compiler’s name has been long forgotten, as they
neglected to name themself in the text. This matters
not to those who worship Nhimbaloth, nor does the
fact that the author originally penned the book for the
purpose of cataloging the ways in which Nhimbaloth’s
inﬂuence could be opposed. The very act of collecting
these old stories of the Empty Death brushing against
the world had the opposite effect, and now, those who
seek to draw their goddess’s attention to their world
uses The Whispering Reeds to spread stories of her
previous visits.
Details on this potent, cursed work appear on
page 216.
Relations with Other Religions
Nhimbaloth doesn’t consort with other gods,
although often her visitations upon the wilderness
force confrontations with other faiths. In particular,
Gozreh and Desna oppose her influence—the former
because of the proliferation of unnatural elements
that taint swamplands, and the latter out of a
mixture of anger and fear that her flock might
stumble into Nhimbaloth’s clutches accidentally
while exploring the wilds. The Eldest of the
First World also oppose Nhimbaloth, whose
parasitic tendrils can occasionally drift into
that plane through fey gates and portals.
Even after driving out the Empty Death,
small cults of fey who have fallen
under her sway inevitably remain.
Pharasma
opposes
Nhimbaloth
for multiple reasons. Those who
perish in lands haunted by the
latter’s presence tend to rise as
ghosts. Moreover, the Empty Death’s
habit of consuming those ghosts has
rightly angered Pharasma, for rather
than being released to the Boneyard,
the consumed souls simply disappear.
One might assume that such an affront
to the cycle of life and death would
compel Pharasma into a direct
confrontation with Nhimbaloth,
and indeed, certain ancient texts
tell of such a clash between
the
two
goddesses
at
the very dawn of mortal
civilization.
