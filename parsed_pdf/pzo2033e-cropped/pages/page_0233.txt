Corpselight
A will-o’-wisp that starves to death might rise as a cold, blue, glowing
sphere of spongy wetness—a corpselight. A corpselight instinctively seeks
out a host corpse to dwell within, as its physical form quickly deteriorates
if not hidden within a dead creature.
CORPSELIGHT
CREATURE 2
RARE
CE
MEDIUM
UNDEAD
Perception +7; corpse sense (precise) 30 feet, darkvision
Languages Common, Necril
Skills Athletics +7, Intimidation +8, Stealth +8
Str +3, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +1, Wis +1, Cha +2
Corpse Sense A corpselight can sense dead bodies within range. This is a precise
sense that functions through solid barriers less than 5 feet thick.
AC 17; Fort +5, Ref +10, Will +7
HP 40, negative healing; Immunities death eﬀects, disease, fear, paralyzed,
poison, precision, unconscious; Weaknesses bludgeoning 5 (in skeletal
corpses) or slashing 5 (in ﬂeshy corpses)
Sunlight Powerlessness A corpselight exposed to sunlight is
stunned 2 and clumsy 2, and cannot Claim a Corpse.
Wisp Form When a corpselight is reduced to 0 Hit Points
while merged with a corpse, it is instead reduced to 1
Hit Point as the corpse collapses to the ground and the
corpselight emerges in its wisp form. While in wisp
form, a corpselight is Tiny and can take no actions other
than Claim Corpse or Fly. A corpselight that starts its turn
in wisp form must attempt a DC 16 ﬂat check at the end of
its turn; if it fails, it loses 1 Hit Point. A corpselight reduced to
0 Hit Points while in wisp form is destroyed.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet (wisp form only)
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +10, Damage 1d8+6 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +10 (agile), Damage 1d6+6 slashing
Claim Corpse Ȱɵ (necromancy) Prerequisites The corpselight is in wisp
form and is adjacent to a Medium or Small corpse that hasn’t been
claimed by a corpselight in the past 24 hours; Effect The corpselight
merges with the corpse, causes the corpse to Stand, and regains 3d6
Hit Points.
Death Light ̂ˬ (emotion, fear, mental, necromancy, occult) Prerequisites
The corpselight is merged with a corpse; Eﬀect The corpselight emits a
sickly blue beam of light from its mouth and eyes in a 20-foot cone. All
living creatures in this area must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude
saving throw. If at least 1 creature fails its save, the
corpselight regains 2d6 Hit Points, gaining any that
exceed its maximum as temporary Hit Points
that last for 1 minute. The corpselight can’t use
Death Light again for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes 1d6 negative
damage.
Failure The creature takes 2d6 negative damage
and is frightened 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes 4d6 negative damage
and is frightened 3.
LARGER CORPSELIGHTS
A typical corpselight can animate
only a Small or Medium corpse, but
particularly powerful corpselights
can inhabit larger bodies. Their basic
abilities remain the same, but the
damage they deal and the DC of their
Death Light increase as appropriate
for their increased level.
