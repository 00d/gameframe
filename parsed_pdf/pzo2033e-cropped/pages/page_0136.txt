to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the
threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then
perhaps we can broker a deal—one that greatly beneﬁts
both of us with a minimal number of precious lives lost.”
If the heroes already encountered Szek and made
an agreement with her—which Urevian doesn’t really
mind—he adds, “You already struck a bargain with Szek,
so I know it is not a matter of if, but of what price.
Trust me when I say, I am offering you an excellent
deal.” For this conversation, refer to the following list
of likely questions and Urevian’s responses.
Who are you? “I am Urevian, a contract devil of
some renown, if I do say so myself.”
What do you want from us? “Simply put, you
are the third-party agents I need to get out of this
dreadful place and return home. You see, there
is something I want but am not allowed to go
and get myself, nor can I employ any infernal
agents to retrieve it. No, the hands of a mortal
foe of Belcorra must deliver me my prize. My
devils are valueless in this regard, as are my
ﬂeshwarp soldiers.”
Why does it have to be a mortal foe of
Belcorra? “That is the delight of legalistic
contract interpretation. It cannot be me,
any of my minions, or any ally of Belcorra.
The contract was written with the intent
that Belcorra alone could give me the prize
as my payment. Which, of course, she
will not until I have given her the full
measure of service the contract requires.
However, a very technical reading
means any of her foes can also provide
it—and you have thus far conclusively
demonstrated that you oppose her.”
What is it that you want? “I require
the soul of Carman Rajani. In his living
body, if possible, though I can make do
should he... perish.”
What do you want with Carman’s soul? “I
owe the soul of a Rajani to someone much
more powerful than myself. It would be...
unwise for me to leave the Material Plane
without it. Carman is the last descendant
of Vol Rajani.”
What will this powerful someone do
with Carman’s soul? “I do not know;
my contract merely stipulated to
turn it over. Just arranging the deal
proved considerably costly, but I
stand to gain quite a bit of prestige in
Hell if it is completed.”
What do we do if he died? “I know a ritual that can
summon his spirit out of the River of Souls and back
to the place where he died. There it can be captured. If
you sign an agreement with me, I shall teach it to you.”
We can’t give you someone’s soul. That’s evil! “Is
it? I say it is a lesser evil to turn over the soul of
one corrupted individual than to allow an entire
town’s destruction. Far less bloodshed on all
