CHAPTER 1:
A Light in the Fog
When the fog is creeping,
And the moon is low;
When the town is sleeping,
Gauntlight starts to glow!
That’s when she arises
For her midnight lunch.
Naughty kids are prizes
For her teeth to crunch.
But if you obey me,
And obey the rules;

signiﬁcant treasure after being completely picked over.
Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra’s defeat
after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace
to Otari through sinister rhymes.
Or so the citizens of Otari believe.
While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she
did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn’t limit
her diet to foolish children), the belief that she’s no
longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th
anniversary of the most signiﬁcant event of her life—
her family’s exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites—
Belcorra’s spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight
Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented
only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had
stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her
