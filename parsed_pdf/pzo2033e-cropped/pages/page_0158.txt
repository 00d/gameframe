a 3rd‑level ﬁreball (DC 28 basic Reﬂex save; DC 28 to
notice and disarm the glyph). The glyph triggers when
a non‑undead creature touches the door, even to open
it with the key.
This chamber is dusty and dry. At its west end sits a stone
slab three feet high. Atop it lies a small body covered in
funeral wrappings.
Gorsalthith, one of the oldest Children of
Belcorra, plans to become a demilich. The other
Children don’t know where he got this idea; none
of them have even seen a demilich, although
they’ve all heard stories of the gem-studded
undead
skulls
with
phenomenal
spellcasting power. But Gorsalthith
was adamant that he knew the
method: he placed gemstones in his
eyes, replaced his teeth with smaller
gems, and drilled holes into his head
to lodge a crown of crystals there. He
then locked himself in this room to lay
in repose, patiently waiting for his body
to turn to dust and his transformation to
take its ﬁnal form. He has been here
for nearly a century with no change
in his mummiﬁed form.
Creatures:
Gorsalthith
is
determined in his unrealistic
goal. When the heroes enter,
he becomes convinced
he must defeat them to
advance his evolution. He
arrogantly talks about his
pending
transformation
as he ﬁghts.
GORSALTHITH
CREATURE 9
Elder child of Belcorra (page 156)
Initiative Perception +20
Treasure: Gorsalthith’s only treasures
are the gemstones grafted to his skull. The
teeth are a variety of semiprecious stones, 24
in total, each worth 8 sp. His eye sockets
each have a clear topaz worth 50 gp, and
his crown is nine bits of quartz worth 3
gp each.
A21. ANCIENTS’ CAVES
SEVERE 8
Four caves atop steeps cliﬀs sit ten feet above the
lake’s dark water.
These cliff walls have numerous handholds and
require a successful DC 15 Athletics check to Climb to
the caves (or across from one to the other).
Creatures: Three Children of Belcorra became far
too interested in the lore of Nhimbaloth and were
blasted with a powerful glimpse of the Outer God,
transforming them into bodaks. Nursing their pain
and resentment, the bodaks retreated to these caves.
The other Children acknowledge the bodaks’ power
and knowledge but rarely approach them. The bodaks
dwell individually in areas H21a, H21b, and
H21d. When any bodak is disturbed, the
others clamber over to help,
so anyone ﬁghting one of the
bodaks soon ﬁghts them all.
EMPTY DEATH BODAK (3)	CREATURE 8
UNCOMMON
CE
SMALL
UNDEAD
Variant bodak (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 42)
Initiative Perception +17
Treasure: While two bodaks have no
treasure, the one that dwells in area
H21d has valuables scattered
about its cave. A sack contains
80 gp, 2 pp, and eyes of the
eagle. A greater staff of healing
lies discarded at the back of
the cave, and a +1 striking
shortsword is wedged in a
crack in the wall.
H22. QUIET LAKE
The western side of the
large lake has foul water and
obscuring mist like the lake to
the east (area H15). This side is
less populated, predominantly
due to the appetite of the
froghemoth lairing to the south.
The heroes might have random
encounters here, too, but the DC of the ﬂat
check for an encounter is 10 rather than 5.
H23. SHADOWED DOCK
LOW 8
This T-shaped dock has been recently
repaired, and a single skiff is moored on
its north side. Beyond the dock, a masonry
structure juts out from the cavern walls, the
drifting mist creating strange shadows on
the stonework. At its center is a single iron-
bound door.
