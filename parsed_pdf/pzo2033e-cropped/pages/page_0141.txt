PAINFUL SUGGESTION TRAP
HAZARD 8
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 26 (expert)
Description A hidden rune on the ﬂoor under the ﬁlth, just
past the threshold, triggers an ersatz ghost.
Disable DC 28 Thievery (expert) to remove the rune without
triggering it, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC
26) to dispel the rune
Counterfeit Haunting
Ǻȓ
(auditory,
enchantment,
incapacitation, linguistic, mental) Trigger A living
creature moves over the rune; Eﬀect A frightful moan
echoes through the room, and a hoarse telepathic
voice shouts, “Get out!” This shout deals 6d12 mental
damage to creatures in the room (DC 26 basic Will save).
Creatures who fail this saving throw must immediately
leave the room and can’t willingly reenter it for 1 minute
(1 hour on a critical failure).
Reset The trap automatically resets after 1 hour.
G17. STASIS CHAMBERS
MODERATE 7
Fifteen transparent pillars ﬁll the center of this 30-foot-high
room. A bright light shines down into the center of each
chamber. A catwalk 10 feet above the ground circles around
the edge of the room without handrail or banister; at the
western side, each stops at a staircase leading down.
Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior
to teleporting them via Gauntlight’s beam. Each cell is
10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent
stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own
column, held in suspended animation outside the ﬂow
of time. The creatures haven’t aged and ignore any
effect from the normal timestream as long as they stay
imprisoned within their stasis chambers. However,
such effects can work on the pillars, which are made
of transparent, magically enhanced stone (Hardness 18,
HP 76).
Ten pillars are occupied. Nine contain living
creatures: a chuul (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 64), a
drider (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 159), three
ghonhatines (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2
119), a gibbering mouther (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 176), a gibtanius (page 239),
and two gugs (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 198).
One contains a dead gogiteth because
of a ﬂaw in its chamber’s magic. If a hero
breaks the pillar around one of the creatures,
roll a DC 3 ﬂat check; on a success, the collapsing
stasis effect messily kills it. On a failure, the
creature returns to normal time and attacks anything
in sight until destroyed. (High-level monsters, such
as the ghonhatines, pose a serious danger even for
7th-level characters!)
Of the ﬁve empty stasis chambers, two are
noteworthy. The northwest chamber appears badly
blackened, as though from soot on the inside. After
the error with the gogiteth, Belcorra appointed a
hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical
expertise would prove invaluable in maintaining the
stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend the hag to do
this job in life. Belcorra trapped the hag in this pillar,
burned her to death, and bound her spirit as a witchﬁre.
A creature entering a square adjacent to this blackened
pillar receives a brief telepathic ﬂash of Belcorra burning
