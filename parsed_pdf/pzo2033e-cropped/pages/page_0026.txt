A4. MAGGOT TRAINING HALL
MODERATE 1
Piles of rotting timbers and loose stones lie in heaps
throughout this large, L-shaped hall. Clumps of moss and
tangled vines spill down from gaps in the wooden ceiling
above each pile of rubble. Several doors lead out to all
sides, most barely clinging to their hinges and frames.
Debris completely blocks a wooden stairwell that leads up
to a large hole in the ceiling. Here and there, the stone walls
bear the scars of ﬁre or damage from an ancient battle.
Many years ago, the Roseguard confronted Belcorra
in this vast room. The ﬁght spilled from here into the
servants’ lounge, now a sinkhole (area A8), and caused
some of the keep’s collapse. A hero Investigating
this room who succeeds at a DC 15 check to Recall
Knowledge using any skill associated with magic
conﬁrms that powerful, destructive spells caused some
of the damage centuries ago.
Most of the doors in this room are easy enough to
access, with a couple exceptions. The door to area A11
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check to Force
Open, and rubble has mostly buried the door to area
A14. Characters can try to clamber over the pile of
rubble, through a hole in the roof, and down into the
room beyond with a successful DC 10 Athletics check.
A secret door opens into a small hidden alcove
to the northwest; a hero Searching this room who
succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check ﬁnds a section
of the stone wall that slides aside to access it. The
alcove beyond the door has several grooves in the
stone, caused by what looks like determined scraping.
This chamber used to contain a teleportation circle
(Pathﬁnder Advanced Player’s Guide 244) to area C5a,
but fortune hunters found this hidden alcove centuries
ago and gouged out all the silver in the magic runes.
The extensive damage drained away the magic and
permanently destroyed the teleportation circle.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Arcana or
Occultism check to Recall Knowledge
realizes the original purpose of this
room and the permanent damage
done. This room foreshadows
the many other teleportation
circles in the Abomination Vaults
that the heroes will be able to
reactivate and use.
Creatures: When
the
mitﬂits
dwelled in the dungeons below, they
numbered in the dozens, but their
violent eviction by the morlocks,
attrition from games of “dodge the squirt,” and
misjudged vermin empathy have diminished the group.
Originally, all the Mudlickers lived in this large room;
now, only three mitﬂits remain here.
The Mudlicker leader, Boss Skrawng, has an
audacious plan. After discovering the giant maggots
in area A5 and the giant ﬂy in area A6, he ordered his
mitﬂits to start training and breeding more maggots.
Once the insects have fully grown, he intends on
leading his entire group, mounted on trained giant
ﬂy war steeds, down to Otari to raid and rule. Three
mitﬂits are currently engaged in training their ﬁrst
maggot, hoping the pallid creature retains its training
after it matures into a giant ﬂy. None of the gremlins
know how long it takes for a maggot to grow up
big and strong, but upon sighting the heroes, they
immediately order their “pet” forward to attack. After
all, giant-ﬂy war steeds need to develop a taste for
people to grow up nice and mean.

A collapsed wooden staircase in the northeastern corner of
this room winds up to a moss-shrouded hole. The expanse
of the Fogfen is visible through a total collapse in a stone
wall to the west. A dead frog the size of a horse lies
sprawled in this collapse, its back legs bitten oﬀ at the hips.
