Vaults
story of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The
corpses here used to be linked to enslaved ghosts that
guarded the hall, but their undead presences have been
inadvertently drawn into the magical wall at the south
end of this hallway.
A large ﬂight of stairs to the south leads down to
area E1. For now, progress to this level is blocked
by a shimmering wall of ectoplasm. Now and then,
silently shrieking ghosts ﬂit through the swirling mist
of this wall. The stairwell beyond remains visible yet
tauntingly inaccessible. This wall acts as a wall of force
heightened to 9th level and has been forged from the
agonized souls of the heroes displayed throughout this
hallway—they’re the trapped ghosts who silently cry
out in agony within the wall. This wall’s creation was
an unintended side effect of Gauntlight’s test ﬁring
after it had lain dormant for so long. For now, though,
the wall blocks progress deeper into the dungeon.
Only the icons of Belcorra’s killers can bring it down,
as the ghost of Otari Ilvashti in area D18 can explain.
The secret door in the alcove, which leads to area D10,
is built into the back of the only empty sarcophagus.
A hero who Searches the empty sarcophagus and
succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check discovers the
latch to swing the sarcophagus open like a door.
The collapse in the northwest wall leads to a series
of 5-foot-high ledges that drop down to area D14.
Creatures: The two northernmost sarcophagi
contain traitorous apprentices transformed into cairn
wights. If anyone approaches within 15 feet of them,
both lids pop open and the cairn wights emerge to
attack. They relentlessly pursue foes through this level.

D13. UPPER TEMPLE OF NHIMBALOTH
SEVERE 4
This vast octagonal chamber is mostly empty. The walls
are carved and painted to resemble a sprawling graveyard
half-sunken into a swampy morass, yet all the graves in
the mural are open and empty. Carved images of shrieking
ghosts parade upward and into the hungry pupil of a
malevolent eye at the apex of this room, thirty feet above.
A circular ﬁfteen-foot-diameter platform sits in the middle
of the room, raised three feet oﬀ the surrounding ﬂoor.
The platform supports an altar stone made of an irregular
slab of rock marked by seven deep indentations, almost
as if a huge, seven-ﬁngered hand had gripped the stone
with enough force to leave grooves behind. Now and then,
a faint blue light ﬂickers and pulses inside one of these
indentations. Small objects lie heaped atop the altar.
A successful DC 25 Religion check to Recall
Knowledge identiﬁes this chamber as a shrine dedicated
to Nhimbaloth, the Outer God of despair, ghosts, and
swamps. Her shrines are often empty of additional
furnishings, such as statues or benches, symbolizing the
emptiness of death itself. Worshipers typically kneel or
prostrate themselves on the stone ﬂoor while priests
lead sermons and sacriﬁces at the altar.
The entire shrine is infused with an overwhelming
sense of despair and hopelessness. Any living creature
who enters this room must succeed at a DC 22 Will
save or become frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical
failure). A living creature can’t reduce its frightened
condition while in this chamber. A critical success
grants the creature temporary immunity for 24 hours.
Creatures: A hero who succeeds at a DC 16
Perception check from the room’s entrance identiﬁes
the objects on the altar as four severed hands. These
undead guardians scuttle forth and attack when the
heroes enter this room. When the hands animate,
four ﬂickerwisps slither out from indentations on the
altar’s sides and join in their attack. The ﬂickerwisps
and crawling hands don’t pursue foes from the shrine
room. If no foes are present, they return to their
original places on the altar. They ﬁght until destroyed.

Lights from the Altar: The altar produces a new
ﬂickerwisp each day at dusk, but no more than four
ﬂickerwisps can exist in this chamber at one time. The
malevolent aura and ﬂickerwisp generation persist
until the heroes place the four Roseguard icons atop
the altar stone, as directed by Otari’s ghost (area D18).
At this point, the frightening despair in the room ends,
and the altar produces no more ﬂickerwisps.
D14. PAVILION
SEVERE 4
This immense cavern is cold and damp. Water drips from
condensation above into a large, still lake. Thick patches
of moist mushrooms, some nearly four feet tall, grow
along the western shore of the lake, while a narrow
trickle of water feeds in from a tunnel to the south. A
thirty-ﬁve-foot-long pavilion made of stone stands in the
middle of the lake, elevated ten feet above the water level
by more than a dozen stone columns. The entire pavilion is
