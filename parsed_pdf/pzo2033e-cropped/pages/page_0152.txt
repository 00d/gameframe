H8. DULAC’S CHAMBERS
MODERATE 8
This sparsely appointed chamber contains a single mat in
the far corner of the room and a small desk on the south wall
with an iron strongbox sitting under it. A bowl with some
gray gruel and a spoon are the only items on the desk.
This chamber serves as quarters for a severe caligni
woman named Dulac, the head of the Cult of Urthagul.
She has granted herself the title of “custodian” to
demonstrate her humble subservience to Urthagul. Once
a very active and vital leader, she drew the attention of
an owb, one of the malevolent manipulators of caligni
communities. The owb spends his time in the secret
chamber off of this room, twisting Dulac’s faith.
Dulac’s control and self-conﬁdence took a severe
blow when Belcorra stationed the will-o’-wisps around
the cultists’ domain. Cut off from Urthagul’s bizarre
babblings and strange insights, Dulac isn’t sure what
to do next. The owb offers vague assurances, but he
secretly likes seeing the cult crumble and doesn’t want
contact with Urthagul restored.
A hero who Searches this room and succeeds at a
DC 25 Perception check discovers the secret door in
the east wall as well as the hidden latch that must be
pulled and turned to open it. The room is empty—the
owb needs no comforts, only solitude.
Creatures: Custodian Dulac and the owb are in here
in close conversation. They ﬁght intruders, but if the
heroes give any indication that they’re willing to talk,
Dulac ceases hostilities to hear them out. However, the
owb presses the attack to silence the heroes.
If the owb is defeated and Dulac is reduced to fewer
than 30 Hit Points, she surrenders.

Side Quest: If the heroes parley with Dulac, she
proposes a deal. If the heroes gather more chuul eggs
and eliminate the wisps on the fringes of the cult’s
territory, Dulac will make them formal allies of the cult.
As allies, they can rest in the shrine whenever they’d
like. Further, she can grant them safe passage through
caligni territory in the lodge. She warns that the caligni
defenders on the lower level aren’t likely to speak with
the heroes without Dulac’s good word.
Treasure: The iron strongbox holds one small pouch
containing 13 gp and 50 sp, another with 30 pieces of
onyx worth 2 gp each, four moderate healing potions,
and a barkskin potion.
XP Award: Award the heroes XP for talking with
Dulac as though they’d defeated her in combat.
H9. BARRICADED DOOR
This stout, iron-bound door swings open to the north.
It used to be barred from the north, but after Huglu
sneaked in, the calignis blocked the southern side with
rubble for additional security. Moving the rubble to
open the door is time-consuming but not difﬁcult.
H10. STAIRS OF URTHAGUL
SEVERE 8
This long chamber features roughly carved stairs leading
upward. Its sides are dotted with nooks, two of which
contain stone basins ﬁlled with muddy water.
The basins are similar to and serve the same purpose
as those in the Hall of Eyes (area H2).
