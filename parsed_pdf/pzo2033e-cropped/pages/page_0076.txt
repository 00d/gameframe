Volluk and the voidglutton needed a living creature
as an anchor for the light. While others who touch
the light suffer negative damage, the light
simultaneously heals its anchor as swiftly as
it harms them, keeping the person in a
perpetual state of agony.
This victim is a dwarf named Lasda
Venkervale (LG male dwarf bartender
2), once the bartender at the Rowdy
Rockﬁsh in Otari. Volluk abducted
Lasda just over a year ago for
nefarious
experiments
while
the dwarf was on one of his
customary predawn walks
from the Rockﬁsh up to
the graveyard. Volluk
kept Lasda a prisoner
in area D11 for many
months and, impressed
by the dwarf’s hardiness,
decided
to
use
him
as
Gauntlight’s anchor.
Creatures: The heroes can’t focus on rescuing Lasda
without ﬁrst defeating a will-o’-wisp that has been
gorging itself on Lasda’s terror. It’s invisible when the
heroes ﬁrst arrive, but it ﬂares up in an angry blue
glow as soon as the heroes attempt to aid the dwarf. It
pursues foes who ﬂee and ﬁghts to the death.

Side Quest: To remove Lasda from the terrible
ribbon of energy, the heroes must ﬁrst unlock the four
manacles that bind him. The key to these manacles can
be found in area D8, or the heroes can succeed at three
DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock on each manacle.
Unless the heroes have some means of working on the
locks from a distance, each round a hero works to
unlock a manacle (by the key or otherwise), that hero
is exposed to the ribbon of necromantic energy.
Once freed and removed from the energy ribbon,
Lasda recovers his mobility after 2d4 rounds of
gasping for breath. Lasda can tell the heroes the
harrowing tale of his imprisonment and give a partial
description of areas D1 to D11. The heroes might have
heard of Lasda’s disappearance if they’ve spoken to
his worried mother, Brelda, at the Rowdy Rockﬁsh.
If the heroes return Lasda to the Rowdy Rockﬁsh,
his mother is overjoyed and presses upon the heroes
a family heirloom, a minor sturdy shield emblazoned
with an angry-looking rockﬁsh, as a reward.
Removing Lasda from the ribbon of light causes the
necromantic energy here and in areas B35 and C15 to
vanish. While this prevents Belcorra from ﬁring
Gauntlight’s beam upon Otari again, the
reprieve is only temporary. As the heroes
will learn from Otari’s ghost, Belcorra
continues to prepare Gauntlight for its
true purpose far below.
In addition, once Lasda is removed,
the haunts on the upper four
levels of the Abomination
Vaults don’t reset if they’re
deactivated or defeated. These
effects return if both Volluk and
the voidglutton survive, and they’re
given several days to ﬁnd and install
a new victim. If they do so, this
should be an NPC whose kidnapping
spurs the heroes into action!
D10. SCALATHRAX PEN
MODERATE 4
The ﬂoor of this rough-hewn cavern is strewn with bones
and scraps of metal and cloth.
All three irregular, rocky passages out of this area
end in secret doors. All three secret doors are obvious
from within the cavern.
Creatures: This cavern once merely connected the
southwestern and northeastern wings of the level, but
it now serves as a pen for a trio of scalathraxes. One
of these has already been transported from area D9 via
Gauntlight’s beam to Otari in Chapter 2, but the other
two remain here, awaiting Volluk’s next Gauntlight
test. They’re poorly fed and attack the heroes on sight,
pursuing them relentlessly.

D11. TORTURE CHAMBER
MODERATE 4
Three ﬁve-foot-square iron cages, the bars lined with spikes
on the inside, hang from chains in the middle of this room.
Blood-crusted manacles dangle from chains on the west
wall. A stout wooden table with more manacles anchored
to it stands in the southwest corner, and on it sits a whip
made of blood-red leather with a silver handle.
Here, Belcorra imprisoned and tortured those lacking
the qualities she sought for ﬂeshwarping experiments or
arena battles in the levels below. Once she was satisﬁed
