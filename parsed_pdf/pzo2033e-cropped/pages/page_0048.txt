Treasure: The river drake stashes what treasure she
has gathered in a sea chest amid a tangle of roots in the
southwestern cul-de-sac. A successful DC 16 Perception
check while Searching ﬁnds the chest amid the roots.
The drake’s treasure consists of 36 gp, a retribution axe,
a wand of magic missile (1st), and a wayﬁnder.
B20. MOLDY BEACH
A thick knot of roots hangs from the cavern roof over a muddy
beach. Stone stairs lead up from the beach to the north.
Hazard: The square just south of the bottom of the
stairs, marked with a dotted white box on the map,
appears to contain only moldy roots but is brown mold.

B21. PROCESSIONAL
This long, ten-foot-wide hallway has a vaulted ceiling
arching to a dozen feet high. Three broken metal brackets
hang from the ceiling; one to the south, one to the north,
and one in the middle, although what the frames once held
is unclear. The ﬂoor is strewn with pieces of rotten wood
and twisted metal. To the north, pale green light shimmers
around a closed door’s frame.
The empty frames used to house small, swiveling
ballistas on the ceiling that functioned as traps, but
morlocks have scavenged the components. Only
detritus the morlocks deemed worthless remains.
The secret door leading to area B6 is exceptionally
well hidden from this side, its seams all but invisible
cracks in the stone. A hero who succeeds at a DC 28
Perception check while Searching this hall spots it.
The green light shining through the door frame
to area B28 is evidence of Otari’s unquiet spirit. The
morlocks don’t approach this light, as they believe it
to be a sign of the Ghost Queen’s wrath.
B22. WORKSHOP
SEVERE 2
Roll a secret DC 10 Perception check for each hero
before they enter this room to hear the sound of metal
clanging and wood splintering. A hero who speciﬁcally
listens before entering automatically hears the sound.
This long room smells of rust and grime. Stacks of
splintered furniture, pieces of weapons and armor, frayed
coils of rope, jagged shards of metal, and other bits of trash
lie in heaps along the walls of the room. A cold, unlit forge
sits in an alcove to the west. To the north, several heavy
timbers are wedged up against a door to keep it shut.
Removing the timbers from blocking the door to
area B24 is a simple-enough 3-round activity.
Creatures: Two Ghost Queen morlock engineers
toil at assembling a pair of broken ballistas. While
the morlocks have the skill to rebuild the devices, they
keep incorporating dubious improvements that require
restarting their repairs. The engineers quickly realize
they can present intruders to mollify Graulgust’s
frustration at their slow pace. They prefer to use their
junk launchers from a distance for as long as they can.
The morlocks do their best to capture the heroes
alive; if they do, they conﬁscate the heroes’ gear and
throw the heroes in with the thieves in area B24 until
Graulgust tells the morlocks what to do with them.
Graulgust’s offer to the heroes is described in area B12.

B23. WELL
The air here is cool and moist. A low stone well sits to the
east. Armor, weapons, and tools lie in heaps in the north.
This well drops 40 feet down to a large pool of water
in a natural reservoir in area C40 below. Anyone who
leans over the well can attempt a DC 15 Perception
check to hear a strange sound drifting up from
below—splashing combined with what sounds like a
small crowd. These noises come from the gibbering
mouther that lives below, but it remains out of sight
of anyone peering down the well. The rope and bucket
once used to draw water up from below are long
gone, but the metal bracket in the ceiling is sufﬁciently
strong to anchor a rope supporting the heroes.
Treasure: The heap of gear belongs to the prisoners
in area B24. It consists of three suits of studded leather
armor, two rapiers, one broken rapier, three sets of
thieves’ tools, a lesser healing potion, and 13 gp.
B24. PRISON
Alcoves along the walls might once have been storerooms,
but the stone shelves are all empty. The room smells foul.
The foul odor is due to the room’s use as a prison.
Of the four thieves who stole into the dungeon from
Crook’s Nook, only three survive—Gorul Vetters, Shad
Nunder, and Ziskilly Theed. (If you need statistics,
