Bright Walker
Those who encounter calignis (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 50) quickly learn that
their deaths involve burning out instead of bleeding out. At times, this
dramatic immolation is denied to a caligni, so they arise as a bright walker.
Tied to caligni society, these creatures don’t understand that their glow
damages and repels living calignis. Despite their name, these undead don’t
walk; they instead ﬂoat a few inches above the ground.

HP 115, negative healing; Immunities
death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed,
poison,
precision,
unconscious;
Resistance all damage 10 (except for force, ghost
touch, or positive; double resistance vs. non-magical).
Bright Release (ﬁre, light) When a bright walker is reduced
to 0 Hit Points, they ﬂash out in a burst of light, obtaining
the blazing end they were denied at death. This blaze deals
10d6 ﬁre damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex save) to creatures
within 20 feet. Creatures who fail this save are also dazzled
for 1 minute (blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure).
Light Aura (aura, divine, light) 30 feet. The bright walker
sheds bright light. Any creature that starts its turn in
the aura must attempt at a DC 24 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is temporarily immune
for 24 hours.
Success The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 hour.
Suppress Aura Ȱɵ (concentrate) The bright walker suppresses their light aura
for 1 round, reducing it to a faint, ghostly glow of dim light.
Speed ﬂy 25 feet; landbound
Melee Ȱɵ radiant touch +21 (agile, ﬁnesse, ﬁre, light, magical), Damage 2d8+11 ﬁre
Ranged Ȱɵ radiant ray +21 (ﬁre, light, magical, range increment 60 feet) Damage
2d6+11 ﬁre
Landbound A bright walker can’t ﬂy higher than 1 foot above the ground. If they
ﬂy higher than this distance, they fall but don’t take any damage from falling.
Light Flare ʚʖ (divine, evocation, ﬁre, light); Requirement The bright walker’s
Light Aura is suppressed; Eﬀect The bright walker reignites their Light Aura
with a burst of brightness that deals 5d6 ﬁre damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex
save) to creatures within a 20-foot burst. Creatures who are dazzled or with
light blindness ﬁnd this ﬂare particularly painful; such a creature’s save result
is one degree of success worse than the result it rolled.
Shadow Jump Ȱɵ (conjuration, divine, teleportation); Requirement The bright
walker’s Light Aura is suppressed; Eﬀect The bright walker teleports to a
square it can see within 60 feet that is not in an area of bright light. The bright
walker can’t use Shadow Jump again for 1d4 rounds.
BRIGHT WALKER FORMATION
Most calignis assume that bright
walkers arise at the whims of their
malign and capricious demigods, the
Forsaken, but as the Forsaken are
denied the souls of these undead,
some other unknown force must be
involved.
