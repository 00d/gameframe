should suggest that Yldaris is a safe place to visit, and
set the stage for a peaceful encounter with drow living
in the lower levels.
Jedzeli: This unfortunate skulk (Pathﬁnder Bestiary
2 243) hangs limply on her hook, her right hand visibly
missing. She constantly mumbles and murmurs about
“the man in colored rags who takes hands.” Other
attempts at conversation with her prove unintelligible.
Before Ysondkhelir discovered the psychic human girl,
Dorianna Menhemes, he amused himself by tormenting
Jedzeli’s dreams. With a successful DC 22 Perception
check, a hero who has interacted with Dorianna notices
some disturbing similarities with the way Jedzeli mutters
about the “man in colored rags.” Helping Jedzeli reclaim
her sanity is a long and difﬁcult road outside the scope
of this adventure, but Glashdrumdur offers to look out
for her if the heroes set them both free.
Treasure: While nothing in this kitchen is suitable
for consumption by anyone but perhaps a goblin, a
large jar labeled “deadly nightshade” lies at the bottom
of one of the mushroom baskets. The jar contains four
doses of belladonna poison.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each
prisoner they set free and help to reach an exit to the
Abomination Vaults.
F13. LEVEL 6 PORTAL CHAMBER
This circular chamber is plainly used for storage, as
it has several large casks stacked along its rounded
walls. Dull silver ﬁlls the faded runes carved into the
stone walls.
This room contains an inert teleportation circle like
the ones in areas E18 and G2. As with those rooms,
this teleportation circle must be reactivated with the
awaken portal ritual before it can be used.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for activating
this portal.
F14. STORAGE ROOM
Spare chairs and shelves piled with grimy bottles and
poorly cleaned dishes ﬁll this storage room.
F15. MOLDY SUPPLIES
Fuzzy yellow moss covers the shelves of this room and
their contents.
Hazard: Yellow mold had started to grow here,
leaving the store room unusable. After months of
being left alone, the mold has grown all over the walls
and poses a danger to anyone entering this room.
YELLOW MOLD
HAZARD 8
Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook 524
Stealth DC 28 (trained)
Treasure: A forgotten moderate healing potion in
the back of the room has partially congealed over
time to become oddly lumpy. Although the potion is
unpleasant to consume, it’s no less efﬁcacious for its
semi-congealed consistency.
