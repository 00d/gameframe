Content Warning
While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathﬁnder action
and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism,
body horror, and human experimentation. Before you
begin, understand that player consent (including that of the
Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for
everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning
and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.

From the Beginner Box
If you started the heroes’ careers with the Pathﬁnder Beginner
Box and the adventure “Menace Under Otari,” your heroes
already know about Otari. They’re also already 2nd level! You
don’t need to make any adjustments to this adventure, as 2nd
level characters can begin it without any trouble. Don’t allow
them to level up to 3rd level until they’ve substantially cleared
the dangers in both of the upper two dungeon levels.
