Beneﬁt Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing
melee weapons deal 1 persistent bleed damage. On a
critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to
half your level.
Payment You regain half the normal number of Hit Points
from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term
rest) and from any application of the Medicine skill.
Hidden Condition The barbazu owns any weapons you
ﬁnd. No more often than once per month, the barbazu
can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best
weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand
over the weapon immediately, without question.
Termination Clause The contract guarantees that you will
not “be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action.” This
wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die
from persistent bleed damage from any source, the
contract is voided.
RIGHT OF RETRIBUTION
ITEM 8
RARE
CONTRACT
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Devil erinys; Decipher Writing Nature, Religion
Profane powers of vengeance are yours to inﬂict.
Beneﬁt When a creature deals damage to you, you can
call out for retribution as a reaction. Until the end of
your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack
rolls against that creature.
Payment If you wound a creature, it is your duty to kill
it. If a creature survives for 24 hours after you deal
it damage, you are doomed 1. If you already have the
doomed condition, it increases by 1.
Hidden Condition No more than once per year, the erinys
can compel you to attack a creature of the erinys’s
choice that you can see. You are controlled by the
erinys and must ﬁght the chosen creature for 1 minute.
Termination Clause The contract demands that you
enact bloody vengeance against anyone who has
ever wronged you, but the nature of the vengeance is
vague. You can end the contract by creating eﬃgies of
everyone you believe has ever wronged you, bleeding
upon them all at once (at least 1 Hit Point per eﬃgy),
and destroying them.
ICY DISPOSITION
ITEM 11
RARE
ABJURATION
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Devil gelugon; Decipher Writing Nature, Games Lore
Your ﬂesh looks no diﬀerent, but is cold to the touch.
Beneﬁt You gain cold resistance equal to your level and a
+1 status bonus to saving throws against mental eﬀects.
Payment Liquids in your possession, including potions
and liquid alchemical items, freeze over the course
of 1 minute and thaw 1 minute after they leave your
possession. Frozen potions and elixirs take 1 minute
to consume.
Hidden Condition (conjuration, teleportation) No more than
once per week, the gelugon can move you like a piece on
a game board to advance its schemes. The gelugon can
appear and transport you and any items you’re wearing
and holding from your current space to a clear space
within 500 feet (the gelugon need not see this location,
but must know its relative location and distance from
you). This eﬀect doesn’t transport any other creatures.
The gelugon is unlikely to place you in a less dangerous
space than the one you left.
Termination Clause The contract provides you the beneﬁts
of “the eternal ice of Cocytus.” If you travel to Cocytus,
Hell’s seventh layer, and stand within an area at least 100
feet across that contains no ice and has a temperature
above freezing, the contract is void. Such locations are
exceptionally rare in Cocytus, and the eﬀorts to create
such an area are likely to attract unpleasant attention.
INTERPRETING AN INFERNAL CONTRACT
Understanding the complex, legalistic provisions of
an infernal contract is diﬃcult, and doubly so when a
devil is at hand demanding an expeditious signature.
A reader must attempt a secret check to Decipher
Writing to understand a contract’s provisions. Each
contract indicates appropriate skills to use, and the
DC is based on the contract’s item level (Pathﬁnder
Core Rulebook 503). Alternatively, the reader can
always use the Legal Lore skill to decipher the
contract at the DC – 4. Regardless of the outcome
of the check, the reader always understands the
Beneﬁt and Payment provisions of the contract.
Critical Success The reader understands the
Hidden Condition and the Termination Clause.
Success The reader understands the Hidden
Condition.
Failure The reader misunderstands the Hidden
Condition and receives false information about it.
Critical Failure The reader misunderstands both
the Hidden Condition and the Termination
Clause, receiving false information about each.
A mortal can try to renegotiate the contract;
whether the devil agrees is up to the GM. The mortal
must understand the Hidden Condition or Termination
Clause to change the terms in their favor; the devil
knows if the mortal misunderstands these clauses
(from a failed Decipher Writing check) and if so usually
plays along, knowing that any further agreements
they make based on a misunderstood clause aren’t
binding and don’t change the contract’s eﬀects.
