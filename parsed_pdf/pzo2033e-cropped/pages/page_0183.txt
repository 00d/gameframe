Disable DC 28 Survival (expert) to disrupt the fog before
the hazard triggers or dispel magic (5th level; counteract
DC 26) to counteract the magic.
Gnawing Fog Ǻȓ (divine, evocation) Trigger A creature
crosses the cavern’s midpoint (the dotted line on the
map); Eﬀect The hazard deals 9d6 piercing damage (DC
32 basic Reﬂex save) to the triggering creature and all
other non‑ﬁend creatures within 20 feet. A creature that
critically fails the saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds.
Reset The hazard resets over the course of an hour as the
daemonic stain reenergizes the fog.
Creatures: A derghodaemon lurks in the fog at the
south end of the cavern. It keeps an eye on the deeper
Darklands passages to protect the urdefhan hunting
grounds from anything that might come from that way.
It scuttles forth whenever anyone triggers the hazard, or
when it otherwise hears intruders come close.

I32. SOUTHERN JUMBLE
MODERATE 9
Fungus grows wild and tall throughout this enormous
cavern, sometimes reaching as high as thirty feet. The
cavern ceiling, when visible through the fungal canopy, is
higher still.
Creatures: Some fungus in this wild section of the
cave is dangerous. Two deadly puffballs ﬂoat toward
the heroes when they ﬁrst enter this area, descending
from the mushroom tops high above. They pursue foes
as best they can and ﬁght until destroyed.

I33. FEROCIOUS DISPLAYS
LOW 9
This wide cavern entrance is a disgusting sight. The
walls are splashed with ocher and scarlet images in
a riot of violent and obscene symbols. Stakes around
the entrance hold up skulls and dismembered parts of
strange creatures.
This is the main entrance of the cavern complex
where the urdefhans live. Intelligent creatures in
the Hunting Grounds avoid this place, knowing the
urdefhans ruthlessly protect their territory.
Creatures: Two urdefhan lashers stand guard,
while two death scouts lurk amid the gruesome
displays of skulls and body parts. They’ve been
directed to shout an alarm in the face of powerful
or numerous foes, but they jump eagerly into a
ﬁght as soon as they detect any enemies. If any
three urdefhans are defeated, the survivor suddenly
realizes they should’ve called for help sooner and
ﬂees to area I34 to raise the alarm.
