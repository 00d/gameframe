Characters who Search this dead end can discover the secret door with a
successful DC 26 Perception check. Any character who is Detecting Magic
or is an expert in Survival automatically ﬁnds it, as the secret door is magical
in nature, and there are several subtle tracks leading right to it.
The rubble swings aside when an invisible magical wall panel is touched
by someone speaking any words in Elven. Magic reinforces the secret door,
so it’s impossible to break through.
I5. YLDARIS ENTRY
TRIVIAL 9
Iron sheets cover the outside of the western door, with a slot at drow eye
level covered by a sliding plate on the inside. The door has no keyhole or
handle and is reinforced by heavy bars. Anyone seeking entrance must
either burst through the door (Hardness 15, Hit Points 60) or supply
the secret knock known to all of the outpost’s drow (which occasionally
changes) and wait for the guard to open it.
The door to the east, leading into Yldaris, uses the same construction, but
it’s normally open and unbarred.
Creature: A drow warden named Taklitur stands guard inside the
door, ready to admit anyone who gives the proper knock. If the warden
hears the wrong knock, he ﬁrst ignores it, thinking another drow is just
misremembering. If the beats persist, or if he realizes someone is trying to
break down the door, he opens the slot to take a shot at anyone on the
other side, shuts it, and raises the alarm.

I6. WATCH CHAMBER
MODERATE 9
A table and chairs sit in the northeast corner of this large room. The walls feature
words carved in a ﬂowing script underscored with hash marks. Of the four doors
leading out of this chamber, the door leading west looks sturdier than the others.
The words on the wall are drow aphorisms in Elven about staying alert
and protecting one’s home. The hash marks record times the drow have
repelled invaders and lived up to these sayings.
Creatures: When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, a drow shootist named Yrorix
and a pair of hunters are playing cards with a drow version of a harrow
fortune-telling deck. In the event of an assault, they knock on the three
doors leading deeper into Yldaris to alert more defenders, but they make
their stand here.
If the heroes are allies of Yldaris, the drow cheerfully invite the heroes
into their game. The stakes aren’t high, and the drow cheat relentlessly, but
it might be an enjoyable way for the heroes to pass the time.
If the heroes rescued the drow rogue Falxi Orshendiel from area F12,
he’s also here gambling. Falxi is well-regarded because he’s a distant
cousin of Yldaris’s leader, but he’s fundamentally lazy. He greets the heroes
warmly and insists to his companions that they can be trusted.

CHAPTER 9 SYNOPSIS
The Hunting Grounds contains
aggressive urdefhans, insular drow,
and some of the most powerful
monsters the heroes face in this
Adventure Path. It’s key for the
heroes to learn about the fulcrum
lenses, such as from the drow Quara.
This chapter provides substantial
treasure, by design, as there’s very
little treasure on the level below.
Environmental Cues: mold,
echoing roars, patches of slick slime,
rough stone walls, strange tracks
