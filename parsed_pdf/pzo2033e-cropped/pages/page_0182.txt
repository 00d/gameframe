Vaults
The Yldaris drow cultivated this area with a thick,
fast-growing fungus developed by drow mycologists
in distant communities. These mushrooms hide drow
movements and provide the community with a ready
source of food.
Movement in this area is challenging, as the thick
mushrooms conceal stalagmites and crystalline growths
on the ground. For Yldaris drow and their riding lizards,
who know the terrain, the ground is difﬁcult terrain; for
all other creatures, it’s greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: The drow let their riding lizards run free
in this area. The predators of the cavern sometimes
catch and kill an errant lizard, but the drow don’t
mind the loss, as they can study the site of the kill
and learn more information about creatures hunting
near their home. Four riding lizards currently reside
here, all just reaching maturity. As two of their siblings
were recently killed by urdefhans, they’re aggressive to
non‑drow humanoids. A lizard reduced to fewer than
25 Hit Points ﬂees the area.
RIDING LIZARDS (4)
CREATURE 5
Giant frilled lizard (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 229)
Initiative Perception +11
Treasure: While the giant frilled lizards have no
treasure, 87 gp and 120 sp are scattered near the
remains of a spider’s web. A dead drow in the web
wears greater healing gloves and a cloak of elvenkind.
I31. THE BARRENS
SEVERE 9
The fungus growth thins in this cavern, giving way to
barren rock and rubble. Amid the dull gray stone, strange
clouds of thick, grayish-black fog hug the ground.
The Yldaris drow skirt the north stretch of this
cavern when they come this way, knowing of the
dangers that lurk deeper in. The drow call this place
the Barrens; if the heroes have earned their aid, they
warn the heroes of its risks: the fog is deadly, and the
cavern harbors a dangerous monster.
The fog imposes a –2 circumstance penalty to
Perception checks. Everything beyond 10 feet is
concealed, and visibility ends at 30 feet.
A narrow passage leads south to distant, equally
treacherous Darklands caverns outside the scope of
this adventure.
Hazard: The fog’s effects are tied to the daemon’s
miasma. When a non-ﬁend, non-urdefhan creature
ventures halfway into the cavern, the mist solidiﬁes
into life-draining mouths. If the derghodaemon is
killed, this hazard disappears in minutes.
DAEMONIC FOG
HAZARD 10
ENVIRONMENTAL
MAGICAL
Stealth DC 30 (expert)
Description The fog solidiﬁes into tiny, gnawing creatures
that devour everyone within before fading back into mist.
DROW TO THE RESCUE
If the heroes have gained the aid of Yldaris and
indicated they were going against Khurfel, the drow
might have followed at a distance to keep an eye on
them. If the heroes are in over their heads, a group
of two drow hunters and two drow shootists come
to their aid. The drow won’t enter melee if they can
avoid it, but they’re happy to pick oﬀ urdefhans at a
distance. If the heroes have truly shown their worth
to Yldaris, Quara might come to their aid as well.
