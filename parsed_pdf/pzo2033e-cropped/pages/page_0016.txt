help keep the town’s pier in repair or work aboard a

Nature, or Sailing Lore.
14. RUINS OF THE THIRSTY ALPACA
The Thirsty Alpaca was once the largest tavern
in Otari, but in a recent disaster, excavations by
a small band of overeager kobolds attempting to
expand some of the old Stonescale warrens below
the building caused the structure’s dramatic collapse.
Several employees and a few visitors from out of town
perished in the accident, and the tavern’s owner has
gone missing. Today, the locals avoid the ruins, for
strange lights and eerie sounds there have given the
place a reputation of being haunted. In truth, a few
kobold sappers survived the collapse and are
keeping the townsfolk away from their lair
with spooky tricks.
15. INKLEHOLTZ MANOR
Whistledown Cutters is a successful
lumber company thanks to the
cunning business sense of its owner,
Alymora Inkleholtz. She invested
funds to bolster Otari’s educational
services, a shrewd move that has made
her admired by Otari’s parents. Many
have been pushing Alymora to run
for mayor the next time elections
come along, but for now,
the half-elf is happy raising
her family and building her
business’s legacy.
INKLEHOLTZ MANOR
MANOR 4
EMPLOYER
Address 75 Wisp Street
Alymora Inkleholtz (NG half-elf lumber magnate 4,
Friendly, Perception DC 17, Will DC 19). If Inkleholtz
Manor supports the heroes, Alymora oﬀers them work
in a classroom she maintains in town. This allows the
heroes to Earn Income using Lore associated with one of
the four disciplines that the Inkleholtzes hope to foster
in the local children: literature, mathematics, science,
and history.
16. CHERTEL MANOR
Wrab Chertel is the current patriarch of one of
Otari’s three lumber concerns, Chertel Timber. The
Chertels are struggling with a combination of poor
management, labor disputes in distant lumber camps,
and difﬁculties with ﬁnancing. Wrab suspects the other
companies of meddling in his business and sabotaging
both lumberjack morale and equipment
alike; in truth, the Kortos Consortium is
behind Wrab’s woes. By forcing Chertel
into desperate straits and hasty hiring,
the Kortos Consortium has managed
to place an increasing number of its
own agents in Otari’s lumber industry.
CHERTEL MANOR
MANOR 4
EMPLOYER
Address 5 Zarmavdian Street
Wrab Chertel (N human lumber magnate
4, Unfriendly, Perception DC 19, Will
DC 17). If Chertel Manor supports the
heroes, Wrab oﬀers extra money for
keeping an eye on his competition—
the Menhemes and the Inkleholtzes—
as well as his own workers. The heroes
can Earn Income using Perception, but on a
critical failure, word of their spying gets out, and Chertel
no longer oﬀers the job.
17. THE ROWDY ROCKFISH
Despite its name, The Rowdy Rockﬁsh is the quietest
and quaintest of Otari’s taverns. A sign depicting a
rockﬁsh with his ﬁns up in a boxing pose hangs above
the door of this two-story wooden structure, but
within, the calm demeanor of its patrons leads some
to wonder if this might be the one tavern in the Inner
Sea to never host a barroom brawl. The Rockﬁsh’s
current proprietor is a matronly dwarf named Brelda
Venkervale, a stoic but shrewd businesswoman who
took over the bar after her son Lasda, the previous
owner, vanished without a trace. A few locals saw the
red-bearded Lasda walking out of town with a hooded
stranger carrying a lantern. Over a year has passed,
and Brelda suspects that her son is gone for good.
THE STONESCALE WARRENS
When the Stonescale kobolds took over Otari, they
used the buildings above as a sort of camouﬂage,
living in an extensive network of tunnels that
connected many of the buildings below ground.
Today, this network is a complicated tangle of ﬂooded
or collapsed tunnels. Thieves and smugglers from the
Osprey Club use some, while others have become the
dens of monsters. One tunnel leads all the way to
the Abomination Vaults; see area C2 on page 54.
