Urdefhan
Translucent-skinned scourges of the Darklands, urdefhans (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 2 272) are remorseless killers and foot soldiers of the world’s end.
URDEFHAN DEATH SCOUT
Death scouts train as spies and assassins for their cult. Other urdefhans
scorn their stealthy methods, but none can argue with their results.

SHAUTH WEAPONS
Shauth blades and shauth lashes
are made from the teeth of fallen
urdefhans. Collecting these teeth
is diﬃcult, as a slain urdefhan
dissolves into a foul-smelling gas
almost immediately. However, their
bones are somewhat more durable.
