Treasure: The seugathi’s book contains several
sketches of the shanrigol behemoth and notes in Aklo
about its nature (it includes parts of, and therefore
derives abilities from, driders and urdefhans), its
weakness to positive energy, and that it’s kept docile in
the arena by a steady diet of failed experiments. More
than just a text about one speciﬁc monster, this book
contains several insights of general applicability to
other creatures. It’s worth 25 gp to a collector of rare
tomes, such as Morlibint.
F21. SPA
LOW 6
This room bears the rich stink of rot. Doors to four
changing stalls prominently appear at the east end of
this long hallway. Each door has a makeshift clockwork
mechanism attached to it, and the mechanism connects to
a lever on the eastern wall through a series of wires and
pulleys. The hallway to the west is hung with four wide,
tattered curtains. Another, thicker curtain covers the hall’s
west end.
The spa kept the gladiators in their best health and
entertained visiting guests. None of the seugathis or their
minions want to use it. The four tiny changing rooms
to the east have wooden doors that stop six inches from
the ceiling and the ﬂoor. The four thinner curtains
cover alcoves that serve as massage rooms; each has
only a dilapidated massage table. The thicker curtain
conceals the entrance to another chamber.
An
enterprising
morlock
engineer
rigged
a
complicated clockwork latching mechanism to turn
the changing rooms into very small prison cells. The
lever opens all four doors at once, but it then sticks
and won’t close them again.
Creatures: The room’s stink plainly originates
from the changing rooms. Some of Jafaki’s minions
captured, tortured, and imprisoned four ghasts here,
one in each changing room. The gaps below and above
the doors allow their potent stench to escape, but not
the ghasts themselves. They occasionally reach under
or above the doors with their claws, but they can’t
harm anyone who isn’t pressed up against a changing
room door. If freed, they immediately attack any living
creatures they see, so cunning heroes might use them
against other enemies in the dungeon.

F22. SAUNA
MODERATE 6
This round sauna is constructed entirely from polished
stone. A wooden bench lines the circumference of the room,
save for the exit to the east, which is covered by a thick
curtain. At the center of the chamber stands a stone pedestal
topped with a heavy bronze bowl ﬁlled with red-hot rocks.
A wooden bucket full of water rests next to the pedestal.
The bowl maintains an evocation effect that keeps
the rocks within it constantly heated. The command to
turn it off and on is long forgotten. The intense heat in
the room gives creatures in the room a –1 circumstance
