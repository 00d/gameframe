H7. PRISON
This room is locked on the outside; Padli has the only
key. A hero can open it with four successful DC 25
Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or a successful DC 29
Athletics check to Force it Open.
A single prisoner waits inside: an urdefhan warrior
(Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 272) named Huglu whom the
calignis recently captured. The calignis have denied
Huglu food and water to get information out of him,
but the stubborn warrior would rather die than tell his
captors anything. He’s currently pretending to be dead
to catch his abductors off-guard, but as his Deception
DC is only 12, the heroes likely see through his ruse.
Getting any information out of Huglu is virtually
impossible, as the evil warrior’s only desire is to inﬂict as
much death and destruction as he can before
oblivion. Diplomacy attempts to improve
Huglu’s hostile attitude don’t work, though
the heroes might get information out of him
with Deception checks to Lie or Intimidation checks to
Coerce compliance. The DC for these checks is 19, which
is both his Will DC and his Perception DC.
On a success, Huglu relays his name, that he was
caught near the door in area H9, that he serves a great
war champion named Khurfel, and that his people
control the territory at the bottom of a nearby chasm
(area H34). Huglu sprinkles this information with
threats against the heroes and promises to drink the
heroes’ and the calignis’ blood (on a critical success,
however, Huglu omits these threats).
If the heroes free Huglu, he turns on them as soon
as he thinks he can kill one of them before being
killed himself.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for getting
information about the urdefhans from Huglu.
