What Boss Skrawng Knows: If the heroes can get Boss
Skrawng to talk, he has useful information. He knows
about all the dangers in areas A1 to A10, the giant
scorpion in A14, and the “swamp dragon” that lives
under the boathouse (area A16). He also knows about
the “bogeys” in the keep, warning the heroes about
the haunts in area A7 and the glowing “ghosts” in area
A15. He never visited the outbuilding on the island to
the northwest, but mentions that a boat full of people
(whom he can describe as “big and sneaky-looking”)
came to visit it a week ago. The visitors went into the
SIDE QUESTS
Some of the locations in the Abomination Vaults list
side quests the heroes can pick up, usually after
interacting with an NPC or discovering a clue. If
the heroes complete a side quest, they earn an XP
award for a moderate accomplishment (30 XP) in
addition to any rewards the side quest grants, such
as treasure or useful information.
swamp dragon’s cave while the dragon was out, but the
dragon returned soon thereafter; Boss Skrawng assumes
the people got eaten.
If asked about Gauntlight’s eerie glow, Boss
Skrawng’s eyes get big, and he shakes his head,
warning the heroes that the light is the creepiest
haunting of them all. He conﬁrms that every night, the
light glows, and he worries that there might be a big
ghost up there.
Boss Skrawng also conﬁrms that the Mudlickers
used to live in a dungeon level beneath Gauntlight
Keep, but that a bunch of “mushroom-eyed people”
(morlocks, although the mitﬂits don’t know them by
that name) chased them up here many nights ago.
Boss Skrawng can provide a crude map of the ﬁrst
level and a partial map of the second if the heroes can
successfully Request or Coerce the favor from him
and supply him with the means to write out a map. A
bribe of at least 2 gp automatically gets Boss Skrawng
feeling helpful enough to provide these maps. His map
of the ﬁrst level omits areas A12 to A13, areas A19 to
A23, area A25, and all of the secret doors. His map of
the second level is obviously much less complete. It
only shows the areas once dwelt in by the Mudlickers:
areas B8 to B14 and areas B16 to B19 (although he
warns the heroes that a big swamp dragon lives in the
cave at area B19).
Side Quest: Boss Skrawng hates the “mushroom‑eyed
people” and promises the heroes a big pile of shiny
gems if they go downstairs, kill them all, and defeat
their king. He describes the king as a “magic priest
mushroom-eyed guy who can hurt your brain just
by looking at you.” Boss Skrawng doesn’t actually
have any shiny gems, and if the heroes do his quest
and return with proof, he realizes that the heroes are
tougher than the morlocks and that he made a terrible
mistake in promising them treasure he doesn’t have.
He instead throws himself at their mercy and agrees to
abandon his plots against Otari forever.
