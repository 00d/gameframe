their body combusts in a ﬂash of white-hot ﬂame. All
creatures in a 20-foot burst take 6d10 ﬁre damage

unaﬀected by the ﬂames and are left in a pile where
they died.

I23. CALIGNI BUNKS
LOW 9
This room is ﬁlthy and smells stale. Rags and tattered rugs
and blankets litter the ﬂoor.
This sleeping chamber is dimly lit, as the cracks
around the door to area I24 glow.
Creatures: The two calignis resting here respond to
commotion in the great hall. If outclassed, a defender
opens the door to area I24 to set the undead free.

I24. STRANGE DEAD
MODERATE 9
If the heroes examine the glow in the door’s cracks, it
shifts as if the light source within is moving around.
A stack of dusty urns is heaped against the east wall of this
small room. Each is covered with jagged runes.
The caligni keep out of this room due to its strange
occupants, a pair of rare undead calignis called bright
walkers. Only Galudu regularly comes here to speak
with them; the other calignis only open the door if
they need serious and immediate aid.
The urns are left over from when this place was a
lodge for hunters. There are 11 urns in total, each 3
feet tall. They were used to magically preserve creature
parts taken as trophies, but their magic expired long
ago. Four urns contain shriveled claws or bones.
Creatures: The two bright walkers pace restlessly
in this room, but Galudu does her best to keep them
grounded and calm. When they see non-calignis,
they assume the lodge is under attack and ﬁght until
destroyed, or until Galudu calls them off.

I25. OLD RUBBISH
Piles of broken furniture, rags, and other rubbish litter this
dirty room.
Galudu sometimes meets with others here, rather
than in her private chamber to the south. If the heroes
are with Custodian Dulac, Dulac asks them to wait
here while she privately informs Galudu about them.
I26. GALUDU’S ROOM
MODERATE 9
A large bay window of transparent stone overlooks
the wilderness outside the lodge, but it’s so covered in
grime that it’s diﬃcult to see through with any clarity. A
makeshift table has been erected near the center of the
room, and a sleeping mat is rolled up to one side of it.
Creatures: Galudu spends most of her time here.
She isn’t only the leader of the calignis but their chief
provider, feeding them with conjured food and water
when hunters return empty-handed—or not at all.
If the heroes fought their way through the lodge,
Galudu uses her spells to drive them off. With nowhere
else to go, she ﬁghts to the death.
If Custodian Dulac led the heroes here, Galudu is
wary but welcoming; if the heroes aided Dulac and her
band of foolish cultists, they might be able to help her
as well. She listens to the heroes but quickly introduces
the topic of her side quest on page 179.
