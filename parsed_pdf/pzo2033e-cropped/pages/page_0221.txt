Magic Items
The Abomination Vaults hold several new magic items
for the heroes to ﬁnd. The lantern of empty light is in
the possession of Volluk Azrinae, the worm that walks
who sometimes ventures out into the Fogfen with it.
Kragala, Shadow Malice’s duergar drummer, uses as
set of folding drums in her performances. The devils
of the Prison level use the drover’s band to drill their
ﬂeshwarp troops.
Fulcrum lenses are unique magical crystals that
each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence. They
belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate
or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other
lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex
family came into possession of four of the lenses,
and they knew that bringing them together focused
Nhimbaloth’s
attention
in
unprecedented
and
dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to
the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install
them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon
Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called
the Fulcrum Lattice to hold the lenses so that their
power could be focused together. She realized
the danger of keeping the fulcrum lenses
too close together until the right time
and spread them out among loyal
groups in the Abomination Vaults’
lowest levels for safekeeping.
Belcorra keeps only the most
powerful lens, the Ebon Fulcrum
Lens, with her—indeed, as a ghost,
it’s the only one she can carry. If
the heroes can bring the other three
lenses to bear against Belcorra, they
can draw Nhimbaloth’s dread glare
to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty,
Belcorra can’t hope to keep her spirit intact when
Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.
The fulcrum lenses are more than mere receptacles
of Nhimbaloth’s essence. Each grants those who use it
a fragment of the Great Old One’s power.
CRIMSON FULCRUM LENS
ITEM 9
UNIQUE
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
OCCULT
Price 700 gp; Bulk 1
This concave lens has a drifting crimson cloud resembling
slowly swirling blood within it.
While you have the Crimson Fulcrum Lens invested, you
seethe with malevolent fury you can barely contain. You
gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear eﬀects
and a +2 item bonus to your melee Strike damage (this
increases to a +4 item bonus to damage if the melee Strike
is a jaws attack).
You can activate the lens in the following ways.
Activate ʚʖ Interact; Frequency once per day; Eﬀect You
grasp the Crimson Fulcrum Lens in one hand and make
a Strike that doesn’t require that hand. The Strike deals
an additional 1d8 precision damage (or 2d8 precision
damage if you make a jaws Strike) and doesn’t count
toward your multiple attack penalty.
Activate ʚʖ Interact (attack, possession); Eﬀect While
grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with
a modiﬁer of +18. On a hit, you force the splinter of
Nhimbaloth’s essence from the lens to possess the
target. You’re no longer invested in the lens, and the
target gains the beneﬁts as though it had invested the
lens but can’t activate the lens’s other abilities. This
eﬀect is permanent, but it can be ended by any eﬀect
that removes a possession eﬀect. The lens doesn’t have
any magical abilities until the possession eﬀect ends;
when it does, the essence returns to the lens.
DROVER’S BAND
ITEM 7
RARE
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Price 675 gp
Usage worn bracers; Bulk L
This black leather wrist guard has a
bright red gem on the inside of the
wrist. Faint glyphs and words of
domination in Infernal swim inside
the gem. Your words become harsh
and clipped when you have this
magic item invested.
Activate ̂ˬ command; Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect You exert your will
over a mindless creature within 30 feet.
If the target is a mindless creature of 3rd
level or lower, it must attempt a DC 20 Will
save. If you are a devil, the target uses an
outcome one degree of success worse than the result
of its saving throw.
Critical Success The target creature is unaﬀected.
Success The target creature is slowed 1 for 1 round as its
responses are muddled by your commands.
Failure The creature is controlled by you for 1 hour,
although it doesn’t follow commands that are
obviously self-destructive.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 day.
EBON FULCRUM LENS
ITEM 12

OCCULT
Price 2,000 gp; Bulk L

resembles a chip of smooth obsidian containing three dark
glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence. Incorporeal creatures
can touch and carry the Ebon Fulcrum Lens.
