Claustrophobia Wrin becomes overwhelmed when she’s
underground, or when she’s in an indoor space
that’s smaller than 10 feet in diameter. At these
times, she is sickened 2 and can’t reduce her
sickened condition until she’s outside of the
enclosed area.
Spirit Sight Wrin can see creatures with the spirit
trait within 30 feet, regardless of whether they
are visible to the naked eye. This ability sometimes
allows Wrin to notice other supernatural auras, such
as the buildup of spiritual energy atop Gauntlight.

Bloodline Spells 1 Focus Point, DC 22; 3rd faerie dust (Core
Rulebook 404)
Blood Magic When Wrin casts charm, enthrall, faerie dust,
ghost sound, or hideous laughter, fey glamours dance
around Wrin or one target of the spell, causing them
to be concealed for 1 round. Such obvious concealment
can’t be used to Hide.
Read the Stars (divination, exploration, prediction, primal)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect Wrin attempts to read
the future in the stars by spending an hour studying the
night sky—she can’t use this ability during the day, on an
overcast night, or when she can’t otherwise study the
stars. Although Wrin usually performs this reading for
an individual person or to answer a pressing question
she has, for the purposes of this campaign she reads
the stars for the party as a whole. She attempts an
Astrology Lore check, using the DC appropriate for the
heroes’ current level (see Table 10–5: DCs by Level, Core
Rulebook 503).
Critical Success The results of Wrin’s astrological
readings have the eﬀects of read omens, and the
heroes gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
for 24 hours.
Success The results of Wrin’s astrological readings have
the eﬀects of augury but can predict results up to 24
hours into the future.
Failure No reading.
Critical Failure Wrin brushes against hostile spiritual
forces and can’t Read the Stars for 1 week.
