Magic Sense (detection, divination) Belcorra can sense the
presence of magic auras as though she were always
using a 1st-level detect magic spell. When she Seeks, she
gains the beneﬁts of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on
things she sees.

eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious;
Resistances all damage 10 (except force, ghost touch, or
positive; double resistance vs. non-magical)
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When Belcorra is
destroyed, she re-forms in 2d4 days within the Empty
Vault (though she can reduce that time by empowering
herself with glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence using
the Ebon Fulcrum Lens [page 220]). Belcorra can only be
permanently destroyed if she enacts her full revenge on
Absalom or if Nhimbaloth devours her soul.

Corrupting Gaze ʚʖ Belcorra stares at a creature she can

Nhimbaloth’s Entrance
Once the heroes infuse Belcorra with all three of
Nhimbaloth’s splinters, the earth shakes. A tremendous
and hideous wail emanates from somewhere beyond
this chamber—indeed, it seems, from beyond the
Material Plane. All creatures in the Abomination Vaults
must succeed a DC 30 Will save or become frightened
3 (a creature that critically fails is also paralyzed for
1d4 rounds). At the start of the following round,
Nhimbaloth’s essence pervades the room.
A terrible, blackish-gray mist seeps into the room. It
stinks of a fetid bog and leaves a layer of cloying, slimy
water upon everything it passes. The mist twists in shape
and form, with seven-ﬁngered tentacles appearing and
disappearing in the fog.
This misty incarnation can’t be attacked or
damaged. It ﬂows into Belcorra, who shrieks, “No! I
deserve your power, not your attention! My death is
full of rage and strength—it is not empty!” Despite
these protestations, Belcorra’s form is pulled apart into
the mist, and the mist vanishes.
An immense grinding noise comes from high above.
Gauntlight, Belcorra’s greatest work, is collapsing,
one level at a time. With each passing round, the
artifact drops one dungeon level along the lighthouse’s
footprint (but not in the rest of the Abomination
Vaults!), obliterating anything directly beneath it.
In the 9th round, it collapses into this chamber,
destroying everything here—by then, the heroes would
best be gone.
Conclusion
With Belcorra destroyed, Otari and Absalom are
safe from her spiteful schemes. The heroes receive a
warm welcome in Otari, and everyone wants to hear
their tales over a friendly ﬁre, good food, and more
than a few drinks. The heroes are told, retold, and
embellished upon for generations.
Gauntlight is no more, and only the pit in the Fogfen
marks the spot it once stood. The dangers lurking
there might one day regain their strength and menace
the surface—but those are tales for other heroes.
