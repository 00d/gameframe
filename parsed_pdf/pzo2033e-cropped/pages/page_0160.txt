If the heroes managed to get here without disturbing
the mud in area H24, the mummies there rise up and
ﬁght alongside the naga.
VETHRIS
CREATURE 9
Female spirit naga (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 179)
Initiative Perception +18
H26. SECRET TREASURY
A glittering mass of treasure sits at the south end of this
small room.
This is the bulk of the treasure Vethris had accumulated
as well as that she tasked the undead to gather.
Poisoned Treasure: A porcelain teapot in the hoard is
slathered with nettleweed residue (Core Rulebook 553).
Treasure: Once the poison is washed off the teapot,
it’s worth 40 gp. Scattered about the room are 130 gp,
310 sp, greater bracers of missile deﬂection, a wand of
ﬁreball, three murderer’s knots, a potion of quickness,
and a javelin of lightning. A small sack contains 10
saltwater pearls worth 9 gp each.
H27. SHORES OF DEATH
EXTREME 8
At this southern terminus of the foul underground lake,
a small wooden dock juts out from a stone and masonry
building. The dock is in ruin; its front has been ripped away
with massive force, leaving the rest of it sloping down into
the water. The building had a door at the dock’s end, but
it has been ripped oﬀ its hinges, with a chunk of the door
partly submerged and leaning against the cavern wall.
South of the structure, the lakeshore gives way to a forest
of massive fungi. The water near the dock occasionally
bubbles, as if something massive dwells somewhere below
the surface.
A surly froghemoth attacked the Children of
Belcorra in this outpost, damaging the dock and
driving the bog mummies away. It’s the source of
the bubbles in the water. A hero who succeeds at a
Perception check against its Stealth DC of 38 spots its
eyestalk peeping above the fetid water.
Creatures: How the froghemoth came to the lake
is a mystery, but in the short time, it has been here, it
has damaged this building and driven nearly all the
aberrations and creatures away from the southern
lake. It sometimes makes its way north to hunt, but it’s
usually lurking under the water by the shattered dock.
The Children of Belcorra injured the froghemoth
more than they’ve realized; it’s afﬂicted with bog rot
that has affected its alien physiology in strange and
debilitating ways. Rather than simply being clumsy,
the froghemoth has the weak adjustment.
A lazy hunter, the froghemoth tends to attack from
the water and rarely pursues those who ﬁnd shelter
within the fungus garden. However, it’s vindictive in
a way; if it loses at least half of its Hit Points, there’s
a chance (DC 15 ﬂat check) it becomes enraged and
follow its attackers onto dry land.
BOG-ROTTED FROGHEMOTH
CREATURE 12
Weak froghemoth (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 6, 122)
Initiative Stealth +28
H28. RUINED OUTPOST
The remains of a table and some chairs are scattered
around the room. While the western door has been ripped
oﬀ its hinges, the southern door is still intact but open. Two
torn, soggy corpses are slumped in the doorway.
The corpses are Children of Belcorra who were
destroyed in the froghemoth’s rampage.
While there’s nothing of value in the abandoned
room, there’s a secret door on the east wall. A
hero Searching the room who succeeds at a DC 20
Perception check spots the fake ﬂagstone in the wall
and can pull it aside with the rest of the secret door.
Beyond the door is a narrow passage heading east
and then turning north, leading to another secret
door of similar design. The Children of Belcorra used
this passage to gain quick access to the northern
reaches of the fungus garden.
H29. WEST GARDEN
While the fungal forest continues to grow high, there are
also signs that this area was recently tended. Rocks outline
sections of healthy growth, and the paths are clear of all the
but the occasional bits of mold and fungus. Bioluminescent
moss provides a low, even glow throughout the area, as
though intentionally cultivated for the eﬀect. To the east, a
wide stone bridge spans a massive chasm. A gigantic iron
ladder snakes down into the darkness of the chasm from
its other side. Beyond the bridge and the ladder, the fungal
forest becomes even more overgrown.
The Children of Belcorra long ago limited their efforts
from tending the entire fungus garden to only this
western end. With the recent arrival of the froghemoth,
they’ve even stopped their efforts here.
The fungi here are harmless; in fact, they’re good
sources of nutritious food, fungus-wood lumber, and
luminous moss.
