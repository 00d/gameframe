exceedingly fragile; the ﬁrst time a creature opens
it, they must succeed at a DC 20 Thievery check
or a random formula is destroyed as some pages
disintegrate. On a critical failure, the entire book is
destroyed. Consulting the book thereafter doesn’t
risk further disintegration unless the handler is
intentionally careless.
E9. ELITE VIEWING ROOM
MODERATE 5
The curved east and west walls contain tables with small,
built-in ovens. Wood fragments, heavily dented pewter
serving dishes, silver ﬂatware, and crystal shrapnel litter
the ﬂoor. A wide alcove to the south ends at a cloudy
window overlooking a much larger space. An array of
magical glyphs glows next to the window.
This elegant meeting room is where Belcorra’s guests
watched arena matches and enjoyed the
food cooked in the kitchen below (and
kept warm in the ovens).
Most of the debris scattered across
the ﬂoor is worthless, but it creates
difﬁcult terrain across the entire room. The
staircase leading down to the Warped Brew
Tavern (area F11) is choked with trash and is
greater difﬁcult terrain instead.
The south wall overlooking the arena (area E26)
isn’t glass, but transparent stone. The glyphs on the
wall control the magic infused in this stone. A hero
Investigating the glyphs who succeeds at a DC 20
Arcana or Occultism check understands how to use
them. A creature manipulating the glyphs can make
the wall ethereal (it still resembles transparent stone,
but creatures and objects can pass through it), render
it opaque, or change it back to transparent stone,
as well as control what part of the arena it shows.
Each change is a 2-action Interact activity with the
manipulate trait.
Creatures: When Belcorra died, two of her
guests—squabbling aristocrat siblings—let their
fear of being trapped in the Abomination Vaults
overwhelm them. They murdered each other in
a panicked rage and arose again as poltergeists,
who continue their ﬁght to this day. Their hurled
accusations against each other invariably escalate
into hurled debris, and these frequent rages have
produced the wreckage throughout this room.
The poltergeists put their differences aside to ﬁght
intruders, but they soon fall back into their endless
squabbling again if the heroes retreat. As they
ﬁght, they mutter phrases like “can’t get out” and
“trapped here forever.” They ﬁght until destroyed.
