You have unlocked deeper secrets to uncovering and
hoarding lore. You gain an advanced domain spell from one
domain you selected with Seeker of Truths. Increase the
number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

domain you selected with Seeker of Truths.
WORDS OF UNRAVELING
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You have unlocked abstruse methods to tangle with
reality itself, altering the fate of a single individual
by untethering their fate from reality. Once per day
as an occult innate spell, you can cast daydreamer’s
curse (page 224), outcast’s curse, or sage’s curse (page
225). At the GM’s discretion, you can substitute or add
additional occult curse spells of 4th level or lower to
this list. You can choose a different spell from the list
each time you use this ability. If you couldn’t already
cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as
your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in
spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if
you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency
in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells
increases to expert.
ENTITIES FROM AFAR
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You can call in aberrations to ﬁght for you or to answer
questions about the universe that their own strange
perspective can illuminate. You can cast summon entity as
an innate occult spell once per day. If you couldn’t already
cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your
spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack
rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already
cast occult spells, your proﬁciency in spell attack rolls and
spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.
As soon as the aberration arrives, instead of giving it any
other commands, you can demand that it answer a single
question that you pose to it. For the creature to eﬀectively
answer, you must Sustain the Spell for 1 minute, and you
must understand and be understood by the aberration. If
you do, the aberration gives you a cryptic clue as provided
by the read omens spell, except that the clue is even
more enigmatic than normal; the creature then
immediately returns from whence it came
without providing you any other beneﬁt or
taking any other actions.
At 16th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the
summon entity spell is heightened by 1 level (to a
maximum of 8th level when you reach 20th level).
INCREDIBLE RECOLLECTION Ȱɵ
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You can sift through knowledge locked within your mind
at an incredible pace. You instantly use up to 5 Recall
Knowledge actions. If you have any special abilities or free
actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall
Knowledge, you can’t use them for these actions.
