Toolbox
Abomination
Vaults
This storage chamber is a mess because calignis have
haphazardly thrown supplies in here over the years.
The plants are bioluminescent reeds that retain their
glow for weeks after being harvested, and they provide
dim light here. Most casks contain the meaty, dried
mushrooms calignis favor, although their gritty taste
makes them practically inedible to other creatures.
Treasure: A hero Searching through this room
uncovers three beautiful amethysts worth 20 gp each.
H5. CULT BARRACKS
This drab chamber contains a few bedrolls and a box with
several earthen mugs atop it. A desk holds stacks of paper.
Rank-and-ﬁle members of the Cult of Urthagul
all sleep in the eight bedrolls here. The bedrolls
contain nothing of interest.
Some cult members are mapping the
Abomination Vaults, in the hopes of
ﬁnding an easy way around the wisps
to reach Urthagul again. Their map is
on the desk. They’ve mapped out areas H2 to
H14 and drawn several lobster-like shapes in the
water between areas H13 and H14 to represent the
chuuls. Several angry ball-like shapes in areas H2 and
H10 represent the new wisps. They’ve also mapped
out areas I22 to I26 and the connecting staircase. The
secret door in area H8 isn’t noted.
H6. PADLI’S CHAMBER
MODERATE 8
This room is a jumble of pillows, furs, blankets, and rugs.
Several empty jugs litter the ﬂoor.
While Dulac is studious and intense, her second-in-
command, Padli, is a selﬁsh, gregarious hedonist. He
favors mushroom wine, and the jugs around this room
once held the earthy, intoxicating beverage.
Creatures: For all his hedonism, Padli is no less
devout than Dulac, and he sees any intrusion here as an
assault on the faithful. Padli lets his companions take the
brunt of melee attacks and hangs back to cast spells. The
calignis here have no interest in parley or quarter.
