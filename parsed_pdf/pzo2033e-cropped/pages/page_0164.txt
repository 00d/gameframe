Treasure: Hidden deep in the nilith’s hanging
tangles is its treasure, consisting of a bag with 253 sp,
three topaz gemstones worth 60 gp each, a thundering
runestone, and a moderate bravo’s brew.
H40. BETWEEN A ROCK AND A DOORWAY
LOW 8
The path ends at a door leading west. A large boulder covered
with spidery carvings blocks a cave entrance to the east.
The door to this room is locked, and Nyzuros (in
area H44) has the key. A hero can open it with four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or
a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Force it Open.
The boulder seems impassable, but it’s cleverly
hinged to open when parts of its surface are pressed
in the proper conﬁguration. The Elven carvings
describe how to move the boulder, but these
instructions are intentionally wrong and trigger
the hazard below. Finding the proper way to move
the boulder requires a successful DC 25 Nature,
Perception, or relevant Lore check. Alternatively,
a hero can roll it aside with a successful DC 30
Athletics check to Force Open, and a Small or
smaller creature can Squeeze past the boulder with
a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check.
Glyph of Warding: The carvings form a glyph of
warding containing a 4th-level sound burst (DC 28
basic Reﬂex save; DC 28 to notice and disarm the
glyph). The glyph triggers when a creatures handles
the boulder in the way indicated by the Elven
carvings. The noise also alerts the nearby drow to
intruders, and they go on alert.
H41. DESCENT TO YLDARIS
SEVERE 8
Faintly glowing green veins of crystal line the walls of this
large cave. To the south, a wide passage spirals into the earth
as though created by some massive burrowing creature.
The slick, green veins crackle with faint electricity
when touched, but they aren’t harmful. A cave worm
burrowed this passageway long ago. It leads to the
drow outpost of Yldaris far below (area I1).
Creatures: This passage isn’t unguarded; a
quartet of drow hunters is always on alert here.
If they detect intruders, they form a ﬁring line to
prevent anyone from getting past them. Although
they’re quick to attack calignis, urdefhans, or other
enemies they recognize, a group of surface-dwellers
intrigues them. The hunters keep their weapons at
the ready, but so long as the heroes don’t attack
ﬁrst, they ask the heroes why they’re trespassing
in Yldaris territory. Their starting attitude to the
heroes is indifferent. If the heroes improve their
attitude to friendly (which requires a successful DC
24 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression), they
agree to escort the heroes to their leader in Yldaris.
Three drow escort the heroes through areas I1, I5,
I6, and I17 to meet Quara Orshendiel. If the heroes
improve their attitude to helpful, only a single
drow accompanies them. If they can’t improve the
hunters’ attitude, the drow ﬁrmly turn them away.
If the heroes mention that they rescued Falxi
Orshendiel from the Warped Brew kitchen (area F12),
the hunters remember that Falxi mentioned them.
The heroes thereafter have a +4 circumstance bonus
on Diplomacy checks to negotiate entry into Yldaris.
The heroes might have earned the trust of the drow
in areas H44 or H45; in that case, the heroes don’t need
to separately win over these hunters.

Initiative Perception +16
XP Award: Award the heroes 80 XP if they successfully
negotiate entry to Yldaris from these drow.
H42. SPIDER GUARD
TRIVIAL 8
Sheets of webbing hang on the south wall of this room,
between two wooden doors.
Creatures: A trained hunting spider, the loyal pet of
the drow shootist Iribo in area H44, lairs in this room.
The spider whistles shrilly as its ﬁrst action when it
spots intruders, then springs to attack. The noise alerts
the nearby drow and brings them running; together,
this is a severe encounter for 8th-level characters.
HUNTING SPIDER
CREATURE 1
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 306
Initiative Perception +7
H43. CELL
This square cell has two pairs of rusted manacles bolted
into the wall about six feet from the ﬂoor.
The drow recently captured one of the Children of
Belcorra in the fungus garden and brought her here.
She dangles from one of the manacles. They’ve been
interrogating her for information about the layout and
denizens of the level, but the mummy hasn’t yet been
forthcoming with any information.
