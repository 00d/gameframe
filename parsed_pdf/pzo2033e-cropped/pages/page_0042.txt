The machine in this room is a sadistic device Volluk
crafted ages ago. With a successful DC 20 Occultism
or Religion check to Recall Knowledge, a hero
determines that the device aids in casting the create
undead ritual (this doesn’t provide knowledge of that
ritual). The drilling device penetrates the skull of a
restrained victim, while the scope focuses the ritual’s
necromantic energies. Using this machine grants a +2
item bonus to skill checks to cast create undead.
The stairs to the south lead down to area C7.
Creatures: One of Volluk’s last creations remains
here, a horriﬁc undead guardian created from a giant
leech. Volluk called the creature the “bloodsiphon” and
was amused at how shriveled the thing became. The
bloodsiphon appears to be a giant log of desiccated
ﬂesh until anyone disturbs or approaches it, at which
point it lurches forth and attacks. It pursues foes into
areas B1 to B4 but not beyond.

Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The bloodsiphon has a
creature grabbed or restrained; Eﬀect The bloodsiphon
drains blood from the creature it has grabbed. This deals
4d4 damage, and the bloodsiphon grows temporarily
moist and slimy as it regains 8 Hit Points, gaining
any excess as temporary Hit Points that last for 1
minute. A creature that has its blood drained by
the bloodsiphon is drained 1 until it receives any
type of healing.
Treasure: The black onyx gemstone in the machine
can be pried out easily enough. Doing so renders the
device useless, but the gem is worth 25 gp.
B6. ABANDONED GUARD POST
Three plain wooden chairs sit along the east wall of this
otherwise empty room.
Belcorra’s lackeys once waited here to perform any
tasks she might need. The secret door to the east that
leads to area B21 is easy to discover from this side of
the room, as the middle chair leans against a section
of the wall that pivots slightly outward. The heroes
can discover this secret door by succeeding at a DC 12
Perception check or by moving the middle chair.
Stairs beyond the north door lead up to area A12.
B7. MEETING ROOM
A long wooden table sits in the center of this room,
surrounded by several wooden chairs. Only the chair to the
