major settlements. However, like members of any ancestry, drow can have any
alignment, especially when removed from the demon lords’ sinister inﬂuence.

ADHERENTS OF CHAOS
Away from the larger drow cities,
where worship of demon lords is
instilled into all citizens from a
young age, drow might adopt the
worship of other entities. Many drow
feel the call of the protean lords and
embrace chaos, art, and freedom
to set themselves apart from their
demon‑worshipping kin. These
communities often have proteans
living among them, instructing drow
proteges in the power of disorder.
