SAGE’S CURSE
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
ATTACK
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
MISFORTUNE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast ʚʖ somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You aﬄict the target with a curse that ﬁlls its mind with
distracting and hyper-specialized minutiae, causing it to
second-guess even simple facts. The target must attempt
a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice
and use the worse result whenever attempting
an Arcana, Lore, Occultism, or Society check.
If the target succeeds at a check to Recall
Knowledge, it gains one piece of true
knowledge and one piece of erroneous
knowledge, but it has no way of
knowing which is which (this has
no effect if the target critically
succeeds at a check to Recall
Knowledge).
Failure As success, but the eﬀect is
permanent.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target
treats the outcomes of all checks to Recall Knowledge
as one degree of success worse than the result the
target rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a
success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a
critical failure).
WORM’S REPAST
The
worm
that
walks
occultist
Volluk
Azrinae
created this repulsive spell
while
undertaking
the
research required for his
horrid
transformation.
The ﬁrst time the heroes
encounter
this
spell
might be when Volluk uses
it against them, but it’s also on a
scroll in his quarters (area D18).
WORM’S REPAST
SPELL 2
RARE
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult, primal
Cast ʚʖ somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration see below
Gnawing worms materialize within the flesh of the
target creature, dealing 4d6 piercing damage and 1d6
persistent piercing damage. If the target is a non-
skeletal corporeal undead creature, you deal an extra
2d6 persistent piercing damage. The target must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The worms writhe away harmlessly and
the target takes no damage.
Success The target takes full initial
damage but no persistent damage, and
the spell ends immediately.
Failure The target takes full initial and
persistent damage and is flat-footed due to the
pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target takes
double the initial damage and is also slowed 1
by the pain for as long as it takes persistent
damage.
Heightened (+2): The initial and persistent
damage increase by 2d6 and 1d6, respectively.
Weapons and
Adventuring Gear
The heroes can ﬁnd several unusual
new weapons in the Abomination
Vaults. The xulgath lutenist Gulzash is
prepared for a ﬁght with his battle lute, and drow
make heavy use of repeating hand crossbows and
the associated gear that makes using repeating hand
crossbows even easier. Urdefhans use a variety of
strange weapons that are wholly unknown on the
surface, including rhoka swords, shauth blades, and
shauth lashes. Even ﬂeshwarps
made
from
urdefhans
use
bizarre
weapons,
including
the
tamchal
chakrams that mulventok
ﬂeshwarps employ.
