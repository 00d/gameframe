SHOOTIST ENTOURAGES
Many drow shootists have a
magnetic bravado that draws others
to follow and learn from them. Few
shootists are as skilled at teaching
as they are at ﬁghting, however, and
their followers aren’t much more
than an entourage. These hangers‑on
are rarely as lucky or quick as the
shootist, so shootists lose their
followers to monsters or mischance
with startling frequency.
