Side Quest: Galudu explains that the calignis here
are all refugees, ﬂeeing from some calamity deeper in
the Darklands that she doesn’t explain. Several calignis
died before they made it safely to this lodge; only the
strongest now remain. She quickly glosses over the
schism that led to Dulac occupying the upper levels
as Cult of Urthagul; Galudu considers Dulac and her
cult to be simpletons clinging at misplaced hope and
doesn’t care about their fate. She’s more interested in
ﬁnding a safe exit for herself and her caligni defenders;
the cultists are welcome to come along if they don’t
slow Galudu down.
Galudu explains that there are two ways to leave,
but both are blocked by powerful monsters: a daemon
to the south (area I31) and a dragon to the west (area
I51). Furthermore, hunting bands of urdefhans can—
and have—whittled down the calignis’ numbers. If the
heroes agree to eliminate either monster (or, better yet,
have already done so) and escort the calignis there,
Galudu gives them her magic wand as payment.
Galudu doesn’t know that area I42 also leads out of
the Hunting Grounds, but she’s happy to take that
passage if the heroes clear the way. The heroes are
on their own to defeat the creature they choose and
can come back to escort the calignis. As the defenders
in area I22 don’t let them in through area I21, they’ll
have to return to the Farm level and descend through
the shrine to return to Galudu.
URDEFHAN ATTACK
SEVERE 9
If the heroes accept the side quest, the journey isn’t
without incident. Urdefhan death scouts are waiting
for the calignis to come into the open. The denizens of
areas I35 and I36 come together to assault the group.
