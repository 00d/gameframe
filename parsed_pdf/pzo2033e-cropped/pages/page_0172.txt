DROW HUNTERS (3)
CREATURE 7

Initiative Perception +16
Treasure: Each locked box has some personal items,
2d10 gp, and 4d10 sp. One contains a mummiﬁed bat.
I10. TARGET PRACTICE
LOW 9
A cluster of stools takes up one corner of this room, but
most of it’s empty space with several reed-stuﬀed dummies
dangling from the ceiling on the south wall. The dummies are
full of holes, a few bolts still lodged in them.
The shootists engage in close-range target practice
here. A secret door conceals a storage closet to the
west; a hero who Searches the room and succeeds at a
DC 25 Perception check locates it. One of the hooks
for hanging dummies, when pulled, causes the door to
slide open. The closet holds discarded dummies and
some atrocious fungus wine.
Creatures: There are typically a pair of shootists
practicing here. Fiercely competitive, they ignore any
sounds outside this room, as they’re so focused.
DROW SHOOTISTS (2)

I11. SHOOTISTS’ QUARTERS
LOW 9
Four bunk beds are crammed into this room. In front of
each sits a trio of sturdy, padlocked boxes.
The shootists tend to be much more orderly than the
hunters, but this is still a communal space. Shootists
come and go when they aren’t doing other tasks in
and outside of Yldaris and sleep where they’d like. The
lockboxes are similar to those in area I9.
Creatures: There are typically a pair of shootists
resting here at any given time. They’re quick to
respond to any alarm or sounds of trouble.

Treasure: Each locked box has personal items, 3d10
gp, and 5d10 sp. One contains an oil of keen edges.
I12. WARDEN BARRACKS
TRIVIAL 9
This room contains a pair of bunks and a low table.
Like the hunters and the shootists, drow wardens
dwell in these barracks. The more regimented wardens
insist on assigned bunks, but they don’t have lockboxes
and thus keep their valuables with them and their
personal items tucked inside their blankets.
Creatures: There’s typically at least one warden
resting in each room. When any are in danger, they
call out for the others, who quickly come out of
their rooms. Encountering these wardens together
constitutes a Trivial challenge for 9th-level characters
(if Salaisa Malthulas is present in area I14, she joins
the ﬁght, making this a severe challenge).

I13. OVERFLOW LODGING
This room contains a pair of bunks, each with a carefully
folded bedroll atop the mattress. At the foot of each sits a
pair of strongboxes with padlocks and keys.
As with any border outpost, Yldaris’s population
waxes and wanes with caravans coming and going at
any given time. These rooms are set aside for visitors,
and Quara offers them to the heroes. The empty locker
boxes and padlocks are like those in area I9.
I14. MASTER WARDEN’S QUARTERS	 MODERATE 9
Master Warden Salaisa Malthulas keeps the door to
her bedroom locked and carries the only key. It requires
ﬁve successful DC 30 Thievery checks to unlock or a
single DC 33 Athletics check to Force Open.
This room is tidy and clean. It contains a bed, a small desk,
and a large trunk.
Yldaris drow all look to Salaisa for leadership when
Quara isn’t around. If something happens to Quara,
Salaisa becomes Yldaris’s next leader.
The desk contains extensive notes about the wardens
of Yldaris: their names, schedules, personal quirks,
and other evidence that Salaisa is watching them all
very closely. The trunk contains only personal items.
Creatures: Salaisa is continuously on the move and
rarely uses her room for anything but sleep. The heroes
might encounter Salaisa anywhere in or near Yldaris. She
isn’t nearly as friendly with the heroes as Quara is, and
she’s concerned that having unknown surface dwellers in
Yldaris puts the whole community at risk.
In a ﬁght, Salaisa quickly seeks aid from any nearby
drow. She’s reluctant to let opponents ﬂee because she
