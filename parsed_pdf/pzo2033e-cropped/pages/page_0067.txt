C35. SECURE COLLECTION
The walls of this small room have built-in shelves. Books
line the shelves to the north and south, while a stack of
loose scrolls sits on the shelf to the west. A single chair and
a small writing desk sit in the middle of the room.
Belcorra kept her most valuable and signiﬁcant
books in the large chamber to the east, but she stored
everything involving her work on Gauntlight and
the Abomination Vaults here. These resources have
remained here since her demise, since the ghouls
don’t know this room exists.
