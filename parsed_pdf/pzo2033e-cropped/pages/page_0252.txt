The voidglutton extinguishes its Glow as part
of Casting the Spell. It becomes invisible as
long as it remains in the area of darkness.
If the voidglutton uses a hostile action, its
invisibility ends as soon as the hostile
action is completed.
Ectoplasmic Web Trap
(conjuration,
occult)
A
creature

by
the
voidglutton’s ectoplasmic web trap is
immobilized and stuck to the nearest
surface until it succeeds at a DC 26
check to Escape. Ectoplasmic Web
Trap can immobilize incorporeal
creatures.
Fearful Strike (emotion, fear, mental,
occult) When the voidglutton damages
a creature with its claw Strike, the
creature must succeed at a DC 26 Will
save or become frightened 1 (frightened

Feed on Fear Ȱɵ (concentrate) Frequency
once per round; Requirement An enemy is
aﬀected by a fear eﬀect or has the frightened
or dying condition, and is within 25 feet of the
voidglutton; Eﬀect The voidglutton feeds on the
creature’s terror. It regains 3d4 Hit Points and its
Glow reignites if it had been extinguished. It cannot use
Consume Light again for 1d4 rounds, as it is too glutted on
fear to suppress its Glow.
AGENTS OF EMPTY DEATH
As with will-o’-wisps and
ﬂickerwisps, voidgluttons are
associated with the Outer Goddess
Nhimbaloth. Her cultists see
voidgluttons as roving incarnations
of her hunger and have been
known to oﬀer themselves up to
voidgluttons as prey in order to
achieve religious insights. Most who
attempt this get a closer look at
death than they intended.
