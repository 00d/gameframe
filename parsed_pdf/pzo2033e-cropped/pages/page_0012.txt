1. THE GIANT’S WHEEL
The Otari Mill is known locally as the Giant’s Wheel,
as its towering, 30-foot-diameter waterwheel is truly
a sight to behold. The wheel’s immense size is needed
to generate enough torque to power the mechanized
treadmill loading logs into the ﬂume and keep the saws
running within the mill. Much of the lumberyard’s
income comes from the town’s two larger lumber
families, who pay to have their lumber processed here.
The mill is a noisy place, with the constant grinding and
churning of the wheel itself competing with the whine
of the saws and the clatter of the loading ramp.
The Menhemes family leaves the day-to-day
administration of the mill to a heavily scarred half-orc
foreman named Klorte Hengus. In his youth, Klorte
made a name for himself in Absalom’s gladiatorial
arena, the Irorium, by ﬁghting with paired hatchets
and picked up the moniker “the Lumberjacker.” Klorte
has put that violent past behind him and fails to see
any ironic humor in the fact that he’s now employed
by honest-to-goodness lumberjacks.

Klorte Hengus (LN male half-orc foreman 5, Indiﬀerent,
Perception DC 20, Will DC 20). If the heroes earn the
support of the Giant’s Wheel, Klorte allows them to Earn
Income using Survival by patrolling the ﬂume’s length. If
you choose, encounters with local wildlife might liven up
a shift of ﬂume-walking. If Klorte warms to the heroes,
he might even gift them one of his old +1 hatchets.
2. LOADING FLUME
A mechanized treadmill runs from Otari Mill into
a wooden ﬂume ﬁlled with water from the Osprey
River. The treadmill and chute transport timber from
the Giant’s Wheel hundreds of feet south to a loading
chute, which itself descends to the harbor so the timber
can easily be loaded onto ships. The loading ﬂume has
long been a draw to local youths who enjoy “riding
the chute,” but after a few unfortunate accidents,
Klorte keeps a wary eye out for such foolishness.
3. MENHEMES MANOR
Mayor Oseph Menhemes lives in the family estate with
his wife Emnala, their ﬁve children, and a small army
of servants. One of the town’s oldest structures, the
cross-shaped building is a sprawling affair that’s larger
than the Menhemes clan needs. The entire west wing of
the manor has been closed for two generations, while
the eastern wing has been converted into a publicly
accessible museum of Otari’s history.
Oseph does his best to keep his roles as businessman
and politician separate, devoting the mornings to work
as a public ﬁgure and the afternoons to managing his
company, Otari Lumber. The heroes are likely to have
much more interaction with the Menhemes family,
particularly Oseph’s oldest daughter, Dorianna, in
Chapter 5.

MANOR 4
EMPLOYER
Address 10 Highside Road
Oseph Menhemes (N male human mayor 4, Indiﬀerent,
Perception DC 19, Will DC 19). If the heroes earn the
Menhemes’ support, they can Earn Income using Society
to tutor the family’s children and prepare them to ﬁt into
Absalom’s social scene.
4. WRIN’S WONDERS
This curio shop bears no sign, but locals know it as
Wrin’s Wonders: a place to marvel at whatever strange
new trinkets and offerings its equally strange owner
might have come across. The structure consists of a
ring of what appear to be standing stones arranged in
a 60-foot-diameter circle surrounding a 15-foot-high
dome of wooden beams covered with triangular pieces
of canvas. Closer inspection of the standing “stones”
reveals that they’re also made of wood frames and
canvas, cleverly painted to resemble granite. The area
THE ROSEGUARD
An adventuring party who made their name in
Absalom, the Roseguard defeated the villainous
Belcorra Haruvex and founded what’s now the
logging town of Otari. Today, the people of Otari
honor them on founders’ day, 3 Desnus. The
Roseguard consisted of the following heroes.
Aesephna Menhemes: Aesephna was the party’s
healer. She was a cleric of Erastil who was always
more comfortable in smaller towns than big cities.
Otari Ilvashti: Otari, the group’s rogue, was an
optimist who kept the others hopeful with his charm
and humor, even during their darkest hours.
Vol Rajani: Vol was the party’s ﬁghter, a capable
and no-nonsense swordswoman who claimed to be
exiled royalty from Nidal.
Zarmavdian: The group’s wizard was a well-educated
diviner who pursued outlandish conspiracy theories
and occult lore.
