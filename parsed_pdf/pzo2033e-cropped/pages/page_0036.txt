Treasure: The bejeweled spyglass was Volluk’s ﬁnest
creation apart from the lenses for Gauntlight. Even in
his self-loathing rage, Volluk couldn’t bring himself to
smash this treasure. The spyglass is the “shiny” that
Tangletop seeks. If the heroes decide to keep it, the
spyglass has a value of 20 gp.
Mister Beak’s soul focus gem is located on his back,
nestled between his wings. The gem is worth 5 gp
but might prove more valuable as a potential source
of information if the heroes place it in the partially
completed soulbound doll in area B2.
A24. OLD PIER
LOW 1
This old wooden pier has partially collapsed into the
swamp, and the portion remaining above water looks
ready to follow the rest at the slightest touch.
The pier is just as dangerous as it looks;
anyone stepping onto it causes the entire pier to give
way and fall into the 3 feet of water beneath it. The
sucking mud beneath it is greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: A single ﬂickerwisp dwells amid the
rotting ruins of this old pier. When it notices the heroes,
it begins to glow and writhe, appearing alternately as
a string of ﬂickering ﬁreﬂies or a rippling ribbon of
light just above the gaping hole in the pier. Anyone
who steps onto this section of the pier runs the risk of
falling through, and the ﬂickerwisp quickly attacks a
victim who gets stuck in the mud. The ﬂickerwisp is
eager to sup on frustration and confusion; it doesn’t
retreat once a ﬁght begins, even if it’s outmatched.

A25. GAUNTLIGHT CUPOLA
MODERATE 1
Rows of black metal bars encase this circular chamber
like a cage. Shimmering waves of force ﬂicker between
the bars and gives the illusion that softly glowing glass
encases this entire area. The ﬂoor to the north has an iron
trapdoor; otherwise, this room appears empty save for a
human-sized encasement of glass and iron that ﬂickers
and glows with an unsettling, almost nauseating pale blue
shimmer—Gauntlight’s lantern!
The locked trap door in the ﬂoor of this room leads
down to area A11, marked with an “F” on the map.
Creatures: If the heroes enter this area after
defeating the blood of Belcorra haunt in area A11
below, that blood has slithered and ﬂowed over
Gauntlight’s lantern. As the heroes enter the chamber,
it slides off the lantern and transforms into a ravenous
blood-drinking vampiric mist which attacks at once,
ﬁghting to the death.
This encounter can repeat as often as the heroes
continue to trigger and defeat the haunt in area A11
below, but it doesn’t occur more than once per night.
