business. The bartender has only a few drinks available
but sells them to the heroes at inﬂated prices.
The patrons all have a starting attitude of Unfriendly
to the heroes. Lallizanx casts suggestion on any hero
who persistently bothers her, insisting that they leave her
alone. The morlock bartender gives only a halfhearted
attempt to prevent the heroes from leaving by either of
the doors behind the bar; she doesn’t consider her pay
sufﬁcient to stand in the way of well-armed intruders.
The morlock patrons all idolize the band Shadow
Malice and bring them up in conversation.
If a ﬁght breaks out, the tavern’s urdefhan manager,
Vischari, comes from area F16 in 3 rounds to join the
battle. Vischari and Lallizanx ﬁght to the death to
protect the tavern they consider their home turf, while
any morlock reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points ﬂees.
If the members of Shadow Malice are present, they
retreat to area F18 rather than risk injury.

Side Quest: If the heroes seem curious
about Shadow Malice (regardless of
the band’s presence), the morlocks all
start chanting the band’s name and
“Challengers!” in Undercommon. It
might seem like the morlocks intend
to set up the heroes to ﬁght against
the band, but they call for a battle of
entertainment, not of weapons. The
cries bring Shadow Malice onto
the stage, if the band’s not already
there, and Ryta, the band’s
vocalist, explains the rules.
“You want to challenge us? Then let’s get to it. We’ll each
face oﬀ one-on-one. Each pair squares oﬀ with some kind
of show: music, acrobatic tricks, displays of strength,
whatever. Then we perform as two groups—mine then
yours—and let the crowd tell us who’s the best overall!”
The challenge has an individual and a group phase.
The individual phase pairs each hero with one of
Shadow Malice’s four members (if the party has
more than four heroes, some must sit out this phase).
A band member provides the best solo performance
they can on their instrument of choice, then the paired
hero can attempt a DC 22 check with a relevant skill,
such as Performance, Acrobatics, Athletics, or any you
