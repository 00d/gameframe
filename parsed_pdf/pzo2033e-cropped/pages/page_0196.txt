CHAPTER 10:
To Draw the Baleful Glare
Perhaps a few of the vaults’ inhabitants know the true
story of Nhimbaloth’s ancient temple—notably Lady’s
Whisper and maybe a dread wisp or two—but none
will tell the tale. Was it the hub of a cult cast deep into
the earth by some ancient enemy, or the headquarters of
a Darklands cabal? No matter its original purpose, the
complex series of initiation trials are the last challenges
that the heroes must face to confront Belcorra. The ﬁrst
is the Challenge of Souls, where unworthy initiates were
poisoned, tormented, and had their souls extracted. The
second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced
their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the
Swamp, where initiates demonstrated their mastery over
swampland dangers. The heroes are likely to face these
in order only if guided by Lady’s Whisper; otherwise,
they’re free to tackle them in whatever order they’d like.
Beyond lies the Empty Vault, Belcorra’s domain and the
source of Gauntlight’s powers.
Temple Features
The temple is wholly dark, except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are generally 15 feet high but reach
60 feet in the main chambers (areas J1, J9, J14, J18,
and J20). The stone doors all bear intricate carvings,
such as a moss-ﬁlled skull, swirling mists, or detailed
swamp scenes, as well as clusters of seven divots.
Lady’s Whisper controls the doors here.
The map of the Temple level appears on page 194.
J1. FIRST CHALLENGE
A basin ﬁlled with reeds and moss stands in an alcove
between doors that lead to the north. Two metal tubes
jut into the room from the east, each sealed oﬀ by some
iris-like mechanism a foot or so inside the pipe. No method
of opening these mechanisms is visible. Black stone doors
lead south, and a single gray stone door carved with shapes
of swirling mist leads west. None of the doors have handles
or latches.
The tests begin with the Challenge of Souls through
the western door. The metal tubes slant downward
and drain into the swamp (area J15). They’re just large
enough for a Medium creature to slide down. If the
