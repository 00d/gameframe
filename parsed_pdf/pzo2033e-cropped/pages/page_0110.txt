any). If the ritual succeeds, the elementals return to their home plane. The
living landslide grants a boon to one of the heroes who participated in the
unbinding (most likely the primary caster). That character gains the crystal
sense ability of a sod hound for 1 week.
Treasure: The sod hounds buried six gemstones worth 15 gp each, given
to them as payment for their service. Heroes who Search the area ﬁnd the
stones with a successful DC 27 Perception check; the hero with the crystal
sense ability locates them automatically.
F4. DEEP POOL
MODERATE 6
A rocky shoreline drops steeply into a large pool beneath several stalactites.
Five square shafts in the stony ceiling lead upward. To the south, a barrier of
transparent stone protects winding raised ledges that run along each side of the
cavern. A short bridge, similarly encased in transparent stone, crosses over the
pool to connect the two ledges.
This area functioned as Belcorra’s underground nature preserve. She
kept a pair of hydras here, as hydra blood has many applications in
alchemy, magic, and ﬂeshwarping. The pool averages 15 feet deep, and
tiny subterranean streams refresh its waters.
Creatures: Jafaki maintains the preserve and two hydras (descendants
of the original pair) for the same reasons Belcorra did. He induced them
into a chemical stupor to extend their lives, lower their food intake, and
reduce the amount of trouble they cause. When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, the
hydras are sleeping with just their heads above the water’s surface.
If the heroes approach this chamber carefully with at least half the party
successfully Avoiding Notice from the hydras, the creatures remain asleep.
Any actions that signiﬁcantly disturb the water—such as someone falling
into the room from above—rouse them.
Due to their forced alchemical hibernation, each hydra takes 3d4 rounds
to fully wake up; in the meantime, it’s slowed 2. Each time a hydra takes
damage, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 3.
The hydras defend their territory to the death but don’t pursue prey
beyond the conﬁnes of the cave.

F5. THE DEEP END
MODERATE 6
The southern end of this cavern is entirely ﬂooded. A walkway encased in
transparent stone runs along the eastern wall, ten feet above the water’s surface.
The hydras once kept their nest at the far end of the pool, where the
depth dips down to 25 feet. They’re afraid of the recent arrival here,
however, and now don’t venture into this part of the pool.
An overhang above the deepest part of the pool is pierced by a well
capped by a sturdy iron grate. The grate’s bolts appear to have been
broken from underneath, so the grate lifts off with only a little effort.
With a successful DC 20 Athletics check, anyone in the water can Climb
up into area F9.
CHAPTER 6 SYNOPSIS
The Abomination Vaults’ sixth level
served to support the gladiator
games in the arena above but also
included extensive laboratories
for creating increasingly bizarre
and powerful creatures. A small
team of seugathis pursue their
ﬂeshwarping experiments while
resisting encroachment from the
devils below. The heroes encounter
these worm‑like monsters, but they
also ﬁnd a strangely civilized tavern
in the midst of the dungeon.
Environmental Cues: acid pitting
on ﬂoors and doors, crude graﬃti
carved into walls, distant shrieks,
old bloodstains, squelching noises,
stench of acrid chemicals and beer
