Despair (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear,
incapacitation, mental) 30 feet. Living creatures are
frightened 1 while in Chafkhem’s despair aura. They can’t
naturally recover from this fear while in the area but
recover instantly once they leave it. When a creature
ﬁrst enters the area, it must succeed at a DC 24 Will save
(after taking the penalty from being frightened) or be
paralyzed for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When Chafkhem is
destroyed, necromantic energies rebuild his body in
the magic circle in his room over 1d10 days. If the
re‑forming body is destroyed during that time, the
process starts anew. Chafkhem can be destroyed for
good with a consecrate ritual, or if the magic circle is
destroyed.

a 7th-level resurrect ritual or similar magic. Saving

Side Quest: As long as the heroes obey Chafkhem’s
demands and suffer his imperious demeanor, he can
be a font of information. His initial attitude toward
the heroes is indifferent, but they can improve it with
a successful Diplomacy check to Make an Impression
(or another relevant skill, such as Deception to Lie or
Arcana to Recall Knowledge that impresses him). The
DC for this check is 27 (Chafkhem’s Will DC).
If the heroes get on Chafkhem’s good side, he
speaks with open contempt about the seugathis that
Belcorra permitted to operate their ﬂeshwarping
laboratory on the next lower level, as they displaced
arena functions Chafkhem controlled. He doesn’t
know precisely how many seugathis remain, but he
describes their leader as an alchemist and ﬂeshwarper
named Jafaki, whom he blames for locking him in
Chafkhem
