J16. PERILOUS CONTROLS
SEVERE 10
Swamp water ﬂoods much of this cave. Three small islands
each bear a metal box with a rusty wheel.
The murky water in this room looks no deeper
than the swamp in area J15, but the water is 25 feet
deep. The heroes will likely need to swim to reach the
islands. Fortunately, the air
in this cavern isn’t as toxic
as that in area J15 and no
saving throws are required for
breathing the air here.
The three wheels on the
islands control the dam in
area J15. If all are turned
fully clockwise (requiring three
Interact actions each) while all
the valves are positioned “on,”
the dam there grinds downward,
releasing a cascade of fetid swamp
water. This inﬂux raises the water level
here and in area J15 by several inches.
Creatures: Lurking under the water are
a pair of dread dhuthorexes that attempt to
ambush intruders and ﬁght to the death.

J17. INFESTED REEDS
LOW 10
This room is usually ﬁlled a foot deep with swamp
water that drains from the Empty Vault when
the dam connected to area J15 is closed.
The heroes most likely enter this area from
area J15 after lowering the dam; if they do,
they’ve completed the Challenge of the Swamp.
