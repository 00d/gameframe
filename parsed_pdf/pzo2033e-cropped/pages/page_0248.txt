SHANRIGOL BEHEMOTH
Shanrigols that grow with the additions of many living victims can become
truly enormous in size and pose a greater danger in their expanding hunting
territories. Subterranean communities have collapsed entire tunnels to
prevent the creatures from reaching their settlements.
Many shanrigol behemoths absorb enough brain matter to form crude
intelligences and take a serpentine or humanoid shape. They’re more
varied in their abilities than shanrigol heaps, as they often gain abilities
from their constituent creatures. The shanrigol behemoth presented
below contains ﬂesh from driders and urdefhans, giving it a web attack
and necrotic decay ability. Not all shanrigol behemoths have these two
abilities, but should have other abilities to replace them.

Necrotic Decay (divine, necromancy, negative) When
the shanrigol behemoth dies, its ﬂesh rots away and
sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that ﬁlls a 5-foot
emanation around the body. This gas deals 9d6
negative damage to creatures in this area as their ﬂesh
curdles and rots as well (DC 27 basic Fortitude save).

SHANRIGOL COMPONENTS
As shanrigols incorporate pieces of
creatures near their hunting ground,
explorers who examine a shanrigol
can gain many valuable clues about
nearby creatures. In the case of a
shanrigol behemoth, these explorers
might ﬁnd the beast using strange
abilities from creatures they haven’t
yet faced!
