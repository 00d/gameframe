Restoring Dorianna: Slaying Ysondkhelir frees
Dorianna, as described on page 92. Destroying the
giant crawling hand immediately restores Dorianna’s
hand to normal.
G19. HAND COLLECTION
A small desk covered in the stubs of burned candles stands
against the east wall. The west wall has severed hands
from more than a dozen creatures nailed to it, each badly
withered and displayed palm outward.
Ysondkhelir
performs
his
research in this room, but it
primarily serves as his gruesome
trophy hall—it bears the hands of
creatures he has corrupted over the
years, including Jedzeli’s. He spends hours
examining them, mesmerized by the intricate
details upon each hand that tell an entire life’s story.
Treasure: The desk drawer contains two scrolls of
dream message.
G20. RITUAL ROOM
A ﬁlthy silk pillow rests at the center of this room,
surrounded by several unlit candles. Several charcoal
depictions drawn directly on the stone walls feature the
same teenage girl. A small wooden box sits in the corner of
the room with a few more candles inside.
Ysondkhelir performs his dream rituals here, using his
magic to invade and twist Dorianna Menhemes’s dreams.
His drawings of her help him to focus on her mind.
Treasure: The box contains several candles
made of rare waxes worth 50 gp in total.
G21. THE SECRET VOID

MODERATE 7
The ﬂat, black walls of this chamber
reﬂect an eerie emptiness. An open
trapdoor against the east wall leads to
a narrow crawl space.
This chamber was built for a high priest of
Nhimbaloth to sleep and meditate in. The only
entrances are concealed and the room’s black
walls simulate the void of oblivion granted to
those consumed by the Empty Death.
Creature: Sacuishu, a will-o’-wisp priest
of Nhimbaloth, occupies this chamber.
She’s a variant form of will-o’-wisp who has gained
Ysondkhelir
