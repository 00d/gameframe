a few writing slates, upon which the seugathis take
notes when observing creatures in the testing grounds.
The stairs near the southwest corner lead up to
area E21.
The northwest door has no visible latches, but the
wall next to it features two distinct keyholes: one is
a round indentation, and the other is a circular piece
of stone with four separate holes. They function
identically to the keyholes in area F7.
The wall at the eastern end of the observation
gallery bears faintly glowing magical glyphs. These
glyphs simultaneously affect all the transparent stone
ringing the gallery and operate as described in area E9.
Two secret doors lead out of this room to the
north (to area F5) and southeast (to area F20). A
hero Searching the right area who succeeds at a DC
20 Perception check locates them. Both secret doors
operate the same way: a masonry square near ﬂoor
level depresses like a button and causes the secret door
to unlatch and swing open.
Creature: A seugathi researcher observes the
destrachan in the testing grounds and takes notes on a
writing slate. Upon noticing the intruders, the seugathi
becomes eager to see how the destrachan performs in
combat; they retreat as soon as possible to the east end
of the gallery to turn the wall ethereal. Once the wall
is no longer solid stone, the destrachan’s echolocation
allows it to recognize the heroes’ presence and join in
combat as the seugathi directs, together presenting a
severe-threat encounter for 6th-level characters.

This twenty-foot-high chamber’s stone ﬂoor is heavily
stained with blood. A wall of transparent stone separates
this room from an observation gallery that rings
its north, west, and south sides. The northeast
corner features a short stone well, while the
room’s south end has a steep, ascending
staircase. The room juts out a side
hall to the east that ends at a
charred circle in the stone
with a double door nearby.
This chamber was intended
for grudge matches between
gladiators;
however,
it
saw
equal use in testing aberrant
monsters’  capabilities. Since Jafaki seized control of
this level, the room has served only as testing grounds.
The room is 20 feet high from ﬂoor to ceiling, and
the ﬂoor is 5 feet below the observation gallery. Two
iron ladders bolted to the north wall ascend the 5 feet
to the transparent stone, but they don’t allow access to
the gallery unless the characters use the glyphs in area
F8 to render the stone ethereal.
A sturdy iron grate caps the well in the north. It
was built to provide food—normally in the form of
defeated combatants cut into chunks—to the hydras in
the pool. The grate appears ﬁrmly fastened to the stone
