or partially ﬁlled with rubble in the middle of the room;
Eﬀect Six ghostly kobolds surge out of the rubble with
eerie yowls. Each creature in area A7 must attempt a DC
18 Will save with the following results. The haunt then
rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected, is temporarily
immune to Confusing Confrontation for 24 hours and
realizes that a display of intimidating dominance
might quell the ghostly kobolds’ assault.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is confused for 1 round and is
frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is confused for 2 rounds
and is frightened 3.
Routine (1 action) The spirits swoop together toward one
creature in area A7 who’s frightened, instilling feelings
of betrayal and confusion. The target takes 1d10+4
mental damage (DC 18 basic Will save).
Reset The haunt deactivates if there are no frightened
creatures in area A7 at the start of its turn. The ghostly
kobolds return to the rubble pile. The haunt can’t
activate again for 1 hour.
Treasure: With a successful DC 20 Perception check,
heroes Searching this room ﬁnd many tiny bones
scattered in the rubble. Thirty minutes of work can
uncover six kobold skeletons. Destroying the bones
or removing them all from this room permanently
disables the haunt. A hero who’s trained in Religion
or who succeeds at a DC 15 Religion check realizes
the connection between the bones and the haunt and
understands that destroying the bones or removing
them all from the rubble pile is necessary to ensure the
spectral kobolds won’t ever rise again.
If the heroes discover the kobold bones, they also
ﬁnd several jumbled treasures: 3 gp, 20 sp, a box with
components for a caltrop snare, a wolf fang, and a vial
of black adder venom with the word “YUM” clumsily
written on it.
A8. SINKHOLE
MODERATE 1
Roll a secret DC 10 Perception check for each hero
before they enter this room to hear the sound of
high‑pitched squeals and shrieks from within. Any
hero who speciﬁcally listens before entering hears
these sounds automatically. The four mitﬂits gooﬁng
off in this room are the source of the noise.
Almost the entire ceiling of this room has collapsed ,while
below, the ﬂoor has crumbled into a ten-foot-deep sinkhole
ﬁlled with rubble, mud, and glistening patches of fungus.
Evidence of ancient damage—burn scars and acid scorch
marks—decorate the walls and much of the rubble.
The ancient battle between the Roseguard and
Belcorra came to its destructive end in this room when
Belcorra used a last-ditch explosion to try to defeat
the adventurers. The resulting collapse swallowed the
group’s rogue, Otari Ilvashti, and trapped him in the
dungeon below. Belcorra ﬂed to the lighthouse (area
A11) after this failed gambit. As in area A4, a hero
Investigating this room who succeeds at a DC 15
check to Recall Knowledge using any skill associated
with magic conﬁrms that a devastating magical battle
occurred here long ago.
A character must attempt a DC 12 Athletics check
to Climb to navigate the sinkhole’s steep slopes. A
hero who Searches the rubble and succeeds at a DC 18
Perception check spies a buried spiral staircase leading
downward. Clearing the rubble away can take many
days, but if the heroes persist, they open the way down
to area B8 below.
Creatures: Four Mudlicker mitﬂits clamber and
scurry around amid the rubble in the sinkhole. They’re
supposed to be gathering mushrooms and grubs but
are currently wrestling over who gets to snack on a
particularly bright blue grub. The mitﬂits take a –2
penalty to Perception checks rolled for initiative as a
result of their distraction unless the heroes take pains
to announce themselves before attacking. The mitﬂits
hurl darts at the heroes from below, but a mitﬂit
who runs out of darts or takes any damage focuses
on Climbing out of the pit and then running away to
warn Boss Skrawng in area A10.
MITFLITS (4)
CREATURE –1
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 192
Initiative Perception +2 (+4 if not distracted)
A9. WALKWAY
A ﬁfteen-foot stone walkway spans a narrow stretch of
swamp water, connecting the ruined keep to a large stone
outbuilding. Double doors block each end of the walkway.
Standing before the southeast door is a seven-foot-tall
skeleton dressed in armor made of gnarled roots, bones,
and rusted metal. The skeleton clenches a morningstar in
one weathered hand with the weapon’s heavy, spiked tip
resting on the walkway at the skeleton’s feet.
The skeletal “guard” is nothing more than a statue
built by the Mudlickers. It looks frightening but poses
no danger; anyone examining the statue who succeeds
at a DC 12 Perception check notices the wooden struts
and crude lashings that keep it together. Any damage
dealt to the skeleton causes it to clatter apart loudly,
alerting the occupants of area A10.
