of tiny swatches of skinned ﬂesh marked with tattoos.
Judging by the workspace on the table in the middle of the
room, these tattoos have been placed postmortem, with
a swath of pale skin stretched over the desk sporting a
half‑completed image of a sinister woman.
Creatures: Aller Rosk served as a notary and scribe
for Belcorra when he lived, but after he died and
became a ghoul, his nature and interests shifted, if only
slightly. He’s developed a unique taste for tattooed
ﬂesh. The idea of writing something down and then
eating it appeals to the twisted ghoul, and when he isn’t
preparing a less-than-fresh morlock for distribution to
the other ghouls, he’s here, preparing his latest work
on a swath of morlock skin. His current project is a
depiction of Belcorra. While he doesn’t intend to eat
this one, some part of him knows that this work of art,
once complete, won’t have a fate any different than the
numerous others he’s created over the years.
Aller is focused on his work and takes a –2 penalty
to initiative checks. If interrupted,
he seethes and curses, wasting
an action each round for
the ﬁrst 2 rounds voicing his
displeasure and informing the
heroes about the blasphemous
limericks and humiliating odes he’ll
be tattooing onto their corpses once
he’s defeated them. Single‑minded
to a fault, Aller Rosk pursues foes
relentlessly once a ﬁght begins and
ﬁghts until he is destroyed.

Treasure: This room contains 2 Bulk of books
about tattoo artistry and historical tattoos of interest
to Morlibint.
C20. SCRIVENER’S OFFICE
The desk in this oﬃce has been repurposed into a messy
butcher’s block. A shiny silver hatchet is wedged
in the top of the desk, and bits of decaying
pale ﬂesh lie strewn about the room.
Aller has repurposed this ofﬁce into
a makeshift butcher’s shop. Of course,
there’s little artistry that goes into the
preparation of a morlock body for
ghouls to eat, other than a few quick
and brutal hacks with a hatchet.
Treasure: The hatchet is a +1
low-grade silver hatchet.
C21. FOOD STORAGE
The heaps of slowly decaying bodies
hung and stacked here reveal this former
bedroom’s current use as a meat locker.
Five dead morlocks are stored here,
their ﬂesh decomposing (aging, to the
ghoul palate) somewhat slowly in the
chilly room. There’s nothing of interest
in here, but the ﬁlthy conditions
expose any hero who Searches the room
to blueblisters, a disease arising from an
uncommon ﬂesh-eating bacteria. Ghouls ﬁnd
ﬂesh infected with blueblisters to be quite savory. A
hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Medicine or Nature
check realizes the danger these infected bodies pose
before Searching the room.
