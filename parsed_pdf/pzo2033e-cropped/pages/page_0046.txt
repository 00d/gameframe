B15. CRYPT 
MODERATE 2
This ﬁve-foot-wide hallway features three alcoves along
each side. Stone sarcophagi stand upright within each.
Belcorra planned to inter her favorite followers
in this small crypt. Due to her high standards and
hard-to-please nature, only one servant ever had the
honor of being buried here—her ﬁrst majordomo.
Creatures: Today, the majordomo exists as a
shadow-like undead who retains her appearance
from life but otherwise functions as
a standard shadow. Her soul
is bound by her loyalty to
Belcorra and Gauntlight’s
necromantic energies. The
majordomo
emerges
from
the central sarcophagus on
the west wall to attack anyone
entering this crypt, but it doesn’t
pursue foes beyond area B15.

B16. PANTRY
Only a few fragments of the shelving that once lined
the walls of this pantry remain today.
The
morlocks
ﬁrst
entered
the
dungeon’s second level through this
room. Most of the gear and shelving once
stored here has been scavenged for other
projects (most notably Graulgust’s throne).
The stairs beyond the northeastern door lead
down to area C1.
B17. LEVEL TWO PORTAL CHAMBER
The door to this room is locked, and its key is long lost. A
hero can Force it Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics
check or Pick the Lock with three successful DC 20
Thievery checks.
The walls of this octagonal chamber are adorned with
swirling runes carved into the stone and then ﬁlled with
dull, silvery metal. The ﬂoor is polished smooth, as is the
ceiling ten feet above.
Belcorra installed several teleportation circles in
the Abomination Vaults for swift movement between
levels, but over time, their magic has faded. Smaller
teleportation circles, like those at areas A4 and C5, link
to only one area each, but this transit chamber was
linked to several others; by tracing speciﬁc patterns on
the wall runes, someone could transport everyone in
this room to one of nine other portal chambers in the
Abomination Vaults.
The awaken portal ritual required to reactivate
this teleportation circle is recorded in a folio in area
C35. Each linked teleportation circle must each be
individually reactivated with this ritual, though,
before they can be used—the heroes must therefore
physically travel to each portal chamber they want to
