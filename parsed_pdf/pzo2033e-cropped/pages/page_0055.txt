The stairs beyond the east door lead up to area B16.
Heroes can discover the secret door to the south
with a successful DC 27 Perception check. It’s
concealed behind a heavy sofa.
Creatures: A unique undead creature
dwells here. Augrael is a morlock ghoul
exiled by his living kin among the Ghost
Queen morlocks above, just as he’s reviled
by the ghouls of the Cult of the Canker who
occupy this level. As he hasn’t been steeped
in the maliciousness or fervor of either
group, Augrael is quite calm and collected.
When the heroes arrive, he greets them
cordially but cautiously.
Augrael wants only to dwell
within these dungeons, reading
and feeding on undead ﬂesh—
he has little taste for ﬂesh
that was merely once living.
He has hazy recollections of
how he and the other Ghost
Queen morlocks came up
from below and fought the
ghouls, as the ghoul fever
he contracted fragmented his memories. He knows the
rough layout of areas C1, C6, C10, C11, C15, and C33,
as his memories of these rooms are freshest.
Augrael’s initial attitude to the heroes is indifferent,
but it becomes friendly if the heroes prove that
Augrael’s chief rival among the morlocks, Graulgust,
is dead. The heroes can convince Augrael to
accompany them with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy
check to Request his aid (for 1 day on a success; 1
week on a critical success) or with a successful DC
20 Intimidation check to Coerce him (for 1 day on
a success; he attacks in a rage on a critical failure).
He won’t leave this level under any circumstances.
Augrael’s propensity to glut himself on ghouls the
heroes defeat is both off-putting and macabre.

C2. TUNNEL TO OTARI
Belcorra’s pet purple worm dug this long tunnel for
visitors who didn’t want to travel overland. The
passage leads under the Fogfen to the Stonescale
kobold warrens beneath Otari (which connect to other
Darklands passages). If you’ve run the “Menace Under
Otari” adventure in the Pathﬁnder Beginner Box, this
passage connects to area 15 beneath the Otari Fishery.
The secret door to area C1 is easier to ﬁnd from this
side—it’s a smooth section of a natural passage. A hero
identiﬁes it with a successful DC 16 Perception check.
C3. HAUNTED READING ROOM
The cracks around the edge of this door glow faintly
with greenish light, like the door to area B28.
An ancient, tattered sofa sits against the east wall of this
room. The south wall shimmers with strange green light.
