Swarm Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate) Volluk collapses into a
shapeless swarm of leeches. He drops all held, worn, and
carried items. While discorporated, he can’t use attack
actions and can’t cast spells, but he can move through
areas small enough for his individual leeches to ﬁt
without having to Squeeze. He can use the same action
to coalesce back into his normal form.
Treasure: Among Volluk’s papers are a scroll of
comprehend language, a scroll of paralyze, and a
scroll of worm’s repast (page 225). A lantern of empty
light (page 221) sits on the writing desk. Volluk
takes this lantern on his journeys above ground,
where he unknowingly spawned the rumors of the
lantern‑carrying stranger.
D9. LASDA’S LAMENT
MODERATE 4
The walls of this circular chamber are smooth and gray. A
ﬂickering, nauseating ribbon of pale blue light churns in
the center of the room. Where the light touches the ceiling,
the stone bubbles as if it were infected ﬂesh. Below, the
light bathes a screaming, thrashing dwarf bound onto a
metal table, his body covered in blisters.
As in area B35, the ribbon of light is a manifestation
of Gauntlight’s growing power. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn in it takes 5d6 negative
damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save) and undead
creatures regain the same amount. To reactivate
Gauntlight for its test ﬁring on Otari’s graveyard,
Volluk Azrinae
