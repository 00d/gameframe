Vaults
The banks of the River of Souls brushes against every
world, for when a mortal dies, their spirit steps out
of their body to cross over these banks on the ﬁrst
step toward the afterlife. Yet, as
with most rivers, predators lurk
along these perilous banks. Night
hags, astradaemons, devourers,
and worse stalk the River, eager to
pluck souls free and feed on them.
Dread Nhimbaloth, the Empty
Death, doesn’t deign to hunt
the shores of the River of Souls
alongside
these
predators—she
instead feeds upon the predators
themselves, reveling in consuming
souls already being digested in the gullets of those who
would deem themselves the apex hunters of the dead.
Nhimbaloth uses the shores of the River of Souls
to manifest upon the universe’s countless worlds, but
she can’t just do so whenever she wills it. Before the
Empty Death can manifest within a world, it must
ﬁrst endure a cataclysm so vast that the outﬂow of the
dead into the River of Souls weakens the boundaries
between life and death. When such massive casualties
sufﬁciently thin these borders, she can drift in through
the cracks and stain what she ﬁnds. The resulting
blurring between the River of Souls and its shore is
metaphysically akin to the muddied boundary of a
swamp. It’s no coincidence that when Nhimbaloth
emerges into a world, she chooses to dwell in its
remote swamplands. Nhimbaloth isn’t a glutton—
she’s endlessly patient and can linger on a world for
centuries before being noticed.
More often, her presence in an isolated swampland
simply festers, turning a region of natural beauty into
a dangerous fen that draws all manner of monsters
to its fetid heart. Such lands call to will-o’-wisps; for
these feeders of fears, the ruin wrought by the Empty
Death is like a ﬁne wine of unparalleled vintage.
In time, many of these wisps realize the truth of the
inﬂuence in their chosen haunts, and in most cases,
these ravenous aberrations become Empty Death’s
most fervent worshippers.
Personification
and Realm
While Dread Nhimbaloth has
no physical body of her own,
she has been known to manifest
a perceivable shape under the
perfect
conditions,
growing
visible after consuming a huge
quantity of souls the way an
empty glass’s contours becomes
more deﬁned once ﬁlled with
liquid. In this form, Nhimbaloth appears as a
twisting, melted mass of glistening blue ﬂuid with
eyes the shape of yellow four-pointed stars and a
tangle of translucent tentacles extending in every
direction. The tentacles’ tips split into seven smaller
tendrils, and where these “hands” touch the world,
they leave her mark behind—a ring of seven strange
divots where vegetation refuses to grow, stone
becomes chalky, and ﬂesh festers as if it had forgotten
how to heal. The position of the stars in the sky, the
number of dead trapped within the swamp, and the
time of year all seem to play a part in determining
when this shadow of what might have once been
Nhimbaloth’s body can appear, as does the presence
of her cultists, but the manifestation rarely persists
for long. Always, the manifestation ends in a sudden
consumption from within when the Empty Death
retreats to her domain, leaving behind a dead
swampland of toxic waters and mindless undeath.
This form often appears in illustrations that
depict the Empty Death, though Nhimbaloth is also
portrayed as a ghostly human woman with a single
yellow eye in the shape of a four-pointed star ﬁlling
her otherwise blank face, and a long, writhing mane
of ghostly, seven‑ﬁngered tentacles wraps around
 “The wind, her voice;
The wisp, her eye;
Your life, her choice;
Your lot, to die.”
