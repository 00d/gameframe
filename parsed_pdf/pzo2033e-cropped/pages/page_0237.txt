Fleshwarp
Although twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime
of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices
or developed them independently. The worm-like seugathis (page 244)
sometimes warp other creatures whose territories abut their lightless lands;
the ﬂeshwarps below result from morlocks and urdefhans, respectively.
DRESHKAN
Because morlocks are descended from distant human ancestors, clumsily
or hastily ﬂeshwarping a morlock simply produces a grothlut (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 158). Skilled ﬂeshwarpers, however, can tease out a morlock’s
genetic differences to make an entirely different creature. Creating a
dreshkan involves replacing the morlock’s bones with a metal skeleton.
This new skeleton is often heavily augmented, such as with spiderlike
limbs protruding from the spine or magazines of tiny, deadly needles.
Arcane electricity courses through the dreshkan thereafter, making it
jumpy and irritable.
Morlocks view dreshkans as impressive fusions of ﬂesh and technology.
They gladly ﬁght alongside dreshkans, viewing them as paragons of
morlock potential. Dreshkans don’t think much of morlock allies and
don’t much care if they’re injured by an errant spray of electriﬁed needles.

Partially Technological A dreshkan is
partially technological. Positive healing eﬀects only heal a
dreshkan half as much as normal.
Defensive Needle Ǻȓ Trigger A creature critically fails a
melee Strike against the dreshkan; Eﬀect The dreshkan
makes a needle Strike against that creature.
Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ claw +13 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 2d6+4 slashing
Ranged Ȱɵ needle +13 (range increment 30 feet), Damage 1d4
piercing plus 2d8 electricity
Needle Spray ̂ˬ The dreshkan braces itself on all four limbs and sprays
needles at as many creatures as it would like in a 30-foot cone, dealing
2d4 piercing plus 2d8 electricity damage (DC 21 basic Reﬂex save).
Swarming Stance A dreshkan can share the same space as a morlock
or another dreshkan, but no more than two such creatures can occupy
the same space. When these creatures share the same space, they gain a +1
circumstance bonus to attack rolls.
DRESHKAN VARIATIONS
Though most dreshkans ﬁre
electriﬁed needles from the metal
limbs on their backs, some are built
with even stranger abilities. Seugathi
masters looking to perfect their craft
will sometimes “upgrade” dreshkans’
artiﬁcial limbs to gout steam,
hammer through stone, or launch
hooks at the end of long cables.
