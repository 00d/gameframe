A22. HALL OF PORTRAITS
A series of four paintings hang on the
northwestern wall of this hallway,
although layers of mold and decay
have severely damaged them.
The
paintings
along
the wall have sustained
irrevocable damage over
time and due to moisture
dripping
down
from
leaks in the roof.
The ﬁrst painting is
enormous, nearly 7 feet
tall and almost as wide. It’s
a landscape painting that
depicts the city of Absalom in
ﬂames with ghosts rising from the
city streets between the burning
buildings. The picture’s lower frame
bears a bronze plaque that reads, “So Shall the
Fools Suffer.”
The second painting is nearly as large as the Absalom
painting and is in the same style, though its subject
is different. This second painting depicts Gauntlight
Keep as it appeared before its upper ﬂoors collapsed.
The lighthouse rises above the stately keep into the
night sky, with its beacon emitting a pale blue light
in which ghostly faces sneer and grimace. Its bronze
plaque reads, “Let the Light Shine Forever.”
The third picture is a portrait that once depicted
Volluk but is now totally shredded. Volluk destroyed
it after becoming a worm that walks. Its plaque reads,
“The Artist at Work.”
The fourth and ﬁnal portrait is smaller and circular.
It depicts a smirking woman dressed in a red gown
with a high collar—an image of Belcorra herself. Its
plaque reads, “The Lady of the Light.” Long ago,
Volluk scratched the following sentences, written in
Aklo, into the stone next to this last painting: “I serve
you still! You shall be avenged!”
A23. LENS WORKSHOP
MODERATE 1
This once elegant workshop has fallen into shambles.
Soggy strings of dripping moss hang through cracks in the
wooden domed roof above. Below it, a carpet of broken
glass glitters dangerously. Workbenches and shelves,
armatures and displays—all formerly used in crafting or
repairing immense lenses for a lighthouse—lie in ruins.
Only a bejeweled spyglass sitting on a display rack near
the southern wall has survived the devastation.
Volluk caused most of this destruction. After
Belcorra’s death, he hid in the swamp while he
waited for the Roseguard to leave. When
he returned, he was ﬁlled with such guilt
over his cowardice that he destroyed
this workshop in a ﬁt of fury.
The layer of broken glass
and
shattered
materials
covering the ﬂoor makes
it uneven ground (Core
Rulebook 476) with an
Acrobatics DC of 11. A
creature who falls prone
while in this room takes 1
piercing damage.
Creatures: Volluk created
several
constructs
to
aid
him and his mistress in their
day‑to‑day jobs, but the raven-headed,
raven-winged soulbound doll he called
Mister Beak was his favorite. Neither the
most powerful nor the most helpful, Mister Beak
held the soul of his devoted servant, a goblin named
Borbo, a fact that ensured the construct’s place at
Volluk’s side. Today, Mister Beak remains abandoned
here, waiting forever for a creator who moved on to
other tasks and an entirely new body. Mister Beak
hasn’t lost hope, and when the heroes enter the room,
he stands up from the slumped mound in the room’s
center and asks in a warbling voice, “Is Master
Azrinae coming back?” Regardless of the heroes’
answer, Mister Beak realizes none of them are its
creator; it then leaps into the air on ﬂapping wings
to attack in a frustrated fury, ﬁghting until destroyed.
Mister Beak is a unique variant of a soulbound doll
with ungainly wings that he can nevertheless use to
ﬂy. He can therefore easily avoid the uneven ground
in this room.
