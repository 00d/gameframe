XP Award: Award the heroes 120 XP for freeing

Arena Features
Once the heroes recover all four of the icons and place
them on the altar in the Upper Temple of Nhimbaloth
in area D13, they are able to enter the ﬁfth level of the
Abomination Vaults. Belcorra used this level to test the
resolve of her minions and her prisoners, and hoped
to someday establish a premier facility for gladiators,
from which she would take the best combatants for
her forces. Presently, Jafaki and the other seugathis use
this level as a dumping ground for failed experiments.
The ceilings on this level are 15 feet tall unless
otherwise indicated. Areas not described as having
light are completely dark. The doors are made of wood
banded with iron, and virtually all of them bear gouges
or scarring from violent beasts smashing their way
through in the past. The doors are weighted to swing
closed after a few moments if they aren’t propped open.
The Arena map appears on page 84.
E1. UPPER SHAFT
MODERATE 5
A crumbling staircase leads to a cracked and badly stained
mosaic tile ﬂoor. To the south, a walkway encircles a round,
gaping pit, leading to a spiral stairway that clings to the edge
of the pit. A twisted iron banister follows the edge of the
walkway and stairs. The acrid smell of chemicals and rot,
with just a tinge of sulfur, wafts from the pit’s darkness.
Strange moaning echoes up the shaft.
The circular pit is 80 feet deep and ringed with
a spiral staircase. The laboratories level is 40 feet
below (area F1), and the prison level is at the bottom
(area G1).
Creatures: The seugathis deposited some rejected
experiments here to keep them out of the way. Two
grothluts lurk around the bends, just out of sight of
the stairs, and a gibbering mouther sprawls on the
walkway near the door leading east. They attack as
soon as they detect any creatures in the area, moaning
and gibbering as they do. (The grothluts are immune to
the mouther’s gibbering, but the mouther isn’t immune
to the grothluts’ piteous moan.) These creatures ﬁght
until destroyed, but they don’t bother pursuing anyone
who retreats up the stairs.

E2. LARGE MONSTER HOLDING
MODERATE 5
Rusted iron chains hang from the ceiling of this room, each
ending in an oversized manacle. The octagonal eastern end
of the room contains a circular pit covered by a rusted iron
grate. Torn bolts and scrap metal dangle from the ceiling
above the pit. Piles of scrap ﬁll the four alcoves that open
oﬀ the wide hall that constitutes the room’s west end.
A velstrac named Cratonys once prepared large
monsters for ﬁghting in the arena in this part of the
dungeon. She kept them in the cells in area E3, where
she tortured them to enhance their aggressiveness and
scarred them to augment their ferocious appearance
using the now-rusted contraptions in the alcoves.
When it came time for the creatures to ﬁght, she
lowered them into the chamber below (area F2) using
a heavy winch in the ceiling, which is now inoperable
and unstable.
The heroes might have met another evangelist
velstrac named Vaulgrist on the level above this one.
Cratonys and Vaulgrist were once as close as sisters,
but each has fallen into her own independent malaise.
Hazard: The rusty and unstable grate over the pit
collapses as soon as any signiﬁcant weight is placed
upon it. The remains of the dangling winch mechanism
fall into the pit moments later. The Athletics DC to
Climb the pit is 20.
RUSTY GRATE PIT

MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 20 (expert), or 0 if the grate is open
Description The rusty grate covers a pit that’s 10 feet in
diameter and 40 feet deep.
Disable DC 18 Thievery to harmlessly trigger the trap
by nudging the gate or the dangling winch, or DC 24
Thievery to stabilize the grate so it doesn’t collapse.
AC 21; Fort +17, Ref +11
Hardness 14; HP 56 (BT 28); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Pitfall Ǻȓ Trigger A creature walks onto the grate; Eﬀect
The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage
(20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the
Grab an Edge reaction to avoid falling. Whether or not
the creature Grabs an Edge, the rusty winch above
crashes down atop the triggering creature, dealing
3d10 bludgeoning damage and dislodging its grip (DC
24 basic Reﬂex save). The creature can still try to Grab
an Edge again.
