I50. COINS AND SLIME
Hanging streamers of mold dangle from the ceiling here.
Several coins protrude from a shelf of stone to the north.
A traveler left the coins in the wall here long ago,
hoping to keep them safe, though they never returned.
A patch of green slime grew from the streams of mold,
particularly over the coins, where it could fall upon
greedy treasure-seekers, dissolve them, and slither up
the ceiling to await a new victim.
Hazard: The green slime is hard to spot amid the
hanging mold. It drips upon anyone who tries to pull
the coins free.

Treasure: There are only 15 sp stuck in the ﬂoor,
and breaking out each coin requires a few minutes’
chiseling or shape stone or similar magic (which is
how the coins got stuck in the stone in the ﬁrst place).
I51. RAVIREX’S FEN
MODERATE 9
A morass of mud sprouting thick fungus and clinging vines
makes up the ﬂoor of this large cavern. A few boulders
protrude from the mud.
Not long ago, a black dragon named Ravirex moved
into the swampy cavern at the edge of the Hunting
Grounds to make his lair. He initially thought to
dominate the area but soon ran afoul of powerful
creatures like the derghodaemon in area I31, the
gogiteth in area I49, and the drow hunters who have
proven impossible to pin down. Ravirex quickly
realized the need to be much more circumspect in the
Hunting Grounds, and these days he primarily works
on sculpting the growth in his wide cavern to his
liking. He’s too arrogant to consider defense, assuming
that even the other dangerous creatures of the Hunting
Grounds know better than to attack a dragon.
