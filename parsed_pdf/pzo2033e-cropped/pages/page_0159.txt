This dock and building were abandoned decades
prior to Belcorra’s return. Vethris, the spirit naga
Belcorra recently put in charge of the Children of
Belcorra, now claims it as her lair. The door to the
building is unlocked.
Creatures: The shadows playing on the masonry
are more than just a trick of the water. A dread wraith
haunts this area, acting as a lookout. When it spots
strangers, it silently moves to the inner complex to warn
Vethris. Vethris peevishly dismisses the dread wraith,
commanding it to “take care of the problem.” The dread
wraith then hunts down the heroes, eager to make
wraith spawn out of them.

H24. MUD ROOM
LOW 8
This damp room has a recessed ﬂoor ﬁlled with mud.
The mud is only a few inches below the doors’
thresholds but is two feet deep and is difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra lurk in the
mud in the eastern part of this room, bitter at being
stationed here under the command of the lazy Vethris.
They’re quick to attack when anyone disturbs this
room, but, being beneath the mud, they don’t notice
when the dread wraith ﬂits overhead to warn the naga
of intruders and aren’t likely to know the heroes are
present until the heroes enter the mud.

H25. NAGA LAIR
LOW 8
This room is ﬁlled with rugs, tapestries, and pillows. Most
are stained with mud.
This is the lair of the scheming spirit naga Vethris.
Vethris convinced Belcorra she would do a good job
of getting the Farm level back in good order and
keep the Children in line, but she has done nothing
of the sort. Vethris spends her days lounging about
and ordering her new minions to bring her food and
treasures. While the undead are dissatisﬁed with her,
they’re loyal to Belcorra, so they alternate between
grudgingly follow the naga’s orders and ﬁnding ways
to ignore her.
Vethris brought the pillows and other trappings,
but good hygiene isn’t one of the naga’s priorities.
One tapestry, depicting a stylized nest of intertwining
snakes, covers the secret door on the south wall.
Anyone removing the tapestry or Searching the
room locates the secret door with a successful DC 25
Perception check. It’s opened by pressing the proper
stone on the eastern wall.
Creatures: Vethris is lazy, but
she snaps into action against
any who dare intrude on her
relaxation. She screams curses
at her foes while casting spells
at them. She prefers to use
black tentacles to keep her foes
at a distance, but then she follows
up with paralyze as often as possible; this
is her favorite spell, and it frustrates her that
the Children of Belcorra are immune to it, and
thus she can’t use it to discipline them. Vethris
surrenders if reduced to fewer than 40 Hit Points
and tries to slither away.
