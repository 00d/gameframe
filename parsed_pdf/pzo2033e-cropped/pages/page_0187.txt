Creatures: The three urdefhan lashers assigned to
guard this little-used entrance are itching for a ﬁght.

Initiative Perception +16
Reinforcements: If the guards
are defeated, they’re replaced by
the ceustodaemons in area I34.
If the daemons are defeated, this
area remains unguarded.
I39. DEADLY LAKEMODERATE 9
The murky waters of this massive lake
shift ominously.
Though not covered with a cloying, sickly mist
like the large lake in the Farm level, this lake is
hundreds of feet deep in its center and harbors
strange aquatic life.
Creatures: A total of six deepwater dhuthorexes
swim in this lake. Two quickly come to investigate any
disturbance in the water. This attack should occur the
ﬁrst time the heroes venture into the lake, but you can
have another pair of dhuthorexes attack during later
excursions if you choose. The dhuthorexes attack
singly or in pairs and are shockingly aggressive; they
pursue foes on land and ﬁght to the death.

I40. CRYSTAL SHORE
The stone along the shore here sprouts large growths of
pale‑green crystals. The crystals hang from the ceiling, climb
up the wall, and reach toward the water in long strands.
While some of these crystals are pointed, they aren’t
hazardous. However, if a creature touches one of
the crystals, it begins to vibrate, which starts a chain
reaction of resonant, ringing sounds among the crystals.
The sound is loud but not unpleasant. The noise piques
the attention of the cauthooj nesting in area I41, which
swims over to investigate.
I41. ISLAND NEST
SEVERE 9
A mix of green crystals and grayish stone make up the
mass of this island. A few patches of fungus grow across
the rocks, with a particularly thick patch near the island’s
eastern shore.
The thick patch is a cauthooj nest
holding two eggs.
Creatures: A cauthooj recently
came to this island to lay its eggs
and stockpile corpses to feed the
hatchlings. When it detects the
heroes, it attacks immediately
to secure a source of food. If
reduced to fewer than 40 Hit
Points, it ﬂees the island and
abandons its eggs. It’s wary of a trap
and doesn’t pursue anyone who ﬂees
into a narrow passage, such as to areas
I38 or I43.

Finding the Lens: Quara’s father dropped the
Ochre Fulcrum Lens in the water near the eastern
shore of this island during his battle with Khurfel.
Spells like detect magic locate it easily; otherwise, a
hero Searching the water ﬁnds it with a successful
DC 28 Perception check. If the heroes haven’t already
encountered deepwater dhuthorexes in area I39, those
monsters might harass anyone spending a lot of time
searching this area.
Treasure: The two cauthooj eggs are valuable
to the right buyer, but ﬁnding one can be difﬁcult.
Worliwynn, who runs the Stone Ring Pond just
outside of Otari, has contacts who offer 400 gp or
any common permanent magic item that’s 8th level or
lower for the eggs.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for recovering
the Ochre Fulcrum Lens.
I42. STEEP EXIT
This rubble-ﬁlled passage slopes steeply downward. The
passage’s ceiling undulates as an echoing chitter ﬁlls the air.
The passage leads deeper into the Darklands, but
the going isn’t easy. The steep and rocky decline slopes
downward for 80 feet before reaching a sheer, 300‑foot
drop. Several disused natural passages radiate outward
from its base, but where these passages might lead is
beyond the scope of this adventure.
Hundreds of tiny subterranean bats lair here. They
don’t pose a threat to high-level characters, even with
Ochre Fulcrum Lens
