Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted
hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or
prepare a good cover story. The Otari Garrison can’t
provide much help; Captain Longsaddle points out
that since Carman isn’t in town or along the roads,
the guards don’t have jurisdiction to pursue him.
He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that
troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s
good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture
Carman but happily takes him into custody if the
heroes bring the smith into town.
Blades for Glades: The heroes ﬁnd Carman’s
blacksmith shop, Blades for Glades, closed; they won’t
ﬁnd any clues here. If the heroes already had the
support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman
mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a
likely hideout.
Combing the Town: If the heroes ask about Carman’s
location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go to
the Crook’s Nook. A hero who succeeds at a DC 20
Diplomacy check to Gather Information hears about
the Smuggler’s Refuge from townsfolk and recalls that
Carman spent time there in his youth (as did many
people in Otari).
Crook’s Nook: Asking around at the Crook’s Nook
brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly
asks for a 10 gp “special fee” for food and drinks; heroes
who pay up (or succeed at a DC 20 Diplomacy check to
Request information) get her to open up about Carman.
The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in
her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She
mentions that Carman has likely gone into hiding at
Smuggler’s Refuge outside of town. If Yinyasmera has
a favorable opinion of the heroes from their previous
actions, she gives this information for free.
SMUGGLER’S REFUGE
LOW 5
This cave is only about an hour outside of town, just a
short walk through the forest, north of an abandoned
ﬁsh camp. Though it’s too far inland for transporting
heavy cargo, this cave once saw a lot of use from
smugglers moving lighter goods. They hid their loot in
