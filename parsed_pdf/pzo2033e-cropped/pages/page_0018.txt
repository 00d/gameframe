20. OTARI GRAVEYARD
Looming over the western cliffside and crowned by a
grove of scraggly trees that no living person in town
can remember ever having borne living leaves, the
Otari Graveyard is tended by the Dawnﬂower Library
acolytes. A wooden stairway ascends the cliff face
from the library below, but most priests prefer to take
the half-hour walk through town and up the easier
roads to tend the graves.
Cremations and burials at sea have become more
popular in Otari, so burials in the graveyard tend to
be the province of older families who value tradition.
While the graveyard itself is spooky and unsettling,
it doesn’t have any undead problems within its
boundaries—at least, not until the Gauntlight shines
upon it again during Chapter 2!
Otari Backgrounds
The following backgrounds are particularly suitable
to characters in the Abomination Vaults Adventure
Path, although heroes can select any background
they choose and need not conﬁne their selection to
those provided below. People come from all walks
of life to seek their fortunes, after all. Among the
backgrounds presented in the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, the best choices are acolyte, bounty
hunter, farmhand, ﬁeld medic, guard, hunter, martial
disciple, miner, nomad, or scout.
BIBLIOPHILE
BACKGROUND
You love few things more than a good book, and as a result,
Odd Stories is your favorite shop in Otari. The bookseller
Morlibint supplies you with ﬁction, anthologies, and other
delightful reads, and he’s always eager to discuss his latest
ﬁnds with you. You know that imagination is the greatest
magic, but a working knowledge of actual magic helps, too.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Library Lore
skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat.
ELDRITCH ANATOMIST
BACKGROUND
You’re a trained physician who can ably tend wounds of
many kinds. But more than a practitioner, you’re a scholar.
Some cultures shape ﬂesh to extreme degrees, creating
aberrations from humanoid forms. The ﬂeshforges of
distant Nex practice this ﬂeshwarping, as do certain
subterranean societies you hope to one day study—
preferably from a safe and clinical distance.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Fleshwarp
Lore skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Medicine.
FOGFEN TALE-TELLER
BACKGROUND
You know there are monstrous things out in the swamp
known as Fogfen; you’ve seen these things through
the mist, gliding through the murky water and heaving
themselves over sodden bits of land. No one in Otari
believes your tales of swamp monsters from the depths,
even when you embellish the creatures of your stories with
fangs, wings, or tentacles. You’ll just have to prove to them
that there are truly monsters out there, and that they were
wrong to doubt you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Athletics and the Swamp Lore skill. You
gain the Titan Wrestler skill feat.
MARKET RUNNER
BACKGROUND
Keeleno Lathenar, the proprietor of Otari Market, is a
grim and bitter man. A werewolf named Jaul Mezmin
mauled his wife, Ayla, to death 30 years ago. Keeleno
has never forgotten nor forgiven this attack, and he
believes against all odds that Jaul has evaded justice and
is alive and well. Running errands for Keeleno around
town, you’ve gotten to know him almost as well as
you know Otari. Keeleno’s suspicions have rubbed off
on you a bit, so you keep a wary eye on other people—
particularly around the full moon.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution
or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Otari Lore
skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.
RUIN DELVER
BACKGROUND
You’ve looked through some of the smaller ruins in the
Otari hinterlands but have never quite built up the courage
to check out the creepy lighthouse called Gauntlight.
You’ve heard that these ruins are pretty well picked over,
and mostly collapsed, but you always planned to some day
explore them and perhaps ﬁnd some bauble left behind
from the centuries-old battle where the Roseguard slew
an evil sorcerer. You know that the crumbled stone of old
ruins has a tendency to shift, so you’d better step lightly if
you get the chance to explore Gauntlight.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Acrobatics and the Roseguard Lore
skill. You gain the Cat Fall skill feat.
STARWATCHER
BACKGROUND
You’re one of Wrin Sivinxi’s closest conﬁdantes. You’ve
spent many long nights with her under the stars, learning
the tales associated with the Cosmic Caravan and how the
heavens can predict the future. You know that Wrin has
paralyzing claustrophobia; she sees menace in angles and
