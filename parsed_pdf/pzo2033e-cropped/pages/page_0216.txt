ITEM 2
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 6 gp
Usage Worn; Bulk L
Activate Ȱɵ Interact
This mask is made of Darklands wasul reeds, which have
been alchemically treated to enhance their air-retaining
properties when submerged in water. When you put on
this mask, for the next hour, you can hold your breath for
15 rounds plus your Constitution modiﬁer (instead of 5
rounds + your Constitution modiﬁer) before drowning.
It has no eﬀect in non-aquatic
environments that require you
to hold your breath. One hour
after you apply the mask, it
ﬂakes away into ﬁber shreds.
Artifacts
The
heroes
come
across
the
following
artifacts
in
their
explorations. Of course, Gauntlight
is hard to miss, as it towers over the
ruins of Gauntlight Keep and its base
extends down through every level of the
Abomination Vaults to the Empty Vault
far below. In many ways, this artifact is just as much
a key danger of the campaign as the spiteful Belcorra
Haruvex herself.
The heroes might discover the dread tome known as
The Whispering Reeds in Belcorra’s secure collection
of books on the Library level.
GAUNTLIGHT
ITEM 20
UNIQUE
ARTIFACT
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Gauntlight is much more than a 115-foot-tall lighthouse
rising from the heart of an old ruin in Fogfen—its pale
stone walls extend far below the ruins, passing through
eight diﬀerent dungeon levels and ﬁnally terminating
at the ninth level below the surface, where its deep
foundation centers on an ominous chamber where, long
ago, Nhimbaloth herself once physically brushed against
this world. Once she ﬁnished its physical construction,
the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source
of power to infuse the walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings of each
of Gauntlight’s levels with eldritch power. The lens at the
apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to
focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam,
but Belcorra’s plans were cut short before she could replace
the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.
As an artifact, Gauntlight can’t be damaged by normal
means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any
attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers
of Nhimbaloth. They block eﬀects that allow temporary
passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against
dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract
teleportation eﬀects and planar travel into or out of areas
within Gauntlight and eﬀorts to summon creatures into
the area (using a +37 counteract modiﬁer); this eﬀect does
not stop a summoned creature from departing when the
summoning ends. Note that this eﬀect only applies to the
areas that are within Gauntlight and its footprint (areas
A11, A25, B35, C15, and so on), and not to the entirety of
the Abomination Vaults!
In Gauntlight’s current state of diminished functionality,
it can be activated only in the two ways below. By
swapping in a series of four magical lighthouse lenses
called fulcrum lenses that focus Nhimbaloth’s
baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even
Belcorra takes special care with them—
the artifact gains signiﬁcantly greater
power, including the ability to reach
all the way to Absalom and to
activate its eﬀects every minute.
To
activate
Gauntlight,
a
creature must be in the deepest
portion of the artifact, the Empty
Vault on the Temple level (area J20).
From anywhere within the Empty Vault,
a creature can observe the world outside remotely
through Gauntlight’s lens in its cuploa, including any area
Gauntlight’s beam can reach.
Activate ̂ˬ Interact; Frequency once per month; Eﬀect
A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and
illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point
within 1 mile. The light saturates the region, causing
any corpses in the area or within 10 feet of the surface
of the illuminated area to animate as level –1 undead
(typically as skeleton guards or zombie shamblers). Once
animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until
then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by
the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully
restored, the undead instead animate as any Common
undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.
Activate ̂ˬ Interact; Frequency once per month; Eﬀect
A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and
illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point
within 1 mile. The user chooses one creature of 4th level
or less that is physically located within Gauntlight; this
creature is then is teleported to any point within this
illumination radius. If Gauntlight is fully restored, any
number of creatures within Gauntlight of 15th level or
lower can be transported. This is a teleportation eﬀect.
Destruction If Belcorra’s ghost is permanently destroyed,
Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and
collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving
an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.
