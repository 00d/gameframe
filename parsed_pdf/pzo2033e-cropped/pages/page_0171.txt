DROW HUNTERS (2)
CREATURE 7
Page 234
Initiative Perception +16
FALXI ORSHENDIEL
CREATURE 2
Male drow rogue (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 137)
Initiative Perception +6
A Peaceful Meeting: If any drow led the heroes to
meet with Quara, they stop here and ask the heroes to
leave their weapons for the duration of that meeting.
Falxi (or, in his absence, Yrorix) promises to watch over
their gear personally. As it’s forbidden to bring armed
strangers before their leader, the drow don’t negotiate
this point. If the heroes balk, the drow usher them out
and invite them to return if they change their minds.
Treasure: The deck of harrow cards is well worn
but features unusual drow iconography. It’s worth 15
gp. Stacks of wagers worth 24 sp sit around the table.
I7. TANIETH’S ABODE
TRIVIAL 9
This small room has a bed and table next to it. A ceramic
mug and a modiﬁed hand crossbow sit next to the bed.
This is the sleeping quarters for a solitary shootist
named Tanieth. Tanieth is a loner; when he isn’t resting
here, tinkering with his repeating hand crossbow
with parts from another, inoperable repeating hand
crossbow, he’s ranging the Hunting Grounds alone.
His good looks and remote demeanor make him
something of a heartthrob among some Yldaris drow.
Creatures: Tanieth doesn’t like being disturbed. He
tends to shoot ﬁrst and ask questions later, even if it’s
another drow who bothers him.
TANIETH
CREATURE 8
Male drow shootist (page 235)
Initiative Perception +16
Treasure: Tanieth has hidden several treasures
under his mattress, including a small sack with 50 gp
and three opals worth 100 gp each.
I8. HUNTERS’ MESS
Tables, chairs, dirty dishes, empty bottles, and utensils
litter this chamber. It’s evident that creatures eat their
meals here but very rarely clean up afterwards.
Yldaris’s hunters are skilled at their craft and keep
their equipment in good working order but tend to be
slobs in their day-to-day living. They usually avoid this
place unless they’re eating.
I9. HUNTERS’ QUARTERS
LOW 9
The ﬁve bunk beds in this area are a mess of blankets
and furs. A trio of locker boxes is stacked at the foot of
each bunk.
While not in the total disarray of the adjacent
mess hall, this room is remarkably untidy.
The beds are unassigned; hunters simply grab
a bunk when they can. Unlike the beds, each
padlocked locker box belongs to a speciﬁc hunter.
Each padlock requires ﬁve successful DC 30 Thievery
checks to unlock or a single DC 30 Athletics check
to Force Open. Most hunters carry their keys
on their person.
Creatures: At least three hunters are
usually resting here. They’re quick to rouse
and confront danger.
