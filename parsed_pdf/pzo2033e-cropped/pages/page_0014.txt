8. OTARI GARRISON
This squat stone building houses Otari’s civic guards,
who keep the peace and patrol the Roseguard Road,
which leads off toward Absalom, to ensure it stays
clear of banditry and trouble. Clad in distinctive green
and white uniforms, the Otari Guard also serve as
ﬁreﬁghters and barristers, switching predominantly
to the latter role when they reach the age of 40. The
head of the guard is Captain Longsaddle. This elderly
but hale man was a veteran of Absalom’s city guard
who “retired” to Otari a decade ago. He took up
the mantle of leader after its previous captain, Trusk
Hanely, drowned in an unfortunate misadventure
involving a bit too much raspberry mead and an
ill‑advised boast regarding how long he could hold
his breath. Those among the guard who remember
Trusk do so fondly, for Longsaddle is short-tempered,
foul-mouthed, and much stricter than his dwarven
predecessor. The town’s jail is in the basement of
the building, but its cells are rarely used to hold any
criminals other than petty crooks or drunkards.

support of the Otari Garrison, the guards express a
strong need for equipment upkeep and maintenance; the
heroes can Earn Income using Crafting.
9. FARMER’S GUILD
This building and its nearby yards provide stables,
auction houses, livestock pens, butcher shops, and
a guildhall for the region’s farmers. Otari’s Farmer’s
Guild handles the distribution of goods from the
various nearby farms and ranches, ensuring that the
members are paid well for their toil while saving them
the trouble of having to spend too much time on
deliveries of goods in town. The guildhall maintains
a dozen rooms that are free of charge to visiting
farmers, but available for rent to others. The current
guildhead is a business-minded halﬂing woman named
Jala Highstepper who maintains a shrine to Erastil
in the side yard. She isn’t a cleric herself, and hopes
someday to convince a visiting priest of Erastil to settle
in Otari and take up the mantle of representing the
regional farmers, despite the fact that she has done an
admirable job of it herself so far.

Guild supports the heroes, they can work as inspectors
for incoming shipments. This allows the heroes to
Earn Income using Nature to successfully weed out
foodstuﬀs that are rotten, infested, or otherwise not ﬁt
for public consumption.
10. CROW’S CASKS
A sign over the door to this two-story stone building
depicts a group of drunk crows perched on a leaky
cask. Crow’s Casks is more than just a popular tavern
and brewery—it’s a shrine to Cayden Cailean. Its
proprietor, a tengu alchemist named Magiloy, gives the
establishment its name.
If Magiloy’s misspent youth aboard a half dozen
pirate ships in the Shackles gave her anything, it was
a fondness for unusual alcohol. Now well into her
twilight years, Magiloy likes tending bar and inventing
new drinks for locals and visitors to enjoy. The two
most popular drinks currently are a spiced pumpkin
rum and a sour blackberry ale. Of last month’s
somewhat disastrous attempt to brew a goblinpepper
stout, Magiloy prefers never to speak.
