was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the
resources she could to the seugathis. The seugathis
pursued not one research path but many, including
ﬂeshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in
magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad
experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with
useful monsters for her growing army. She passed
along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists
and mages who could duplicate the work.
When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the
seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their
objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil
named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed
that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom
the bone devil remained loyal even after
her death—meant taking a ﬁrmer hand in
overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried
to constrain and direct the seugathis’
sprawling research. Rather than comply
with these unwelcome demands, the
seugathis rebelled; Jafaki ambushed and
killed Tarkannah and seized control of the
laboratories level.
This assault started a brief war between the
devils and the seugathis. For months the two sides
fought, but Urevian soon discovered the seugathis
weren’t really interested in expanding their holdings,
only defending the territory they had. The two sides
settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of
the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian
is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to
pass through the prison, and the seugathis’ cast-off
creatures often ﬁnd their way into the devil’s gradually
increasing forces.
Jafaki has little concern for the army growing on
the level below. The seugathis don’t bother with the
imp and zebub spies that occasionally pass
through the laboratories, but Jafaki and
their colleagues can make marching
through with a large army costly or
even impossible. Jafaki plans to permit free
passage only in exchange for additional
concessions to bolster their ongoing
experiments, even though Urevian is
certain to balk at the cost.
Jafaki’s research has seemed to
drift over the years through various abhorrent
sciences: ﬂeshwarping, reanimation of the
dead, selective breeding, or even golem
creation. Yet they remain as focused on their
goal of creating the perfect soldier as they
were when they spoke to Belcorra all those
years ago.
That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good
soldiers? They’ve created those, and all have died by
the dozens or hundreds in the arena. Great soldiers?
Some of Jafaki’s ﬁnest works have been nearly
unstoppable. But “nearly” is not “perfect.” Jafaki will
pursue perfection for as long as it takes.
