their staggering numbers and tendency to swarm
around the heads of intruders. The bats sometimes
hunt in the Hunting Grounds, or in deeper Darklands
caverns, but are just as often food for larger creatures.
I43. SANCTUARY
A thick growth of fungus blocks this narrow cave entrance.
The harmless fungus can easily be pushed aside. It
conceals an out-of-the-way cavern with a small spring
of fresh water. This cavern makes a perfect place for the
heroes to rest, as wandering monsters ignore it.
I44. DIGGER’S CAVERN
SEVERE 9
A jumble of fungus grows in the center of this roughly
square cave. A large lizard’s corpse lies amid the fungus.
The giant frilled lizard barely escaped the roper
in area I45 but collapsed and died in this harmless
fungus patch.
Creatures: When the heroes examine the lizard or
the fungus, the entire cavern starts to shake as a shuln
chews its way through the north wall. The enormous,
rodent-like shuln scented the dead lizard and was
coming to eat it, but it’s more excited for living prey.
It’s hungry and ﬁghts until slain. It pursues foes that
run away but doesn’t like the water, so it gives up
chasing anyone that ﬂees into the lake.

I45. DEAD ROPER
A rocky depression at the south end of this chamber contains
a thick stalagmite toppled over in a pool of dark ichor.
Upon closer inspection, the stalagmite is a dead roper.
The shuln in area I44 burrowed up from beneath it and
bit off its lower third before deciding its taste was wholly
unpleasant and leaving the rest of the body behind. A
hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Nature or relevant Lore
check realizes that a Huge burrowing beast came up
beneath the roper and bit it, but the burrowing creature’s
tunnel has collapsed behind it and is now impassable.
I46. PUDDING WALLOW
A pool of thick black goo coats a large patch of the ﬂoor
in this cave.
A black pudding stripped most of the fungus in this
room clear before it was defeated by another predator.
Its gooey remains rest in a shallow pit.
I47. CORRUPTED GARDEN
LOW 9
An ancient and crumbling stone bridge stretches across
the water to an island teeming with reeking fungus.
The old stone bridge is still stable enough to traverse
safely, though it’s slick with slime and moist lichen that
make it difﬁcult terrain. The island used to be a tended
garden, but it’s now greater difﬁcult terrain thanks
to the dense, slick fungus. The slime growing on the
fungus emits a terrible smell, but one overwhelmed by
the stench of the island’s denizen.
Creatures: An ofalth dwells on the island. The fungus
and the layer of ﬁlth it grows from fuels the creature’s
Filth Wallow ability. It treats the slime-covered fungus
as difﬁcult terrain rather than greater difﬁcult terrain.

I48. HORRID CARNAGE
Bones and discarded viscera are strewn across this cavern
as if some horrifying battle recently occurred here. A trail
of the gruesome remains winds to the northeast, up a
narrow tunnel.
The carnage is the result of gogiteth feeding. The
gnashing, nightmarish aberration lairs in area I49, but
it sometimes lurks in the passageway to ambush prey.
When the heroes approach this area, make a secret
DC 15 ﬂat check. On a success, it’s watching from the
passageway and is prepared to strike.
I49. GOGITETH CAVE
SEVERE 9
If the heroes haven’t already defeated the gogiteth
lairing here, as they approach, they hear its clacking
and popping legs as it moves about. Any hero who
succeeds at a DC 30 Occultism check recognizes the
sound as that of a gogiteth.
Creatures: If the gogiteth is here, it’s tearing up an
urdefhan corpse. It drops the dead urdefhan with a
sickening plop to skitter forward and feast upon the
heroes. It doesn’t pursue prey out of areas I48 and I49.
