B30. WAR ROOM
SEVERE 2
This large, low-ceiling room has a cross-shaped table at its
center. Ten chairs stand around the table. The walls, ﬂoors,
and ceilings of the chamber are completely covered with
thick layers of webbing.
Belcorra once held meetings with her most valued
advisors, minions, and conjured allies in this room,
usually to plan out her never-realized but oft-imagined
assaults on Absalom. The table in the center displays
an illusory map of the city of Absalom as it appeared
hundreds of years ago, during Belcorra’s life, to aid
in her plans, but the spiderwebs in this room obscure
this illusion.
Creatures: Several years ago, a web lurker named
Mimnivix came to this room after entering the dungeon
from the swamp. He found the illusory city a delight and
fancied himself the “King of the Ghost City,” making
the room his lair. After being damaged by a trap in the
outer hall, Mimnivix has taken to clambering along the
upper reaches of the hall to avoid stepping in front of
the traps as he comes and goes on hunting trips, timing
them for the hours the river drake is out of her lair at
area B19.
When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, the web lurker is
squatting atop the table, delighting in yet another
examination of his web-caked city. He rises up to full
height upon spotting the heroes and, in Aklo, greets
them by commanding, “Bow down before the King
of the Ghost City and present your offerings!”
Mimnivix’s inﬂated ego leaves him expecting any
visitors to be potential supplicants bearing gifts,
and if the heroes don’t offer him gifts (of any
sort), he hisses in frustration and attacks. If the
heroes actually do so, Mimnivix is so startled by
his own authority that he’s momentarily silent. He
makes further demands of the heroes to give more
offerings, polish his claws, and so forth until he
tires of their obsequiousness and simply attacks
them. He calls his hidden dream spider minions
out to ambush the heroes and does his best to
lure the heroes into one of his two web traps.
Mimnivix ﬁghts to the death.

strange sense of aesthetics, like rusty arrowheads,
