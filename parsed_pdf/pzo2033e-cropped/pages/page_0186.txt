Necrotic Decay (divine, necromancy, negative) When
Khurfel dies, his invisible ﬂesh quickly rots away and
sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that ﬁlls a 10-foot
emanation around his body. The gas deals 10d6 negative
damage to creatures in this area as their ﬂesh too curdles
and rots (DC 28 basic Fortitude save).

Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ rhoka sword +24 (deadly 2d8, magical,
two-hand 2d10), Damage 2d8+11 slashing

Frenzied Attack ʚʖ Khurfel makes one rhoka sword
Strike and two jaws Strikes against one or two diﬀerent
creatures (splitting up the attacks any way he wishes).
His multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after
all three attacks.
Insightful Swing ʚʖ Khurfel makes a melee weapon Strike.
On this Strike, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the
attack roll and ignores any concealment the target has.
Wicked Bite Ȱɵ Requirements Khurfel damaged a
creature with a jaws Strike on his last action; Eﬀect
Khurfel maintains contact, turning the creature’s ﬂesh
translucent around the injury. Khurfel chooses one of
two options, each of which requires a DC 28 Fortitude
save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature
suﬀers both eﬀects, using the same save result for both.
•	 Drain Blood Khurfel drinks some of the creature’s
blood. On a failed save, the creature is drained 1 and
Khurfel regains 10 HP (or, on a critical failure, it’s
drained 2 and Khurfel regains 20 HP).
•	 Drain Vitality (necromancy) Khurfel draws out some
of the creature’s vital essence. The creature becomes
enfeebled 1 for 1 hour on a failed save (or enfeebled 2
for 1 hour on a critical failure).
Treasure: Inside Khurfel’s hovel are mounds of
tribute: 180 gp, 1,320 sp, ﬁve moonstones worth 10
gp each, and two chrysoberyls worth 20 gp each.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for recovering
the Emerald Fulcrum Lens.
