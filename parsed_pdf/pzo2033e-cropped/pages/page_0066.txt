C33. RESTRICTED COLLECTION
SEVERE 3
Rows of bookshelves run the length of this room, although in
places they’ve been damaged or tipped over. The books that
once sat on the ruined shelves appear to have been relocated
to other shelves. Several doors lead out from this room, but
the double door to the north is the most impressive: it’s
made of stone, carved with a strange feminine shape rising
from the ghost-laced mists of a cemetery of emptied graves.
The bulk of Belcorra’s most valuable tomes were
kept here, in a collection that was available to only
key scholars and very inﬂuential visitors. Much of
the damage done to this room is relatively recent, for
when the Ghost Queen morlocks emerged into this
room from the stairs to the east, they clashed violently
with the Cult of the Canker. Both sides suffered losses,
but the ghouls won the ﬁght and forced the surviving
morlocks to ﬂee west, eventually ﬁnding their way to
the Servants’ Quarters level upstairs.
The books here cover all the same subject matter
as those in area C11 but are much more useful and
better organized. Checks to Recall Knowledge about
the relevant topics here have a +2 item bonus instead.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 25 Religion check to
Recall Knowledge recognizes the scene on the north
door as the Outer God Nhimbaloth feeding on the
spirits of those who worship her.
The stairs beyond the east door descend to area D16.
Creatures: A single Canker cultist and four ghouls
are repairing the shelves as best they can—a task that
keeps suffering setbacks due to the decayed quality of
the ancient wood. They don’t immediately attack, but
instead adopt a defensive position around the north
door. The Canker cultist then addresses the heroes,
offering them the chance to have an audience with her
high priestess, Nhakazarin. Of course, this is a ruse—
she hopes to lead the heroes to her high priestess only
to betray them, and if her attempt to Lie to the heroes
fails (a likely outcome, given her mere +3 Deception
modiﬁer), she grows frustrated and orders an attack.
These ghouls all ﬁght until destroyed.

C34. TEMPLE OF THE CANKER
MODERATE 3
Soft light illuminates several display cases in this vast room.
Once used to display books, the cases stand smashed and
empty. Along the curved north wall stands a hideous, towering
ﬁgure of a woman. The form is composed of hundreds of
portions of stitched-together ﬂesh from a variety of diﬀerent
creatures and draped in tattered, ﬁlthy sheets. The stench of
rot from the statue ﬁlls even this large room.
Belcorra once displayed her most important and
valuable tomes here. A graveknight named Caliddo
Haruvex, one of Belcorra’s distant relatives and a loyal
guardian of her treasure vault far below, retrieved the
books and returned to the vault with them on Belcorra’s
orders. The magical light that once illuminated their
display cases remains, rendering this room well-lit.
The immense rotten construction to the north is an
incomplete shell akin to a ﬂesh golem. The Cult of the
Canker intends it to serve as a new body for Belcorra
once it’s ﬁnished. The rotting statue looks ominous but
is inanimate... for now.
The secret door to the west is particularly well
hidden; heroes Searching this area must succeed at a
DC 30 Perception check to ﬁnd it. None of the ghouls
know it’s here, and it’s unlikely that the heroes will
ﬁnd it at ﬁrst. Note, however, that the existence of this
secret door (as well as all other secret doors on the
upper three levels) is revealed in the blueprints found
in area D8.
Creatures: The high priestess of the Cult of the
Canker is a ghoul named Nhakazarin, a woman
who was cruel and sadistic even in life. Born with an
infestation of undeath in her soul, she served as one of
Belcorra’s many necromantic advisers. After her death,
she was the one who galvanized the other servants of
this level to prepare for Belcorra’s resurrection.
Nhakazarin spends her time working with bits
of ﬂesh harvested from morlocks, monsters, and
even other ghouls. She’s stitching this ﬂesh to her
masterpiece, a 15-foot-tall statue of Belcorra made
from decaying meat and stained bone.
Nhakazarin demands the heroes abandon their
gear and their lives, promising glory with the Canker
if they agree to accept ghoul fever and then be locked
away in the Author’s Hall (area C38) until they
transform. If the heroes refuse, Nhakazarin laughs
imperiously and attacks, using Intimidation for
initiative. As she ﬁghts, she promises the heroes that
they’ll join her cult, willingly or not. Once combat
begins, Nhakazarin prefers to ﬁght in a square
adjacent to her statue so she can use her Consume
Masterpiece ability if needed.
