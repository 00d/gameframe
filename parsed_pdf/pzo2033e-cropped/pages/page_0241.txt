Morlocks originate from humans long lost to the surface world. They have
an afﬁnity for machinery, scavenging, and strange occult behaviors.

The morlock scavenger is a lankier, smaller version of a typical morlock.

MORLOCK MACHINES
Morlock engineers are talented at
ﬁguring out ancient machinery or
damaged constructs, but don’t keep
notes or record their techniques. As
a result, a morlock enclave might
well be defended by strange, ancient
mechanical hazards or constructs
that treat morlocks as allies, even
though none of the morlocks can say
who built the machines they use.
