troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this
entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.
Urevian sees the heroes as an unexpected opportunity
and a potential solution. If the heroes slaughter their
way through Jafaki and the seugathis, then all the
better for the devil. Urevian has ordered his devils to
keep an eye out for the heroes, to kill all but one or
two, and then bring him the survivors for negotiations.
He plans to convince the remaining heroes to deliver
Carman Rajani to him. Otherwise, he’ll march his
army up through the dungeon and destroy Otari.
Urevian’s devils have had little contact with the
Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, even in less troubled
times. He receives food from the farm level below to
feed his mortal soldiers but cares little for the denizens
there or their machinations. Since Belcorra’s return,
Urevian has seen an increase in
urdefhans,
drow,
and
more
parading through the prison level, and
he has had enough. He recently blocked the stairs
leading down to the lower level with rubble (area G1)
and erected a magical barrier across the large elevator
opening (area G3). Urevian knows that his control
over these barriers probably gives him some leverage
with the heroes, too, which further beneﬁts him. He
needs them to be his hands on the surface.
Prison Features
Ceilings are 20 feet high throughout the prison, which
is illuminated by dim, red light from ﬂickering ﬂames
or glowing diabolic symbols. The doors are all stone
bound in iron, and many are locked. As a side effect
of pervasive, diabolic inﬂuence, all doors ﬂicker brieﬂy
with ﬁre around their edges when opened or closed,
making sneaking in the prison level difﬁcult. A hero
trained in Religion can utter a brief incantation
(which requires no action) when opening a door to
prevent this effect.
The map for this level appears on page 126.
G1. LOWER SHAFT
The spiral staircase bottoms at a circular
chamber’s red stone ﬂoor. Four wide
passages lead away in opposite directions,
three of them ending at a door. The west passage features
the most impressive of these doors, which are ﬁfteen
feet high and inscribed with a blazing pentagram. The
southwest stairway descends from this room and appears
choked with boulders, rubble, and dust.
