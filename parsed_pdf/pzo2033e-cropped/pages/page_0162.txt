clear, if overgrown, and the rest of the cavern is greater
difﬁcult terrain if it’s passable at all.
The gigantic iron ladder leads more than 100 feet
down to area I27.
Creatures: The massive patch of fungus closest to
the bridge has grown two deadly red puffballs. These
dragon’s blood puffballs resemble overgrown ﬂowers,
but they soon detach and ﬂoat toward the heroes to
attack with their fatal blooms. They follow ﬂeeing
heroes and ﬁght until destroyed in an explosive burst.

H35. WEBBED CROSSROADS
SEVERE 8
The towering fungi around these overgrown paths are
laced in thick webbing. Within are a few humanoid ﬁgures,
too shrouded in webs to see clearly.
The webbed corpses are a desiccated urdefhan and
two much-more-recently killed drow from Yldaris. It
takes half an hour to clear the thick webbing from
each corpse.
Creatures: The hungry goliath spider that has
made its web here isn’t on the ground, but hiding in
a crevasse in the ceiling 60 feet above, where it has
greater cover. The spider begins its assault with its
Descend on a Web ability to catch its prey off guard. If
reduced to fewer than 40 Hit Points, it retreats for the
safety of its ceiling crevasse high above.

Treasure: The urdefhan carries a jade bauble and
a standard-grade darkwood shield. One of the drow
corpses has a pouch with dust of disappearance.
H36. ROUNDED WALL
LOW 8
This patch of fungus sits lower than the rest, though it
bears no signs of cultivation. Amid the other fungi are
bulbous green growths. The back wall of the cavern is
visible through a cloud of drifting spores; it isn’t natural
rock, but a pale, curved, seamless stone.
The wall is part of the footprint of Gauntlight high
above and is thus impervious to damage. A secret door
in the curved wall provides access to the structure’s
interior (area H37); like the secret door in area H1, it’s
easy to ﬁnd (DC 15 Perception) but only opens when
a fulcrum lens is placed into its indentation.
 Creatures: The spores and green growths belong
to a drakauthix lairing here. It attacks any living
creatures that approach, ﬂoating upward to reveal
its hooked tentacles. If reduced to fewer than 20
Hit Points, it ascends to the ceiling and tries to ﬂoat
away to the south. If the heroes haven’t dealt with the
goliath spider lurking above area H35, the drakauthix
ﬂoats right beneath its crevasse. The spider darts out,
kills the drakauthix, and retreats into its bolt-hole.
This might alert the heroes that the spider is there!

H37. UPPER PIT
This large, circular room is made of pale stone and covered
with dust. At its center stands a single, stone-lipped pit.
A twisting ribbon of blue light coils and twists in the air,
extending from the ceiling down into the pit. The stone of
the ceiling and the walls of the pit undulate in the eerie
light as though the stone itself were suﬀering.
This pit leads down through Gauntlight’s lowest
levels. The ribbon of energy shows that Gauntlight is
drawing even more power, and the heroes might have
seen a ribbon like it in the dungeon’s higher levels. A
living creature ending its turn within the 5-foot-diameter
ribbon of light takes 10d6 negative damage (DC 26
basic Reﬂex save); unlike the ribbons discovered in the
upper levels, this energy doesn’t heal undead creatures.
The pit leads down over 100 feet to a similar
chamber on the Hunting Grounds (area I28) and then
another 100 feet to the Empty Vault (area J20), where
Belcorra typically dwells.
H38. STRANGE SENTRY
TRIVIAL 9
Toward the end of the fungal path, a masonry structure
juts out from the cavern wall, a door at its center.
The structure served as a waypoint where the
Children of Belcorra could converse with their Ghost
Queen through the wisps. They abandoned this
building when they left the eastern fungus garden.
Creatures: A sinister, sloth-like monster called a
nilith moved into the structure, but it left a guardian
outside: a feebleminded medusa it calls Murmur.
Murmur stands in front of the door, her hood up,
muttering unintelligible words to herself.
