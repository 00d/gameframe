Vaults
Rituals and Spells
The heroes may ﬁnd the following new ritual and spell
useful in the Abomination Vaults.
AWAKEN PORTAL
The Abomination Vaults are vast, and Belcorra
sometimes considered them too large to traverse by
normal means, particularly when she was in a hurry.
She therefore installed teleportation circles throughout
the Abomination Vaults, both for directed travel and
for more convenient general transport. Over time, the
magic of Belcorra’s teleportation circles has faded.
The awaken portal ritual is required to reactivate
them. Each linked teleportation circle must each be
individually reactivated with this ritual, before they can
be used, so the heroes must physically travel to each
side of a linked pair of portals to awaken
them. An exception is the network
of portal chambers throughout the
Abomination Vaults (areas B17, C16,
D5, E18, F13, G2, H33, I59, and J5); for
this network, the heroes can awaken the
portals as they ﬁnd them, but the awakened
portals only connect to others in the network
that the heroes have previously awakened.
This ritual is recorded in a folio in Belcorra’s
secure collection (area C35), but the mummy
ritualist Chafkhem (in area E18) knows it as well, so
the heroes might learn it from him.
AWAKEN PORTAL
RITUAL 3
RARE
CONJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Secondary Casters up to 5
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (trained); Secondary
Checks Arcana or Occultism (whichever is used for the
primary check)
Range 10 feet; Target 1 portal
You attempt to reactivate a dormant gate, portal, or
teleportation circle (Advanced Player’s Guide 244) by
infusing it with magical energies. This ritual must be
successfully performed twice, once at each location
the portal connects. While the teleportation circles and
portals found in the Abomination Vaults require no
additional cost to awaken, other portals might require
rare items or speciﬁc materials as a cost for this ritual
at the GM’s discretion—some portals might even be so
powerful that this ritual cannot awaken them at all.
The DC required to successfully awaken a portal varies
based on the strength and distance between its end
points. For the portals found in the Abomination Vaults
Adventure Path, the DC varies according to the
dungeon level on which it is located.
Use the DCs by Spell Level section
of Table 10–5 on page 503 of the Core Rulebook to
determine the DC for a portal, using the dungeon level in
place of spell level. Thus, activating the portal on the ﬁrst
level of the Abomination Vaults requires a successful DC
15 check, while activating the portal on the fourth level
requires a successful DC 23 check.
Critical Success You awaken the portal. If its other side is
awakened, the portal can be used normally and won’t
deactivate naturally. If its other side is not awakened,
this side remains awakened for 1 year, possibly
allowing you enough time to ﬁnd and awaken the
connecting portal.
Success As critical success, but if the portal’s other side is
not awakened, this side remains awakened for only 1d6
days before it fades and falls dormant again.
Failure You fail to activate the portal, and magical
backlash leaves you stupeﬁed 1 for 24 hours.
