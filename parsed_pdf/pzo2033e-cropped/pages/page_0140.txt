Adventure
Toolbox
Abomination
Vaults
Through infernal contracts, Cynemi learned
that a contract devil named Urevian had offered a
high bounty for a speciﬁc target.
Cynemi made her way here and
agreed to retrieve Carman
Rajani for a healthy sum.
However, Carman proved
too
cunning,
hustling
Cynemi out of her magic
armor and leaving her stranded
on a leaky boat on the Inner Sea.
By the time Cynemi swam back
to shore, the time she negotiated
with Urevian to catch Carman
had run out, so an erinys dragged
her back. She has been here since,
fed only irregularly and often
hung by her feet. She suspects
she has spent months or even
years imprisoned. Her manacles
open easily, but Cynemi can’t
reach them. If you need Cynemi’s
stats, use those of a bounty hunter
(Gamemastery
Guide
226),
except
Cynemi is neutral evil and has darkvision.
Side Quest: Cynemi requires urgent care, as she’s
on the verge of death from dehydration. A hero must
succeed at a DC 23 Medicine check while providing
water and food to Cynemi to save her; on a critical
failure, the bounty hunter dies. Even if saved, she stays
distant and suspicious; her starting attitude is unfriendly.
If the heroes can improve Cynemi’s attitude to at least
indifferent (usually, a hero must succeed at a DC 22
Diplomacy check to Make an Impression, although
you might allow other skills at this DC to get Cynemi
to open up), she shares her story. She emphasizes how
urgently Urevian wants to capture Carman Rajani, and
that the contract devil is willing to cut a deal for just
about anything to get him. Regardless of her attitude
toward the heroes, Cynemi wants the heroes to help
free her and to get far away from here.
Cynemi is a criminal wanted by Absalom authorities.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 23 Society check recalls
seeing a wanted poster for her (heroes from Absalom
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check). Of course,
Cynemi doesn’t volunteer this information.
Getting Cynemi out of the Abomination Vaults—
whether or not the heroes place her in their custody—
completes this side quest.
Treasure: If the heroes turn Cynemi over to the Otari
Garrison, they earn a 30 gp reward. If they have the
Otari Garrison’s support, Captain Longsaddle gives
them an additional 30 gp.
G15. BARRACKS
SEVERE 7
This old prison block has been converted into a makeshift
barracks with several shoddy cots pushed into the cells
and against the walls. The three cell doors have been
chained open. Foot lockers sit near each cot.
Creatures: When not drilling with the barbazu
or performing other menial tasks, the devils’
ﬂeshwarped soldiers relax here. They ﬁght to
the death.

The

almost nothing of value. Each
footlocker contains 3d6 sp.
G16. PRISON OFFICE
This old prison oﬃce is full of ﬁlth and cobwebs. A single
door exits to the north.
A hero can locate the secret door in this room
by succeeding at a DC 28 Perception check while
Searching. If the heroes clean the dust and cobwebs
from this room ﬁrst, this DC drops to 24. Tiny cracks
form the subtle shape of a manacle and chain on the
wall. The spaces between the chain links are buttons
that, when pressed, cause the secret door to slide open.
Beyond the secret door, a narrow hallway has several
peep holes ﬁlled with one-way transparent stone for
spying on prisoners, along with a door to area G21.
Characters can clearly see the secret doors leading out
of this hidden hall (to areas G16 and G18).
Ysondkhelir didn’t like the fact that a secret tunnel
led directly into his suite of rooms, so he installed a trap
to keep any nosy creatures away. He pressed Urevian
to help with the ruse, so the devil had the erinyes
start a rumor about the prison ofﬁce being haunted.
Virtually all other creatures on the prison level believe
this rumor, especially the ﬂeshwarps who bunk just
outside the room, which has given Ysondkhelir the
peace he desires.
Hazard: The magical trap in this room triggers
when anyone steps inside.
