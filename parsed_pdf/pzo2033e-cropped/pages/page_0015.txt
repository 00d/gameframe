quite a bit more harrowing than one might expect. A
taste tester can Earn Income using Fortitude saves, but
on a critical failure, something they’ve tasted
sits poorly, and the hero becomes stupeﬁed

11. CROOK’S NOOK
Any town with a successful economy
inevitably
generates
its
own
homegrown band of thieves and
scoundrels,
and
Otari
is
no
exception. Crook’s Nook serves
several purposes: it’s a public bridge
over the Osprey River, a tavern
known for serving the best seafood
in town, and a cheap place to
stay for the night. Its attic
serves as the guildhall for
Otari’s thieves’ guild, the
Osprey Club—a function
that’s perhaps the town’s
worst-kept secret, as evidenced by
the ediﬁce’s very name.
The owner of Crook’s Nook is a lanky
woman named Yinyasmera. While she has
never run for mayor, her inﬂuence in town remains
as strong as that of any publicly elected ofﬁcial.
Yinyasmera
keeps
her
illicit
operations
from
overly inconveniencing Otari’s citizens, so Captain
Longsaddle turns a blind eye.

Yinyasmera’s missing “employees” (see area A17’s Side
Quest on page 32), Crook’s Nook supports them as long
as they keep quiet about the Osprey Club. If Crook’s
Nook supports the heroes and they express interest
in illicit work, Yinyasmera suggests minor crimes
against visitors (pickpocketing, petty burglary, con
games, and the like). This allows the heroes to Earn
Income using Thievery, but on a critical failure, their
actions are spotted, and Yinyasmera cuts them oﬀ
from future jobs. Further legal woes might arise for the
heroes as well, at your discretion.
12. OTARI MARKET
One part open-air farmer’s market, one part log‑cabin
trading post, the Otari Market is a gathering place
for locals and a one-stop shop for all manner of
general goods. Tended by a dour, humorless man
named Keeleno Lathenar, Otari Market is open every
day from dawn to dusk, with one exception:
Keeleno closes the market down on every
Gozran 5th in honor of his dear departed
wife, Ayla, who was mauled to death 30
years ago. The killer turned out to be
a werewolf druid named Jaul Mezmin,
whom Keeleno believes remains at large
to this day. Keeleno remains bitter and
fearful toward druids, particularly those
who worship at Stone Ring Pond.

The Otari Market won’t support the
heroes if any of them are known to be
(or profess to be) druids. The Otari Market
otherwise automatically supports heroes who
return Ayla’s necklace to Keeleno along with evidence of
Jaul’s death (see area D14’s Side Quest on page 79). If the
Otari Market supports the heroes, they can stand guard
over the market and Earn Income using Intimidation. At
your discretion, a minor encounter with a cutpurse or
other petty crook might take place during a work shift.
13. OTARI FISHERY
Tamily Tanderveil turned her back on what could’ve
been a lucrative position as a captain among the
Gray Corsairs to retire to a safer job here in Otari—
the loss of a leg during a raid on a pirate ship having
convinced her that serving as a harbor warden would
be a wiser decision for her longevity. The jolly and
irreverent Tamily maintains a growing collection of
peg legs for various occasions that she regularly swaps
out. Every night, from an hour before sundown to
an hour before midnight, Tamily opens the ﬁshery’s
ground ﬂoor to sailors, laborers, and travelers for
games, snacks, and entertainment.
