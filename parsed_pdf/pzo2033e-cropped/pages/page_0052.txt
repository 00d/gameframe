shiny rocks, bits of glass worn smooth by the surf,
or neat seashells. Among the clutter is a mesmerizing
opal, ﬁve shining sling bullets, and a type I necklace
of ﬁreballs. The cache is visible to anyone who looks
under the table, as the magic sling bullets glow faintly
through the webbing holding them in place.
B31. RECEPTION ROOM
LOW 2
A ruined table and several destroyed chairs lie in a heap
in the middle of this room, along with several large bones.
If the heroes are following the ghostly trail left by
Otari from area B28, they’ll see this trail dance and
ﬂicker around the center of the room where a minotaur’s
skeleton is entangled with the ruined furniture. Otari
encountered the guardian here and killed it before
moving on. Unfortunately, the necromantic inﬂuence of
Gauntlight has animated these remains.
Creatures: As the heroes enter the room, the bones
shudder and pull together. This takes 1 round, so
swift characters can exit the room before the bones
assemble, at which time they fall back into place. If the
minotaur skeleton completely rebuilds itself, it pulls
its rusty glaive from the wreckage and ﬁghts until
destroyed—but it doesn’t pursue foes from this room.
SKELETAL GIANT
CREATURE 3
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 299
Initiative Perception +7
B32. SECRET STAIRS
The heroes can spot the secret door at the top of
these stairs with a successful DC 18 Perception check.
The secret door opens when the rise on the top step
is pushed a certain way. The stairs beyond the secret
door lead down to area C10.
B33. PUNISHMENT ROOM
Broken-down torture instruments lie in half-collapsed
heaps on the ﬂoor here. To the north slumps a ruined
stretching rack, while to the south a pillory lies fallen on
the ﬂoor. Rusty tongs and chains, frayed and rotten whips,
and other implements lie on tottering shelves.
Belcorra used this room to punish insolent servants
or when she was bored and needed something to
distract her. Little of use remains here, but a hero
Searching this room who succeeds at a DC 18
Perception check ﬁnds the secret door to the south,
which opens when a rusted ring on the wall is pulled
down sharply.
B34. ELEVATOR DOWN
A hero Searching this dead end spots the secret door
with a successful DC 18 Perception check. Two wall
stones, pushed in unison, cause it to swing open.
This plain, circular room is empty. A single image of a
moss-caked skull adorns the eastern wall.
The ﬂoor of this room is a magical elevator that
links to area C22 below. If a creature touches the image
of the mossy skull—Nhimbaloth’s symbol—while the
secret door is closed, the ﬂoor slowly descends 30 feet
with a grinding noise. Doors slide up into view to the
north and south.
If the secret door is opened while the elevator is in
area C22, this room is a 30-foot-deep pit.
B35. GAUNTLIGHT BASEMENT
If the heroes manage to enter this room before Gauntlight
activates at the beginning of this chapter, then the artifact
is already empowered; no ribbon of ghostly energy is
currently present, and you should amend the following
read-aloud text accordingly. After Gauntlight activates, it
needs to recharge, so the ribbon of energy returns.
The walls of this circular room are smooth and gray. A ribbon
of pale blue light coils and slithers through the air, connecting
the ﬂoor at the center of the room to the ceiling ﬁfteen feet
above. The points where this light touches the stone above
and below seethe and writhe, as if the stone itself were
suﬀering from an infection. The desiccated remains of an
enormous worm lie slumped around the ribbon, forming a
crescent of shriveled and tattered purple ﬂesh.
One of Belcorra’s favorite pets dwelt in this room, a
purple worm she transported into the chamber from the
Darklands. For all the creature’s bestial power, it was
entirely dependent on Belcorra for sustenance, as the
keep’s walls are indestructible. After Belcorra’s death,
the worm starved to death.
The ribbon of ghostly light is a manifestation of
Gauntlight’s mounting power. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn within it takes 2d6
negative damage (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save), and
undead creatures regain HP of the same amount.
As long as Gauntlight remains at its low-level
activation, the light keeps churning, but if the heroes
rescue Lasda Venkervale from area D9, it winks out.
Treasure: A hero who digs into the dried worm’s
carcass ﬁnds the remains of its last meal: a duergar
skeleton still clutching a +1 warhammer that didn’t
help him cut his way out of the worm’s gut.
