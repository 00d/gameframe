E4. SURGICAL SUITE
MODERATE 5
Lanterns hanging from the ceiling shine bright circles of
light over three stone tables topped with metal slabs. A
single lightweight chain dangles near each table. The
remnants of a dead morlock lies on one slab. Dried splatters
of blood cover the walls, ﬂoor, and ceiling.
The three lights in this room are magical; they
illuminate the tables with bright light but provide only
dim light to the rest of the room. The metal slabs at
the top of each table have hinges on the sides. A tug
on the hanging pull-chain causes the table’s hinged
slabs to fold down then back up, dumping anything
on the table into a 40-foot-deep shaft to area F6. The
slabs easily fold down from the underside, so anyone
climbing up one of the shafts can open the slab and get
out. The Athletics DC to Climb the pits is 20.
Jafaki previously used this chamber for ﬂeshwarping
trials, dumping failed experiments and waste from his
surgeries into the pits for the oozes below to devour.
He eventually deemed this location too inconvenient
and virtually never uses it anymore.
Creature: The last time Jafaki came here, he
abandoned a morlock whose arms and legs he had
amputated (and disposed of). The creature died in
agony and its spirit arose as a specter. The specter wants
only to inﬂict its interminable agony upon others, and
it still harbors a visceral fear of the operating tables.
The bright lights shining on the tables activate its
sunlight powerlessness.

E5. MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Shelves of dusty bottles and surgical equipment line
the walls in this room. Cobwebs and dust hint that this
chamber has remained untouched for quite some time. At
the center of the room stands a solitary pushcart.
Jafaki kept spare parts, alchemical reagents, and
tools organized in this room. He hasn’t visited this
room in decades, so many reagents have spoiled.
On a successful DC 15 Perception check, a hero
Searching this room locates an unusual key that fell
behind one of the shelves. The key has a round shaft
tipped with several teeth of varying length; it opens
one of the locks in the plinth room (area F7).
Treasure: The shelves contain two sets of healer’s
tools, a set of expanded healer’s tools, and alchemical
reagents worth 10 gp.
E6. HALLWAY
A steep staircase descends underneath a footbridge,
which crosses this hall at 20 feet above the ground.
From this side, the double door to the south is
barricaded with several bars of twisted metal scrap and
a sturdy wooden shelf. The footbridge’s wrought iron
railing prevents anyone on it from easily falling off.
With a successful DC 20 Athletics check, a character
can climb up onto (or down from) the footbridge.
E7. SECURITY CHECKPOINT
MODERATE 5
The heroes might have some difﬁculty reaching this area
from the east since a closed portcullis ﬂanked by arrow
slits blocks the hall, but a character can lift this portcullis
with a successful DC 30 Athletics check. Some of the
bars near the north arrow slit have partially melted and
twisted, perhaps caused by powerful acid. A Small or
smaller creature who’s trained in Acrobatics can Squeeze
through the opening with a successful DC 18 Acrobatics
check, but the opening is too small for larger creatures.
This central octagonal room is ﬂanked on the north and
south by single iron doors, each with a narrow viewing port
and archery slit. The stone double door to the east features
an emblazoned carving of a dripping skull, its mouth
stuﬀed with weeds. The western double door is made of
iron pitted with rust.
This area acted as a gateway for Belcorra’s scouts to
go out into the world and as an egress point for her
army of well-trained champions. The double door to
the east leads to a passage that ends at a cave-in behind
the well-hidden secret door in Smuggler’s Refuge. The
cave-in and secret door are obvious from this side.
Clearing the cave-in requires 40 hours of manual labor,
but the heroes can divide up this task (four characters
can clear it in 10 hours, for example).
The two guard chambers (areas E7a and E7c) and
archer stations (areas E7b and E7d) were looted
centuries ago but still bear empty weapon racks.
The east wall in area E7b has a lever that raises and
lowers the portcullis. Although rusty, it still works.
Any creature squeezing past the gap in the portcullis
can see the lever in the archer station.
