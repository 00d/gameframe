Malevolent Possession ʚʖ (divine, incapacitation, mental,
necromancy, possession) Jarelle attempts to possess an
adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same eﬀect as
the possession spell (with a spell DC of 22), except since
Jarelle doesn’t have a physical body, she’s unaﬀected by
that restriction of the spell.
Poisoned Breath ʚʖ (divine, necromancy, poison) Jarelle
exhales a 15-foot cone of toxic mist that deals 5d6
poison damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save; on a critical
failure, the target is also enfeebled 1 for 24 hours). She
then can’t use Poisoned Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
XP Award: If the heroes put Jarelle’s spirit to rest
without ﬁghting her, award them XP as if they’d
defeated her in combat.
Treasure: A search of Jarelle’s remains turns up the
key to the door to area C11, a gold paperweight worth
10 gp, and a crafter’s eyepiece.
C14. LIBRARIAN’S BEDROOM
A small, cramped bed is wedged awkwardly into this room,
as the walls are lined with sagging bookshelves.
Jarelle once lived here before she took her life in
area C13. The books she kept here were mostly
duplicates of others found elsewhere in the library, but
she viewed them as her private collection.
Treasure: There are 2 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint.
C15. GAUNTLIGHT READING ROOM
MODERATE 3
This chamber’s smooth stone walls glisten with moisture
despite the air being dry and somewhat stuﬀy. Several low
divans are arranged in a circle and interspersed with low
tables stacked with a few books and rotting morsels of
decayed ﬂesh. A twisting ribbon of pale blue light stretches
between the bare ﬂoor at the room’s center and the ceiling
above, its points of contact sending creepers of what looks
like infected tissue out in a distorted spiral for a few feet.
As in area B35, the ribbon of sickly light is a
manifestation of Gauntlight’s growing power. This
room once served as a reading room for library
staff, as well as a place where they could directly
evaluate Gauntlight’s energies. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn in it takes 4d6 negative
damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save), and undead
creatures regain the same amount in Hit Points. As
long as Gauntlight remains at its low-level activation,
the ribbon of light continues to churn, but if the heroes
rescue Lasda Venkervale from his captivity area D9,
the ribbon winks out.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check
while Searching this room spots the secret door to area
C16 in the curved western wall.
Creatures: Today, Cult of the Canker ghouls relax
here with books and snacks. Ripened morlock ﬂesh has
been a staple of their diets lately, but the ghouls and the
cultist who commands them decide to add adventurer
ﬂesh to the menu once they spot the heroes. As they ﬁght,
any ghoul brought below half its Hit Points moves into
the ribbon of light to gain some necromantic healing,
Shoving a rival ghoul out of the way if necessary.
