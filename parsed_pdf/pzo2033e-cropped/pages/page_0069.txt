Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) To put Chandriu to rest
permanently, a hero must convince her to stop pining
over Volluk with a successful DC 21 Diplomacy check.
Regardless of the result of this check, Chandriu ﬂies
into a rage and attacks, but if the Diplomacy check is
successful, she’s slowed 1 for 10 rounds while she ﬁghts.
If defeated while she’s slowed, she’s put to rest.
Speed ﬂy 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ghostly hand +16 (agile, ﬁnesse, magical),
Damage 3d8+4 negative
Despairing Cry
ʚʖ
(auditory,
divine,
emotion,
enchantment, mental) Chandriu wails in despair at her
loss and betrayal, forcing each living creature within
30 feet to attempt a DC 24 Will save. On a failure, a
creature becomes slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical
failure) for 1 round as it’s overcome with sadness over
its own missed opportunities. On a success, a creature
is temporarily immune to Chandriu’s Despairing Cry for
1 minute.
Treasure: There are 1 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint. In addition to these books, the three
mentioned in the note in area B3 (What The Worm
Knows, Grave Feasts, and Secrets of the Skull) are
located here as well. Morlibint has no interest in
these three grim treatises on necromancy, but they
can be sold for 8 gp each to someone other than
Morlibint (Yanyismera, for example, might be
able to procure a buyer).
A search of Chandriu’s remains reveals
that her +1 chain shirt is in good condition.
The object she clutches is a framed portrait of
Volluk Azrinae. The portrait captures the drow’s
beauty as well as his imperious, vain smirk, both
qualities Chandriu adored. His name appears
on a tiny gold plaque at the portrait’s base. The
work of art has endured the passage of time quite
well and is worth 10 gp, but it might be more
immediately valuable to the heroes as a way to
ﬁght against Volluk (area D8).
In addition to the obvious armor and portrait,
a hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check
while Searching Chandriu’s remains spots a tiny iron
key concealed beneath them; this key unlocks the
cabinet in area C37.
