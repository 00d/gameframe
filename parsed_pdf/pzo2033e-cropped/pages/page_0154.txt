Distracting Whispers: Creatures in the cavern are
immune to emotion effects, but spending time amid the
whispers affects the mind. Every minute, creatures in
the cave must attempt a DC 24 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure) for
24 hours. This condition is cumulative, up to
stupeﬁed 4. The whispers speak a different truth
each time a creature here increases its stupeﬁed
condition, as follows.
Stupeﬁed 1: “The lenses. She knows the
secrets of the lenses. Three are within reach, one
very close. The other lost by Yldaris. One held by
the blood eaters.”
Stupeﬁed 2: “She keeps them apart while she works
her petty vengeance, but the essences shall become one.”
Stupeﬁed 3: “Find the lenses and place their essences
together within a host.”
Stupeﬁed 4: “Join the essences within Haruvex,
and she can fall again. This is a promise of the Empty
Death, a promise of empty death.”
The cavern affects aberrations and sorcerers with
the aberrant bloodline differently; they don’t gain the
stupeﬁed condition but are fascinated while within the
cavern. This fascination ends as soon as they leave. If
such creatures stay here too long, they involuntarily
babble strange truths that echo in the whispers, which
is how Urthagul obtained his reputation as a mystic
among the calignis.
Creatures: On the northernmost island, amid a
nest of glowing toadstools, lurks the gug Urthagul.
He sits hunched, purring and stroking the Crimson
Fulcrum Lens in one of his four hands. Urthagul has
been here for decades, or perhaps longer. While
a formidable creature, his fascination with the
whispers and the Crimson Fulcrum Lens have
taken a toll. He rarely eats, and does so even
less now that the caligni cultists don’t visit him.
His glowing treasure commands nearly all of
his attention.
When the heroes enter, Urthagul takes no more notice
other than a glance in their direction. The heroes can
even explore or pass through the cave without rousing
Urthagul; if they speak to him, he doesn’t respond other
than to shift his treasure to the hand farthest from
anyone who might try to take it.
If the heroes use force against Urthagul or try to
take the Crimson Fulcrum Lens, he attacks with
relentless brutality. In combat, he prefers to use his
jaws, supplemented with the powers of the lens. When
Urthagul uses his Furious Claws ability, he can only
make three attacks instead of four, as he doesn’t let go
of the lens. Urthagul ﬁghts to the death to protect his
treasure, but he doesn’t leave this cavern.
