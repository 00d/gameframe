SHUFFLING SCYTHE BLADES
HAZARD 8
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC +18 (expert)
Description Six long blades, hidden in grooves in the walls
and ﬂoor, zigzag through diﬀerent parts of this hallway
when any pressure plate in the hallway intersection is
depressed; there are so many plates it’s impossible to avoid
them when moving through the room. The blades retreat
into the ﬂoor and move through the hidden grooves before
swinging out from the wall again in a diﬀerent location.
Disable DC 26 Thievery (expert) to disable each blade, or
utter the magical passphrase (which only Chafkhem
knows) to deactivate the trap for 10 minutes
AC 27; Fort +19, Ref +13
Scythe Blade Hardness 16, Scythe Blade HP 30 (BT 15);
Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Dicing Scythes Ǻȓ Trigger A creature steps in the 15-foot-
by-25-foot area where the branching hallways connect;
Eﬀect The trap uses Scythe Shuﬄe; each blade makes a
scythe Strike against each creature in its region, then it
uses Scythe Shuﬄe again. The trap then rolls for initiative.
Scythe Shuﬄe Ȱɵ The blades travel erratically throughout
the hallway’s branches, out of sight under the ﬂoors or
behind the walls. For each blade, roll 1d4 to determine the
region in which it next makes scythe Strikes. A creature
can Seek (DC 22) to learn clues about blades in the region
they’re currently occupying. On a success, the creature
knows how many blades are currently in its region.
1. Main intersection (the 15-foot-by-25-foot area where
the hallways connect, as marked on area E20)
2. North branch (from the main intersection to the secret
door to area E14)
3. Central hall (from the main intersection to the secret
door to area E24)
4. South branch (from the main intersection to the wall
shared with area E25)
Routine (7 actions) The trap spends 1 action for each of
its blades; a blade makes a scythe Strike against each
creature in its region. With its ﬁnal action, the trap uses
Scythe Shuﬄe. Reduce the number of actions the trap
can take by 1 for each destroyed blade.
Melee Ȱɵ scythe +20 (deadly 1d12), Damage 1d12+8
slashing; no multiple attack penalty
Reset The trap resets when no creatures remain in area
E20. Damaged or destroyed blades aren’t repaired when
the trap resets.
E21. STAGING AREA
Large, dark discolored patches of dried ﬂuids adorn the ﬂoor
of this oddly shaped chamber. A stone desk stands against
the west wall and holds tools, bottles, and jars of a variety
of substances.
Here, Belcorra’s agents kept notes about the
gladiators they spied upon. Recently, Jafaki’s
minions have spent time and resources trying to
disable the scythe trap in the hallway to the north,
and they stage their attempts here. Parchment
marked with tick marks indicates how the blades
shufﬂe around the hallway when triggered. The
seugathis have sought a pattern in the randomness
without any luck.
The doorway to the southeast opens to a cramped
and steep staircase, which leads down to the
observation gallery (area F8).
Treasure:
The
heroes
can
ﬁnd
expanded
alchemist’s tools and three moderate tanglefoot
bags on the table.
E22. SLUDGE-FILLED ROOM
MODERATE 5
Several feet of thick, black sludge ﬁll this room. The
sludge is a creature, but that’s not obvious upon a
casual look (such as viewing the room through the
one-way stone in area E20). Several weeks ago, Jafaki
caught one of Urevian’s devils poking around, lured
them into this chamber, and sent in an alchemically
modiﬁed black pudding. The ooze killed the devil and
dissolved them completely.
Creature: If disturbed, the black pudding rouses
from its torpor to feed, pursuing prey relentlessly.
VISCOUS BLACK PUDDING
CREATURE 7
Variant black pudding (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 255)
Initiative Perception +9
Adjust Shape Ȳ˓ A viscous black pudding is thicker than
most black puddings and can heap its body upon itself
or spread itself out again. The pudding changes its size
to Medium, Large, or Huge. If the pudding is Medium,
its density reduces its Speeds to 10 feet, but this ability
doesn’t otherwise change its Strikes or its Speed. If the
viscous black pudding Splits, both of the new puddings
have the same size as it had at that time, until they
Adjust their Shape.
E23. EMPTY GLADIATORS’ QUARTERS
These chambers include nothing more than a single
bed, an empty footlocker, and a metal chamber pot.
Anything of value was stripped long ago, and each
room has signs of being used as a prison.
A metal bolt was once mounted on each door’s
interior side for privacy, but some time ago, each
of the bolts was relocated to the exterior to keep
creatures trapped inside. This remounting has
somewhat loosened the bolts, however, and a
character who succeeds at a DC 20 Thievery check
can open a bolted door from the inside.
