H18. ROPER PEN
MODERATE 8
The entrance to this cave is blocked by a makeshift
barricade of wood and iron straps. Its door is barred
from the outside, and the bar has the words, “Danger!
Do not open!” written on it in Gnomish.
The Children of Belcorra keep their largest and most
dangerous monsters here. The barricade has obviously
been broken and rebuilt many times, but it’s sturdy
enough to keep its current prisoner contained.
Creatures: The cave contains a single roper. The
Children who discovered the creature took great care
to capture it and move it here. They have no idea how
to control the aberration, but they’re sure that Belcorra
will want it for her army. The roper waits in the back of
the cave, disguised as a nondescript stalactite. If given
the chance (such as if the heroes open the door and then
leave), it creeps out of the cave so it can’t be imprisoned
again. Otherwise, it waits for creatures to step further
inside before striking, and it ﬁghts until destroyed.

H19. GAME ROOM
MODERATE 8
Four small reclining couches circle a small table toward the
corner of this L-shaped room. On the table is an elongated
game board split into rows of squares. Various pieces sit in
place on the board, and pyramid-shaped dice are scattered
about the surface.
Some Children of Belcorra retreated from their
duties after long years and spend their time gambling
on a deep gnome board game called “The Dark Chase.”
Their set is missing several pieces (although it has all
six required four-sided dice), but the incompleteness
holds a peculiar attraction to the Children: the missing
pieces mean there’s no end state, so the game is never
over. The wagers around the board are all colored
pebbles that are pretty but not particularly valuable.
A simple iron key to area H20 is among the pebbles.
Creatures: The three Children here ﬁght intruders,
but they avoid disturbing the game in progress. If a
hero damages the game (such as by moving across the
square containing the low table or by damaging the
square with a splash or area effect), the mummies focus
their rage upon that hero. They ﬁght until destroyed.
