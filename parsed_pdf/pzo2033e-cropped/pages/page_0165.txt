Creatures: The Child of Belcorra realizes that the
heroes aren’t with the drow and asks for release. She
makes only vague promises about what she can do for
the heroes if released because she’s lying; as soon as
they let her go, she ﬂees to warn the other Children of
Belcorra that the drow have made signiﬁcant inroads
to the fungus forest (although the listless mummies
aren’t likely to act on this information anytime soon).
The prisoner knows the denizens and layout of areas
H15 to H25 and that there’s a froghemoth in area H27.

H44. OBSERVATION POST
TRIVIAL 8
This small room appears to be a lookout post. Three narrow
slits line the north and east walls, giving a view of the
overgrown fungus garden beyond.
The Children of Belcorra observed their cultivated
and thriving gardens from here, but the post had been
abandoned for some time before the drow of Yldaris
discovered it.
Creatures: A drow shootist named Iribo serves as a
lookout in this room. She investigates any indication
of intruders, such as her pet spider’s shrill whistle.
In a ﬁght, Iribo attempts to quickly incapacitate her
foes with her poison and calls for the drow in area
H45. However, she doesn’t foolishly throw herself into
combat; if she thinks it’s possible to negotiate with the
heroes, she does so.
A longtime friend of Yldaris’s leader, Quara, Iribo
knows that Quara might have some use for surface
dwellers. The heroes can attempt to improve her
starting attitude of indifferent just as they can with the
hunters in area H41. If they improve her attitude to
friendly, she personally escorts them to Yldaris.

XP Award: Award the heroes 80 XP if they talk to
Iribo rather than ﬁght her. Award them an additional
80 XP if they successfully negotiate Iribo’s escort into
Yldaris, but don’t award this additional XP if the
heroes have already arranged an escort from the drow
in area H41.
H45. PLANNING ROOM
MODERATE 8
This large room might have once been richly appointed, but
it’s now full of mold and decay. Shattered furniture covers
the ﬂoor, and tattered, mildew-specked tapestries hang
from the walls. At the north, curtains obscure a wide bay
window made of what looks like transparent stone.
The elder Children of Belcorra used to plan their
lush gardens from this room, but it’s now the
staging area for the small drow contingent.
The curved, ﬂoor-to-ceiling bay window provides a
