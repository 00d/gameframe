Battle Lute: This reinforced lute is suitable both for
use as a handheld musical instrument and for bashing
heads should a crowd turn sour. Its strings are ﬁnely
braided wires that run along its sturdy metal neck.
Repeating Hand Crossbow:
This
weapon
features
an
ingeniously
designed
catch
mechanism at the top of the
ﬂight grove, just in front of the
latch, which automatically loads a
bolt from a magazine and resets the
string each time the weapon is ﬁred.
A typical repeating hand crossbow
magazine holds ﬁve bolts.
Rhoka Sword: These dual‑bladed
swords are commonly used by urdefhan
warriors.
Shauth Blade: These strange curved blades are
jagged and deadly weapons made from the alchemically
strengthened teeth of dead urdefhans. Each weapon
is typically named for the urdefhan whose teeth were
forged into the weapon, which are often carried (and
revered) by that urdefhan’s descendants. Magical
shauth blades allow an urdefhan wielder to channel
their Wicked Bite ability through shauth blade Strikes.
Shauth Lash: This metal chain bears hook-like
barbs made of alchemically strengthened urdefhan
teeth. Magical shauth lashes have the same ability to
channel an urdefhan wielder’s Wicked Bite as magical
shauth blades, and urdefhans hold these weapons
with the same reverence as they do shauth blades.
Tamchal Chakram: These circular weapons are
among the many strange weapons used by urdefhans.
The sharp metal circle contains numerous protruding
blades, while an angled central handle provides a
decent grip that spins the weapon as it’s thrown.
WEAPON TRAITS
Repeating hand crossbows have the following new
weapon trait.
Repeating: A repeating weapon is typically a
type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time.
These weapons can’t be loaded with individual
bolts like other crossbows; instead,
they require a magazine of
specialized ammunition to be
loaded into a special slot. Once
that magazine is in place, the
ammunition is automatically loaded
each time the weapon is cocked to ﬁre,
reducing its reload to the value in its
reload entry (typically 0). When the
ammunition runs out, a new magazine
must be loaded, which requires a free hand
and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine,
retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in
place). These actions don’t need to be consecutive.
