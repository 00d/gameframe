a cage requires a successful DC 40 Athletics check. The
cages have wide enough gaps that a Medium creature
can Squeeze through the bars with a successful DC 25
Acrobatics check. Small or smaller creatures don’t need
to Squeeze and can simply move through the bars as
greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: The three unmarked cages are empty and
open. A “c” indicates a cage with a chuul, a “k” indicates
a cage with a krooth, and an “s” indicates a cage with a
skeletal hulk that was once a Large reptilian humanoid.
The creatures are furious at their imprisonment and, if
freed, simply attack anyone nearby and ﬂee if reduced
to half their Hit Points. The heroes might be able to
negotiate with the chuul, although it only speaks Aklo
and Undercommon. The chuul insists it will simply
swim away and not trouble the heroes again if freed;
if the heroes seem to need further enticement, the chuul
offers to reveal the location of several chuul eggs (area
H15). It goes back on its word only if the heroes seem
particularly vulnerable.

H17. DOCK AND LIFT
LOW 8
This large, T-shaped dock has four old skiffs moored to
it. On the land side, the docks open up to a large wood
and iron platform; at each corner, an iron chain climbs
upward into darkness. At the south end of this platform
sits a large pulley device. Its chains and machinery,
as well as the chains on the platform, are crusted
with rust.
This is the launch point for the Children of
Belcorra’s increasingly rare lake excursions.
The platform is a lift that connects to area G3
100 feet above. The big lift once brought food
and supplies from the Farm level to the
upper levels of the Vaults. While the rusted
machinery can still be coaxed to work, it’s
slow and often stalls. It’s controlled by
four levers situated in a mechanism on
the platform. The controls are unintuitive;
each lever controls a chain pulley on a corner, but
each lever pulls at a different rate. It takes 1d4 hours
of tinkering to ﬁgure out exactly how to control the
lift, and such trial and error might ruin the entire
mechanism (roll a DC 11 ﬂat check; on a failure, the
mechanism is permanently destroyed). A hero who
succeeds at a DC 24 Crafting check to Repair the
mechanism reduces the DC of this ﬂat check to 5 (or
to 1 on a critical success). The lift is marked by a
white square on the map.
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra are repairing a
skiff here. When they spot intruders, three rush to ﬁght
while the fourth ﬂees to area H19 for aid. Although
there are several caged creatures nearby, the Children
don’t release them because it was such trouble to
capture them in the ﬁrst place. Instead, if in genuinely
desperate straits, the undead either ﬂee to area H19 or
launch a skiff to get aid from area H21.
