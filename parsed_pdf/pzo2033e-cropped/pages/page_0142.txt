the hag alive and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to
saving throws against the witchﬁre’s spells and abilities
for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to that pillar can also
just make out the objects inside it (see Treasure below).
The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.
The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest,
looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top
and ﬂoor are both illusions. An open area below the
chamber’s “ﬂoor” leads to a 5-foot-wide crawl space to
the open trapdoor in area G21. The wisp in area G21
comes and goes this way while invisible.
Creature: The witchﬁre still guards this room.
Three rounds after anyone enters, she materializes and
attacks. Creatures who must pass through this room
regularly, such as the denizen of Leng Ysondkhelir or
the zebubs who report to him, do so quickly.
Urevian has tried to make deals with the witchﬁre
time and again, but the witchﬁre simply won’t listen
to him. He knows the creatures in stasis are valuable
to his invasion plans, so he has postponed his invasion
until he ﬁgures out how to reliably free them.
WITCHFIRE WARDEN
CREATURE 9
Witchﬁre (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 293)
Initiative Perception +18
Rejuvenation (divine, necromancy) When the witchﬁre
warden is destroyed, and as long as any creatures
remain in stasis in this room, she reforms in 1d4 days at
the soot-blackened pillar, fully healed.
Treasure: The soot-blackened pillar still contains a
few items left behind when the hag died: type I bracers
of armor and a type II bag of holding containing a
dozen cheap, broken clocks.
G18. WAR ROOM
MODERATE 7
This small chamber features a large map of the Inner Sea
painted on the north wall, though the listed countries seem
long out of date. A large cushion rests in the room’s southwest
corner. On the west wall, overlapping scraps of paper create a
much newer map of the town of Otari and the area around it.
This chamber has seen little use as a war room and
has been repurposed for its current inhabitant’s personal
agenda, as evidenced by the out-of-date maps on the
north wall, but the much more focused and updated
map of Otari on the west wall.
The paper maps conceal a secret doorway to a hall
that connects to areas G16 and G21. A hero Searching
this room locates the secret door with a successful DC
28 Perception check. If the heroes remove the papers,
this DC drops to 24. This secret door opens the same
way as the one in area G16. The secret doors leading
out of the hidden hallway (to areas G16 and G18) are
obvious from within it.
Creatures: Belcorra appointed the ageless and
mysterious denizen of Leng named Ysondkhelir as
her chief strategist. After Belcorra died, Ysondkhelir
lost interest in planning troop movements, though he
convinced Urevian that he was still doing so and that
he would have plans ready by the time the devil chose
to march on the surface. Ysondkhelir insisted that
Urevian’s zebubs keep scouting the surface and report
back to him, which has allowed the denizen to make
the exceptionally detailed map found here.
Instead of planning troop movements, Ysondkhelir
seeks powerful latent psychics whom he can torment
and, by means of eldritch invocations, send physically
into the Dimension of Dreams so that other denizens
of Leng can make use of them. He has had little
success in the last ﬁve centuries—not only is true
psychic potential very rare, but Ysondkhelir is as likely
to drive his victims to insanity as to successfully send
them to his extraplanar compatriots. He had most
recently manipulated the addled skulk Jedzeli (area
F12). Ysondkhelir abandoned Jedzeli as a lost cause
to prey upon Dorianna Menhemes instead, and his
schemes with her near completion.
Ysondkhelir likes to claim a hand from creatures
he has corrupted. As he hasn’t ever met Dorianna in
person, he instead stole a psychic imprint of her right
hand and manifested it as a massive, gnarled claw.
This giant crawling hand obeys Ysondkhelir loyally
and does its best to defend him.
If the heroes simply barge in, Ysondkhelir and the
hand ﬁght back. The hand tries to keep foes from
reaching Ysondkhelir, who retreats into the doorway
of either adjacent room to keep out of melee range. He
prefers spells that debilitate his foes, such as hypnotic
pattern and phantom pain.
If the heroes come to him with knowledge of
Dorianna, the denizen knows his latest plot has put him
in signiﬁcant jeopardy. He attempts to calm the heroes
and convince them that he’ll release Dorianna from
his clutches—an outright lie—if one of them willingly
accepts his Leng ruby.
If the heroes fall for this ruse, he relocates to another
part of the prison level (which you can determine); he
continues to afﬂict Dorianna and begins tormenting the
hero who took his ruby as well.
If Ysondkhelir is slain, he eventually reforms in
Leng and gives up his Material Plane plots—for now.
