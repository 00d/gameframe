Vaults
Treasure: The three crystal globes are each about a
foot in diameter and worth 200 gp to certain unsavory
soul merchants, such as night hags. If smashed, their
fragments are valueless but the soul trapped within
travels to the Boneyard and its ultimate reward.
The three functioning machines contain some
valuable parts. With several hours’ work and a
successful DC 30 Crafting check, a hero can strip a
machine of rare metals and delicate gears worth 80 gp.
If this check is a critical success, the parts are worth
160 gp; on a critical failure, the parts in that machine
are ruined and valueless.
J8. DEVOURING CHAMBER
SEVERE 10
This large chamber has a spiny, dust-covered ﬂoor. On the far
western end is a large stone basin ﬁlled with swamp plants.
A thick layer of dust covers the shattered crystal
shards littering the ﬂoor, evidence of hundreds of
initiates’ extracted souls. The broken crystal makes the
ground difﬁcult terrain and inﬂicts a –5 circumstance
penalty to Stealth checks, but it isn’t dangerous to
anyone who isn’t barefoot. Barefoot creatures take 5
piercing damage at the end of each Stride in the room.
Creatures: Three powerful dread wisps called soul
feeders ﬂoat here. As extensions of the evil energies of
the Empty Vault (area J20), they funnel souls released
here into that chamber. They can’t return to the Empty
Vault, or even leave this room, without more souls.
When the heroes arrive, the bobbing wisps demand
that the heroes gather the crystal globes from the next
room and smash them here. They don’t admit that
doing so frees them to return to the Empty Vault but
might insist (truthfully) that doing so will cause them
to vanish from here. One soul feeder winks out for
each sphere the heroes smash; the heroes will face
them again in the Empty Vault.
If it becomes clear to the soul feeders that the heroes
aren’t going to comply, they attack the heroes in an
attempt to kill them and use their souls as the fuel for
the Empty Vault instead. Soul feeders gang up on one
hero at a time, moving on to another when their target
is dead. Each hero killed in this room returns one soul
feeder to the Empty Vault immediately.
SOUL FEEDERS (3)
CREATURE 10
Elite dread wisps (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 6, page 252)
Initiative Perception +22
Stolen Soul: A hero who dies in this room has a
portion of their soul stolen to power the Empty Vault.
The hero can be raised as normal, but they gain the
doomed 1 condition and can’t reduce their doomed
condition below 1 for a year.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for dealing with
these soul feeders and passing the Challenge of Souls.
J9. SECOND CHALLENGE
This chamber looks much like the room to the north, except
the gray door to the west is carved with frightened faces
rather than mist, and there are three metal tubes rather than
two. The basin of reeds and swamp water is to the south.
This is where initiates began the Challenge of
Despair. The south doors and mechanical iris openings
in the tubes are similar to those in area J1. The door
on the west wall is unlocked and leads to second test.
If Lady’s Whisper is leading the heroes through the
challenges, it points silently at the western door. The
second dread wisp shadowing Lady’s Whisper moves
to hover above the basin and silently report the heroes’
movements to Belcorra. Once the heroes are through
the door, Lady’s Whisper opens the doors to area J14
and awaits the heroes there, closing the doors after
moving through them.
J10. PATH OF PLEASANT MEMORIES
The walls of this long, narrow hall are momentarily stark
white, but colorful images soon swirl upon them. A door
stands at each end of the hall.
Occult magic powers the illusions here and along
the path that constitutes the Challenge of Despair
(areas J11 and J12). Each viewer sees different images,
as they’re all a hodgepodge of memories drawn from
the viewers’ mind. You might draw upon the heroes’
victories, friendships, and amusing encounters in this
Adventure Path to describe the images. A hero who
approaches the western door must attempt a DC 27
Will saving throw; on a failure, the hero is entranced by
the illusory images for 24 hours. While so entranced,
the hero takes a –10-foot penalty to all Speeds in areas
J10 to J12 and can’t Avert their Gaze from the images
in the same areas.
Two secret doors allowed cultists to cut quickly
between the challenges. Heroes Searching this hall
discover the secret door to the north with a successful
DC 25 Perception check and the secret door to the
south with a successful DC 30 Perception check. Each
is opened by manipulating a nearby section of the wall
that’s slightly darker than the surrounding stone. The
secret door to the south is one-way only; the heroes
can use it to access area J12 but can’t come back.
