The Empty Vault drew Belcorra’s soul after the
Roseguard killed her, and her ghost reappeared here
500 years after the most traumatic event in her life—
not her death, but her family’s exile from Absalom.
Belcorra can’t leave this chamber for long, so she
uses her wisp proxies and bound agents to enact her
will throughout the Abomination Vaults. She keeps
the Ebon Fulcrum Lens on the altar to restore its
energies; while here, it can regain its glimmers of
Nhimbaloth’s essence, but this takes time.
The seven swamp water rivulets are both dangerous
and noxious, as they mark where Nhimbaloth once
touched the world. It’s a simple matter to step over them,
but they pull unpleasantly at the life energy of anyone
who crosses them. At the end of any turn in which a
hero crosses a rivulet (whether by Striding, Stepping,
Flying, or any other means), the hero must succeed at
a DC 22 Fortitude save or become doomed 1. This DC
increases by 2 for each additional unique rivulet crossed
during that turn (for example, a hero who crosses over
3 rivulets in their turn must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude
saving throw). The doomed condition is cumulative on
subsequent rounds. Crossing the pools doesn’t have
this effect, so the heroes might learn that there are safer
ways to move about the room than simply walking in
a direct line. The rivulets have no effect on followers of
Nhimbaloth, including Belcorra and the dread wisps.
The black stone menhirs help support Gauntlight’s
weight and emit the twisting ribbon of eerie energy
that writhes up the shaft through areas B35, C15,
H37, and I28. Belcorra can
manipulate this ribbon of
energy to power Gauntlight.
Creatures:
If
Belcorra
hasn’t yet rejuvenated, the Ebon
Fulcrum Lens automatically rejuvenates her when the
heroes arrive. She’s so incensed that another group of
adventurers would dare to oppose her in her sanctum
that she attacks with her full fury. Belcorra focuses
her attacks on anyone who carries fulcrum lenses,
especially a hero who carries them in the Fulcrum
Lattice. She realizes that the lenses are potent weapons
that can be used against her.
There’s one soul feeder here at all times. If the heroes
presented souls to the soul feeders in area J8, they’ve
come here and also ﬁght at Belcorra’s side; this makes
the encounter particularly challenging!
Belcorra and the soul feeders use the menhirs for
cover as they dart about, hoping to draw the heroes
over the doom-inducing rivulets of swamp water.
When the heroes infuse Belcorra with splinters in the
Crimson Fulcrum Lens, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens,
and the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, Nhimbaloth comes for
her, and she’s forever destroyed. When the heroes do
this, proceed to Nhimbaloth’s Entrance (page 205).
