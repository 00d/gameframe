CHAPTER 7:
Soul Keepers
Five centuries ago, Belcorra summoned the contract
devil Urevian to administer her Abomination Vaults.
Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further
offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion
of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani,
legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty
from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has,
for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value
to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s
aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul. When the
Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right
to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing
Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even
though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned,
the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The
sorcerer couldn’t fulﬁll her end of the bargain, trapping
Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a
surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse,
he didn’t dare return to Hell without the Rajani soul,
and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul
directly or through his infernal proxies, as Belcorra was
intended to deliver it. Urevian was trapped.
Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement
with her can be fulﬁlled. He plans to train her armies
and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying
has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can
also fulﬁll his contract, lives there.
Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the
ﬂeshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra
placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though
Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them
and has made that discovery his next priority.
Although the devils can use dimension door to
reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need
physical access, which required him to approach
the seugathi Jafaki about allowing them through
the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a
reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past
relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition:
Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally
inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and
improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki
to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and
that the ﬂeshwarper would never sign off on any
