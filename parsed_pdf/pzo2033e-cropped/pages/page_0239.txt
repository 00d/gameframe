Gibtas
This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with
ﬁve bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms
a bond with a single other creature—usually, a more powerful aberration—
and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as
a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions
they don’t want spattered with acid.
GIBTAS BOUNDER
A full-grown gibtas uses its powerful legs and rubbery body to bound great
distances. Most gibtases remain solitary, unless bonded with a creature.

Bouncing Slam Ȱɵ The gibtas Leaps toward a Medium or smaller creature,

the gibtas bounces out of the target’s square to an adjacent square of the
target’s choosing.

Bouncing Slam and the gibtas successfully Shoved the target;
Eﬀect The gibtas attempts to Trip the target of its Bouncing
Slam, then makes a jaws Strike against the target. The Trip and
Strike both count against the gibtas’s multiple attack penalty,
but the penalty doesn’t increase until after both attacks.
GIBTAS SPAWN SWARM
When a gibtas gorges itself on an incredible amount of
ﬂesh, it vomits up a pool of acid ﬁlled with tiny pink
egg sacs that burst immediately. The new babies hunt as
a pack, growing in size until they go their separate ways or
consume each other.

WILD GIBTASES
In the wild, gibtases are scavenger
creatures, avoiding much larger
and more powerful predators while
feeding oﬀ abandoned scraps. This
limits their consumption-based
reproduction. By spawning hundreds
of oﬀspring at once during times
of plentiful food, they ensure the
propagation of their species only
during times of plenty.
