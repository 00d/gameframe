This is a Severe encounter for 9th-level characters,
but they have the calignis on their side.
I27. LADDER BASE
LOW 9
A large, iron ladder stretches upward into the darkness. Its
chains and rods are cracked and ﬂaked with rust.
This ladder leads over 100 feet up to area H34.
Creatures: Four ceustodaemons prowl amid the
rubble and fungus at the ladder’s base. They’re so
eager for violence that they ﬁght anyone they see to
the death.
CEUSTODAEMONS (4)
CREATURE 6
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 71
Initiative Perception +14
I28. CENTRAL PIT
A ribbon of twisting light extends from a circular hole in the
ceiling to a matching hole in the ﬂoor. The stone near the
light looks pockmarked and infected. The rounded walls are
decorated with snarling stone heads of fearsome monsters.
Gauntlight’s interior can’t be reached from this level;
the only access is from 100 feet above (area H37) or
100 feet below (area J20). A living creature that ends
its turn within the 5-foot-diameter ribbon of light takes
9d6 negative damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save). The
stone heads are simply decor that Belcorra liked; they
constitute a checklist of sorts for aberrations. They
include chuuls, ﬂeshwarps, gugs, and other monsters
the heroes have likely already encountered. They aren’t
made of the same invulnerable stone as Gauntlight and
thus can be removed or destroyed normally.
I29. BOATHOUSE
MODERATE 9
This squat stone building, only eight feet high, hugs the
shore. Two wooden docks jut from the building into the dark
waters of the massive underground lake. The doors are caked
with mold and lichen, as if they haven’t been opened in years.
The Children of Belcorra once tended to this lake as
they did the one above, but the urdefhans routed them
centuries ago. During this rout, the urdefhans drove
Beluthus, a powerful occultist among the Children of
Belcorra, back to this boathouse and locked him in.
Beluthus has remained inside ever since, succumbing
to torpor like many of the other undead gnomes. In
addition to being caked with mold, the doors have
makeshift planks nailed across them on the outside.
The planks are easy to pry off, but doing so is noisy
and alerts Beluthus. Inside, an old but serviceable
rowboat hangs from the ceiling on short chains.
Creatures: Beluthus wakes when anyone pries open
the doors or intrudes into the boathouse. He lashes out
with fury, eager to recover more souls after his long
torpor and rejoin the other Children of Belcorra.
BELUTHUS
CREATURE 11
UNIQUE
NE
SMALL
UNDEAD
Male devourer (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 78)
Initiative Perception +22
Treasure: The rowboat contains a small sea chest
with a swan boat feather token, a runestone with a +2
armor potency rune, and a +2 striking dagger.
I30. LIZARD RUN
LOW 9
The ceiling of this cavern sports many crystal growths and
stalactites. A pattering drizzle drips from these formations,
and paths wind though thick fungus growing on the ground.
THE CAVERN VAST
Most of the Hunting Grounds is a wilderness of rock
formations, crystal growths, mineral springs, and
vast swaths of towering fungi. Its denizens aren’t
always found in their respective encounter areas.
Every 15 minutes that the heroes spend traversing
the cavern, make a secret DC 5 ﬂat check. On a
success, they face one of the following random
encounters. If the result would be a creature the
heroes have already faced, treat it as no encounter.
