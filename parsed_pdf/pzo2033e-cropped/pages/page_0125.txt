scientiﬁcally engineering the most powerful monsters.
They might be encountered elsewhere in the
Laboratories level, as needed to evaluate potential
successes. They even strive to make the best of their
failures, such as by cultivating the shanrigol behemoth
in area F26. Jafaki isn’t likely to venture out in direct
response to the heroes’ presence; they consider the
heroes to be little more than annoyances and trusts
in others to take care of them. Once the heroes
show up here, Jafaki ﬁnally realizes they might have
underestimated them.
Creatures: Jafaki sends the drider to answer any
knock at the door since other seugathis sometimes
come by for Jafaki’s guidance. The heroes might
take advantage of this habit to take the preoccupied
researcher by surprise.
If the heroes try to Force Open the door open or
Pick the Lock, Jafaki realizes they’re intruders and
prepares for a ﬁght. The drider scrambles up to the
ceiling. Jafaki envenoms their rapier and casts levitate
to stay out of melee reach. Both use their spells as often
as they can; the drider uses ﬁreball and acid arrow to
inﬂict direct damage, while Jafaki prefers spells that
disorient opponents and turn them against each other,
like confusion. They hope to distill out which of the
heroes is the toughest, then take that hero captive for
experimentation. When direct damage is more useful,
Jafaki hurls their alchemical bombs to catch as many
targets as possible.
Both of these foes ﬁght to the death—the drider
out of loyalty to Jafaki, and Jafaki because they can’t
abandon their life’s work.

Mindfog Aura (enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature
that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 23
Will save or become confused for 1 round; on a success,
that creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. Jafaki
can suppress or activate this aura as a single action with
the concentrate trait.

ally, the creature can immediately attempt a DC 21 Will
save; on a success, its target is determined randomly
as normal, and on a critical success the target is no
longer confused.
