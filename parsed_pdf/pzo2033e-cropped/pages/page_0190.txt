Vaults
open negotiations about aiding an attack on a surface
city that Ravirex doesn’t know, and the dragon awaits
her next visit to learn more. She mentioned something
about entrusting a colored magical lens to Ravirex,
so he’s keeping an eye out for those in the hopes of
currying favor with Belcorra.
Two passages lead out of this area to wild Darklands
areas to the west. Swamp water ﬂoods the southern
passage entirely, while the northern passage is clear
but very narrow.
Creatures: While not working to sculpt the fungus in
its lair or out hunting, Ravirex rests upon his hoard in the
alcove to the north. He defends his lair ferociously and
works hard to drive intruders away so he can preserve
his privacy. If he learns that the heroes have any of the
magic lenses he believes Belcorra wants, he targets the
heroes who carry them and tries to take them.
RAVIREX
CREATURE 11
Male adult black dragon (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 105)
Initiative Perception +22
Treasure: The dragon’s hoard consists of 260 gp,
1,412 sp, 4,303 cp, a golden goblet worth 200 gp, a
+2 striking mace, an iron medallion, a scroll of spirit
blast, and a mummiﬁed bat.
I52. VAULT LEDGE
The lake’s water laps lazily on a wide stone ledge
surrounding a structure built into the cavern wall. The
ledge is thick with lichen and barely wide enough to stand
on. A single iron, vault-like door with a metal handle and a
keyhole leads into the structure.
Belcorra built this secure vault as a place to gather
the treasures she planned to use to fund her assault on
Absalom. Beneath the profusion of lichen, the ledge
holds several cleats for securing boats.
The vault door looks formidable but is, surprisingly,
unlocked. The vault’s only intelligent occupant, a
graveknight named Caliddo, recently traveled to the
third level of the Abomination Vaults to recover some
books Belcorra wanted, and he neglected to lock the
door when he returned.
Hazard: The vault door isn’t locked but is trapped.
BLAST TUMBLER
HAZARD 10
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 32 (master)
Description A hard-to-reach rune is placed on the lock’s
tumbler. It emits a blast of force when the door is jostled.
Disable DC 32 Thievery (master) to disarm the rune, or
dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 28) to counteract
the rune’s magic.
Force Blast Ǻȓ (evocation, force, occult) Trigger A
non‑undead creature opens the door or critically fails an
attempt to disarm or dispel the rune; Eﬀect A 30‑foot
cone of force issues forth from the lock. Creatures within
the cone must succeed a DC 29 basic Fortitude saving
throw or take 8d12 force damage. Those who fail the
save are pushed 10 feet, and those who critically fail are
pushed 20 feet and are stunned 2.
Reset The rune resets 1 minute after it triggers.
I53. VAULT ANTECHAMBER
LOW 9
The dust is thick in this room, save for footprints that lead
to and from the southernmost of three iron doors, which
look similar to the vault’s entrance.
On the south side of the chamber is a hardened clay
statue sculpted to resemble Belcorra.
Each door leads to another vault. The doors to
areas I54 and I55 are both locked, and Caliddo the
graveknight has the keys. The locks require six
successful DC 40 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock to
open, and they can’t be Forced Open. The door to area
I56 is unlocked; this is where Caliddo went.
Creatures: The statue is a clay golem charged
with attacking any creature other than Belcorra or
Caliddo. It ﬁghts until destroyed, its old clay grinding
as it attacks. The sound quickly brings Caliddo to
ﬁght as well. Together, they’re a Severe encounter for
9th‑level characters.
CLAY GOLEM
CREATURE 10
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 186
Initiative Perception +16
I54. COIN VAULT
Three iron chests, all in diﬀerent sizes, are lined up against
the north wall of this room.
The boxes hold a mass of treasure that Belcorra
accumulated in life to aid in her assault on Absalom.
Treasure: The largest box contains 8,000 sp, and
the next largest holds 500 gp. The smallest has 100
pp. All these coins were minted centuries ago.
I55. ALCHEMICAL VAULT
This door is difﬁcult to open, even once unlocked,
because the inside has been warped by an explosion.
Inside the vault is a tangle of ancient wood and shattered
glass and pottery. Scorch marks scar the stone walls.
