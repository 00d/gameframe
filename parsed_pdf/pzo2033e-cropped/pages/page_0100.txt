E12. SENTENCING CHAMBER
MODERATE 5
The ﬂoor of this room contains several open square pits:
one in each of the three alcoves to the north and two larger
pits in the middle of the room. A dais at the room’s west
end contains a stone throne with two rusty levers jutting
from the ﬂoor next to it.
In Belcorra’s day, prisoners were brought to this room
for the sorcerer to pronounce judgment against them.
Nearly always, this judgment involved feeding them to
the hydras below. The two levers correspond to the two
pits; each lever once released the supports on a false stone
trapdoor, dropping anyone standing on it into the water
55 feet below (area F4). The hinges to the trapdoor broke
away long ago, and the fallen trapdoors now rest at the
bottom of the pool. The rusted levers are currently useless.
The pits in the alcoves never had trapdoors; they
simply drop into the water below and were used to
dispose of multiple creatures in quick succession. The
pits are narrow enough that a Medium creature falling
into any of them can Grab an Edge automatically.
The Athletics DC to Climb these pits is 20.
Creatures: Jafaki trapped two gibtas bounders in
this room; his efforts to mutate or train them proved
entirely ineffective, so he has given up on them for
the time being. The gibtas bounders attack intruders,
but they don’t coordinate their tactics. They’re smart
enough to avoid the pits, and a gibtas reduced to fewer
than 40 Hit Points starts trying to Shove opponents
into the pits with its bouncing slam.

Initiative Perception +13
Into the Pits: A hero who falls into a pit and fails to
Grab an Edge lands in area F4, awakening the hydras
there and potentially getting into a very tough ﬁght. If
a gibtas falls into the pit, it brieﬂy ﬁghts with the hydra
under the water, biting off a head and cauterizing the
stump with its acidic saliva before the hydra’s other
heads rip it to pieces. The heroes see only roiling water
followed by a cloud of green blood and pieces of the
gibtas’s corpse ﬂoating to the surface.
Treasure: The stone throne contains a secret
compartment in the back. A hero Searching it who
succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds the
compartment and its contents: a climbing bolt, a dragon
turtle scale, and 31 gp.
E13. GLADIATOR READINESS ROOM
LOW 5
Weapon racks stand in the northeast and southeast
corners of this room. The southeast rack is empty, but the
northeast rack holds a hatchet made of dark crystal. Two
alcoves between the racks on the eastern wall each have
an open hatch and a ladder leading down. Additional exits
lead out to the north, west, and south.
Gladiators readied themselves for aquatic battles in
this room, climbing down the ladders to the shallows
in the pool below. The exit to the north leads to
a supply closet; the door fell off the hinges decades
ago, and a mimic recently took the door’s place. The
weapon rack with the hatchet is another mimic, the
hatchet merely a part of its camouﬂage.
The hatches leading down into the water below (area
F4) are open. Several of the ladder rungs are missing,
so a character must succeed at a DC 10 Athletics check
to Climb either ladder.
Creatures: A pair of mimics recently entered this
room. One settled in the northeast corner, disguising
itself as a weapon rack identical to the one in the
southeast corner. The second mimic wedged itself
into the northern door frame, disguising itself as a
door that collapsed inward into the storage closet. If
the heroes approach this area with great stealth, they
might overhear the two mimics murmuring about the
ﬂavors of the dungeon’s various denizens.

Treasure: Shattered jars ﬁll the supply room in the
north. Among the debris, the heroes can ﬁnd a few
intact bottles, including a lesser sea touch elixir and
a corked glass bottle. A hero who succeeds at a DC
20 Arcana or Occultism check while Investigating this
room or handling the bottle recognizes the runes on its
base, which label it as bottled air.
E14. LOUNGE
A counter wrapped around the northern and northeastern
wall bears a few cracked serving dishes. A dusty and
shattered display case features only grime and broken glass.
This room once hosted gladiators looking to
compete in the pits, where they fought to eventually
become leaders of Belcorra’s army. A hero who
Searches the display case ﬁnds the words “They Are
