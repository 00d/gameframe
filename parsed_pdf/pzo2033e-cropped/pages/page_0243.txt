VALUABLE SPORES
Alchemists, naturalists, and other
collectors prize samples from
unusual underground fungi. Deadly
puﬀballs are even more valuable.
The carefully harvested scraps of an
exploded deadly puﬀball can fetch as
much as 150 gp to the right buyer.
Puffball Fungus
Many benign puffball fungi cling to the detritus of forest ﬂoors in Darklands
caverns. These fungi’s giant versions are more mobile and dangerous.
