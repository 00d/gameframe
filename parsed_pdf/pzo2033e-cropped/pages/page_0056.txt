Vaults
This private reading room was the second room in which Otari Ilvashti
sought shelter in his desperate ﬁnal days. As in area B28, his ghost’s energy
lingers here. When the heroes enter this room, the green light forms the
message, “Belcorra fell to the Roseguard, but we never knew of these
vaults below...”
A moment later, the words slide off the wall and slither away. If the
heroes follow, the ribbon creeps back up to area C6 and then past the
stairs at area C10. Here, the ribbon hesitantly climbs the northern stair
only to turn around and quickly slither further east. The ghostly light
enters area C11, curls onward to C33, and then through the eastern door
and down the stairs before fading. The heroes can pick up the ﬁnal clue of
Otari’s path in area D16.
This spectral manifestation can appear once per day.
C4. NOT-SO-PRIVATE READING ROOM
LOW 3
An ancient sofa with its covering torn open and its stuﬃng and springs revealed
sits against the west wall of this room.
This reading room contains much more than meets the eye. Secret doors
in the north and south walls (either of which can be found with a successful
DC 23 Perception check) open into a hidden hall around the room (area
C5). A search of the wall above the couch (and another successful DC 23
Perception check) reveals a hidden peephole into this room. If Belcorra
deemed a visitor too dangerous, her forces would ambush the visitor and
bring them through a teleportation circle in area C5b to be imprisoned in
area D11.
Hazard: The ﬁnal victim of this room, a spy from Absalom whose
intelligence had already brought Belcorra’s activities to the attention of
the Roseguard, met his end here. When he put up a ﬁght and Belcorra
tried to subdue him, she accidentally killed him instead. The spirit of the
paranoid spy lingers on.

CHAPTER 3 SYNOPSIS
Belcorra’s sprawling library has
been transformed from a store
of necromantic knowledge into a
stronghold for a cult of ghouls. The
heroes can not only eliminate this
vile cult but also uncover signiﬁcant
information about Belcorra’s
interests and plans.
Environmental Cues: books in
untidy stacks, dust, looming shelves,
musty mold, ruined tools and
furniture, sounds of ﬂipping pages,
stink as of something rotting in a
hidden corner, stuﬀy air.
