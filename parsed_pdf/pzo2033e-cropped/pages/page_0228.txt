DROW SHOOTIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisite trained in the hand crossbow
Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow
to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever
you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater
proﬁciency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that
proﬁciency in the hand crossbow. If you’re at least an expert
in a hand crossbow you’re using, you gain access to its critical
specialization eﬀect. You also gain the Shootist’s Draw action.
Shootist’s Draw Ȱɵ Frequency once per round; Eﬀect You
Interact to draw a hand crossbow and Strike with it, or
you Strike with a loaded hand crossbow you’re already
holding and then Interact to stow it.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the drow shootist archetype.
REPEATING HAND CROSSBOW TRAINING
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Drow Shootist Dedication
You become trained in the repeating hand crossbow (page 73)
and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and shootist
bandoliers (page 73). Whenever you gain a class feature that
grants you expert or greater proﬁciency in a given weapon
or weapons, you also gain that proﬁciency in the repeating
hand crossbow. If you’re at least an expert in a repeating
hand crossbow you’re using, you gain access to its critical
specialization eﬀect. You can perform the Shootist’s Draw
action with repeating hand crossbows.
Special If you have the Running Reload feat, you
can reload a repeating hand crossbow magazine on the
move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity
to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after
you Stride, Step, or Sneak, or as a 2-action activity if you use
a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
RELOADING TRICK Ȱɵ
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites Drow Shootist Dedication
Frequency once per round
Requirements You’re holding an unloaded hand crossbow.
You can ﬁre oﬀ a single shot even when unprepared. You
Interact to reload your hand crossbow and Strike with it.
Special If you have the Repeating Hand Crossbow
Training feat, you can use this feat with a repeating hand
crossbow to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed
means you can ﬁre only one bolt, then the magazine jams.
You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the
jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
LETHARGY POISONER
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Drow Shootist Dedication, trained in Crafting
You’ve learned more than the use of hand crossbows
from drow lore. During your daily preparations, you can
prepare a dose of lethargy poison (Core Rulebook 552)
from ordinary materials in a wilderness or urban area. If
you’re an expert in Crafting, you can instead craft a dose
of stupor poison (page 74). You can prepare two doses
(of either poison) if you’re a master in Crafting and three
doses if you’re legendary in Crafting. The save DC for this
poison is equal to your class DC. Only you can use these
poisons, and they expire the next time you make your
daily preparations. The GM might decide that the area
you’re in is too barren to provide the materials you need
for this feat.
