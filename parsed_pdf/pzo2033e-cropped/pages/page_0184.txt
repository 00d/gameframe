Replacements: If these guards are defeated,
they’re ﬁrst replaced with death scouts and lashers
from area I34, then with a pair of nervous urdefhan
warriors from the same area.
I34. URDEFHAN HORDE
SEVERE 9
This massive cavern holds a jumble of low-lying tents
made of stitched-together pelts and blood-streaked
leather. Most of the tents surround a natural stone
pillar decorated with strange symbols in brown and
red paint, amid skulls tied or spiked to the pillar. Hides
of various creatures cover the entrances to three
caves to the southeast, each with a narrow
wooden door.
Most
urdefhans
in
the
Abomination Vaults dwell in this
enormous cavern. They sleep in small,
cramped tents but spend their time
awake eating, sparring, or working with
their weapons. Other accouterments
to support their camp, such as food
storage and mundane supplies, are in
the tents.
Traversing this war camp to face
Khurfel is difﬁcult. With their craving
for destruction, the urdefhans are
always ready for battle. As they spend so
much time sparring and ﬁghting among
themselves, the denizens of the adjacent
caves (areas I35, I36, and I37) don’t respond to the
sounds of combat here. The heroes might have an
easier time bypassing these forces if they use stealth
or trickery, but keep in mind the daemons here have
a constant see invisibility.
Creatures: Nearly 20 urdefhans can be found here
at almost all times, along with two ceustodaemons
who stoke their bloodlust. About a third of the
urdefhans are sleeping, but they’re quick to grab their
weapons and join in a ﬁght if other urdefhans raise
a hue and cry. All the urdefhans ﬁght with growling
whoops and revel in the battle, even if they’re losing.
If the heroes defeat all the foes here other than
urdefhan warriors, the urdefhan warriors all break
and ﬂee together.
If the heroes retreat from this battle, most of the
urdefhans let them go; 1d6 urdefhan warriors follow,
screaming for the heroes’ blood.
If the urdefhans defeat the heroes, they don’t kill
them, but rather take them alive and hand
them over to the tormentors in area I35,
where they might have a chance to
escape before being sacriﬁced.

I35. SUMMONING CAVERN
LOW 9
This cavern slopes upward to a ﬂat area. A metal box
about three feet across sits against the northern wall, its
lid pressed against the wall to prevent it from opening. A
bloody circle surrounded by runes is painted on the ﬂoor.
Dedicated to bringing more daemons into their
midst, the urdefhans use this chamber for vile
KHURFEL ON THE MARCH
If the heroes assault the urdefhan camp and retreat or
escape, Khurfel is active in his retribution. He doesn’t
wait for the heroes to return. Instead, he leads a
lasher, a death scout, and four urdefhan warriors in
the search for them. The next random encounter the
heroes have is an encounter with Khurfel’s war party.
Alternatively, you can have the war party show up
whenever the heroes are traveling outside of Yldaris.
