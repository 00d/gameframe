D8. LOUNGE
SEVERE 4
The walls of this large chamber are hung with grisly paintings depicting various
spectral beings cavorting among ruined neighborhoods, overgrown swamps,
and foggy graveyards. Three large overstuﬀed chairs pair with small end tables,
upon which sit empty wine glasses. To the south stands a cluttered writing desk
with its own chair, while a large iron tub to the west is visible between standing
screens depicting shadowy marshes.
This large lounge once served as a place for Belcorra to relax, but today
it functions as a den for her one‑time apprentice, the drow Volluk Azrinae.
Most papers on the desk are Volluk’s disjointed notes. More usefully to the
heroes, the papers also include detailed blueprints of the top three levels of
the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors.
A hero Searching the room and who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception
check ﬁnds the secret door in the east wall: a lifelike graveyard painting
that swings outward. Every 10 minutes or so, a faint scream issues from
the other side of the secret door, though it sounds like it’s emanating from
the picture. After the ﬁrst scream, the DC to ﬁnd the door drops to 12.
A hero Searching this room who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check
ﬁnds an iron key hidden in a secret slot in one of the desk’s legs; it opens
Lasda’s manacles (area D9).
Creatures: Unlike most of the denizens who dwelt in the Abomination
Vaults in Belcorra’s day, Volluk is still alive—after a fashion. After feeding
himself to a vat of ritually prepared leeches, he lives on as a hideous worm
that walks. Volluk resembles a roughly drow‑shaped mass composed of
thousands of slithering leeches. He has been working with the voidglutton
that now dwells in Belcorra’s old chambers (area D20) to restore
Gauntlight, but he’s frustrated that Belcorra’s ghost doesn’t speak to him
directly. Being forced to do his mistress’s bidding through the will of the
voidglutton galls the proud occultist.
Volluk is reading at his desk when the heroes ﬁrst arrive. As soon as
he notices the heroes’ intrusion, he rises up—a squirming, awful mess—
and demands to know who they are and why they’ve come. He has little
interest in constructive discourse, but if the heroes let him talk, he uses
Intimidation to roll initiative.

CHAPTER 4 SYNOPSIS
The fourth level of the Abomination
Vaults was designed as a retreat
for Belcorra to relax and to revere
her uncaring deity Nhimbaloth.
No faction of signiﬁcance holds
sway over Belcorra’s Retreat today.
Instead, several powerful individuals
claim separate portions of this level.
The most signiﬁcant ally the heroes
can acquire is the ghost of Otari
Ilvashti, the fallen hero who gave the
town of Otari its name.
Environmental Cues: Cool
but comfortable temperature,
ﬁne furnishings that are old yet
luxurious, haunted house eﬀects
such as closing doors or sliding
chairs, profusions of fungi, smells
of dust and faint spices, spectral
visions of rooms as they looked 500
years ago.
