B11. WASHROOM
One wall of this washroom has been gouged out by sharp
claws, revealing a rough-hewn tunnel leading west.
This once served as the majordomo’s washroom.
The tunnel to area B13 began as an eroding crack, then
was widened by the morlocks.
B12. GRAULGUST’S THRONE ROOM
SEVERE 2
A sofa-like throne made of an old mattress, several pieces
of reconstructed furniture, and dozens of bones sprawls
along the northern side of this room. A narrow rivulet of
muddy water trickles from a narrow tunnel to the south
and forms a puddle in the room’s center.
Creatures: Graulgust, the self-styled king of the
Ghost Queen morlocks, has chosen the majordomo’s
old bedroom as his throne room. He has rebuilt the
older furniture in this area into an immense throne
of sorts, and he’s attended at all times by a morlock
servant tasked with sharpening Graulgust’s ﬁngernails
and toenails, rubbing his feet, feeding him worms,
or whatever else Graulgust demands. Now and
then, Graulgust leaves his throne room to patrol the
Ghost Queen’s domain and to check up on the Ghost
Queen’s shrine (area B14), but the ﬁrst time the heroes
visit the dungeon, they encounter him here.
Graulgust fancies himself something of a worldly
diplomat, but since he speaks only Aklo and
Undercommon, communication with the heroes might
be difﬁcult. If he can’t establish communication,
Graulgust grows annoyed and sends his morlock
servant to ﬁght the heroes. Graulgust steps into the
ﬁght only once his servant is slain or if he’s attacked
directly. If he’s reduced to 30 Hit Points, he spends an
action to howl for his pet grothlut in area B13. If the
slithering monster still lives, it comes to its master’s aid
as soon as it can through the tunnel to the southwest.
Any morlocks present when Graulgust is slain gain
the ﬂeeing condition for 1 round and are frightened 3.

Side Quest: If he can communicate with the heroes,
Graulgust congratulates them for their bravery in
seeking him out and gives them a choice—they can
become sacriﬁces for the Ghost Queen (in which
case he directs his morlock servants to kill them), or
they can prove their worth to the Ghost Queen by
slaying the “water monster” that dwells nearby in area
B19 and bringing back her head. If the heroes agree,
Graulgust allows them to leave the room only via the
tunnel to area B18, and if they don’t have the river
drake’s head with them as proof of their deed the next
time they encounter Graulgust, he attacks the heroes
at once for their failure. If the heroes return with the
river drake’s head, Graulgust is delighted that the
morlocks now have an easy way out of the dungeon to
go foraging. He rewards the heroes by giving them the
title of “lackeys of the Ghost Queen” and leads them
on a stroll through Ghost Queen territory (through
areas B10, B9, B8, B14, B21, and B22). Once he and
the heroes reach B22, he offers them a new choice—
surrender their gear and become true slaves of the
Ghost Queen (and be imprisoned in area B24) or begin
a crusade for him against the Cult of the Canker—a
group of “heretic ghouls” who must be slaughtered for
the glory of the Ghost Queen. If the heroes agree to this,
Graulgust sends them downstairs through area B16
with a command to not return until all of the ghouls
are slain. If the heroes do so, Graulgust realizes they’re
too powerful to simply dispose of; he names them
“missionaries of the Ghost Queen” and commands
them to leave the morlock areas and never return.
During this time, the heroes can speak to Graulgust
and learn a bit more about the Abomination Vaults.
The morlocks haven’t explored the northern part of
this level, but he can inform the heroes of the secret
door to area B15 and provide a scribbled map of
level three (including areas C1, C6, C10, C11, C15,
and  C33). If asked about deeper levels, Graulgust
grows silent, saying “You are of the surface and do not
deserve to know of our homeland.” At your discretion,
if the heroes use mind control or other coercive
methods, they might force Graulgust to divulge more
information about deeper levels of the Abomination
Vaults, but note that the morlocks left them a while
ago and much has changed since Belcorra’s return.
Graulgust never speaks the Ghost Queen’s name
aloud, and if the heroes speak the name “Belcorra” in
his presence, he shrieks in anger and warns the heroes
never to say her name again. If they do so, he attacks.
Once the heroes have secured Graulgust’s trust, the
morlock occultist is shocked if they suddenly turn
against him. If the heroes attack Graulgust at any
point after he believes they’re working for him, he’s
slowed 1 for 2 rounds, as he grapples with the fact that
he no longer commands obedience.
