extra powers from her devotion to the Empty Death.
Sacuishu was sent from the lower levels to check on the
prison by Lady’s Whisper, a patient and silent servitor
of Nhimbaloth (area I61) While the gug Aulr—who’s
angry, direct, and abrupt like Belcorra—has mostly
failed to get any answers after being sent to the
prison level by the sorcerer, Sacuishu found more
success in her delving. She has learned a great
deal about the inhabitants of the middle and
even upper levels of the Abomination Vaults,
and she rests here between her invisible
excursions. Sacuishu can’t return, as
Urevian blocked the ways down in area
G3, but she thinks it’s just a matter of
time until the way opens again.
Because of her frequent wanderings, you
can have Sacuishu encounter the heroes
nearly anywhere; she attacks to learn
their tactics and abilities but retreats to
this area when reduced to fewer than 40
Hit Points.
While here, Sacuishu ﬂoats, very still,
near the center of the ceiling, washing
the room in a pale glow and basking in the
emptiness. The presence of outsiders in her
secret room offends her; she immediately Goes
Dark and casts darkness before attacking. If any
of the heroes openly carry the tome The Whispering
Reeds, Sacuishu is appalled that the sacred book
has fallen in the hands of a nonbeliever and targets
whomever carries it.
If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Sacuishu casts
sanctuary and retreats to area G3, hoping it has
opened; if it’s blocked, she makes her last stand there.

Glow (aura, light) 20 feet. Sacuishu is naturally invisible

in the aura and making her visible.

Feed on Magic Ȱɵ (concentrate) Requirement A
creature who can cast spells is within 15 feet
of the spellvoid; Eﬀect The spellvoid feeds
on the creature’s magic. The spellvoid
regains 2d8 Hit Points, and the target
must attempt a DC 28 Will save. The
target is then temporarily immune for
1 hour.
Critical Success
The
target
is
unaﬀected.
Success The ﬁrst time the target
Casts a Spell before the start of
the spellvoid’s next turn, the spell is
disrupted unless the target succeeds at a
DC 15 ﬂat check.
Failure As success, but the eﬀect applies the
ﬁrst time the target Casts a Spell within the next
minute.
Critical Failure As success, but the eﬀect applies
each time the target Casts a Spell within the next
minute. In addition, the spellvoid doubles the Hit
Points it regains.
Go Dark Ȱɵ (concentrate) Sacuishu extinguishes her
glow, becoming invisible. She can end this eﬀect with
another use of this action. If she uses her shock attack
while invisible, the arc of electricity lets any observer
determine her location, making Sacuishu hidden to
observers only until she moves.
G22. MAGICAL COMMUNICATOR
A bowl of ﬁlthy swamp water rests upon a crude altar.
Priests once used this scrying bowl to communicate
with Belcorra before it became inactive upon her
death. It regained a fraction of its power now that
she has returned. The ﬁrst creature to look into
its waters sees Belcorra’s hateful visage glaring
back. The creature takes 9d6 mental damage (DC
33 basic Will save). A creature that fails its save
is also stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute. After this initial
appearance, Belcorra’s image doesn’t reappear, but
she remembers the hero who called upon her in this
way in future encounters.
Treasure: The following items lie next to the bowl: a
gallows tooth, a transparent elemental gem, and a grim
trophy in the form of seven ears impaled on a nail.
