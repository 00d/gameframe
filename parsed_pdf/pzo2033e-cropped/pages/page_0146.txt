CHAPTER 8:
Decaying Gardens
Gauntlight is active, but its true power is yet to be
realized. Belcorra penetrated deep underground to
build Gauntlight’s foundation, following the psychic
pull of the Empty Vault, a place sacred to Nhimbaloth
at the heart of an ancient, subterranean temple.
Gauntlight draws upon the energies of the Empty Vault
as its foundation and the source of its powers. Within
the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum
lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above,
focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s
full power. But the fulcrum lenses are dangerous; they
invite Nhimbaloth’s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra
can’t withstand the scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus,
though they hold great power, the fulcrum lenses are
also Belcorra’s greatest weakness.
Belcorra repurposed the massive natural caverns
above the Empty Vault for her needs. The eighth level
made a lush cavern of fungus growths and freshwater
lakes that teemed with subterranean ﬁsh, while the
ninth level was a wilderness where predators and prey
alike could thrive. Heroes must descend through these
levels to reach the Empty Vault.
Children of Belcorra
Uninterested in administering these vast caverns
herself, Belcorra enthralled deep gnomes already
living there, compelling them with threats and favors
to tend her subterranean farm. She dubbed these loyal,
diminutive gardeners the Children of Belcorra.
The Children of Belcorra disbelieved rumors of
Belcorra’s death as some sort of trick or test and
didn’t waver in their duties. But as the years passed,
more and more feral monsters made their way into
the level and made their mission in the farm more
difﬁcult. Believing that Belcorra (or, perhaps, some
other Haruvex) would return, the Children chose to
become undead to combat their dwindling numbers
and increasing age. They immured each other in
the muddy shores to rise again as bog mummies or
undertook difﬁcult transformations into other, more
powerful, undead.
Eventually, their timeless lives and lack of
direction took their toll. Many Children fell into
a torpor or retreated into obsession or isolation.
The farm they’d carefully tended became infested
