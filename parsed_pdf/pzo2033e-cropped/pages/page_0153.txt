When Belcorra learned that calignis were meeting
with Urthagul, she sent a pair of dread wisps here to
prevent the calignis’ passage. She doesn’t want the
Crimson Fulcrum Lens to fall into caligni hands, as
she sees them as less reliable guardians than the gug.
Creatures: The pair of dread wisps attack any
creatures other than Belcorra and any Children of
Belcorra who attempt to pass. The defeat of the dread
wisps triggers the Belcorra Attacks! event described in
the sidebar on page 146.

H11. CARRION AMBUSH
LOW 8
Even before the heroes enter this chamber, they can
smell a putrid stench of carrion and decay.
This large, smelly cave opens onto a cliﬀ with a large body
of murky water about twenty feet below. At the edge of
the cliﬀ sits a heap of reeking, decomposing carrion. A
stream of water ﬂows from the north, past the heap and
over the cliﬀ in a narrow waterfall.
The pile of carrion was once a Huge aquatic reptile
that scaled the cliff to escape the predatory chuuls but
died here. Its rotting mass hides a group of Children
of Belcorra who wait underneath to gain information
about—and hopefully capture—Urthagul. They plan
to either follow Urthagul if the gug passes this way
(which they don’t realize the gug never does) or
capture and interrogate calignis (which they don’t
realize Belcorra has prevented).
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra are hiding
in the carrion heap, which counts as a bog for the
mummies’ abilities. They attack anyone who comes
near and ﬁght until destroyed.

H12. ISLAND CAVERN
MODERATE 8
Four small streams ﬂow through this chamber, fed by a
dark pond against the west wall. The streams divide the
chamber into islands, each covered with lichen, mildew,
and mushrooms. Bioluminescent fungi and strange
motes of light bathe the place in eerie illumination,
playing oﬀ the water to form odd shapes on the
cavern’s walls, like humanoid apparitions gliding
through the air. Water ﬂowing along the sides of
the islands echoes oﬀ the walls in weird ways,
like harsh whispers.
“Haruvex has risen. There is nothing you
can do,” the overlapping echoes say. The sound is
hypnotizing, and strangely calming.
Long-gone cultists used this cavern as a meditation
chamber to calm their emotions and clear their minds,
but it now echoes with subtle whispers of Nhimbaloth’s
alien will. These whispers can be maddening or
enlightening but are usually wholly unintelligible.
The northwestern end of this cavern forms a rock
wall 10 feet high that leads to a natural bridge 30 feet
above the lake to an old cage (area A13). Urthagul used
to leave this way every week or two to hunt for food in
the lake but hadn’t bothered to do so while the calignis
were bringing him offerings.
