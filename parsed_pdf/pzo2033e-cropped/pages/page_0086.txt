CHAPTER 5:
Into the Training Grounds
While the upper levels of Belcorra’s massive dungeon
were primarily for her personal use, she designed the
middle levels for work. Belcorra trawled the Darklands
for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations,
but their feral power wasn’t enough for her. She needed
to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis
of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces
forged for battle, in body and in mind. The ﬁfth level
thus included a massive arena and training grounds
where gladiators would ﬁght for the right to lead her
monstrous troops.
In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike
aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious
eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth
level—formerly support rooms for her monsters and
their trainers as well as a “preserve” where she kept
large beasts—as laboratories. There, the seugathis
sought to perfect ﬂeshwarping to create ﬂawless
monsters under the guidance of their leader, Jafaki.
Belcorra constructed the smaller seventh level as a
prison. She didn’t intend to keep many captives, since
creatures who displeased her could serve as raw ﬂesh
for Jafaki’s experiments or as food for her monsters.
However, one of Belcorra’s chief administrators, the
contract devil Urevian, insisted on building the prison.
Before long, the level became a warped mirror of Hell.
A decade into building her dungeon and honing her
preparations, Belcorra died at the hands of the heroic
Roseguard, who had no idea about these subterranean
machinations. The Abomination Vaults fell into
disarray almost immediately. Urevian attempted to
assert control, but Jafaki’s aberrant creations fought the
devil’s forces to a standstill. A sort of stalemate settled
over the middle levels, and the borders of control have
shifted only slightly over the centuries. Jafaki merely
wanted peace to continue their experiments; Urevian
idly prepared for the surface invasion as his contract
required of him, even though he knew it was almost
impossible for him to complete his contract because
Belcorra had died.
Word of the seugathis’ skilled ﬂeshwarping spread.
Before long, arrogant or desperate creatures came
to the Abomination Vaults seeking remarkable
transformations, though few ultimately considered
