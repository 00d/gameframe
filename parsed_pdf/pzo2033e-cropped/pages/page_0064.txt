The keyhole is large enough to look through, but it’s
impossible to see anything in the room other than to
identify that the room is also brightly lit.
Treasure: The chandelier’s bright light comes from
an everburning torch socketed into its center. When
socketed, it reﬂects through many pretty (but valueless)
chunks of glass.
C27. BELCORRA’S READING ROOM
MODERATE 3
The door to this room from area C26 is locked with an
oversized lock; its key is on the key ring in area A13.
A hero can Pick the Lock with three successful DC 18
Thievery checks or Force it Open with a successful DC
22 Athletics check, but a failed Athletics check alerts
the fey reading here to the presence of intruders.
This room looks exceptionally comfortable with a thick
carpet, bright light from a glowing chandelier, and
soothing incense. Two overstuﬀed chairs sit opposite a
low table stacked with books, while more books sit on
a set of shelves to the west. A softly gurgling fountain
carved to resemble a mossy skull leaking water sits in the
northwest corner.
This room once served as a private and comfortable
place for Belcorra to relax and read, with minor
magical trappings like the scent of incense, the
bubbling of the fountain, and the bright light working
together to afford a pleasant reading experience.
Most of the books here concern topics of sacriﬁce,
incorporeal undead, and extinguishing living bodies
and souls to create powerful magic items. Other books
are tales (often ﬁctionalized) of famous hauntings
throughout the Inner Sea region. The books are quite
old but are well preserved. They can be used just like
the books in area C11 to aid in Investigation on these
topics, providing a +1 item bonus.
Heroes Searching this room discover an iron key
bearing a defaced symbol of Aroden between two
chair cushions. The key unlocks the door to area C30.
Creatures: The room’s comforts are wasted on the
current occupant, a lurker in light named Shimmergrin
who recently slipped into the brightly lit room to satisfy
their own curiosity. The creature sits awkwardly in one
of the oversized (for them) chairs in the room as they
focus on balancing a book a little bit too large for them
to handle. They periodically cackle and titter over the
book as they annotate its text with a colorful quill.
They’ve become distracted by the grisly descriptions
of ritual sacriﬁce in an illustrated copy of a text called
Pathways of the Worm and angrily attack if interrupted.
If brought below 20 Hit Points, the fey uses dimension
door to ﬂee to area C26 (although they can’t do so if the
heroes have doused that room’s illumination) and ﬂit
away. They plot revenge against the heroes, most likely
by allying with the ghouls in area C33.
LURKER IN LIGHT
CREATURE 5
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 169
Initiative Perception +13
Treasure: As in area C26, the chandelier incorporates
a removable everburning torch.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check
while perusing this collection turns up a slender volume
called Ineffable Hauntings tucked inside of a larger
book about ghosts. This volume contains the formula
for the create undead ritual to create poltergeists. It also
contains a detailed, academic analysis of the ghostly
weapon spell. A character who can cast 3rd‑level arcane
or occult spells can use these notes to retrain a 3rd-level
spell they know into ghostly weapon with only 1 day
of downtime. A wizard can simply transcribe this spell
into their spellbook. This book is worth 20 gp.
Among these tomes are enough texts to present 1
Bulk of books to Morlibint.
C28. PRIVATE WASHROOM
The bathtub and commode in this room are surprisingly clean.
Although a minor enchantment to keep this room
clean still operates, there’s little of interest here.
C29. ABANDONED GUARD POST
This now-empty room was once a guard post. Nothing
remains other than a broken iron stool and a well-used
whetstone. The stairs beyond the door to the south
lead down to area D1.
C30. SIEGE CASTLE HISTORY
SEVERE 3
This room is locked. The heroes can unlock it with
the key from area C27 or with four successful DC 25
Thievery checks. Alternatively, they can Force it Open
with a successful DC 22 Athletics check.
Shelves line the walls, while what appears to be a partially
completed—or perhaps partially ruined—sculpture of a
sprawling city sits atop a ﬁve-foot-diameter circular table.
The sculpture is of Absalom, depicted with heavy
damage in several areas. With a successful DC 20 Society
check to Recall Knowledge, a hero can conﬁrm that the
damage roughly matches what the city was said to have
suffered over the centuries from all of the siege attempts it
repelled, up until about 500 years ago (it doesn’t include
