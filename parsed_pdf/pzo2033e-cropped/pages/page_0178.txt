various mercenary hunters all used the lodge in a series
of uneasy truces enforced by Belcorra and her Children.
These fragile truces fell apart when Belcorra died, and
the lodge has changed hands several times since then.
The calignis currently holed up within are insular and
reclusive. They only rarely leave to hunt, as their leader
Galudu takes care of most of their needs. The heroes’
best way to meet them peacefully is to speak with Dulac
in the shrine (area H8). Otherwise, the calignis view
anyone barging in here as a threat, and the heroes must
be especially diplomatic to placate them.
The door had a massive lock, but it was smashed
long ago. Now, the calignis bar the door from the
inside. It can’t be Forced Open, but it can be destroyed
(Hardness 15, Hit Points 60). It’s also protected by the
glyph described below.
Glyph of Warding: Galudu placed a glyph of warding
on this door that affects any non-caligni who touches
it. It contains a 5th-level lightning bolt (DC 26 basic
Reﬂex save; DC 26 to notice and disarm the glyph).
I22. GREAT HALL
SEVERE 9
This large hall was once grand and impressive. Now the
walls’ murals are chipped and stained, the ﬂoor is covered
with mud, and the few pieces of furniture look like they’ve
been hastily repaired many times. A ﬁre pit sits at the
center of the chamber.
Once a lively meeting place and
banquet hall for hunters, the
area now serves as an outpost
where caligni refugees keep a
careful watch for intruders. The two smaller
doors of the area are unlocked, but the large double
door to the west is barred from this side.
Creatures: Three calignis try to contain intruders
and keep them from penetrating any deeper into the
lodge. If possible, a defender moves to the smaller
doors and knocks on them, alerting the other
calignis to an attack. This brings the calignis in area
I23; together, this makes up a Severe encounter for
9th‑level characters. If Custodian Dulac accompanies
the heroes, the calignis grudgingly point her toward
area I25 to speak with Galudu.
