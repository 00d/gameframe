While you have the Ebon Fulcrum Lens invested, and
you’re a corporeal creature, you become insubstantial,
gain the incorporeal trait, and are drained 2. Your drained
condition can’t be reduced below 2 as long as you have the
lens invested.
You can activate the lens in the following
ways. Both require expenditures of glimmers
within the lens; once the lens is depleted
of its three glimmers, it retains its ability
to make corporeal creatures insubstantial
but can’t be used for its other abilities
until its glimmers are restored (which
generally requires a ritual or being steeped
in an area of Nhimbaloth’s power).

would be destroyed and are able to rejuvenate;

a glimmer of Nhimbaloth’s essence for power; reduce the
number of glimmers remaining in the lens by 1. You’re

extra action to Stride or Step, or for an action in a special
ghost ability you have.

TRANSMUTATION
Price 160 gp
Usage varies (see text); Bulk varies (see text)
You can unfold this virtuoso percussion instrument into
a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with
a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk),
or a large standing drum set with a built-in
stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum’s
size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the
drums must have suﬃcient open space to
accommodate their new size or they can’t
be unfolded.
Activate Ȱɵ Interact (concentrate) Frequency
once per hour; Eﬀect You play a pounding rhythm

FULCRUM LATTICE
ITEM 11
UNIQUE
OCCULT
TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,200 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This silver and copper framework is shaped
to hold four focusing lenses, one behind the
other, from smallest to largest. It has a socketed base
to be mounted into a stand, such as that found atop a
lighthouse. The Fulcrum Lattice was speciﬁcally designed
to hold the four fulcrum lenses from smallest to largest
(ebon, crimson, ochre, emerald), and it hums slightly while
within 10 feet of any fulcrum lens. A fulcrum lens slotted
into the Fulcrum Lattice has no Bulk; the lattice
remains at 1 Bulk. Inserting or removing a
lens from the Fulcrum Lattice requires an
Interact action.
The Fulcrum Lattice channels the
power of fulcrum lenses joined with
it. While you hold the Fulcrum Lattice,
lenses socketed into it are considered
to be in your hand for the purpose of
activating their abilities. When you make
a melee spell attack with a lens in the
Fulcrum Lattice, you use the highest melee
spell attack modiﬁer of any lens in the lattice,
or you can use your melee attack modiﬁer
with simple weapons if it’s greater.

Price 240 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
