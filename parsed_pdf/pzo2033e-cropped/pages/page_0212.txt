to hide her predations upon the world so that even
Pharasma can’t readily ﬁnd her, and one particularly
blasphemous tale in The Whispering Reeds speaks of
a hidden scar that Pharasma bears to this day as a
reminder of her failed attempt to decisively defeat the
Empty Death—a scar, supposedly, in the pattern of
seven divots of ﬂesh where Nhimbaloth fed upon the
essence of the Goddess of Death.
Whether or not this myth has any basis in fact,
the faithful of Pharasma view Nhimbaloth and
her cult with a combination of hatred and fearful
respect. Only the most devout and powerful of
Pharasma’s worshippers receive leave to hunt
Nhimbaloth’s faithful, and they work hard to
prevent lay worshippers from learning much of the
Empty Death. Their justification—that Nhimbaloth
feeds only on ghosts, and that by defeating or
preventing the formation of theses undead, they
strike blows against the Empty Death—reads to
some as an excuse.
Nhimbaloth (CE)
The Empty Death’s sphere of inﬂuence
encompasses
despair,
ghosts,
and
swamps. As with most of the Outer Gods,
Nhimbaloth cares nothing for those who
worship her (and thus her clerics have no
key anathemas), yet those who venerate
the Empty Death nonetheless toil in vain to
attract her favor.
Edicts create undead (particularly incorporeal
undead), feast upon carnivores that have recently
feasted upon others
Anathema none

LIFT NATURE’S CAUL
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
FEAR
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Cast ʚʖ somatic, verbal
Range 5-foot emanation; Targets creatures in the area
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
With a wave of the hand, you cause the targets to see
the world around them as if a gauzy ﬁlm had been lifted
away to expose the truth that lies below their perceived
reality. Natural features they can see grow twisted and
horrendous, structures appear distorted and ruined, and
objects seem warped and alien. This alternate vision fades
quickly, but the glimpse beyond the natural world lingers
for the spell’s duration.
Aberrations or worshippers of Outer Gods or Great Old
Ones are bolstered by this vision of warped reality and gain
a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws and attack rolls
for 1 minute, while all other creatures must attempt a Will
saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and temporarily
immune for 1 hour.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute and
frightened 1.
Critical Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute and
frightened 2. It can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1 as long as it remains stupeﬁed by
this spell.
Heightened (+2) You increase the area by 5 feet and the
duration of the stupeﬁed condition by 1 minute.
FEARFUL FEAST
FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON
FEAR
MENTAL
NECROMANCY
Cast Ǻȓ somatic; Trigger A creature within range becomes
frightened.
Range 30 feet; Targets the triggering creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You open your mouth wide and inhale sharply; you draw
in the bravery, self-conﬁdence, and hope to which the
frightened target clings and then strip away the target’s
false assumption that these fragile emotions can save
them from the oblivion of terror. The target’s stolen hope
reinvigorates you.
You deal 6d4 mental damage to the creature, which
must attempt a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage; you regain Hit
Points equal to half the damage the target takes.
Critical Failure The creature’s frightened condition
increases by 1 (to a maximum of frightened 4) and it
takes double damage; you regain Hit Points equal to half
the damage the target takes.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4.
