Acidic slimes are relatively uncommon compared
to other types. They are typically created by the
magical properties of creatures and items that have
melted in a pool of acid, with the remaining magic
dispersing within the acid pool, giving rise to an
acidic slime.
Usually, only strong and chaotic magics can endure
in acidic liquids, imparting a chaotic and aggressive
nature to the slime formed by such magic.

Poison slimes are exceedingly rare, and their cre-
ation involves very specific methods. Often, they
originate from other slime types that have perished
and become filled with poison gas or natural fumes.
Another common method is the deliberate creation
by an alchemist who specializes in poisons or in
toxic underground caves and dungeons.
