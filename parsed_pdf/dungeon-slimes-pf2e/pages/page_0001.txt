The common Dungeon slime is typically formed
from the residue of magical creatures or abandoned
magical alchemical ingredients.
They do not possess any special abilities, but their
oobleck-like form is quite bouncy. It is rare to see
even the lowliest of adventurers fall to such a sim-
ple creature.

Cave slimes are typically more bottom-heavy and
are created through the interaction of magical
natural flora and liquids in isolated locations. Over
time, influenced by the ambient magic of the area or
the surrounding ecosystem, they gradually take on
a distinct form. These slimes tend to become more
magic-hungry as they develop and seek to consume
magical grass or rocks. Due to their nature, they
often form in caves, hence their name.
