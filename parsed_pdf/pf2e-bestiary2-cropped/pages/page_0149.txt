IRLGAUNT RELIGION
A small number of irlgaunts actively
worship Rovagug, whom they believe
to be the progenitor of their species.
Instead of living solitary lives,
these chaotic evil irlgaunts form
cabals that inhabit deep ﬁssures,
transforming them into grisly
temples by decorating them with
the corpses of their sacriﬁces. They
also decorate their own bodies by
carving prayers into their chitin and
painting themselves with crude and
disturbing images. Some claim these
runes grant them divine powers of
protection and the ability to summon
Rovagug’s otherworldly kin.
Irlgaunt
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils
erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow
them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines
that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible
alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without
pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful
ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating
gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive
enzymes strong enough to break down ﬂesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and
explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because ﬁnding enough food
to sustain a community tends to be difﬁcult. However, they still maintain a sense
of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to
discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been
known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.
