HATRED OF DRAGONS
Some scholars have speculated
that behirs are somehow related to
blue dragons, citing their reptilian
features, lightning breath, and ability
to speak the Draconic language,
but such scholars would do well
to keep such opinions from behirs
they encounter in the ﬁeld. Nothing
infuriates a behir faster than likening
it to a dragon!
Behir
The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short
legs, each ending in three hooked talons. A behir can live to 80 years, but most
perish far younger to violence. Fully grown, a behir is 40 feet long and weighs
4,000 pounds.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The behir breathes lightning that
deals 9d6 electricity damage in an 60‑foot line (DC 27 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t use
Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Claw Storm ̂ˬ The behir Strides up to its Speed, during which it can
walk on air as if it were solid ground, ascending or descending at
up to a 45-degree angle. It can make up to four claw
Strikes at any point during this movement,
each against a diﬀerent target
within reach, and it deals an
extra 1d6 electricity damage
with each Strike. These attacks
count toward the behir’s multiple
attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until
after the behir makes all of its attacks.
If the behir moves half its Speed or less
during a Claw Storm, that movement doesn’t
trigger reactions. The behir can’t use Claw
Storm if it has a creature wrapped in its coils.
At the end of Claw Storm, it drifts downward up
to 60 feet to the ground, landing softly and taking
no damage from the fall. If it descends further
than 60 feet, it takes damage normally
from the remaining fall.
