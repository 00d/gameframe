SLUGS OF WAR
Subterranean cultures like
urdefhans and xulgaths sometimes
turn giant slugs into war beasts.
The creatures’ primitive minds make
them easy to control for anyone
who knows a few simple tactics—
mostly ways of keeping them
well-fed until just before battle and
methods of guiding them in the
right direction as they rampage.
Slug
These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through
swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat ﬂesh
or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare
entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they ﬁrst
shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth—
to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully
acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip
that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near
swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many
almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each
giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into
proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated,
and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these
eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.
Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry
weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides
of bridges, or even fortiﬁcations like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break.
Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but
instead ﬁnds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant
slugs don’t have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in
particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily
compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable,
so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.

Malleable The giant slug can ﬁt through tight spaces as if it
were a Large creature. While Squeezing, it can move at its
full Speed. It can Squeeze through spaces that typically ﬁt
only a Medium creature, but it does so at the usual Speed
for Squeezing.
Mucus Any creature hit by the giant slug or that moves
into its mucus trail is coated in sticky, caustic mucus.
It takes 1d4 persistent acid damage and takes
a –5-foot status penalty to its Speeds while the
damage persists.
Mucus Trail Any square the giant slug moves into is
coated in mucus. These spaces are diﬃcult terrain, and
any creature that moves into one or ends its turn in one is
subjected to the slug’s mucus. After an hour, the mucus dries
and the area is no longer diﬃcult terrain.
Trample ̂ˬ Large or smaller, foot, DC 27
