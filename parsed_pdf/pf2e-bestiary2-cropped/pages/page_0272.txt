UMONLEE FABLES
While they’re immense, violent,
and frightening, umonlees aren’t
inherently evil creatures. As such,
there are stories of youths, gnomes,
or other small-statured creatures
who encounter umonlees in the wild
and manage to befriend them, so that
at some later point in the tale when
the pint-sized protagonists are in
peril, their enormous ally can arrive,
bursting from a nearby glacier to
play the role of overwhelming savior.
Whether or not these tales have any
basis in truth is unknown.
Umonlee
Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that
swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes.
Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the
Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.
Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service
of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are
semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are
not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafﬁcked
areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse
group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path
of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that
crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by
an encounter with one of these monstrosities.
Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as
the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean
predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they
can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to
this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of
alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these
alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren’t evil argues well
against such a theory.

Freezing Breath ʚʖ (cold, evocation, incapacitation,
primal) The umonlee breathes a cone of extremely
cold air that damages its prey and can freeze
them to the ground. Its breath deals 12d8 cold
damage to creatures in the 50-foot cone (DC
38 Reﬂex save). The umonlee can’t use Freezing
Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage and is
slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is slowed 1
for 1 round. If the creature is standing on the ground, it’s
immobilized as thick ice forms around it, and it can’t recover from
being slowed. The creature remains immobilized and slowed 1
until it manages to Escape (DC 36) or deal 30 damage to the
ice, which has weakness 10 to ﬁre.
Critical Failure As failure, except the creature takes double
damage and the ice holding it in place requires 60 damage
to break.
