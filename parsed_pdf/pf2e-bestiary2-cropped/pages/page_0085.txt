DOLPHINS TO THE RESCUE
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual
trait—they often come to the aid of
other creatures in distress, such as to
save a drowning person or to protect
someone from the attack of a shark.
Not every monster in this book
wants to hurt player characters—
consider having a dolphin come to
an endangered PC’s rescue if the
situation merits!
Dolphin
Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite
social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans.
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin.
They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups
called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell tales of how
they save drowning ﬁshers or kill sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.

Large or smaller creature hit by this attack must succeed at
a DC 16 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1 round.
ORCA
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually
the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt
together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true
whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh
8,000–12,000 pounds.

Breach ʚʖ The orca Swims up to its swim Speed, then
Leaps vertically out of the water up to 25 feet in the
air, making a Strike against a creature at any point
during the jump (this lets it attack a creature within
30 feet of the water’s surface). After the Strike, the orca splashes back down into
the water.
