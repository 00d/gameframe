QUEENS OF THE NIGHT
The four queens of the night wield
great power in the Pit. Ardad Lili
is a plotter and manipulator with
ambitions of ruling the heavens, while
Doloras revels in suﬀering. Most
distant is Mahathallah, watching over
fate and death. Mightiest among them
is Eiseth, who is assembling an army
in Dis in the hopes of claiming the iron
throne of Malebolge.

action or attempts a melee Strike against the gylou; Eﬀect The gylou lashes out with a

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The
gylou adopts the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid.
This doesn’t change their Speed or the attack and damage modiﬁers
of their Strikes, but it might change the damage type their Strikes
deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Indispensable Savvy Ǻȓ Frequency once per day; Trigger The gylou
attempts a skill check but hasn’t rolled yet; Eﬀect The gylou demonstrates
a preternatural ability for the task at hand. They use their Deception modiﬁer for the
triggering check and for all skill checks using the same skill thereafter until the next
time the gylou uses this ability or until 24 hours have passed, whichever happens ﬁrst.
Tentacle Encage Ȱɵ (attack) Requirements The gylou has a Medium or smaller creature
grabbed; Eﬀect The gylou transfers the grabbed creature into their lower body’s
net of encaging tentacles, freeing their limbs and tentacles to make Strikes. This
has the same eﬀects as Swallow Whole (Medium, 2d12+12 bludgeoning,
Rupture 30), except the encaged creature is not at risk of suﬀocation,
and the gylou can bring the encaged creature with them when
they cast dimension door. A gylou can have only one creature
encaged at a time.
CORNUGON (HORNED DEVIL)
Hell’s armies contain legions upon legions of
different devils all suited precisely to their roles.
But such an army needs able commanders,
and it is this role that cornugons ﬁll. Their
mere presence inspires those under their
command to improved performance—
often through fear of the horrible
torments that a cornugon can unleash as
punishment for failure. Forged in the ﬁres
of Malebolge from the most renowned
warriors among lesser devilkind, even
the least cornugon is among the ﬁercest
warriors of the multiverse. The greatest
among them on occasion ascend further
still, becoming those rare and feared
legends of Hell called malebranche.
