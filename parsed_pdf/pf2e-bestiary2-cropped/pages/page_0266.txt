NAR-VOTH DELICACIES
Both cavern trolls and xorns—squat,
tripartite earth elementals—share a
voracious appetite for deposits of
precious minerals. When either group
encounters the other, a frenzy of
claws and ravenous gorging ensues
until only one side remains. Powerful
cavern trolls who consume a critical
mass of xorns can gain tremorsense
and rule as monarchs over their
subterranean kin.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
vulnerability to sunlight that petriﬁes them on sustained contact. Unlike common
trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by ﬁre. The crystalline nature of
their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their ﬂinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete
with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and
weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Sunlight Petrification If exposed to direct sunlight, a cavern troll immediately
becomes slowed 1 and can’t use reactions or Trample. The slowed value increases
by 1 each time the cavern troll ends its turn in sunlight. If the cavern troll’s
actions are reduced to 0 in this way, they become petrified until they
spends at least 1 minute in darkness. Spells like sunburst that
create magical sunlight cannot petrify a cavern troll, but the
troll is slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to
such an effect.

TWO-HEADED TROLL
Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-
minded monsters with an unquenchable
thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their
ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the
lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke
the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children.
“Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or
a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow
you whole!” It’s unclear why such a morbid tradition gained
traction with parents, but it’s an undeniable fact that two-
headed trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures
small enough to devour with one bite.
Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height,
weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common
trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright
gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk
hunched over.
