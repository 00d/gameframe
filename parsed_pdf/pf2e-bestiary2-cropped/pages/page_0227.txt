OTHER RAYS
Stingrays and manta rays are among
the most common species of these
ﬁsh, but others dwell in more remote
areas. The dangerous blood ray is
an ambush predator that dwells in
murky swamp waters and drains
creature’s blood after paralyzing them
with its sting, while the immense
leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator
that has a deadly mouth capable of
swallowing small ships whole.
Ray
Rays are an unusual type of ﬁsh with wide, sail-like ﬁns and long tails, giving them
an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have
a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical
charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent
in its accuracy.
STINGRAY
Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when
threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their
toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and
unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray
is a sureﬁre way to receive a painful sting.

MANTA RAY
While manta rays might
appear daunting, they are
generally docile. Manta rays are
found in temperate or tropical oceans,
and they generally stay in the upper reaches
or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are
ﬁlter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also
eat larger ﬁsh or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but
rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater
cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta
rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets.
Manta rays don’t make particularly good mounts, but some
aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.
