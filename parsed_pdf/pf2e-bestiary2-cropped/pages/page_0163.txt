GNOLL MASTERS
Leucrottas often associate with
gnolls. They never submit to serve
others as beasts of burden, but they
sometimes permit gnoll leaders who
impress them to ride them into battle
as steeds. More often, a leucrotta
considers itself to be the true leader
of a gnoll clan, whispering and
manipulating a gnoll warchief into
doing its bidding or (if it tires of the
game) goading them into challenging
the leucrotta for leadership and then
taking over the clan directly after
eliminating its rival.
Leucrotta
The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas,
leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry
to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can ﬁrst torment and then devour
them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they
are perpetually ﬁlthy. A leucrotta’s oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged,
hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through ﬂesh, bone, and
even steel with ease.

The leucrotta’s last action was
Sound
Mimicry;
Eﬀect
The
leucrotta utters a plaintive cry to
draw its prey closer. Each creature
within the emanation that was
deceived by Sound Mimicry must
succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become
fascinated and compelled to move toward the sound of the
leucrotta’s voice on their turn. Fascinated creatures are
also ﬂat-footed. If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated
condition ends only for the creature that is attacked.
If the leucrotta speaks a creature’s name while
using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a –2
circumstance penalty to their saving throw to
resist the ability. On a successful save, a creature
is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours.
Sound Mimicry Ȱɵ The leucrotta perfectly imitates
voices and speech and attempts a Deception check
against listeners’ Will DC to fool them. The leucrotta
gains a +4 bonus to this Deception check if it has
listened to the creature it’s imitating for at least
10 minutes at any point in the last 24 hours. The
leucrotta can’t duplicate voice-based abilities or
spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound
of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to
deceive constructs or undead that respond to
voice commands. The leucrotta can’t imitate
speech in languages it doesn’t know.
