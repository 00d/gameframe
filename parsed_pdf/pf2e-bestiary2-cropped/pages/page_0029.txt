VARISIAN NURSERY RHYME
Is the attic whispering?
Are we safe below?
Do you think he’s listening?
Is that his shadow?
Do you hear him waking,
Up above the stairs?
Do you hear him weeping?
Is he really there?
Can you say “I’m speaking?”
Are you saying naught?
Is it you who’s weeping?
Is it you he’s caught?
Attic Whisperer
Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the pained wrath of
an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of their caretakers.
Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in
a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of
blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles. To give themselves
the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with a small animal’s skull.
Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old inﬁrmaries, orphanages, and other
such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades
in hopes that they might one day ﬁnd a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness.
When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches
by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers
intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from
living creatures as their dark impulses take over.

Aura of Sobs (auditory, aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) 10 feet. An attic whisperer
enshrouds itself in a tapestry of stolen voices. Each living creature that enters or starts
their turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or the unnerving, bitter sobs
render them distraught and they become stupeﬁed 1 for as long as they remain within the
aura. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour. The attic whisperer can
activate or deactivate the aura with a single free action, which has the concentrate trait.

is destroyed or the curse is removed.
