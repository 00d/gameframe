INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
A trumpet archon’s magical
instrument is no mere piece of
brass; each of these immaculately
crafted horns is said to be crafted
in Heaven’s blessed forges and
infused with the voices of a thousand
angels. Only archons can truly
play such trumpets—mortals lack
the power necessary to create
trumpet archons’ iconic clarion
calls, but can still play them as
virtuoso instruments.
TRUMPET ARCHON
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers­—embodiments of
the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and
among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps
leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet
archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon
is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

STAR ARCHON
Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star
archons serve as philosophers and administrators,
and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and
generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory
and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are
as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and
unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather
than on battleﬁelds, star archons are ﬁerce opponents when motivated to enter
