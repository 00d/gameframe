FIRST WORLD CONNECTIONS
Linnorms have a deep connection to
the First World, the primordial home
of the fey. While linnorms typically
won’t think twice before devouring
a gnome or other fey, they do have
an unusual respect for wielders of
powerful primal magic. The only
way to cow a linnorm, according
to common wisdom, is to remind it
that there are forces of nature even
stronger than itself.

CAIRN LINNORM
Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes
in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some
point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a
service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any
creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb
without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the
deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a
cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won’t leave until it has secured permission
to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone’s guess; nevertheless,
reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade
even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts
or mausoleums.
