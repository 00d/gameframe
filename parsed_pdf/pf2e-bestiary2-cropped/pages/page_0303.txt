YETH HOUND ALLIES
When an evil cult engages the
services of a yeth hound, the
process is more like forging an
alliance than animal training. Yeth
hound allies can provide much more
complex services than a typical
animal, but they also present the
risk of possible treachery.
Yeth Hound
Wicked canine creatures who live for the thrill of the hunt, yeth hounds often
serve evil masters as guardians and trackers. Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek
dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the
ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent,
although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate
tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside
when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten
and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a
dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to
corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their
lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from
the hounds’ previous meals.
Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt
only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a
subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their
prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight,
working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when
then can’t simply overpower and kill them.
Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound
servants by ﬁendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to
turn against those who fail to advance the patrons’ wicked aims. The cult of
Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.

(auditory,
concentrate,
divine,
enchantment, fear, mental) The yeth hound emits
an unearthly howl audible up
to 300 feet away. Any non-
ﬁend creature that hears the
howl must succeed at a DC 20
Will save or become frightened
1. Any creature that critically
fails and is within 60 feet of the
yeth hound is instead frightened
3 and ﬂeeing for 1d4 rounds (or
until it recovers from its frightened
condition). Whether it succeeds or fails
the saving throw, the creature is then
temporarily immune to Bay for 24 hours.
Sinister Bite A good creature bitten by a yeth
hound must attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a
critical success, the creature is temporarily immune
to sinister bite for 1 minute. A creature that fails
becomes frightened 1, or increases the value of its
frightened condition by 1 if already frightened.
