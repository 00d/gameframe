ANT HIVES
Giant ants form vast underground
colonies, excavating deep burrows
or infesting existing caverns. Ants
are omnivorous and cultivate fungus
farms, but they are happy to eat
whatever presents itself. Humanoids
and their domesticated animals are
easy fuel for the insectile machinery
of their hives. Worker ants lack the
sting of their warrior cousins, while
elite drones ﬂy on gossamer wings
(ﬂy Speed of 30 feet) to seek new
food sources for their queen.
Ant
Ants are industrious insects that aid the natural processes of decay and renewal.
GIANT ANT
Giant ants are much like their smaller kin in their industrious habits, though
growing to the size of ponies makes them much deadlier.
