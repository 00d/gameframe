DEBASED AND DISTORTED
Vrykolakas are corrupted bestial
versions of their appearance in life,
and are emaciated and pockmarked
with disease. Their spines are bent
in a perpetual hunch. While some
vrykolakas can cloak themselves
in a semblance of living ﬂesh, their
fragmented memories often cannot
accurately recreate their former
appearance or persona. They may not
recognize former family and friends
(and vice versa), but those they
do remember are marked as their
favored victims.
reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to
saving throws against the vrykolakas’s Feral Possession.
Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.
VRYKOLAKAS SPAWN
Vrykolakas unleash their spawn upon the world to spread terror, plague, and
suffering and to draw attention away from their masters.
