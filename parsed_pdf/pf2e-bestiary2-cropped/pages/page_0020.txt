Ankou
Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even the Eldest—
the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey
rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied
threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak
aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic
whisper directly into a victim’s mind. While an ankou’s body is made of strange,
ﬂeshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-
sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical
ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.
While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are
left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In
some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have
been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge
their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!

dimensional anchor; 2nd silence; 1st ray of enfeeblement
Shadow Doubles Ȱɵ to ̂ˬ (illusion, occult, shadow)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect For each action spent to
use this ability, the ankou creates one shadowy duplicate
of themself anywhere within 60 feet of themself.
Shadow doubles have the same statistics as an ankou,
but they have the summoned trait, have 84 Hit Points,
can’t use Shadow Doubles or innate spells, and have
an attack bonus of +25 for their Strikes. A shadow
double that attempts a saving throw against
a light eﬀect can’t get a result better than
failure. Each double remains for 1 round,
until it’s reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until
it moves further than 120 feet from the
ankou, whichever comes ﬁrst. Each round thereafter, the ankou can spend a single
action that has the concentrate trait to extend the duration of surviving duplicates by
1 round, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. The ankou can see through the eyes of
all of the shadow doubles at once. A character who Seeks can identify an ankou as
real or a shadow double with a successful DC 39 Perception check.
Sneak Attack An ankou’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to
flat-footed creatures.
ANKOU GUILDS
The most dangerous ankous are
those who have rebelled against their
masters. Ankous of this nature are
more powerful, gathering others to
form deadly “guilds” of assassins that
pursue common goals in the most
dangerous parts of the First World.
