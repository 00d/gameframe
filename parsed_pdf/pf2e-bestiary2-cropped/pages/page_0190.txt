ONI SHAPECHANGERS
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one
speciﬁc appearance. An ogre mage can
assume only one speciﬁc ogre form,
while an ice yai can appear only as
one speciﬁc frost giant. Some oni have
greater control over their shapeshifting
power and can assume the form of any
humanoid creature, and these oni tend
to be the most dangerous.

ICE YAI
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More
than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the ﬂesh, but in ﬂesh
itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice
yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into
powerful ﬁghting machines.
