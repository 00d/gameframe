BLUE WEEK
Those living in areas where rusalkas
dwell know well to avoid the water
during the week-long period in
early Sarenith when the fey become
particularly active, a time known in
many regions as Blue Week. Most
villages prohibit swimming and
ﬁshing during this time, though the
prohibition is diﬃcult to enforce, as it
takes place during the height of good
weather. Particularly superstitious
folk take care to lock their doors
both from within and without.
Rusalka
These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of
those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break
their victims’ wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for
continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas’ defense, as the shame their
captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.

Primal Innate Spells DC 35; 5th  charm (at will), control water (at
will); 2nd invisibility (at will), obscuring mist (at will); Constant
(6th) water walk
Beckoning Call  Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, enchantment, incapacitation,
mental, primal) The rusalka cries out a compelling invitation. Each
non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation must attempt a DC 27
Will save. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if the rusalka uses Beckoning
Call again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for
all aﬀected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against
Beckoning Call, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated and must spend each of its actions to
move closer to the rusalka, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned
creature is adjacent to the rusalka, it stays still and doesn’t act. If
attacked by the rusalka, the creature is freed from captivation at the
end of the rusalka’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but if attacked by the rusalka, the creature
can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than
being freed at the end of the rusalka’s turn.
Constrict Ȱɵ 2d8+10 bludgeoning, DC 32
Entangling Tresses A rusalka can have up to eight creatures grabbed within their
tresses at a time.
Flowing Hair Ȱɵ The rusalka attempts an Athletics check against each
grabbed creature’s Fortitude DC. The rusalka moves each creature
they succeed against up to 10 feet and each creature they critically
succeed against up to 20 feet. This movement must all be within
reach of its tresses.
Shameful Touch Ȱɵ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) The rusalka
touches a creature within 5 feet using their hand, stirring up memories
of regret and shame. The target must attempt a DC 35
Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target is sickened 1.
Failure The creature is sickened 1 and stunned 1.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 1 and stunned 1,
and it must use its ﬁrst action on its next turn to Strike
itself, automatically hitting.
