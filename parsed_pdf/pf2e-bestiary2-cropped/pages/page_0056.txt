CRAB SPECIES
Crabs can be found along all of the
world’s coastlines, from relatively
small creatures like the king crab or
the coconut crab, to truly oversized
monsters like the great reef crab,
shark-eating crab, or the lumbering
shipwrecker crab.
Crab
Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways
gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and ﬁght other crabs for
territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs
prefer to ﬂee, but when retreat isn’t possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly
as they can.
The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water’s
surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations
to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain
darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of
the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.
These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size
makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.

Vulnerable to Prone If a creature critically succeeds on a check to Trip the giant crab, the
crab is ﬂipped over onto its back in addition to the usual eﬀects. A giant crab that is
ﬂipped onto its back has a particularly hard time defending itself; instead of taking the
normal –2 circumstance penalty to AC for being ﬂat-footed, it takes a –4 circumstance
penalty to AC.
Scuttle Ǻȓ Trigger A creature that the giant crab can see targets the crab with an attack;
Eﬀect The giant crab scuttles to the side and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
against the triggering attack. After the attack resolves, the crab can Stride up to its
speed in a straight line as part of the reaction.
