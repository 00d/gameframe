THE WITCH-TREE
The ﬁrst sard was created when
the Eldest known as the Green
Mother beckoned the sky’s rage to
strike the eldest oak in her domain,
transforming the tree into a living
siege engine. This original sard still
stands sentinel in the Hanging Bower
of the First World.
Sard
An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of
the First World, this monster—one of the legendary Tane—skitters on huge, spidery
roots and thrashes its branches as ﬁery lightning courses within its blackened bark,
a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.
