ARMORED ARCHONS
Always ready to defend others, most
archons are never encountered out of
their suits of armor. Even those who
eschew armor, such as the bastion
archon, tend to still appear as if they
are wearing heavy protection against
the scourge of battle.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven’s Holy
Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt
that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of
sacriﬁce, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested,
and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness
upon the surrounding region.

Ultimate Sacriﬁce (divine, good, healing, necromancy) If the
bastion archon is slain by an evil creature, it explodes in a
geyser of holy light, restoring 140 HP to all good-aligned
creatures in a 40-foot emanation. The ground in the aﬀected
area is also subjected to a level 10 consecrate ritual, and the
ground is consecrated for 10 years (or only 24 hours if the
ultimate sacriﬁce took place in Hell, Abaddon, or the Abyss).
