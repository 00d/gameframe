GLASS GOLEM COMPONENTS
The destruction of a glass golem
often leaves nothing behind but a
pile of tiny shards of crystal and lead.
However, if larger pieces survive, the
crystal can be sold to glass merchants
or skilled crafters who can turn them
into glittering works of art.
Ranged Ȱɵ splinter +16 (magical, range increment 30 feet), Damage 2d4+8 piercing
Splinter Volley ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The wood golem makes up to four splinter
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the wood golem’s
multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the
wood golem makes all of its attacks.
GLASS GOLEM
Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems
are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often
protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power
of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of
their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems.
Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds
that bleed profusely.
Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a
work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature
regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem’s colorful
glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.

The glass golem is targeted by a spell; Eﬀect
The glass golem positions its magical, reﬂective
surfaces to turn the spell back on the caster. It
tries to counteract the spell by attempting an
Acrobatics check for its counteract check. If it
successfully counteract the spell, the eﬀect is
turned back on the caster.

Dazzling Brilliance ʚʖ (evocation, light, visual) The glass golem creates waves of
scintillating luminosity that cast bright light in a 60-foot emanation (and dim
light for the next 60 feet). The light lasts until the start of the glass golem’s
next turn, after which the glass golem can’t use Dazzling Brilliance for 1d4 rounds. A
creature within the bright light or that enters the bright light must attempt a DC 23
Will save.

4 rounds.
