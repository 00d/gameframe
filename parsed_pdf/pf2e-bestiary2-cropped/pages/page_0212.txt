PSYCHOPOMP COURTS
Psychopomps rarely oppose
celestials or ﬁends. In fact, they
frequently host such creatures in
the Boneyard, particularly in the
sprawling psychopomp courts where
these outsiders petition for one
soul or another to be remanded to
their jurisdiction. Complicated cases
are judged by yamarajes, while the
thorniest or most politically delicate
are handed by Pharasma herself.
YAMARAJ
The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose
wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma
herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an
emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the
senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly
individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in
their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.
