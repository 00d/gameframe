MOTHER OF TROLLS
Trolls and ettins do not normally
seek one another as mates, but this
pairing is the source of the original
two-headed trolls—such couplings
were engineered and arranged by
the cult of Lamashtu in ages past.
Oblivious to their origin, two-headed
trolls tend to give no deference to
the Mother of Monsters.
TWO-HEADED TROLL
CREATURE 8
UNCOMMON
CE
LARGE
GIANT
TROLL
Perception +18; darkvision
Skills Athletics +18, Intimidation +17
Languages Jotun
Str +6, Dex +1, Con +6, Int –2, Wis +4, Cha +3
Independent Brains Each of a two-headed troll’s heads rolls their own initiative and has
their own turn. Neither head can Delay. At the start of a head’s turn, that head gets 2
actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls one of the troll’s arms, but both can move the
legs. Any ability that would sever a two-headed troll’s head (such as the vorpal weapon
property) doesn’t cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head,
but does cause them to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head.
Mental eﬀects that target a single creature aﬀect only one of the troll’s heads.
Items club
AC 24; Fort +20, Ref +15, Will +14
HP 190, regeneration 25 (deactivated by acid or ﬁre); Weaknesses ﬁre 10
Head Regrowth A two-headed troll’s regeneration can regrow a severed head. After
regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the two-headed troll attempts a DC 10 ﬂat
check. On a success, the missing head is fully restored. If a two-headed troll
loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +18 (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d12+8 piercing

Reactive Chomp Ȱɵ Requirements One of the troll’s heads hit the
same enemy with two consecutive claw Strikes in the same
round; Eﬀect The other head uses their reaction to make a
jaws Strike against the creature that was hit.
JOTUND TROLL
Jotund
trolls
are
gigantic,
nine-headed
horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes,
and wastelands, always alone and always
enraged. While each of the jotund troll’s nine
heads possess their own brains and senses,
they work much more in tandem than the
dual-minded nature of the two-headed
troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and
bicker, particularly over which head gets to
eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the
same shared stomach makes little difference
in such culinary disagreements.
Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund
troll represents a primordial, if not
original, shape and design for the ﬁrst
trolls to plague the world, arising from a
mythical realm in the Great Beyond known
as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be
nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary
home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the
jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague
the Material Plane as punishment or challenge,
or if it’s merely an evocative legend told
by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the
jotund trolls themselves likely care little.
