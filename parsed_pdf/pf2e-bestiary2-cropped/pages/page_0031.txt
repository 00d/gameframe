BRALANI CONTESTS
Bralanis enjoy inventing games and
contests and adding new twists to
popular sports rather than following
familiar rules. Speed often features
somewhere in bralani games, whether
it be physical speed or quickness of
wit. It is not uncommon for bralanis
to seek the input of young children,
encouraging adults to draw inspiration
from a child’s creativity rather than
allowing themselves to settle into
comfortable and repetitive patterns.
Azata
Azatas embrace the love of life and the ﬁght to retain individuality and choice.
BRALANI (WIND AZATA)
Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to
test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of
good‑natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conﬂict also extends
to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure
that neither side’s desires are crushed by the other’s and work as mediators when
needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are
going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures.
They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.

the contest to harm another,
the creature grows visibly ill,
