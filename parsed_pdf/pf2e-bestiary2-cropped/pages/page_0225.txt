RAVENER PATRONS
While most dragons are too prideful
to turn to anyone, even the gods,
for help, a few who seek to become
raveners are so desperate to stave
oﬀ death that they might turn to
powerful patrons for aid, such as
demon lords, evil deities, or powerful
necromancers, oﬀering service in
exchange for their transformation.
RAVENER
The ravener presented here was once an ancient red dragon.

Redirect Fire Ǻȓ (abjuration, arcane) Trigger A creature within 100 feet casts a ﬁre spell,

ravener makes all the choices to determine the targets, destination, and other eﬀects
of the spell, as though they were the caster.

Consume Soul Ȳ˓ DC 44
Manipulate Flames Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, transmutation) The ravener attempts to take
control of a magical ﬁre or a ﬁre spell within 100 feet. If it succeeds at a counteract
check (counteract level 10, counteract modiﬁer +34), the original caster loses control
of the spell or magical ﬁre, control is transferred to the ravener, and this action counts
as the ravener having Sustained the Spell with the action (if applicable). The ravener
can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if they choose.
Ravenous Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation, ﬁre) The ravener breathes a blast of
ﬂame that deals 20d6 ﬁre damage plus 4d6 persistent negative damage (DC 44 basic
Reﬂex save). A creature that fails its save is also drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical
failure). If a creature is drained by the ravener’s Ravenous Breath Weapon, the ravener’s
soul ward gains 5 HP. The ravener can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Vicious Criticals
RAVENER HUSK
Raveners require a steady diet of souls, and a ravener that’s unable to feed for too
long eventually cannibalizes their own soul. Should a ravener’s soul ward ever be
reduced to 0 Hit Points by hunger while the ravener has more than 1 Hit Point (see
Soul Ward on page 223), they lose all traces of their former identity and descend into
a feral, nearly mindless state. Even if a ravener husk later consumes soul energy, the
transformation can be reversed only via Ravenous Repast.
