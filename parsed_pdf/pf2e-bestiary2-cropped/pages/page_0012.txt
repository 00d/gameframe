Confusing Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, emotion, incapacitation, mental, visual) 30
feet. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 34 Will save. If it fails,
it’s confused for 1 round (or 1d4 rounds on a critical failure).
Temporal Reversion Ȳ˓ (fortune) Trigger The bythos fails or critically fails a check; Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect The bythos rerolls the triggering check and takes the better result.

dimensional lock, haste, plane shift; 6th
slow; 4th dimensional anchor (at will)
Rituals DC 37; imprisonment (temporal stasis only)
Aging Strikes ʚʖ (divine, necromancy) The bythos
make two ﬁst Strikes against a single target. If both
Strikes hit, the target attempts a DC 37 Fortitude
save. Creatures that don’t get weaker with age or
don’t age are immune (GM’s discretion). If a creature becomes clumsy 4,
drained 4, and enfeebled 4 due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1,
or increases each of these conditions by 1. This eﬀect is
cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a
maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature becomes
clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2, or increases
these conditions by 2.
Focused Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate) The bythos focuses its
gaze on a creature it can see within 30 feet. The
target must attempt a save against the bythos’s
confusing gaze. A bythos can’t use this ability
against the same creature more than once per turn.
Temporal Flurry ʚʖ The bythos makes four ﬁst
Strikes. Its multiple attack penalty increases normally
with each attack.
Temporal Strike ʚʖ (divine, conjuration, incapacitation, teleportation) The
bythos touches a creature or object to displace it from time. The target
attempts a DC 37 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success Time ﬂows around the target; the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target disappears from the present moment and reappears
in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed for it.
If a creature or object occupies that space when the target returns, the
target appears in the closest available space to its original location.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is slowed 1 for an extra 1d4 rounds after
it returns.
GUARDIANS OF TIME
Bythos aeons have no innate ability
to directly enter the mysterious
Dimension of Time, but many know
of the hidden routes in the Great
Beyond one can use to travel to this
strange realm. A bythos prefers to
destroy those who seek entrance to
the Dimension of Time rather than
risk the knowledge of how to reach it
spreading too far.
