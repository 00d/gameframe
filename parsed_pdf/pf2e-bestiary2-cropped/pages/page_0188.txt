OCTOPUS SPECIES
The octopuses presented here
are smaller versions of the much
larger giant octopus, but other
species exist as well. The brightly
colored seaﬁre octopus occupies
a predatory niche somewhere
between the reef octopus and giant
octopus—its bite injects a venom
that causes a painful rash and
nausea. The immense grisly octopus
is among the largest of its kind. It
can swallow humans whole and can
squirt particularly sticky crimson
ink to incapacitate prey.
