GRODAIR TREASURE
Amid the vile, rubbery entrails of
an exploded grodair is a bizarre
cluster of tubular organs about the
size of a melon that serves as its
extradimensional water storage.
Harvesting the organ cluster
takes 5 minutes and a successful
DC 22 Survival check. For the next
2d6 hours, the cluster can then be
used produce either the “stream” or
the “fountain” eﬀect of a decanter of
endless water (Core Rulebook 573).
On a critical failure to harvest the
organ cluster, it bursts and deals 2d6
bludgeoning damage to the harvester.
Grodair
Grodairs are bizarre ﬁshlike creature native to the First World. Their supernatural
physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of
storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create
a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly
transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish
to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When
necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long,
ﬂeshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies.
Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes
the creatures difﬁcult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During
conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difﬁculty
remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing
tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they
aren’t reliable. They have difﬁculty following plans or schedules, and they can
keep a secret only if they happen to forget it ﬁrst. For these reasons, grodairs
don’t always make the best allies.
Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in
fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that
they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their
throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them
for consumption at a later time.

Muddy Field Ȱɵ (primal, transmutation,
water) The grodair transforms all soil,
sand, or similar sediment in a 10-foot
emanation into mud for 1 round. This mud is
diﬃcult terrain for creatures other than grodairs.
Organ of Endless Water Ȱɵ (conjuration, manipulate, primal,
water) The grodair causes water to pour from a magical sac on its
spine, either a stream of water at a rate of 1 gallon per round, or a fountain in a
5-foot-long stream at a rate of 5 gallons per round. It can stop the ﬂow of water as
a single action.
