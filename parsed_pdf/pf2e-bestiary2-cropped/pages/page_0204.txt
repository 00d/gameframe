OTHER PLANAR SCIONS
Two other planar scions are the
entropy-infused ganzi and their polar
opposites, the orderly aphorites,
scions of chaos and law respectively.
Eﬀect A swift gale whips up between the sylph sneak and the source of the ranged
attack, giving the sneak a +3 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the
attack misses, the wind deﬂected it. The wind can’t deﬂect unusually large or heavy
ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts).
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ starknife +9 (agile, deadly d6, ﬁnesse, versatile S), Damage 1d4+4
Ranged Ȱɵ starknife +9 (agile, deadly d6, thrown 30 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d4+1
Sneak Attack The sylph sneak’s Strikes deal 1d6 extra precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
Surprise Attacker On the ﬁrst round of combat, creatures that haven’t acted yet
are ﬂat-footed to the sylph sneak.
Wind’s Guidance When the sylph sneak attacks with a thrown weapon, the range
increment increases by 10 feet.
UNDINE
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the
briny deep ﬂows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and
lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how
much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming
communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter
case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number
dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
The undines who ﬁll these communities
are similarly diverse, bringing aspects
of multiple cultures together to
form one whole. Ship-towns are
permanent, but ﬂuid—they grow,
recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add
their ships to or remove them from the ﬂotilla. An
undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
residents coming ashore only on rare occasions
to collect wood for cookﬁres or to repair their
homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence
of these communities reﬂects the undine virtues of adaptability and
freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these ﬂoating settlements, if only
for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.
