CARBUNCLE CHATTER
“A lizard with an apple-sized
gem sticking out of its forehead?
Wishful thinking!”
“Carbuncles are real! I almost
caught one, but even though it
could barely walk, its magic allowed
it to escape my clutches.”
“Their mind control powers could
make them useful familiars, but if
you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
“My advice is to stay away from
these pests. They drink your hopes
and aspirations through their horns,
leaving you empty except for bad
luck and bellyaches.”
“Planning a carbuncle hunt?
You’d better leave your self-respect
at home, and be ready to emerge
with fewer friends than you had at
the start!”
Carbuncle
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than
that of the lowly carbuncle. At ﬁrst glance, carbuncles appear to be little more
than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and
the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although
rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure‑alls to
potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle’s horn
is merely a highly reﬂective growth, not unlike a ﬁngernail.
CARBUNCLE
CREATURE 1
RARE
N
TINY
BEAST
Perception +7; darkvision
Languages carbuncle empathy 30 feet
Skills Stealth +3 (+7 in grass or undergrowth), Survival +6
Str –3, Dex +0, Con +3, Int –2, Wis +3, Cha +0
Carbuncle Empathy The carbuncle can telepathically send mild feelings and sensations
to nearby creatures. It can’t use this ability to communicate in language or hinder a
target, but it might convey a feeling of dread or the scent of food cooking nearby.
AC 16; Fort +8, Ref +3, Will +6
HP 20
Easy to Inﬂuence Any mental spell can aﬀect a carbuncle, regardless of creature type
limitations. Against a suggestion spell, a carbuncle always gets an outcome one degree
of success worse than it rolled on its saving throw.
Fatal Faker Ǻȓ (arcane, conjuration, teleportation) Trigger The carbuncle takes damage;
Eﬀect The carbuncle feigns death by teleporting away and leaving a replica of
its corpse behind, creating a colorful ﬂash of light and a croaking sound. The real
carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow
shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point
it crumbles to dust.
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ  jaws +5 (ﬁnesse), Damage 1d6 piercing
Primal Innate Spells DC 18; 3rd levitate (at
will, self only); 1st jump (at will); Cantrips
(1st) daze
Specious Suggestion ʚʖ (enchantment,
incapacitation, mental) Frequency three
times per day; Eﬀect The carbuncle
concentrates on a creature it can see and
tries to manipulate that creature. The
target must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
The target then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The attempt backﬁres
and bolsters the target’s mind instead,
granting it a +1 status bonus to Will
saving throws for 1 hour.
Success The target brieﬂy experiences an
unusual but harmless sensation like an
unexpected ﬂavor or scent, an urge to eat
something strange, or an amusing half‑forgotten memory.
Failure The target is compelled to spend all of its actions
on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and
usually embarrassing actions.
Critical Failure As failure, but the compulsion
persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt
a new save at the end of its turn each round
to end the eﬀect.
