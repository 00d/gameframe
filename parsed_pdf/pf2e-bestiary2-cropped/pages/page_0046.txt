VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

Cold Healing Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold
damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the
cold eﬀect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments (Core Rulebook
518), calathgars gain fast healing 1.
Mold Mulch When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays
and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold
if it was killed by ﬁre damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute,
during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its
turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn
in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an
hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot
square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points,
BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing,
and
slashing
damage;
the mold deals half its
regular cold damage once
it’s broken).

Seed Spray ʚʖ (cold, evocation,
primal) The calathgar expels
thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot
cone, dealing 1d6 piercing and
4d6 cold damage (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). In mild cold or colder
environments (Core Rulebook 518),
these seeds cling to living creatures
they strike, dealing 1d4 persistent
cold damage. The calathgar can’t
use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
