GENIEKIN ON GOLARION
While most geniekin planar scions
live on their genie parent’s ancestral
plane, rare fonts of elemental power
or genie activity sometimes give
rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far,
geniekin are most commonly found
in Katapesh, as genies are more
prevalent there than other regions
due to the inﬂuence of genie binders.
claims help to bolster those they travel with. Suli from regions other than deserts
adjust their names to match their terrains, but regardless of whether they prefer
forests, hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.

SYLPH
Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar
scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions
between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but
they are prone to ﬂights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.
Sylphs are notorious for their practice of “listening to the wind,” which
most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means
much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to
them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs
may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others,
most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying
connected to the world around them while still keeping it
comfortably at arm’s length. Certainly the typical sylph
sneak doesn’t seek to use what they learn for ill, but
instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized
or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.
