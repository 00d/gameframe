CRYSTAL VAULTS
Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts
too dangerous to be left where those
hungry for power might seize them.
Only they know what items of myth
and legend, long thought lost or
destroyed, lie within their crystal
vaults. They are unreliable guardians
of religious artifacts, however, which
usually disgust them.
Jyoti
Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they ﬁnd insulting) by the
ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane.
They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains
on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and
religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force
that, from the jyotis’ perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to ﬁsh.
Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their
homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the
palaces of crystallized light and captured ﬂame in which they dwell. They often chase
even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire,
for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis’ full wrath is reserved for
natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise
of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to
oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.
