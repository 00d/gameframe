SKAVELING INTELLECT
As a curious side eﬀect of its
creation, a skaveling absorbs many
of the memories and thoughts of the
ghoul brains it was fed. While it was
merely an oversized animal in life,
in undeath these memories coalesce
into a strange form of intelligence
that aﬀords the skaveling the ability
to speak and reason, all the better to
serve its urdefhan masters.
Skaveling
Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that
are not true ghouls but instead are speciﬁcally crafted undead creatures. Their creators
are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant
bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the ﬂesh of ghouls—especially
brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are
ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil (Core Rulebook 551). While this poison
simply rots away the ﬂesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats
will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.
Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of
ﬂight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use
skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that
of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere
mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can
reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them,
and they never take actions in a ﬁght that would knowingly put their masters in
harm’s way.
