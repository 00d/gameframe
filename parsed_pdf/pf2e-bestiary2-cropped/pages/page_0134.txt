DOMINION PLOTS
While Golarion largely survived
the events of the Doomsday Dawn,
the threat of the Dominion of the
Black is far from over. This alien
conglomerate recognizes that it
needs to understand the vastness
of humanoids in the universe to
better enact their plans, and certain
nihilistic scholars suggest that the
Doomsday Dawn was never intended
to end the world, but instead served
its primary goal of setting the
stage for an even more devastating
invasion from the Dominion in the
near future.
Gosreg
Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into
humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as
spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting
plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.
In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy
legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to inﬁltrate
societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately
compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their
brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of
the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.
