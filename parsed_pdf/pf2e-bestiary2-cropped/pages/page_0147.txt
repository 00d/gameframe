TINDALOS
Ancient texts refer to these
relentless temporal hunters as the
hounds of Tindalos, yet they never
seem to explore what Tindalos
actually is. In some references, the
implication is that Tindalos is one of
the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods,
but if this is the case, it is among the
most obscure of these entities. Other
tomes refer as Tindalos as a location,
perhaps even a city or nation that
once existed before time began and
that can be reached only by methods
impossible for any creature bound
by the laws of time. In all likelihood,
both and neither are right—what
Tindalos is may simply be impossible
for mortal minds to comprehend.
Hound of Tindalos
Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the
ﬂow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send
their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can
draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the
hounds’ ire, so few who trafﬁc in such rituals live long enough to spread their
knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely
interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have
attracted their unblinking attention.
Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The
pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and
devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of
Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.

Otherworldly Mind (mental) Whenever a creature targets the hound with a mental eﬀect,
that creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 25 basic Will save). On a critical failure, it
also becomes confused for 1d4 rounds.
Ripping Gaze (aura, evocation, occult, visual) 30 feet. The hound of Tindalos’s eyes glow
balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that
meets its awful gaze. When a creature ends its turn in the aura’s emanation, it
takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). A creature that
critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Vulnerable to Curved Space When a hound of Tindalos is not
adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its
resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it
becomes sickened 1. It can’t recover from this sickened
condition, but the condition ends automatically once
the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +17, Damage 2d10+7 piercing

Occult Innate Spells DC 21; 8th discern

Angled Entry Ȱɵ The hound of Tindalos casts
a 4th-level dimension door spell, but it must
transport itself into a space adjacent to an
angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or
environment around it. For example, it could teleport
to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle
between the wall and ﬂoor) or a corner in a room, or
adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of
the ground, but not to a ﬂat plain or a room
with only curved corners and edges.
Once per day, the hound can use
this ability to plane shift to or from
the Dimension of Time, with the
same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.
