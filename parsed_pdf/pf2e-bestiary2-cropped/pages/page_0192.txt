ONI DAIMYO
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with
isolated mortal domains. The most
powerful is Inma, the Empress of the
World, but Akuma the Horned King,
Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka
the Red King are also worshipped.
WATER YAI
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants.
Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to
lurk alone in the world’s oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote fresh-
water lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they
prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition
of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in
richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous
faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie
magical properties, and in combat, they can also ﬁre bolts of electricity from their
third eye.
