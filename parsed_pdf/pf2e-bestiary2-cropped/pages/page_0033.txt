TRAINED DIGGERS
Kobolds and others who dwell in
underground warrens know the
value of having a few trained giant
badgers in their lair, since when
their digging habits are supervised
and directed, they can excavate new
tunnels and chambers with ease. Of
course, the fact that giant badgers
ﬁnd kobolds and others who dwell
in underground warrens delicious
means that relying on such trained
diggers can be a risky endeavor. A
giant badger trained for use as a
digger or a guardian tends to only
obey the commands of one master,
and even then they can be prone
to unpredictable outbursts for no
reason other than pique.
Badger
The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally
ﬁerce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
BADGER
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A
threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically ﬁghts
until slain.

GIANT BADGER
The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore,
its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or
adventurer. A giant badger’s claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from
solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

Badger Rage Ȱɵ (concentrate, emotion, mental)
The giant badger enters a state of pure
rage that lasts for 1 minute, until there
are no enemies it can perceive, or until it
falls unconscious, whichever comes ﬁrst.
While raging, the giant badger has AC 17,
its jaws Strike deals 1d8+8 damage,
and its claw Strike deals 1d6+6
damage. While raging, the giant
badger also can’t use actions
that have the concentrate
trait except for Seek.
After it has stopped
raging,
a
giant
badger
can’t
use
Badger Rage again for
1 minute.
