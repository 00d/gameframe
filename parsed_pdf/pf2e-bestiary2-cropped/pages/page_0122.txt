FROG SPECIES
While all frogs are amphibious, some
frogs spend more of their time out of
the water. Even those usually found
near lakes and streams are adapted
for climbing. You can add variety
to frog encounters by replacing a
frog’s swim Speed with a climb Speed
(or even allowing it to have both).
Likewise, for frogs that are poisonous
or venomous, the speciﬁc eﬀects
of their toxin can vary by species,
with exposure to some frog poison
causing a creature to become clumsy
or stupeﬁed instead of enfeebled.
Frog
Frogs that are poisonous or grow to monstrous size can be a menace to adventurers.
SPEAR FROG
The spear frog is named for its toxin, which is traditionally used to envenom
thrown projectiles like spears and daggers.

Tongue Grab A creature hit by the giant frog’s tongue becomes
grabbed by the giant frog. The creature isn’t immobilized, but it
can’t move beyond the reach of the frog’s tongue. A creature
can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 13 that
deals at least 2 slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the frog but prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
