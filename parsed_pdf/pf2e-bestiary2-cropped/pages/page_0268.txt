RAVENOUS MUTANTS
Jotund trolls on the world of Golarion
are found in two particular regions
with greater frequency: the magic-
warped reaches of the Mana Wastes,
and the radiation-wracked badlands
of Numeria. In both places, the
presence of life-altering magic or
science seems to have had the same
eﬀect in bolstering the presence of
these lumbering monstrosities.

Head Regrowth A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration
to regrow a head that is severed from an eﬀect like a vorpal weapon. After regaining
Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 ﬂat check. On a success,
one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully
restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.
Multiple Opportunities A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their
heads beyond the ﬁrst, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity
with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can’t use more than 1 reaction for the
same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their
reach, and the jotund troll must use a diﬀerent head for each Attack of
Opportunity they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll’s heads is
severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round.

Cacophonous Roar ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, enchantment,
incapacitation, mental, primal) The jotund troll emits a
cacophonous roar from all their heads with a mystical
power that distorts the listener’s mind. Each non-troll
creature within 100 feet must attempt a DC 34 Will
save. The jotund troll can’t use Cacophonous Roar
for 1d4 rounds.

temporarily immune to Cacophonous Roar for
24 hours.

Ravenous Jaws ʚʖ The jotund troll
makes a number of jaws Strikes

against a diﬀerent target. These attacks
count toward the troll’s multiple attack penalty, but
the penalty doesn’t increase until after the jotund troll
makes all of these attacks.
