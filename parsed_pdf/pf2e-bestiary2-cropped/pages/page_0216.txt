OTHER QLIPPOTH
The qlippoth presented here are but
a small fraction of the squirming
awfulness that lurks in the deeper
rifts of the Abyss. Other types of
qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like
gongorinans, which use living
creatures as incubators; shapeshifting
utukku, which inﬁltrate and undermine
religions; death-spawned behimirons,
which slay the living to reproduce;
and the living siege engines known as
catabolignes. Yet most frightening of
all is the immense iathavos, a monster
so abhorrent that even the Abyss
cannot bear to allow more than one to
exist at any one time.
Aura of Order’s Ruin (aura, necromancy, occult) 30 feet. A lawful or good creature that
begins its turn in this aura’s emanation must attempt a DC 29 Will save or become
sickened 1 (lawful good creatures instead become sickened 2).
Boiled by Light A chernobue takes 2d10 points of ﬁre damage each time it starts its turn
in an area of bright light.
Recall Venom Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within 30 feet suﬀers the eﬀects from stage 2 of
rupturing venom; Eﬀect The chernobue calls out telepathically to the semi-alive
toxin, causing it to burst out of the target’s body and slither through the air to
drain back into one of the chernobue’s mouths. The poisoned creature takes 7d6
bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Fortitude save) as the venom exits its body, but
is thereafter cured of rupturing venom, and the chernobue regains an equal number
of Hit Points.
Speed 30 feet; air walk
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +26 (chaotic, magical), Damage 3d10+13 piercing plus 1d6 chaotic and
rupturing venom
Melee Ȱɵ tentacle mouth +26 (agile, chaotic, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d6+13
piercing plus 1d6 chaotic
Occult Innate Spells DC 32; 7th plane shift (self only); 6th phantasmal calamity, phantom
pain; 5th subconscious suggestion; 4th darkness (at will); Cantrips (6th) daze, detect
magic; Constant (4th) air walk
Paralyzing Display ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion,
enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental,
occult, visual) The chernobue’s eye
pulses and its lid peels back to reveal
mind-bending awfulness. Creatures in
a 30-foot emanation must attempt a
DC 32 Will save, after which they are
temporarily immune to further Paralyzing
Displays for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is paralyzed for 1d4
rounds. It can attempt a new save to
end the eﬀect at the end of each of
its turns.
Critical Failure As failure, but paralyzed
for 1 minute.
Rupturing
Venom
(poison)
The
thick, orange venom injected by
a chernobue is semi-alive, and as
it seethes in a creature’s body, it
deals poison damage in addition to
bludgeoning damage as it ruptures
flesh; Saving Throw Fortitude DC 32;
Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage
1 2d6 poison and 2d6 bludgeoning (1
round); Stage 2 2d6 poison, 2d6 bludgeoning,
and enfeebled 2 (1 round)
AUGNAGAR
The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast—
preferably on rotten ﬂesh, and when possible, demon
ﬂesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the ﬂesh
of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs
with leathery membranes like a bat’s wings, and
three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for
slicing ﬂesh.
