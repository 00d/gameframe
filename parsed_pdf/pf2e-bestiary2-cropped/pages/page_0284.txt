THE SHADOW FORGE
Many velstracs outsource the forging
of their chains to unique velstracs
known as almoners. These six-armed,
legless humanoids toil endlessly at
a great burning foundry called the
Shadow Forge. Almoners operate
under mysterious strictures, and are
just as likely to turn a velstrac away
empty-handed as not.
SACRISTAN
CREATURE 10
LE
MEDIUM
FIEND
VELSTRAC
Perception +19; greater darkvision, painsight

Staggering Servitude (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. When a
creature ends its turn in the aura, it sees a vision of the sacristan groveling in pitiable
servitude. The creature must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or become stunned 1.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ barbed chain +22 (evil, magical, reach 10 feet, trip, versatile S), Damage 2d8+9
piercing plus 1d6 evil and 2d6 persistent bleed
Divine Innate Spells DC 29; 5th chilling darkness; 3rd fear
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The sacristan
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against staggering servitude. In addition, if the creature was
already stunned, on a failed save its revulsion toward the sacristan’s presence causes
it to be stupeﬁed 2 for 1 minute. After attempting this save, the creature is then
temporarily immune until the start of the sacristan’s next turn.
Shadow Scream ̂ˬ (aura, concentrate, darkness, divine, evocation, mental, sonic)
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The sacristan opens their mouth to unloose
the wailing howls and mind-twisting darkness of the Shadow Plane.
This creates a 30-foot emanation of darkness and wailing sounds
around the sacristan. Creatures with darkvision can’t see through
this darkness. The sacristan can Sustain Shadow Scream for up
to 1 minute. Non-velstrac creatures in the area when the ability is
used, as well as those who enter or start their turn in the area, must
attempt a DC 28 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is
unaﬀected and is then temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is deafened for 1 round.
Failure The creature is confused and deafened for
1 round.
Critical Failure The creature takes 20 mental damage,
and is confused and deafened for 1 round.
INTERLOCUTOR
Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of
the velstracs, carving away ﬂesh and replacing it with
new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal.
Each interlocutor structures their individual
appearance carefully, but all are towering,
multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest
limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they
can ﬁnd. They continually search for new
material to graft to their forms, and their slain
foes are rarely found intact, as little is
more valuable to interlocutors than a
powerful opponent’s legs, eyes, or even
brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall
and weigh approximately 800 pounds.
