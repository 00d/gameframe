EATING HABITS
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals
by devouring their prey whole. After
incapacitating a creature, a snake
unhinges its jaw and consumes the
creature entirely, even if it’s more
than twice the diameter of the
snake’s body. A snake can consume
a creature of the same size as itself
or smaller, but most snakes are logy
and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snake
Snakes of some variety thrive in every non-arctic ecosystem, each with their own
particular hunting patterns and defense mechanisms.
SEA SNAKE
These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-foot-
long, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey.
Tales speak of massive sea snakes that swim in deeper waters and follow ships,
waiting for sailors to fall overboard or climbing the side to snatch them from the deck.
