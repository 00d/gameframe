CONJURING DEMONS
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet
the desperate or wicked still do.
Rituals like planar ally or planar
binding are typical for long-term
ends, and summon ﬁend for combat
applications. For planar ally, demons
sometimes accept oﬀerings that aren’t
valuable if gifting them to a demon
pushes the ritualist further into sin.
INVIDIAK (SHADOW DEMON)
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition,
but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing.
Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.

Exorcism Vulnerability If an invidiak attempts to possess a creature and the creature rolls
a critical success on its saving throw to resist possession, or if an invidiak’s possession
of a creature is ended prematurely, such as via a successful dispel magic, the invidiak
takes 6d6 mental damage and cannot use possession
for 24 hours.

Favored Host Each invidiak has a particular type of
creature they prefer possessing, chosen from the
following list: aberration, animal, beast, or any
humanoid (such as dwarf)—in most cases, the favored
type of target is human. When an invidiak uses
possession against a favored host, the duration of
possession increases to unlimited, and the eﬀect lasts
until dispelled or until the invidiak dismisses it.
Shadow Blend ʚʖ (divine, illusion) The invidiak Strides
up to twice their speed. If the invidiak ends their
movement in an area of dim light, they become
hidden as long as they don’t move and the lighting
in the area they’re in doesn’t grow brighter than
dim light.
Unbodied Possession An invidiak leaves no body
behind when using possession.
NABASU (GLUTTONY DEMON)
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material
Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that
releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life.
Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage
to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more
powerful. Once they have sufﬁciently feasted, the demons become
worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo
a vile transformation, ﬁnally digesting their accumulated meals
and deforming further into powerful vrolikais (page 69).
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those
who prefer the tang of undead ﬂesh.
