ADAPTIVE HUNTERS
Though it doesn’t happen often due
to their ability to shift planes, some
bebiliths ﬁnd themselves trapped on
other planes either through magical
binding or subjugation to beings of
great power. While trapped away
from their favored prey, a bebilith’s
hungers can shift. In such cases, the
creature’s penetrating strikes can
adapt—a bebilith trapped in Elysium,
for example, might become a hunter
of azatas, and its Penetrating Strike
would count as cold iron and evil
instead so that it could target
traditional azata weaknesses.
Bebilith
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder
regions of this horriﬁc plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not
the deadliest—is the bebilith. These ﬁends resemble elephant-sized spiders with
glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic ﬂuid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths’ devious
intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take
advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out
at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic
ﬂesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

Dimensional Tether A creature
hit by the bebilith’s web Strike
is restrained and tethered to
the bebilith, preventing it from
moving further away from the
bebilith. The restrained creature
is also under the eﬀects of a
dimensional anchor spell (DC 29)
with a duration that lasts as long as
the creature remains tethered. The
bebilith can have only one creature
tethered at a time. The DC to Escape
or Force Open the tether is 29. The
tether can be severed with a Strike
(AC 20, Hardness 2, HP 20); this ends
the dimensional anchor eﬀect but does
not free the restrained creature.
Penetrating Strike Against demons, a bebilith’s
Strikes count as cold iron and good.
