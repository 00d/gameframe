KELPIE FOLKTALES
Some fanciful stories about kelpies
speak of them appearing in equine
form wearing riding tack, complete
with silver stirrups and bridle bit.
These folktales claim that cutting
the harness from the kelpie’s body
grants the bearer power over it, or
causes the kelpie to sicken and die.
In truth, doing so has no ill eﬀect
on a kelpie, suggesting these stories
are spread by kelpies themselves
to further trick prey into making
foolish mistakes.
Kelpie
Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals
to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly
preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater
then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim’s heart and liver—
the only parts of a meal kelpies ﬁnd unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically
disguising itself as ﬁne steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but
its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green ﬂesh
resembling aquatic plants.

Captivating Lure ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental,
primal) The kelpie instills an overwhelming attraction to itself within the mind of a
single creature within 60 feet. The target perceives the kelpie as a desirable person (if
the kelpie is in humanoid form) or a valuable steed (if the kelpie is in equine form) and
must attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to Captivating
Lure for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round and is then temporarily immune to
Captivating Lure for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to
the kelpie as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated
creature is adjacent to the kelpie, it either attempts to mount the kelpie
(if the kelpie is in equine form) or stays still and
doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked by the
kelpie, or if it can’t breathe water and enters
an area of water, the creature is freed from
captivation at the end of the kelpie’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target
doesn’t consider water a danger and
will enter an area of water even if
it can’t swim or breathe water.
If it is attacked by the kelpie or
starts to drown, it can attempt
a new save at the start of its
next turn, but it isn’t freed
automatically.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate,
polymorph,
primal,
transmutation)
The
kelpie
can
take
on
the appearance of any
Medium or Large animal
of an equine nature (such as
a horse, hippocampus, or pony), or
any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change its Speeds or its attack and damage
modiﬁers with its Strikes.
