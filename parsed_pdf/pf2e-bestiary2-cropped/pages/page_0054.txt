COCKROACH SPECIES
Beyond the common giant cockroach,
other ﬂesh-eating cockroaches
exist throughout the world. These
variations include the giant hissing
cockroach, the noxious venomroach,
the huge spitting cockroach (which
can incapacitate enemies from a
distance), the aggressive sawback
cockroach, and the mysterious and
rare dragonroach.
Cockroach
Generally seen more as a nuisance than a personal danger, cockroaches inhabit
most reaches of the world. They are scavengers who live off the detritus of
the natural world and from those that inhabit it. These maligned insects can
survive weeks without eating, and most of their meals consist of organic
waste that would otherwise overwhelm an ecosystem, particularly in their
preferred urban environments. Though a typical cockroach presents virtually
no threat, they can become dangerous in large groups, and some species grow
particularly large.
GIANT COCKROACH
Cockroaches are communal creatures, rarely setting out on their own unless
they are searching for food. If an adventurer encounters a single giant cockroach
while exploring, they had best take precautions against others, as there is likely
an entire colony nearby.

COCKROACH SWARM
While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a
disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming,
where hundreds or even thousands of the
insects scurry out of their hiding places in
a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces
on thousands of skittering legs. Given how
disgusting many ﬁnd cockroaches to be,
encountering such a swarm can be alarming
to even the most seasoned adventurers. The
creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast
to the insects’ normally skittish and harmless nature,
as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures
that provoked them and harry them with
thousands of stinging bites.
