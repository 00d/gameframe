CATS AND DOGS
If there’s one thing more certain to
infuriate a hellcat other than to treat
it as a mere animal, that is to compare
it in any way to a hell hound. Hellcats
consider hell hounds little more than
vermin infesting the hellscapes they
call home, and enjoy torturing them
more than any other creature.
Hellcat
Hellcats are devious predators native to the ﬁery pits of Hell. While the ﬁendish
creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and
dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with
transparent ﬂesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet
long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and
stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As ﬁendish creatures, they do not require
mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inﬂicting
pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being
treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may ﬁnd themself
made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate
elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.
Though they can’t speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate
by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much
except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of
their diabolic masters.
Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up
against foes they’re unable to reach, but they never forget prey that
escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies,
including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes
against their foes.
