ATHACH TREASURE
Athachs are infamously greedy, but
the distrustful creatures have a unique
way of hiding gems and shiny metal.
When an athach ﬁnds items such
as coins and jewelry, they crush the
valuable metal into a lumpy ball about
the size of an apple and then swallow
it. When not tormenting humans, the
athach regurgitates these lumps and
plays with them. Any of these lumps
found lying about an athach’s lair are
likely coated in the giant’s toxic drool.
Athach
The towering and brutish giants known as athaches are reviled for both their
monstrosity and their cruelty. Beyond an athach’s ﬁlthy habits, this giant is made
stranger by the gangly third arm that protrudes from their torso and ends in a
twitching, long-ﬁngered claw. Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach’s
upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that
is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach’s fangs.
Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and
they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does
not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of
settled territories until they ﬁnd a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to
target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair
in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch
their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and
torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes
on a ﬁnal rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature
they can ﬁnd. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape,
forcing these terriﬁed victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading
word of the athach’s fearsomeness.
