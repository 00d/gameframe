Angel
Angels are benevolent messengers who aid good forces in the ﬁght against evil.
Each angel has a special aura that assists in their individual tasks, and each angel
delivers certain types of messages and performs other duties for the angelic
hosts. While most angels live in the enlightened realm of Nirvana, some serve
the forces of Heaven and Elysium, especially in the case of the angel empyreal
lords within those two realms. Angels organize themselves into choirs depending
on their ranks and roles.
MOVANIC DEVA (GUARDIAN ANGEL)
Movanic devas are stewards of the ﬂow of good creatures’ souls through the cycle
of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels
arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a speciﬁc
connection with a creature’s vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most
concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives,
so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva
leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of
their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within
animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent
as well, thus increasing the ﬂow of goodness into the afterlife. They also
spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy
Plane, seeking to contain signiﬁcant threats to life.

Dispelling Field ʚʖ (divine, transmutation) Frequency once per

magic eﬀects on allies within its aura of vitality to protect them
from malevolent forces. The movanic deva attempts a counteract
check against as many spell eﬀects aﬀecting allies in the area as it
wishes with a +19 counteract modiﬁer and a counteract level of 4,
rolling once for the selected eﬀects.
Flaming Armaments (divine, transmutation) When a movanic deva wields
a weapon, that weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming rune.
THE GIFT OF SAPIENCE
When a movanic deva awakens an
animal, the animal becomes neutral
good and is well-disposed toward
the deva, but the deva understands
that free will is an important part of
life. While the deva provides enough
support and guidance to the animal
to help it adjust to its newly sapient
world view, not all animals awakened
in this way remain on the path of good.
