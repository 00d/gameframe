VIPER VINE POLLEN
While viper vine pollen degrades
quickly after it is harvested carefully
from the plant, a character who has
a set of alchemical tools can gather
and preserve 1d6 doses of pollen
with a successful DC 33 Crafting
or Nature check and 10 minutes
of work. A single dose of viper
vine pollen is worth 300 gp as raw
materials for crafting any alchemical
or magical item that creates an
incapacitation eﬀect.
Viper Vine
A voracious, ﬂesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom
arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the
approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it
rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that
releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine
can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect
is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.
Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than
through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion
and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form
of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and
make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly
large or dangerous-looking.
The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially
devoured remains of victims. It’s not unusual to ﬁnd the rotting corpses of wild
animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant’s immediate vicinity,
along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A
viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier,
preferring to hunt fresh meat.

Melee Ȱɵ vine +27 (agile, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d10+11
bludgeoning plus Grab
Captivating Pollen Ȱɵ (enchantment, incapacitation, mental,
poison) The viper vine releases a 60-foot emanation of invisible
pollen that stays in the air for 5 rounds unless dispersed by a
moderate or stronger wind. Each creature that enters or starts its
turn in the area must attempt a DC 33 Will save or be captivated. The
viper vine can’t use Captivating Pollen for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and
is temporarily immune to Captivating Pollen
for 24 hours.
Success The creature is sickened 1.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and
it must spend each of its actions
to move closer to the viper vine as
expediently as possible while avoiding
obvious dangers. If a captivated creature
is adjacent to the viper vine, it stays still
and doesn’t act. It ceases to be fascinated if it’s
no longer in the pollen aura at the end of
its turn.
Critical Failure As failure, plus the creature is
stupeﬁed 2 for 24 hours.
Constrict Ȱɵ 3d8+8 bludgeoning, DC 33
