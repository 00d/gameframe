ZEVGAVIZEB’S FAVORED
The demonic patron of many
xulgaths, Zevgavizeb, spends most
of his time slumbering in the Abyssal
realm of Gluttondark. However, his
vile priests actively pursue what
they insist are their dormant god’s
goals. Some xulgath high priests
practice ﬂeshwarping upon their own
acolytes, creating ghonhatine zealots
to serve in their legions and guard
their evil temples.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1. Further failed saves against Soul Scream increase
the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. Each time the character gets
a full night’s rest, the stupeﬁed condition gained from Soul Scream decreases by 1.
Critical Failure As failure, except the stupeﬁed value increases by 2 instead of by 1.
Storm of Tentacles ʚʖ The irnakurse makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the irnakurse’s multiple attack penalty, but
the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all of its attacks.
GHONHATINE
In transforming xulgaths, drow ﬂeshwarpers sought not to create a new type of
creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished
from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to
crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.
