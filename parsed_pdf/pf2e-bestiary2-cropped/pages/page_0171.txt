MANDRAGORA SUCKLINGS
Sometimes a mandragora oﬀers its
services to a spellcaster in exchange
for sustenance. Tales tell of sorcerers
or other magical creatures who keep
mandragora “familiars” whose loyalty
is sustained by feeding the little beasts
with their own blood. These tales
generally have gruesome endings
wherein the mandragora is overcome
with bloodlust and, unable to control
itself, devours its master.
Mandragora
A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed
shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious
little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon’s
blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon’s blood, the
root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.
Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained
lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While
they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and
they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs,
a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They ﬁnd the
ﬂavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing
these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.
While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil
plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of
giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces,
eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.
