FLY SPECIES
The giant ﬂy presented here is
but the most common of these
unsettlingly oversized pests. Others
can grow much larger, such as the
blood-drinking glutton ﬂy, the highly
toxic and foul-smelling blight ﬂy,
and the immensely bloated plague
ﬂy—a nauseating creature ironically
incapable of ﬂight that fattens itself
on undead ﬂesh and carries a host of
awful diseases.
Fly
Giant ﬂies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies
bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat
they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding
grounds for virulent diseases.
GIANT MAGGOT
Giant ﬂies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they
hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous
young who voraciously consume any ﬂesh in the immediate vicinity—typically
starting with the body upon which they were born.

GIANT FLY
This pony-sized ﬂy’s twitching limbs seem to never stop moving as it constantly
cleans itself and scoops anything edible into its mouthparts. While primarily carrion
eaters, giant ﬂies sometimes prey on livestock or other animals too slow to get away.
