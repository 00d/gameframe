a DC 26 Will save or be slowed 1 indeﬁnitely. An aﬀected creature can choose to roll
twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.
ZELEKHUT
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical
centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back.
Instead of hands, the zelekhut’s arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with
electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities,
the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active
ﬂight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse’s
most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut’s quarry are as
famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in
enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own
or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While
hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a
dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn’t shift a single hoof to capture a
corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand
that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the
zelekhut’s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments
and track down those who seek to ﬂee their punishment.

Attack
ʚʖ
The
zelekhut makes two
chain Strikes, each
targeting a diﬀerent
creature. Each Strike counts toward the zelekhut’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has
made both attacks. If the zelekhut subsequently uses the Knockdown action, it aﬀects
all creatures it hit with Double Attack.
PARADOX AND UNITY
To mortals, aeons sometimes
seem to combine elements that
are fundamentally incompatible,
whether it’s an aeon combining
opposing concepts, or axiomites and
inevitables mixing the organic with
the mathematical or mechanical.
Aeons see no paradox in this, but
rather claim it is an expression of the
underlying unity of all things.
