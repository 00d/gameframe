CALIGNI SLAYER TRINKETS
Slayers obsess over magical trinkets,
coveting them above all else.
They often have a consumable or
permanent item of use in combat,
such as a scroll, wand, or talisman.
Unfortunately, their incessant
tinkering and ﬁddling often leaves
their treasures broken or depleted.
Caligni Slayer
Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other
calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken
merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger.
Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with
their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied
the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience.
Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer’s hunger appears at the moment of
their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless
implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis’ deaths, consuming
the body itself in a ﬁnal attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe
with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 51), ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own.
For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the
talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too
ambitious can become a brave sacriﬁce in battle, for the good of the enclave.
In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers
and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet
another source of slayers’ envy and resentment.
