OOZE MEPHIT
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants,
shamelessly ﬂattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although
their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting
targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ocher-
colored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell
disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.

STEAM MEPHIT
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They
are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in
shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even
when they aren’t bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from
their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.

MEPHIT NAMES
Perhaps because they’re so often
compelled into service by mortal
conjurers and more powerful
elementals, mephits tend to adopt long
names peppered with self-proclaimed
titles and imagined or exaggerated
accomplishments to alleviate their
feelings of inadequacy. Some examples
of mephit names follow.
•	 Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places,
the Tragic Hero, One Against All
•	 Silothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord
of the Eternal Chill, Lord of Icicles
•	 Oglophax, Prince of Pungency, the
Viscous One, the Forever Stain
•	 Zarnozath the Magniﬁcent, First
of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the
Teapot Terror
