HADROSAURID CRESTS
The diﬀerent species of hadrosaurids
all use the same statistics. While
some species have no cranial crest
at all, those who do, such as the
distinctive backward-curling crest
of the parasaurolophus, are capable
of vocalizing sonorous and haunting
calls when they seek the attention
of a mate or warning their herd of a
predator’s approach.

IGUANODON
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests
where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other
depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach
delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger.
Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A
well‑placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a
cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh
6,000 pounds.

Gouging Lunge ʚʖ The iguanodon makes a thumb spike
Strike at an adjacent foe and then Strides up to 15 feet,
dragging its thumb spike across the foe to gouge out a brutal
wound. If this Strike hits, it deals an extra 1d8 points of slashing
damage and the following Stride does not trigger reactions from the
creature struck. This thumb spike Strike counts as two attacks when
calculating the iguanodon’s multiple attack penalty.
SPINOSAURUS
The spinosaurus is more than just one of the largest carnivorous
dinosaurs—it’s also one of the most unusual in appearance,
with a large, sail-like ﬁn running along its spine. Often
quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to
attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it
appear to be even larger than it actually is.
A swimming spinosaurus can also use the
