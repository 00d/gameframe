REZLARABREN
A series of underwater caverns
on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound
Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren’s
lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini
who labor as miners. Her relationship
with the Linnorm Kings is complex,
and whether she views them as allies
or enemies depends on her mood.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their
lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside
grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed,
or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel
safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of
offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged
from sunken ships.
