OTHER TANE
Originally engineered by the Eldest
as living weapons, the Tane are a
group of mythical creatures whose
might is capable of bringing entire
cities to heel. The jabberwock and
the sard are two other examples
of the Tane in this book, but
others include creatures like the
bandersnatch, the jubjub bird, and
arguably the most powerful of them
all, the unique monster known
as Leviathan.
Thrasfyr
As bizarre in appearance as they are ferocious, thrasfyrs resemble six-limbed bears
with bull-like horns, draconic scales, and a ﬁre-breathing serpent for a tail. Every
thrasfyr is wrapped in animated chains psychically linked to the creature’s mind.

Rider’s Bond Ȱɵ (divination, mental, primal) The thrasfyr
designates one creature as its rider by touching the
rider with its claw. The thrasfyr and rider
can communicate with each other
telepathically at any range
on the same plane and
are aware of each
other’s present state,
direction from each
other,
distance
from each other,
and any conditions
aﬀecting either.

primal,

thrashes its chains in all

bludgeoning damage (DC 38
basic Reﬂex save); creatures that
fail are immobilized until the start of
the thrasfyr’s next turn. The thrasfyr
can’t use Tangling Chains or make chain
Strikes for 1d4 rounds.
Whirling Frenzy ʚʖ The thrasfyr makes a
jaws Strike, a horn Strike, and two claw
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target.
Each attack counts toward the thrasfyr’s
multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t
increase until after all the attacks.
