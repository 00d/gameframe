THE DESERT RIDER
Those rescued from death in the
burning sands often recount the
same dying vision: a strange,
silver‑eyed woman whose scarlet
silk tents stand on the back of a
colossal black scorpion, riding out
of a shattered city and leading an
army of the dead across a sea of
glass toward the world of the living.
Millennium‑old paintings on the
walls of rediscovered tombs depict
a similar desert rider. The identity of
this red‑robed woman is unknown.
Scorpion
Scorpions are frightening enough at their normal diminutive size, but when they
grow to reach or surpass the size of a human, they become absolutely terrifying.
CAVE SCORPION
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of
their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of
the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack
humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure
scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.
