DINOSAUR ABILITIES
While the real world fossil records
hold a wealth of inspiration for
the reconstruction of dinosaurs
in an RPG, you can also look to
living creatures for ideas. Giving
a dinosaur a poisonous bite or
an unusual attack routine like
Clobbering Charge ensures that
dinosaurs are as interesting in
combat as they are in appearance.

Clobbering Charge ʚʖ The pachycephalosaurus Strides up to its Speed. If it ends its
movement within melee reach of a target, it can make a skull Strike against that
target. If the pachycephalosaurus critically hits with this Strike, the creature hit is
stunned 1.
Sudden Shove Ǻȓ (attack) Trigger The pachycephalosaurus damages a Medium or

from itself and knocks the target prone.

ﬂat‑footed for 1 round.
HADROSAURID
Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping
of herbivorous dinosaurs that
share
characteristic
ﬂat
snouts ﬁlled with rows
of grinding teeth well
suited
for
feeding
on vegetation. Also
known as “duck-billed
dinosaurs” due to the
unusual shape of their jaws,
hadrosaurids
are
lumbering
creatures that can rival an
elephant for size, although they
tend to be much less aggressive and
are prone to ﬂight when confronted
with danger rather than stubbornly standing
their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have
uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each
species its own unusual proﬁle, making them easily
recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.
Giants and other oversized creatures have been known
to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite
their ability to sprint quickly, they don’t make particularly
viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group,
a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak
great damage with their trampling.
A hadrosaurid can walk for short
distances on its hind legs but prefers
to graze and travel on all fours. The
typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30
feet long and can weigh up to
10,000 pounds.
