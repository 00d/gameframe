SPRIGGAN DISTRACTIONS
As a culture, most spriggans live for
battle and constantly patrol their
territories in hopes of encountering
trespassers to capture and victimize.
Even so, spriggans sometimes need to
relax. Since they lack the capacity for
pleasure, games, art, and similar leisure
activities are lost on them. Instead,
they ﬁll their idle time training for
combat, watching others ﬁght to the
death, crafting weapons, or plotting
against their kin for personal gain.
the eﬀect extends until the end of the following turn. When Enraged Growth ends, the
spriggan bully is fatigued for 1 hour.

SPRIGGAN WARLORD
While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors
with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan
weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional ﬁghting style for
its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords
often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, ﬁlling roles in spriggan society
akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty.
In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is
typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.
