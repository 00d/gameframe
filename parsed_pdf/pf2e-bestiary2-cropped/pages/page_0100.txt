DRAINBERRY COLLECTIONS
As drainberry bushes sell their berries
to others, they collect coins and small
curios—such as a cameo depicting a fey
noble, a lock of golden hair knotted in
a complex pattern, or a ring inscribed
“To my dearest Memdaria.” Not all of
these baubles have monetary value,
but those that don’t certainly had
emotional value to the original owner.
Occasionally, drainberry bushes
accept intangible trade goods, such as
odes celebrating the bushes’ grandeur.
Drainberry Bush
Drainberry bushes are ﬂoating bushes that originate from the First World, with long,
thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly
siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn
consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a
faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.
Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense
of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their
berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes ﬁnds the plants
telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money
please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an
item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though
a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly
prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of signiﬁcantly lower value.

Blood Berries The drainberry bush must drain blood from living
creatures for sustenance. This causes clusters of bright red
berries to grow among its branches. Each cluster of berries lasts
for 1 day, and a drainberry bush typically has 1d6+3 clusters when
encountered. When consumed, a cluster
restores 2d8+10 Hit Points. This eﬀect has
the healing, necromancy, and primal traits.
A creature can pluck a cluster of berries
with a successful unarmed Strike or
Thievery check against the bush’s AC.
Consume Berries Ȱɵ (healing, necromancy,
positive, primal) The bush draws nourishment
from one cluster of blood berries, regaining
2d8+10 HP. That berry cluster wrinkles and dies.
Drain Blood Ȱɵ Requirements The drainberry bush
has at least one living creature grabbed with one of its
vines; Eﬀect The bush’s hollow thorns siphon blood
from creatures it has grabbed. Each creature
must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take
2d8+10 damage and become drained 1 (double
damage and drained 2 on a critical failure). For
every creature damaged this way, a cluster of
blood berries (see above) immediately grows
along the bush’s branches.
Storm of Vines ʚʖ The drainberry bush makes up to
four vine Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These
attacks count toward the bush’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until after the bush makes all these attacks.
