GIANT SQUID TACTICS
The giant squid attacks by lashing
out with its longest tentacles and
then rapidly pulling the prey toward
itself. While closing the distance
between them, it attacks again,
this time closing its smaller arms
around the prey. Once it has the prey
thoroughly trapped, the giant squid
tears and cuts with its beak and the
teeth-lined saw it has in the place of
a tongue.
Squid
The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a
nautical tale.
VAMPIRE SQUID
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead
inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms.
Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of
bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.

Jet ʚʖ (move) The giant squid moves up to 200 feet in a straight
line through the water without triggering any reactions.
Ravenous Embrace ʚʖ The giant squid makes up to four arm Strikes,
each with a diﬀerent arm and against a diﬀerent target.
The giant squid then makes a beak Strike
against one creature that it grabbed during
Ravenous Embrace. Each arm Strike counts
separately for the squid’s multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase
until the squid has made all of its arm Strikes; the beak Strike uses the multiple attack
penalty as normal.
