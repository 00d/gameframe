ALIEN ALLIES
High-ranking or wealthy witchwyrds
rarely travel the planes alone,
employing bodyguards to accompany
them and leading entourages
composed of various strange beings
they’ve met during their travels.
Witchwyrd
Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked. Their
inscrutability is a boon to one of their most signiﬁcant interests—mercantilism—
and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by
their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new
opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone
is trying to pull one over on them.
These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically
6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and
spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the
local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-ﬁtting clothes in bright reds or
yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions
of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This,
however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about
details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on
Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the
notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked,
many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these
queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars
have theorized a connection between
witchwyrds and several other four-armed
creatures, but like with questions of their
place of origin, witchwyrds have little to
say about the topic.

missile per action spent (dealing 1d4+1 force damage each). They can’t
spend more actions on this ability than they have free hands. If they
use a hand that has Absorbed Force, that hand hurls two missiles instead of one,
expending the held energy.
