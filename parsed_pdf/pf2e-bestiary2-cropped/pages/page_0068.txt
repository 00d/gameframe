HALF-DEMONS
The Abyss can corrupt living
creatures through direct congress
or supernatural infusion of Abyssal
energies, resulting in monstrous
hybrids. A half-demon should be a
custom creature, but you can quickly
generate one by giving an existing
creature a few of a demon’s abilities
along with the demon’s sin-related
vulnerability. For example, a half-
hezrou hill giant would gain purity
vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite,
swim Speed, and poisonous pustules.
When swapping over abilities between
creatures of diﬀerent levels, be sure to
adjust the numbers for the new level.
a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often
waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber,
squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to
fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own.
Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or
neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious
spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

Purity Vulnerability A hezrou revels in the foulness it exudes and becomes distraught
when contaminations are puriﬁed. The ﬁrst time in a round when a contamination
is puriﬁed (such as via purify food and drink) or a toxin is neutralized (such as via
neutralize poison) within 30 feet of a hezrou, the demon takes 6d6 mental damage.

NALFESHNEE (BOAR DEMON)
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed
demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike
and form from the souls of avaricious mortals.
Few demons understand the inner workings
of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it’s not
unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor
of the Abyss itself ﬁrst rather than bow before
a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the
ﬂeshy realms that birth new demons, while others
guard sites of particular signiﬁcance deep in the
plane’s secret reaches. A nalfeshnee’s realm in the
Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the
largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a
singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos
of the Abyss.
