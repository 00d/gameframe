LINNORM LEGENDS
Creatures as powerful as linnorms
tend to spawn stories of their own,
accurate or not. Critical failure on
a check to Recall Knowledge on
linnorms might suggest that you
can avoid a linnorm’s death curse by
closing your eyes as you deliver the
fatal blow, or that rubbing poison
oak on yourself can ward oﬀ a
linnorm’s attention.
Linnorm
The powerful, serpentine beings known as linnorms may be distantly related
to the more well-known chromatic and metallic dragons, but their draconic
physiologies are where any such similarities end. Whereas true dragons boast
incredible intellectual capabilities and far-reaching plans, linnorms are driven
only by their insatiable hunger and desire to inﬂict cruelty on others. Linnorms
are exceptionally difﬁcult to outwit due to their strong wills, and it’s not wise
to try bargaining with them—when faced with one of these legendary beasts,
one’s best option is ﬂight, pure and simple. Failing that, a noble death is a viable
back-up plan.
Extremely powerful linnorms dwell in remote parts of the world. One such
creature is the legendary Fafnheir, the Father of All Linnorms, said to be the oldest
and mightiest linnorm of them all. Fafnheir’s death curse causes anyone who
would slay him to slowly erode away physically and mentally until they die, at
which point the cursed victim’s body fuels Fafnheir’s resurrection.
SHOAL LINNORM
Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither
along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek
out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer
ﬁshers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may
even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the
town’s defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt
large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred
quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich
in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the ﬁery steam that
courses through their veins.
