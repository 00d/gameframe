HELLMOUTHS
While travel to and from Hell is
possible with plane shift, another
way to reach and traverse the
infernal realms is via hellmouths,
strange living portals connecting
diﬀerent layers or even diﬀerent
planes. A hellmouth takes the form
of a grimacing face, distended
maw, or other distressingly organic
aperture, and no two share the
same appearance. Most are carefully
guarded, but some new or well-hidden
hellmouths have yet to be discovered.

HAMATULA (BARBED DEVIL)
Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to
protect infernal vaults from those
foolish enough to try to rob the
archdevil Mammon. In case the
vicious spines protruding from their
bodies and ability to teleport weren’t
deadly enough, they are also clever
wielders of warding glyphs. They are
effective conjured guardians, though
they resent being pulled away from
their duties in Hell. Unlike most ﬁends,
hamatulas are formed from several souls
that lack any features distinctive enough to
merit another role.
