OTHER VELSTRACS
There are as many diﬀerent velstracs
as there are ways to inﬂict pain.
Other velstracs range in power from
the relatively weak lampadariuses to
the powerful phylacators.

Ignore Pain An eremite’s actions can’t be disrupted due to damage or
Strikes (such as Attack of Opportunity).
Paralytic Perfection (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, incapacitation,
mental, visual) 30 feet. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it feels
compelled to oﬀer pieces of its own ﬂesh to the eremite. The creature
must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or become paralyzed for 1 round.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 50 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +39 (evil, magical), Damage 4d8+19 piercing plus 2d6 persistent
bleed and exquisite pain

Rituals DC 42; imprisonment
Evisceration Ȱɵ (attack) Requirements The eremite has a
creature grabbed; Eﬀect The eremite excises ﬂesh or
bone from a creature it has grabbed. The target takes
6d10 persistent bleed damage.
Exquisite Pain An eremite’s knowledge of pressure
points and pain centers is unsurpassed. A creature
hit by an eremite’s melee Strikes must succeed
at a DC 40 Fortitude save or be stunned 2
(stunned 4 on a critical failure). A creature
that critically succeeds is temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Focus
Gaze
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The eremite
stares at a creature they can see within 30
feet. The creature must immediately attempt
a Will save against paralytic perfection.
In addition, if the creature was already
paralyzed, on a failed save, its unnatural
longing causes it to become doomed 1.
After attempting this save, the creature is
then temporarily immune until the start of
the eremite’s next turn.
Graft Flesh Ȱɵ Requirement The eremite holds a piece of ﬂesh they collected
via Evisceration; Eﬀect The eremite attaches the stolen ﬂesh to
themself. They either regain 100 Hit Points; reduce the
value of their clumsy, drained, enfeebled, or stupeﬁed
condition by 3; or reduce the stage of any aﬄiction
aﬀecting them by 3.
Shadow Traveler (divine, divination) When an eremite uses plane shift or shadow walk,
they arrive at exactly their intended destination.
