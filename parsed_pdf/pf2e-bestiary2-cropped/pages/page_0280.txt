FORBIDDEN ARMOR
After a devastating battle with a
vaspercham, many legendary heroes
have tried to forge armor or weapons
from the magical shell of the sea
beast, but all have failed because of
the powerful curse that suﬀuses the
opaline material. If one were able to
dispel the curse of a vaspercham’s
shell—or somehow twist the curse
to their own beneﬁt—they would be
able to craft an incredible suit of
spell-reﬂecting plate mail.
Vaspercham
The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and
destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new
home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A
vaspercham’s physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard
to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a
vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best
a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature
recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.

Magic-Warping Aura (arcane, aura, transmutation) 30 feet. A vaspercham’s shell distorts
nearby magic. Any creature in the aura who Casts a Spell must attempt a DC 37 Will save.
Critical Success The spell is unaﬀected and the caster is temporarily immune to the
magic‑warping aura for 1 minute.
Success The spell is unaﬀected, but if the spell allows a saving throw, the vaspercham
gains a +1 circumstance bonus to save against it.
Failure If the spell has a target and there are one or more viable targets within its
range, the spell’s target changes, determined randomly by the GM. If there is no
other possible target within range or the spell has no target, the spell is disrupted.
Critical Failure The caster instead Casts another Spell, choosing randomly from their
spell repertoire, prepared spells, or available focus spells (as appropriate) and
selecting any targets at random.
Speed 20 feet, swim 50 feet
Melee Ȱɵ tentacle +33 (agile, magical, reach 20 feet), Damage 3d10+16 bludgeoning
plus hallucinatory brine

Hallucinatory Brine (arcane, illusion, mental) A creature hit by the
vaspercham’s Strikes or Mindwarping Tide must attempt a DC 38
Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is overwhelmed with
phantasmal visions, becoming confused for 1 round (1 minute
on a critical failure).
Mindwarping Tide Ȱɵ (concentrate) The vaspercham releases
an eﬀusion of noxious water from its shell. Creatures within
a 15-foot emanation must save against the vaspercham’s
hallucinatory brine.
Whipping Tentacles ʚʖ The vaspercham
makes four tentacle Strikes, each against
a diﬀerent target. These attacks count
toward the vaspercham’s multiple attack
penalty, but the multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until
after the vaspercham makes all of
their attacks.
