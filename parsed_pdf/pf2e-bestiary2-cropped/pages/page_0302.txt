RECOVERY FROM THRALLDOM
A creature that’s transformed into a
yellow musk thrall or brute doesn’t
die right away, although it no longer
retains its personality, memories,
or abilities as long as it exists as a
thrall. Within the ﬁrst few days after
its transformation, a thrall or brute
can be restored to its normal life with
any magical eﬀect that can remove
disease or a 1-hour procedure that
requires a successful DC 22 Medicine
(expert) check and deals
2d6 slashing damage to the
thrall or brute.
creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation
takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions:
bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few
days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead
within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper
within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.
