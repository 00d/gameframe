WIDGET WORKSHOPS
The ﬁrst dig-widget came from the
workshops of a dwarven thieves’
guild called Godak’s Grifters, which
used more advanced magical
clockwork theories as a springboard
for these simpler but no less eﬀective
contraptions. With their dig-widgets,
the Grifters plagued the authorities
of several dwarven settlements
over the years. Their travels spread
dig-widget technology, and numerous
improvements have since led to faster
and more reliable versions. Though
upstanding dwarven mechanics have
observed dig-widgets and recognized
the complexity of the technology,
they’ve steadfastly refused to
adapt something with such an
unscrupulous origin.
Dig-Widget
Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for inﬁltration. Each
dig‑widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices
that function as thieves’ tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews
for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel
themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct,
they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path,
dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They’re rarely left unattended, as a thief
needs to be nearby to follow after—both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget
from engaging in further larceny once it’s achieved its goal.
The source of a dig-widget’s power is as much mechanical as it is magical.
The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement
over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant
winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget’s moving
parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.

or Climb), Stealth +14, Thievery +15

Inﬁltration Tools A dig-widget’s face consists of
a set of inﬁltrator thieves’ tools. They can be
salvaged from a destroyed dig-widget with
a successful DC 20
Crafting check. On a
failed check, the tools
are destroyed.

Mechanical Vulnerability A creature with expert
proﬁciency in Thievery can attempt a check to
Disable a Device to damage a dig-widget. The
DC is 22, and each success deals 20 damage.
Speed 30 feet, burrow 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ drill +14 (fatal d10, ﬁnesse), Damage
2d6+4 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed
Melee Ȱɵ corkscrew +14 (ﬁnesse), Damage 2d8+4
piercing
Fastening Leap Ȱɵ The dig-widget Leaps up 20
feet onto a creature or object and attempts
a corkscrew Strike against it. If the Strike
damages the target, the dig-widget attaches
to the target (typically to the back of a
creature). This is similar to Grabbing the
creature, but the dig-widget moves with that
creature rather than holding it in place. While
attached, the dig-widget can’t use its corkscrew. The
dig-widget can be Shoved oﬀ, or it can detach itself with
an Interact action.
Sneak Attack A dig-widget’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
