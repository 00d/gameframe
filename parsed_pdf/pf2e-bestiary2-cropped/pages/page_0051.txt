MASSIVE MYRIAPODS
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion,
gathering in numbers around
large corpses or battleﬁelds and
jealously guarding their troves of
ﬂesh from any who would disturb
them. Monstrous centipedes are
also aggressive hunters and are
particularly fond of devouring
horses and similar creatures, often
snatching a mount right out from
under its rider. They are unusually
stealthy for creatures of their size,
making their swift strikes all the
more frightening.
Centipede
Centipedes are ﬂesh-eating myriapods that skitter with great speed through
tunnels, forests, and similar densely packed terrain. Many are small predators,
but others are titanic terrors that devour everything in their path.
