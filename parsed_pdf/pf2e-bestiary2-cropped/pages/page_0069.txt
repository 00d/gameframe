SECRET MONGERS
Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as
well as material goods, especially if
such information can help satisfy the
needs and desires of the Abyss. Each
nalfeshnee has areas of interest in
which they’re highly knowledgeable,
but before a nalfeshnee reveals a
secret, they typically demand a secret
of at least equal value in return.

Forfeiture Aversion A nalfeshnee’s greed is such that losing possessions causes them
harm. If an item is stolen from a nalfeshnee, the demon takes 3d6+10 mental damage.
Greedy Grab Ǻȓ Trigger A creature critically fails a weapon Strike against the nalfeshnee;
Eﬀect The nalfeshnee attempts to Disarm the weapon used in the triggering Strike at a
–2 circumstance penalty. On a success, the nalfeshnee steals the weapon.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +29 (magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d12+14 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +29 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d8+14 slashing
Divine Innate Spells DC 34; 6th dispel magic (at will), divine wrath (at will); 5th dimension
door, illusory object (at will); 4th dimension door (at will); Constant (6th)
true seeing
Rituals DC 34; Abyssal pact
Claim Wealth Ȱɵ (conjuration, divine, extradimensional) The
nalfeshnee steals all unattended items glowing with its Light
of Avarice into an extradimensional space. The demon can
Interact to regurgitate any number of these items into their
hand or onto the ground. If the demon dies, is aﬀected by a
teleportation eﬀect, or consumes an extradimensional space
(such as a bag of holding), they vomit up all the items.
Light of Avarice ʚʖ (divine, enchantment, light, mental);
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect Beams of unholy light
shoot from the nalfeshnee toward four items within 60
feet. If someone is holding or wearing a targeted item,
they can keep it from being aﬀected with a successful
DC 34 Reﬂex save. For 1 minute, the aﬀected items glow
in nauseating colors. Any non-demon is sickened 2
and slowed 1 as long as it holds, wears, or touches a
glowing item. Recovering from the sickness requires
a successful DC 29 Will save instead of a Fortitude
save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed
condition and makes the creature temporarily
immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours. If the
creature removes or drops the item, both conditions
end immediately but the creature doesn’t become
immune to Light of Avarice.
VROLIKAI (DEATH DEMON)
Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn’t
form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from
a nabasu once the nabasu ﬁnally satisﬁes their hunger
and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais
suffer from no vulnerability associated with
a speciﬁc sin. A vrolikai who survives this
process and the period of vulnerability
that follows gains great power and in time can
claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain.
Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters
often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.
