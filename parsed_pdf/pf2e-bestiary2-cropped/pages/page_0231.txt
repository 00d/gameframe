OTHER DEVILS
For over a decade, the legend of
the Sandpoint Devil has persisted
in western Varisia. Most hold that
it’s the fantasy of simple folk and
booze-ﬁlled bellies, but locals insist
it exists. Other creatures akin to
the Sandpoint Devil might exist
elsewhere in the world, with slight
variations on their innate spells and
the nature of their Accursed Breath.
Sandpoint Devil
While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that’s graceful and
beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a
powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid
gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs
and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature’s back bears a draconic
tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists
gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children,
with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.

Accursed Breath ʚʖ (curse, evocation, ﬁre,
occult) The Sandpoint Devil breathes a
30-foot cone of ﬂame that deals 6d10
ﬁre damage. Each creature in the area
must attempt a DC 26 Reﬂex save. The
Sandpoint Devil can’t use Accursed
Breath for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and
is sickened 2 by the agonizing pain of its
burns.
Critical Failure The creature takes full damage
and is cursed. The victim’s ﬂesh appears
charred and burned, and the pain of being
burned alive never fully vanishes. The cursed
creature takes a –2 status penalty to all checks
from the constant pain. Healing doesn’t alter the
appearance of the burns or lessen the penalty, but
removing the curse does.
Devil’s Howl ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental,
occult) The Sandpoint Devil unleashes a bloodcurdling howl that
can be heard for miles. Each creature within a 100-foot emanation
must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become frightened 2
(frightened 3 and ﬂeeing as long as it remains frightened on a
critical failure). Creatures that attempt this Will save are
then immune to Devil’s Howl for 24 hours.
