HIPPO SWEAT
A hippopotamus’s sweat is an
unusual reddish color that can lend
them an even more frightening
appearance that evokes the visage of
a blood-coated monster. This sweat
helps to protect the hippopotamus
from becoming overheated, but it
also bolsters their resistance to all
manner of diseases.
Hippopotamus
Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of
their time in rivers and lakes, but they also can thrive on land.
HIPPOPOTAMUS
Typical adult hippos move quickly on land and attack stealthily in the water.
Though herbivorous, hippos are notoriously aggressive and territorial.
