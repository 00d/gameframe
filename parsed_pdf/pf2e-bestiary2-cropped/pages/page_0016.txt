WHAT IS A DEVA?
Three types of devas exist among
the angelic host, all of which serve
as angelic “ﬁeld agents.” Of the types
of angels, devas are the ones most
likely to be encountered dwelling
somewhere other than Nirvana, as
these angels focus their work on
cultivating and protecting goodness
in mortal souls, be they living or dead.
MONADIC DEVA (SOUL ANGEL)
Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal
realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to ﬁsh souls out for their own use
stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas
ﬁght. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of
Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts.
Monadic devas often ﬁnd their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps,
and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between
their views on a soul’s inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs
220 pounds.

Rebuke Soul Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, enchantment, good, incapacitation)
The monadic deva speaks a word to cause a creature’s soul to recoil at
its sins or an undead creature to recoil at its lack of a soul. One non-good living or undead
target within 40 feet takes 5d10 good damage and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save.
Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target takes half damage and is stunned 1.
Failure The target takes full damage and is stunned 2.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is stunned 4.
Solid Blow (divine, evocation, force) When a monadic deva hits a target for the second
time during its turn with its mace, it deals an additional 2d12 force damage as its
weapon shimmers with ripples of power.
PLANETAR (JUSTICE ANGEL)
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient
of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often
leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the
importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic
hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture.
In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They
stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.
