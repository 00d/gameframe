SHADOW GIANT LOCATIONS
Some shadow giants travel to the
Material Plane to serve as agents
in Nidal’s Umbral Court. Rumors of
these massive shock troops deployed
by the court’s mysterious members
are common, and such rumors often
place them in the mountains near
Cheliax and Molthune.
Protected by the Ancestors by performing a 10-minute prayer as an activity that has

SHADOW GIANT
Shadow giants are ﬁerce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in
perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether
the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On
the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life
as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms.
These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages
to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing
foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their
kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist,
keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in
high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter,
shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous
warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with
outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors
who show the giants the respect and deference they feel
they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants
worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are
so ﬁrmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their
Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize
them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient
religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes
of sacriﬁce and self-mutilation.

Pall of Shadow (divine, necromancy, shadow) When a shadow giant hits with a melee
Strike, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become
drained 1 and take a –1 status penalty to Perception checks involving
sight as long as they remain drained. On a critical failure, this condition
doesn’t heal naturally and can be removed only with magic.
Shadowcloak Ȱɵ (divine, illusion, shadow) The shadow giant becomes shrouded in
shadows and becomes concealed. As the nature of this eﬀect leaves the giant’s
location obvious, it can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. This eﬀect lasts for 1
minute or until it is exposed to direct sunlight, whichever comes ﬁrst.
