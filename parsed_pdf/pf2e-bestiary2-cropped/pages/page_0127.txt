TAIGA GIANT CLANS
Each taiga giant clan links its identity
to the deeds of their most famous
ancestors and heroes. Names such
as Cliﬀsmiter and Mountainripper
hint at legendary accomplishments,
though the stories are rarely shared
with outsiders.
TAIGA GIANT
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one
area’s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant
wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
ancestors’ spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when
they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They
occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than
malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people.
Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating
event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants
by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are
scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in
everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of
those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly
than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that
ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the
ﬁrst rune giants is a sureﬁre way to earn a taiga giant’s unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.

ancestors’ spirits to rise up and protect them, causing a cloak of
spectral faces to shimmer and swirl around them. The taiga giant’s AC
increases to 34 until the start of its next turn.
Protected by the Ancestors (divine) A taiga giant’s prayers to their
ancestors grant them spiritual protection. If a taiga giant loses this
protection (such as by taking too much damage when using Guardian
Spirit, or if the ancestors are counteracted by dispel magic), it loses
its immunity to the controlled condition and its status bonus to saving
throws against enchantment and illusion eﬀects. A taiga giant can once again be
