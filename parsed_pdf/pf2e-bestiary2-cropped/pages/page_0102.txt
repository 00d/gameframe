DRAKE LOCATIONS
While the diﬀerent species of drakes
are adapted to diﬀerent climates and
environments, many drakes share
similar preferences regarding nest
location, searching out high places
that oﬀer cover from above, such
as cliﬀside or mountaintop caverns,
jungle canopies, and so on.
Creatures within the burst take 3d6 cold damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save). The explosion
of shadow also snuﬀs out mundane light sources the size of a torch, lantern, or smaller,
and attempts to counteract magical light with a +10 counteract modiﬁer. The shadow
drake can’t use Shadow Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Speed Surge Ȱɵ Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The shadow drake Strides or
Flies twice.
SEA DRAKE
Long and slender, sea drakes have ﬁns
down the length of their backs and
webbing between their talons, making
them just as adapted for gliding through
ocean waves as the skies above. More
solitary than most drakes, they hunt and
live alone. Although most sea drakes make
their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn’t
unheard of for them to dwell in underwater
caves, living entirely aquatic lives.

Ball Lightning Breath ʚʖ (arcane, electricity, evocation) The sea drake spews a
ball of electricity that strikes a primary target within 100 feet, dealing 7d6
electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save). The lightning then arcs to up
to three secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target, striking
the closest available targets ﬁrst. The secondary bolts each strike one
secondary target and deal the same rolled damage value as the
primary bolt (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). The sea drake
can’t use Ball Lightning Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Briny Wound A sea drake’s saliva carries a large quantity of
salt, making its bite wounds even more painful. When a
creature takes damage from a sea drake’s jaws Strike, the
creature must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save; the creature is
then temporarily immune to briny wound for 1 minute.
