GRAY OOZE ADAPTABILITY
Gray oozes have shown the astounding
ability to overcome environmental
challenges by changing their qualities.
For example, some gray oozes have
adapted to fully aquatic environments,
replacing their movement with a swim
speed and gaining a paralytic poison
similar to that of gelatinous cubes.
Other gray oozes have become charged
with psychic energy, gaining the ability
to cause nearby creatures to become
confused, fascinated, or frightened for
a short time.

VERDUROUS OOZE
Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places
where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes
are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or
artiﬁcial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep
verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.

Corrosive Surface A creature that hits a verdurous ooze with a
metal weapon or unarmed attack must attempt a DC 21 Reﬂex
save. On a failure, the weapon or creature takes 2d4 acid damage
(after dealing damage to the ooze as normal). Thrown weapons
take this damage automatically with no save.
Enliven Foliage (aura, primal, transmutation) 20 feet. The verdurous
ooze constantly emits supernatural vapors that cause nearby plants
to grow rapidly and writhe and grasp at anything and everything
within the emanation. This area becomes diﬃcult terrain for
non–verdurous ooze creatures. When a creature starts its
turn in this aura, it must succeed at a DC 21 Reﬂex save
or take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds
until it leaves the emanation.
Split When a verdurous ooze that has 10 or more
HP is hit by an attack that would deal piercing or
slashing damage, it splits into two identical oozes,
each with half the original’s HP. One ooze is in the
same space as the original, and the other is in an adjacent,
unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it
automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to ﬁll a
space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy to push).
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ pseudopod +15, Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid and Grab
