Crystallize Flesh Ȳ˓ (primal, transmutation) Trigger The crystal dragon damages a
creature made of ﬂesh with a jaws Strike; Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The dragon
embeds transformative crystals in the creature’s ﬂesh. The creature must attempt a
DC 30 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round as portions of its ﬂesh turn crystalline.
Failure The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each
of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the
slowed condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a critical failure). A successful
save reduces the slowed condition value by 1. A creature unable to act due to the
slowed condition from Crystallize Flesh is petriﬁed permanently, transforming
into a crystalline statue. The eﬀect ends if the creature is petriﬁed or the slowed
condition is removed.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
