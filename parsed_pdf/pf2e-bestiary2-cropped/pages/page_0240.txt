WHAT FALLS WILL RISE
The war between the humans of
ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk
of Sekamina waged on for years.
The serpentfolk’s defeat threw their
society into chaos and undermined
their conviction that they would
continue to rule simply because they
had done so for eons. For millennia,
serpentfolk have remained in hiding
in their underground fortresses, but
many feel it is time to rise again!
Ranged Ȱɵ hand crossbow +10 (range increment 60 feet, reload 1), Damage 1d6+3
piercing plus serpentfolk venom or hunting spider venom (Core Rulebook 552)
Occult Innate Spells DC 21; 4th suggestion; 3rd illusory disguise (at will); 2nd mirror
image (at will); 1st ventriloquism (at will)
Deceptive Reposition Ȱɵ The Coil spy Strides up to half their Speed and attempts a Feint,
in either order.
Maintain Disguise A Coil spy can maintain an ongoing illusory disguise as long as they
are conscious without having to re-cast the spell; they need only Cast the Spell again
to reassume their illusory disguise if they wish to change their appearance or if the
active spell is dispelled. Coil spies typically seek privacy when they need to sleep, as
an ongoing illusory disguise ends an hour after they fall unconscious.
Serpentfolk Venom (poison) As zyss serpentfolk, but DC 19.
Sneak Attack The Coil spy’s Strikes deal an extra 2d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
BONE PROPHET
The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place
as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals,
and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by
Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often
raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.

and they rise as skeletons. The bone prophet can raise one Large creature
as a skeletal giant or up to three Medium creatures as skeletal champions;
the equipment and attacks might be diﬀerent depending on the corpses’
possessions (Bestiary 298). These skeletons have the minion trait and
are under the bone prophet’s control; the bone prophet can give all
these minions the same command with a single action that has
the concentrate trait. Any skeletal minions that still
remain after 10 minutes crumble to dust.
