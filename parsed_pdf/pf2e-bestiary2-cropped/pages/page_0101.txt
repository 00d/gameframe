DRAKES AND DRAGONS
Although drakes and dragons are
related to one another, little love is
lost between them, and even the
most territorial drakes know better
than to remain in a dragon’s territory
longer than they have to. In rare
cases, large rampages of drakes band
together to attack an encroaching
dragon, especially if the dragon is
young and inexperienced.
Drake
Distant cousins to dragons, drakes menace and terrorize settlements.
SHADOW DRAKE
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their
species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales
and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception
to the norm for drakes and dragons.
