DAEMONIC DEACONS
Each of the four Horsemen is
served by a speciﬁc category
of servitor daemons known as
deacons. Leukodaemons serve
as deacons to the Horseman of
Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as
deacons to the Horseman of Famine,
while thanadaemons serve as
deacons to the Horseman of Death.
Purrodaemons are currently the most
powerful of the deacons, and serve
the Horseman of War—yet over time,
which category of deacon is the most
powerful can wax and wane.

Hurl Weapon Ȱɵ (divine, evocation) The purrodaemon causes a weapon that has steeped
in their ﬂesh (see Steep Weapon) to telekinetically launch from their ﬂesh. The
purrodaemon makes a hurled weapon Strike without using their hands.
Recall Weapon Ȱɵ (evocation) Requirements A steeped
weapon that’s no longer sheathed in the
purrodaemon’s body is within 120 feet of the
daemon; Eﬀect The steeped weapon swiftly
ﬂies through the air to resheath itself in the
purrodaemon’s body. If a creature is along
this ﬂight path, the purrodaemon can make a
hurled weapon Strike against the target; if it
hits, the weapon drops to the ground in a square
adjacent to the creature.
Steep Weapon Ȱɵ (manipulate) The
purrodaemon sheathes a weapon in
their own ﬂesh. This deals no damage
to the purrodaemon, which can have up to 10
weapons sheathed in their body at a time. A steeped
weapon must be one that deals piercing or slashing
damage.
If a purrodaemon Interacts to crush a soul
gem, one weapon of their choice sheathed in
their ﬂesh becomes enchanted with the daemon’s
ﬁendish power and becomes a +2 greater
striking weapon that can be used in place
of their glaive or hurled at targets
(with a +2 item bonus to the hurled
weapon’s attack modiﬁer and an extra
d10 of damage). This magical quality fades 24 hours after
it ceases being sheathed in the daemon’s living body. A
steeped weapon can be Disarmed.
Twist the Blade Ǻȓ Requirements The purrodaemon
has fewer than 10 weapons sheathed in their body;
Trigger The purrodaemon is hit with a weapon that
deals piercing damage; Eﬀect The purrodaemon
seizes the triggering weapon. The weapon’s
wielder must attempt a DC 40 Reﬂex save. On
a failure, the weapon is disarmed and falls to an
adjacent square. On a critical failure, the weapon
is sheathed in the purrodaemon’s body as though the daemon had used Steep Weapon.
