SPIRIT NAGA COVENS
Like hags, spirit nagas occasionally
form small groups of their own kind.
They normally do this for mutual
protection against a greater threat
or to accomplish a goal that a single
spirit naga cannot complete on their
own. Sometimes, spirit nagas form
a coven to bring groups of cultists
together or take over a city or other
large community, and in rare cases a
spirit naga might even join a hag or
witch coven.
Lunar Naga Venom (poison, sleep) Saving Throw DC 24; Maximum Duration 6 rounds;
Stage 1 stupeﬁed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 as stage 1 (1 round); Stage 3 stupeﬁed 2 (1 round);
Stage 4 unconscious (1 round). Once a creature falls unconscious from lunar naga
venom, they remain asleep for 1d8 hours unless woken.
SPIRIT NAGA
In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place
similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives
of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they
can beneﬁt from the spirit naga’s powers without paying a heavy price—for most
who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.
Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and
corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards,
crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may
know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to
the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth
and stones there.
Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit
nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.
They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are
revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of
“civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship
of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They
often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and
rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread
the nagas’ foul inﬂuence throughout a community.
