Creature Traits
Some of these traits appear in the Core Rulebook, while
others are new to this book and the ﬁrst Bestiary.
Rarity Traits
Unless the creature is common, its trait list starts with a
rarity trait. Creatures that don’t start with a rarity trait
have the common rarity.
Common A creature of this rarity is generally known and can
be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.
Uncommon Less is known about uncommon creatures than
common creatures. They typically can’t be summoned. The
DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 2.
Rare As the name suggests, these creatures are rare. They
typically can’t be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge
checks related to this creature is increased by 5.
Unique A creature with this rarity is one of a kind. The DC
of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 10.
Alignment Trait Abbreviation
Following any listed rarity trait is one of nine alignment
trait abbreviations. They are listed below with the
alignment traits that these abbreviations represent.
General descriptions of alignments are found on pages
28–29 of the Core Rulebook.
CE Chaotic and evil
CG Chaotic and good
CN Chaotic and neutral
LG Lawful and good
LE Lawful and evil
LN Lawful and neutral
N Neutral
NE Neutral and evil
NG Neutral and good
Size
After any listed rarity trait and the alignment
abbreviation, each creature has its size listed
before its other traits.
Gargantuan This size of creature takes up a space
of at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but
can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have a
reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are long,
but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
Huge A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot space (9
squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15 feet if the
creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
Large A Large creature takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot space
(4 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 10 feet if
the creature is tall or 5 feet if the creature is long.
Medium A Medium creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Small A Small creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Tiny A creature of this size takes up less than a 5-foot-by-5-foot
space (1 square on the grid), and multiple Tiny creatures
can occupy the same square on the grid. At least four Tiny
creatures can occupy the same square, and even more
can occupy the same square, at the GM’s discretion. They
can also occupy the same space as larger creatures, and
if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.
Other Traits
After any rarity traits, the alignment abbreviation, and
the size, each creature’s trait line lists all other traits the
creature has in alphabetical order. The following is a list
of those traits found in the book.
Aberration Aberrations are creatures from beyond the planes
or corruptions of the natural order.
Acid Creatures with this trait are primarily constituted of acid
or have a magical connection to it.
Aeon These monitors are the self-styled defenders of reality.
Traditional aeons have dualistic natures and forms, and
they hold a dichotomy of interests, though axiomites
and inevitables do not. Aeons other than axiomites
