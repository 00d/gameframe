IRNAKURSE MOCKERIES
When drow capture a particularly
hated surface elf, or one with a large
following, they inﬂict even greater pain
upon them during the ﬂeshwarping
process than most other victims. The
resulting irnakurse are known as
“mockeries,” and always have elite
adjustments. Rather than using them,
drow keep them close at hand as living
“art” akin to a pet or trophy.
Fleshwarp
Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two ﬂeshwarps
presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths
into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
IRNAKURSE
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and
humiliating ﬂeshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment
of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose ﬂesh,
and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display
to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to
hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all
other targets.
