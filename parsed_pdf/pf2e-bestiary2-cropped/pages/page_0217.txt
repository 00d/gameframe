AUGNAGARS AND THULGANTS
An augnagar that gorges suﬃciently,
especially on other augnagars,
can grow so massive it can’t even
move, thrashing and festering
where it lies. It eventually ﬂies
into a frenzy of self-cannibalism
as it rips apart its own ﬂesh to
feast on. From the ruinous remains
emerges a thulgant—a smaller but
more powerful qlippoth. Scholars
are uncertain if other qlippoth are
capable of transforming themselves
in this fashion. So far, none have
returned from the Abyss with proof.

Occult Innate Spells DC 31; 5th dimension door (×3); Constant (7th) true seeing
Confusing Display ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental,
occult, visual) The augnagar’s writhing limbs and ﬂesh seethe and squirm in a disorienting
and unsettling manner. Creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 34 Will save,
after which they are temporarily immune to further Confusing Displays for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 and confused for 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature can’t attempt a
ﬂat check to recover from confusion whenever it takes
damage from an attack or spell.
Inhale Vitality ʚʖ (necromancy, occult) Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect The augnagar inhales sharply,
drawing life force out of creatures in a 50-foot
cone. Creatures in the area take 14d6 negative
damage (DC 34 basic Fortitude save, and
the creature is fatigued on a failure). The
augnagar becomes quickened for 1 round
on its next turn, and it can use the extra
action only to Stride or Strike.
Rotting Curse (curse, disease, necromancy,
occult) Saving Throw DC 34 Fortitude;
Stage 1 drained 1 (1 day); Stage 2 drained
2 and the creature displays hideous,
festering wounds exuding a horriﬁc
stench. Any creature within 30 feet of
the victim must succeed at a DC 34
Fortitude save or become sickened
1 (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure,
for as long as it’s sickened). While
within the aura, aﬀected creatures
take a –2 circumstance penalty to
saves against disease and to recover
from the sickened condition. A creature
that succeeds at its save is temporarily
immune for 1 minute. The victim of the
disease doesn’t roll a save, but takes the
failure eﬀects automatically and can’t
reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day).
