LIZARD LOCATIONS
Giant lizards can be found in all
temperate or tropical climates, often
in relatively close proximity to smaller
villages or rural regions where they
can be a dangerous threat to livestock
or travelers. The two lizards presented
here tend to dwell in warmer regions—
jungles for giant chameleons, and
savannas for megalanias.
Lizard
Giant lizards come in a wide variety of species, but they all tend to be voracious
hunters and quick to anger—particularly when they’re molting.
GIANT CHAMELEON
Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in
response to their surroundings. Their eyes are capable of peering in different
directions independently, making them almost as difﬁcult to sneak up on as they
are to notice in the ﬁrst place.

Tongue Grab If the giant chameleon hits a creature with a
tongue Strike, that creature becomes grabbed by the
giant chameleon. The target isn’t immobilized, but it
can’t move beyond the reach of the giant chameleon’s
tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with an
attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing
damage. Though this doesn’t deal any damage to the
giant chameleon, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
MEGALANIA
Megalanias, like their smaller cousins the giant
monitor lizards, strike fast and use their powerful
bite to grip their prey. They prefer to swallow
their prey whole rather than risk others getting
a bite of a hard-won meal.
