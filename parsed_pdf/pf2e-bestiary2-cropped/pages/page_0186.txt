LOST NORNS
When separated from a triumvirate
for too long, a norn on the Material
Plane can grow confused and weak.
Her powers remain strong, but her
ability to interpret fate becomes
skewed and warped. Lost norns
begin to use their abilities for their
own goals rather than serving fate.
A lost norn’s alignment slowly
shifts from lawful neutral to
either lawful evil or lawful good,
depending on how she interprets
her visions.

Sense Fate (fortune) A norn automatically rolls a 20 when she rolls initiative.
Triumvirate This functions as the coven ability (page 304), except only norns can join
a triumvirate, and it functions only as long as exactly three norns are part of the
triumvirate. A triumvirate grants the following spells: alter reality (once per day),
cataclysm, discern location, foresight, and revival.

Fated When a creature is subject to a fortune eﬀect from a norn and a
misfortune eﬀect from any source other than a norn (or vice versa), the
norn’s eﬀect automatically counteracts the other eﬀect and then takes
place normally, rather than the two eﬀects canceling
each other out. If both the fortune and misfortune
eﬀect are from a norn, then the two cancel each
other out as normal. At the GM’s discretion,
powerful entities related to fate or luck, like
Desna, Magdh, or Pharasma, count as a norn for
the purpose of this ability.
Sever Fate (necromancy, occult) When a norn deals
negative damage with a Strike, she regains 10 Hit
Points. The target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude
save or become drained 1 (drained 2 on a critical failure).
Further negative damage dealt by the norn increases
the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save (or by 2
on a critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.
Shift Fate Ǻȓ (divination, occult) Trigger A creature within 120
feet attempts a saving throw; Eﬀect The creature rolls the
saving throw twice, and then the norn decides which
result applies. If the norn chooses the lower roll, this is
a misfortune eﬀect; if she chooses the higher roll, it’s
a fortune eﬀect; if they’re the same, she decides
which trait to apply.
Snip Thread ʚʖ (death, manipulate, necromancy,
occult) Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The
norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate
of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips
it short with her shears. The target takes 100
negative damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). If
the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this
damage, the thread is completely severed and the
creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip
Thread can’t be restored to life except by miracle, wish,
or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome
of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours. The norn can’t use Snip Thread again for 1d4 rounds.
