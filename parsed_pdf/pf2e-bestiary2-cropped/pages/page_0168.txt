RARER LINNORMS
While the linnorms presented here
and in the ﬁrst Bestiary constitute the
majority of these creatures, others
exist, particularly in the remote
regions of the First World. It may be
that these rare linnorms simply ﬁnd
the Material Plane too constraining
for their might!
Cairn Linnorm Venom (acid, poison) Saving Throw DC 41 Fortitude; Maximum Duration
10 rounds; Stage 1 6d6 acid damage and drained 1 (1 round); Stage 2 8d6 acid damage
and drained 2 (1 round)
TAIGA LINNORM
Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears.
Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in
the bark of conifers—a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently passed through.
Sometimes this means of tracking isn’t enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga
linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk
in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the
water’s surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.
