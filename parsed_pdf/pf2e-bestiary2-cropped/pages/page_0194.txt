SLIME MOLD FUNGI
The particularly foul environments
in which slime molds dwell are
conducive to the growth of extremely
potent and dangerous mushrooms
and other fungi. A dead slime mold
can be a source of enough materials
to produce a few doses of deathcap
powder or other types of poison.
Some creatures, such as deros or
those with inherent immunity to
disease, cultivate slime molds in order
to harvest these materials.
the amoeba’s body. This thereafter has the same eﬀect as if the amoeba had Engulfed
the creature (DC 17, 1d6 acid, Escape DC 17, Rupture 3).
Weak Acid As amoeba swarm.
SLIME MOLD
A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick
layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares
a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive
system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains
perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with
disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with
a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horriﬁc disease that painfully breaks
down a victim’s ﬂesh. At ﬁrst, the disease manifests as painful rashes and
agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the ﬂesh of the affected creature
actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature’s spores continue
to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open
and release a brand new slime mold.

GRAY OOZE
These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes,
or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or
patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims
to reach down for a drink or step into what
appears to be a puddle, then lash out
with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare
and consume their hapless prey.
