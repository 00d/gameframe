CRAWLING HAND ORIGINS
A popular tale among necromancers
tells of an ancient wizard who
traﬃcked in evil magic. During a
summoning ritual gone wrong, the
wizard’s hand became possessed
and later strangled them while they
slept. The hand dragged the corpse
across the wizard’s rooms to their
workbench, propped up a knife in a
vise, and severed itself from the rest
of the body. According to the story,
the hand went on to commit several
more murders and disappeared into
the sewers of a major metropolis,
never to be seen again. Some
necromancers believe that this
original crawling hand still creeps
through the shadows of that city,
killing as it pleases.
Crawling Hand
Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with
a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers.
Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an
appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the
Negative Energy Plane.
CRAWLING HAND
A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and
agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.
