SCEADUINAR CRYSTALS
Sceaduinar congregate on the great
crystalline knots of negative energy
that accrete in the Negative Energy
Plane. Sceaduinar prod treelike crystal
growths to produce dangerous items
akin to spheres of annihilation or
great structures that echo with eerie
chimes. Sceaduinar also stimulate
these aggregations of crystals to yield
other sceaduinar and similar hateful
creatures of unlife.
Sceaduinar
Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the Negative Energy
Plane, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all
life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces,
sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.
These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind.
Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part,
though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar
sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of
life that ﬁnd their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in
undead creatures.
When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in
great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the
Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for
extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a
plane where negative energy isn’t the rule doesn’t improve these creatures’
attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent
when encountered in such realms.
