GOLDEN GUARDIAN
While wholly carnivorous,
aurumvoraxes are known for gnawing
on metals (particularly gold and
copper), though whether they do this
to sharpen their teeth or because of
some nutritional need is unknown.
Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for
thousands of feet dug into the rock,
often following veins of ores and
winding deep into the earth. Mining
dwarves love the creatures’ fondness
for eating rust monsters. Those who
keep aurumvoraxes for protection call
them golden guardians.
Aurumvorax
Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight
legs, using their terriﬁc strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone.
A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for
its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very
strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery
or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the
shiny black of seasoned iron.
Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving
out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are
irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear
aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold
pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births,
and their mothers are ﬁercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous
proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts
of rage.

Gnaw Metal Ȱɵ The aurumvorax makes a jaws Strike against
a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, the target
is knocked prone if it is Medium or smaller. In addition, if
the target is wearing armor with Hardness 10 or lower, the
armor becomes broken. If this Strike
breaks a creature’s armor or damages
a creature that is unarmored or wearing
broken armor, the target also takes 1d6
persistent bleed damage. This Strike
doesn’t further damage armor that’s
already broken.
Rapid Rake ʚʖ The aurumvorax makes
four claw Strikes against a creature it
has grabbed. Each attack counts toward
the
aurumvorax’s
multiple
attack
penalty, and the
multiple
attack
penalty increases
with each attack.
