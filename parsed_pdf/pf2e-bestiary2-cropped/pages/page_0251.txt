SPIRAL CENTURION GLITCHES
A spiral centurion might have one of
the following glitches.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals
only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
 Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up,
and if it Strides more than once per
round, it takes 1d10 damage.
 Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same
actions each round, regardless of
the circumstances.
Spiral Centurion
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient
and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they
resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies
take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting
down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a
password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of
time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or
a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions
besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only
staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still,
millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches
or malfunctions.

Top-Heavy
A
spiral
centurion’s
top‑like design makes it susceptible
to eﬀects that would cause it to fall
prone. The DC of any attempt to knock
the spiral centurion prone is reduced
by 5. If the spiral centurion attempts
a check or saving throw to resist being
knocked prone, it takes a –5 status penalty. A
spiral centurion that has been knocked prone can’t use any actions other
than to attempt to Stand, but it must succeed at a DC 30 Acrobatics
check to do so.
Speed 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ blade +23 (agile, sweep), Damage 2d12+12
slashing
Hurl Blade ʚʖ The spiral centurion hurls one of its
blades with an angled spin to ensure a swooping
ﬂight path. The blade deals 6d6 slashing damage
to each creature in a 40-foot line (DC 30 basic Reﬂex
save). At the start of the spiral centurion’s next turn, the
blade swoops around and returns along the same ﬂight path,
again dealing 6d6 slashing damage (DC 30 basic Reﬂex save) to
each creature along the same line.
Rev Up Ȱɵ Requirements The spiral centurion has not acted yet this turn; Eﬀect The
spiral centurion Strides up to its Speed. It then gains a +2 circumstance bonus to
attack and damage rolls until the end of its turn.
Trample ̂ˬ Medium or smaller, blade, DC 30
Whirling Death ̂ˬ The spiral centurion spins furiously in place, its blades extended
to slice through nearby creatures. It makes up to five melee blade Strikes. No
single creature can be targeted by more than one blade Strike during one use
of this ability. These attacks count toward the spiral centurion’s multiple attack
penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks
are made.
