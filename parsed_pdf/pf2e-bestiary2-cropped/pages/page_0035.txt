HARVESTING SPORES
The psychotropic spores of the
basidirond can be harvested with
a successful DC 20 Herbalism Lore
or Nature check, yielding 1 dose
of spores (1d4 doses on a critical
success); on a critical failure, the
basidirond creates a 10-foot-radius
hallucinogenic cloud. Each dose
is worth 10 gp for use in Crafting
poisons, or 20 gp if the poison causes
the confused or stupeﬁed condition.
Basidirond
The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on
woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral‑rich
moisture—whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—for sustenance. It uses
hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to
a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for
consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs
nearly 300 pounds when saturated.

cold damage causes it to become slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds. During this time, it cannot
use its Hallucinogenic Cloud or basidirond spores.

Hallucinogenic Cloud ʚʖ The basidirond releases a
cloud of invisible spores in a 20-foot emanation.
Each creature in the area must succeed
at a DC 22 Fortitude save or experience
powerful hallucinations as long
as it remains in the cloud, plus
an additional 1d4 rounds after
leaving the area. A creature
must attempt a new save each
round it remains within the
area. The cloud persists for 5
rounds unless dispersed before
then by a strong wind. Each
hallucinating creature rolls 1d6
each round to determine what it
hallucinates that round.
1 The target is sinking in quicksand. It falls
prone and spends 1 action on its next turn
ﬂailing its limbs as if attempting to swim.
2 The target is attacked by a swarm of spiders. It spends 2
actions on its next turn attacking the ﬂoor with a melee weapon
(drawing a weapon if needed). It is ﬂat-footed against all attacks.
3 An item the target is holding turns into a viper. The
target Releases the item and spends its next turn ﬂeeing
from it.
4 The target is suﬀocating. It holds its breath and is
stunned 3.
5 The target shrinks to 1/10 its normal size. For 1 round it is
slowed 2 and enfeebled 4, and takes a –10‑foot status penalty
to its Speed.

and clumsy 4 for 1 round.
