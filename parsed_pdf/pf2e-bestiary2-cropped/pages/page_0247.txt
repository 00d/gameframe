SOLIFUGID BURROWS
Most species of solifugid lay their
eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t
eat while guarding her eggs, and
thus ﬁghts even more aggressively
against any creatures she deems
potential threats to her brood. The
bodies of wayward adventurers often
litter such burrows, though this does
little to deter other fortune-hunters
from trying their luck in such
treasure-laden nests.
Solifugid
These monstrous vermin have six legs and two large feeding appendages easily
mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders,
sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders
nor scorpions.
GIANT SOLIFUGID
The smallest of giant solifugids are still large enough to harry desert traders and
their mounts.
