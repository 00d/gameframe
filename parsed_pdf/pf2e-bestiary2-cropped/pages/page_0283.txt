DESPICABLE ORIGINS
Velstracs originated with the ﬁrst
debased thoughts of mortals, which
divine beings found so deplorable
that they locked all velstracs away
in Hell. It wasn’t long, however,
before the newly formed beings
escaped their infernal prison to the
Shadow Plane.
Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal ﬂesh-sculptors or serving as
wardens of horriﬁc dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may
serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for
mortal’s souls or choice mortal ﬂesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans,
although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh
350 pounds or more.

Unnerving Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. When a
creature ends its turn in the aura, it sees the face of a departed loved one in place
of the evangelist’s face. The creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become
frightened 2 (frightened 3 on a critical failure).
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ chain +17 (disarm, evil, magical, reach 10 feet, trip), Damage
2d8+7 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed and impaling chain
Animate Chains (divine, transmutation) Chains in the evangelist’s
vicinity sprout barbs and writhe menacingly. The evangelist can
make chain Strikes against any creature that is adjacent to an
unattended chain within 20 feet, in addition to those within the
reach of the evangelist’s chain Strike.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual)
The evangelist stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The
target must immediately attempt a Will save against unnerving
gaze. In addition, if the creature was already frightened, on a failed
save, the evangelist is concealed from the creature for as long as the
creature remains frightened. After attempting this save, the creature
is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist’s next turn.
Impaling Chain When the evangelist critically hits with a chain Strike,
the target is impaled and anchored in place, becoming grabbed by
the chain. The creature is unable to recover from persistent bleed
damage until it gets free (DC 25 Escape).
SACRISTAN
Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures
whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken
by the velstracs’ torments. These unfortunates are
assembled from scrap metal, nerveless ﬂesh, and
bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic
pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans
are empowered by a miniature gateway to the
Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending
their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and
windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in
appearance but are the size of maimed humans.
Their features are redundant or absent and they are
wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.
