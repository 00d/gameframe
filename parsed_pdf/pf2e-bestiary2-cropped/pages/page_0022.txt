Aolaz
Aolazes are great beasts carved from stone and metal and magically imbued with
the essence of life. The exact means of their creation is a long-lost secret, and
they are so rare that scholars have little opportunity to study active specimens.
The best-known aolazes are museum pieces or battleﬁeld relics destroyed or
deactivated centuries ago, though fragmented records suggest that many more
were made and might remain, yet to be unearthed.
Most aolazes are built in the shape of great land-bound beasts, such as elephants,
rhinoceroses, or dinosaurs. Regardless of the speciﬁc creature an aolaz has been
constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations
are—it’s imbued with the magical ability to pursue across
water and even through the air. Few can escape an
aolaz’s wrath once it is earned.

Flawless Hearing An aolaz has an incredible
sense of hearing. It can hear any sound
made within 1,000 feet as though it were
only 5 feet away from the source of the
sound, and any sound within 1 mile as
though it were only 30 feet away from the source
of the sound. An aolaz’s hearing is a precise sense.

Roll Ȱɵ The aolaz tucks its head down and rolls up into an armored
sphere. While Rolling, an aolaz has AC 44, Fort +37, Ref +29, Will
+33, and Speed 100 feet, but it can’t use its trunk Strikes or its
Ultrasonic Blast. It can make foot Strikes while rolling, but only as
part of a Trample. The aolaz can use this action again to unroll and
resume its standing form.
Trample ʚʖ Huge or smaller, foot, DC 40
Ultrasonic Blast Ȱɵ (arcane, evocation, sonic) The aolaz releases a
tremendous blast of sonic energy from its trunk in a 150-foot line,
dealing 12d10 sonic damage. The frequency of this sound is such
that it is completely imperceptible to humanoids, but the damage it
wreaks is all too evident. Each creature in the area must attempt
a DC 40 Fortitude save. The aolaz can’t use Ultrasonic Blast again
for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage and is stunned 1.
Failure The creature takes full damage and
is stunned 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double
damage and is stunned 3.
JISTKAN BEHEMOTHS
Thousands of years ago, the Jistka
Imperium mastered the art of
construct creation, and the aolaz
represents the height of its craft.
The Jistkans used primal magic
to imbue their constructs with
spirits of nature. However, when
Jistkan creators turned to the outer
planes, and to ﬁends in particular,
as a source to power even greater
constructs, they unknowingly
orchestrated their own doom.
