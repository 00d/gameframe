ILL-ADVISED TRAININGS
While many have tried to train
gorgons as mounts or beasts of war,
the combination of their notoriously
short tempers and the diﬃculty
in containing the eﬀects of their
petrifying breath make this a diﬃcult
task. In most cases, those who
attempt to domesticate gorgons
end up creating untamed gorgon
breeding grounds.
Gorgon
Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic,
interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a
creature of ﬂesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a
charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are
dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become
especially deadly.
Gorgons typically subsist on petriﬁed ﬂesh or fossils. These supernatural
beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they ﬁnd
raw stone ﬂavorless, so it’s not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons
use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the
resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks
with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetriﬁed organic material,
and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such
discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures
even more ill tempered than usual—much to the chagrin of anyone they
subsequently encounter.
Gorgon ﬂesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and
aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs ﬁnd off-putting. Creatures with a close
association to earth and stone are more likely to ﬁnd the ﬂavor appetizing;
stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be
delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures,
consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a
physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with
gorgon ﬂesh can ﬁnd renown for their skill in creating
palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.
