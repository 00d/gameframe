WISPS AND FIRE
Witchﬁres have the ability to summon
will-o’-wisps, but a number of these
aberrations usually linger nearby of
their own accord. The fear-inducing
witchﬂame aura manifested by
witchﬁres provides will-o’-wisps their
favored sustenance.
Witchfire
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green ﬂames, this incorporeal
undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the
center of the ﬂames usually resembles the witch’s idealized self-image, regardless
of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchﬁre often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays
around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o’-wisps, which seem to
have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchﬁre. A witchﬁre might visit
villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always
attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams.
A witchﬁre might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens,
but a witchﬁre is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.
