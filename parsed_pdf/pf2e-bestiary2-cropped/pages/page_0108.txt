BELKER LORE
Fiercely territorial, belkers attack
trespassers into their lands without
mercy, slithering inside their lungs
and raking their bodies from the
inside. Many belkers are loyal to
the Elemental Lord of Air, Hshura,
but some hold secret allegiances to
Ymeri, who holds domain over ﬁre
and smoke.
Smoke Vision The belker ignores the concealed condition from smoke.
AC 25; Fort +13, Ref +17, Will +12
HP 78; Immunities bleed, paralyzed, poison, precision, sleep
Smoke Form The belker can occupy the same space as other creatures.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ claw +17 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 2d10+5 slashing
Melee Ȱɵ wing +17 (agile, ﬁnesse, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8+5 bludgeoning
Noxious Fumes ʚʖ Requirement The belker occupies the same space as a Medium
or smaller creature; Eﬀect The belker attempts to ﬂow into the creature’s lungs; the
creature must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature partially
inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and
lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing
and succeeding at a DC 23 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the
creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature’s
space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.
Smoke Slash Ȱɵ Requirement The belker is partially inhaled by a creature; Eﬀect The
belker automatically deals its claw damage to the inhaling creature by forming a claw
to slash and scrape the creature from within.
MELODY ON THE WIND
This cloud of song and sound has been caught
by the wind and carried across the air. While
the melody on the wind (known by some as a song
elemental, despite the fact that no such place as a plane of song
exists in the known multiverse) might enjoy the beauty of music, it is
by nature a destructive elemental force.

Hostile Duet Ǻȓ Trigger A hostile creature within 30 feet
creates an eﬀect with the auditory trait that provides bonuses
to itself or its allies; Eﬀect The melody on the wind recreates the
auditory eﬀect, gaining the bonuses for itself and its allies as long as the
original eﬀect persists.
Retune Ǻȓ Trigger The melody on the wind is targeted by a spell with the
auditory trait; Eﬀect The melody on the wind attempts to counteract the spell.
If it succeeds, the spell eﬀect is caught in a blast of wind that sweeps it back to its
origin, aﬀecting the caster. Targets of the triggering eﬀect other than the melody
on the wind are still aﬀected normally.
Speed ﬂy 100 feet; swiftness
Melee Ȱɵ wind gust +23 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 2d10+10 bludgeoning plus Push
Ranged Ȱɵ solid refrain +23 (range increment 70 feet), Damage 2d8+10 sonic
Mesmerizing Melody Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, enchantment, mental, primal) The
melody on the wind sings in a sonorous chorus. Any creature in a 30-foot
emanation must attempt a DC 30 Will save to resist becoming fascinated by
the melody on the wind. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is fascinated for 1 round.
Failure The creature is fascinated for 1d4 rounds.
Swiftness The melody on the wind’s movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
