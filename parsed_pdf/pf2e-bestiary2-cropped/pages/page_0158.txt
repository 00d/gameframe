WEB TEMPLES
Leng spiders build complex lairs out
of their webs, many of which serve a
dual purpose as temples to the eldritch
gods they venerate. Most Leng spiders
worship deities of the Elder Mythos,
such as Hastur, Nyarlathotep, or
Yog-Sothoth, among others.
Leng Spider
The monstrous, bloated spiders from the windswept realm of Leng build eerie,
dangerous lairs with the aid of magically compelled slaves. Leng spiders have
anywhere from ﬁve to 13 legs, but never an even number.

Create Web Weaponry Ȱɵ (manipulate) The Leng spider
creates a weapon by applying a cord of webbing to
heavy objects, such as rocks or chunks of metal, either
attaching two heavy objects together to create a web
bola or fastening one to its leg to create a web war ﬂail.
Descend on a Web Ȱɵ (move) The Leng spider moves
straight down up to 120 feet, suspended by a web line. It can
hang from the web or drop oﬀ. The distance it Descends
on a Web doesn’t count when calculating falling
damage. The web can be severed by a Strike that
deals slashing damage (AC 30, Hardness 15,
25 HP), causing the Leng spider to fall.
Lay Web Trap Ȱɵ (manipulate) Frequency
three times per day; Eﬀect The Leng spider
spins a web within 20 feet of itself to
create a grasping snare, stunning snare,
or warning snare. The Leng spider’s web
provides all the raw materials it needs. All
save and Escape DCs associated with web
traps use the Leng spider’s Crafting DC for traps
(DC 36). A web trap decays after 24 hours.
Leng Spider Venom (poison) Saving Throw DC 33
Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1
2d6 poison damage and drained 1 (1 round); Stage 2 2d6
poison damage, confused, and drained 2 (1 round); the

Ranged Trip A Leng spider can use a web bola to Trip a target
with the Athletics skill. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. A web bola deals no damage when used to Trip.
