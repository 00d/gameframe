SERPENTFOLK MAGIC
Some serpentfolk might have
entirely diﬀerent innate spells.
These alternative spells are
typically illusions, enchantments,
or divinations like dream message,
enthrall, glibness, invisibility,
mindlink, mind probe, mind reading,
mislead, phantom pain, or zealous
conviction. Aapoph serpentfolk lack
innate spells.

ZYSS SERPENTFOLK
Even the least among zyss serpentfolk consider themselves greater than any
mammal. Their magical abilities, most notably their telepathy, are all the
reason they need to hold this view. And it’s true enough that the instinctual
skill and magic of any zyss is enough to best the average human.

AAPOPH SERPENTFOLK
Aapophs possess greater
strength
and
stronger
venom than their zyss kin,
but they lack zyss’ intelligence
and innate magic. Unlike their selﬁsh superiors, aapophs are
