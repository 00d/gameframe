AMOEBAS LARGE AND SMALL
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms
are usually found near each other,
as the two oozes are part of the
same life cycle. When a giant
amoeba grows large enough, it can
spontaneously split apart into two
separate amoeba swarms, and when
an amoeba swarm feeds enough,
its individual components can fuse
together into a single creature.
Ooze
Due to their bizarre physical structures and ability to break down and feed on a
wide variety of materials, oozes are able to adapt to nearly any climate, especially
when assisted by magical or alchemical tinkering. As a result, explorers frequently
encounter new and terrifying varieties of these amorphous creatures.
AMOEBA SWARM
An amoeba swarm consists of thousands of individual single-celled organisms
held together by acrid-smelling slime. As ravenous as they are mindless, amoeba
swarms use no tactics.

Swarming Slither Ȱɵ The amoeba swarm slithers over each creature in its space, dealing
1d6 acid damage (DC 14 basic Reﬂex save). A creature that critically fails is sickened 1.
Weak Acid An amoeba’s acid damages only organic material—not metal, stone, or other
inorganic substances.
GIANT AMOEBA
These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and behavior
to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their
outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and
other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their
internal structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their
amorphous kin. However, this membrane is also extremely ﬂexible and permeable,
allowing them to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it
in the amoeba’s acidic ﬂuids.
