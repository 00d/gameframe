SHARDIZHAD
Still a relatively young crystal
dragon, Shardizhad has already
made a name for herself in the city
of Wati in Osirion. She has taken
on a somewhat unusual role as a
shopkeeper in that city’s necropolis,
where she’s eager to trade magic
items she’s collected for more gems
and valuable stones.
this aura’s emanation are dazzled. Each creature that ends its turn in the emanation
must succeed at a DC 34 Will saving throw or be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical
failure). Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is temporarily immune to the stunning
eﬀect for 1 minute. The crystal dragon can turn this aura on or oﬀ using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait, and it can choose not to aﬀect allies.
Reﬂect Spell Ǻȓ Trigger The crystal dragon is targeted by a ranged spell attack roll;
Eﬀect The crystal dragon adjusts a wing to try to reﬂect the spell and gains a +4

MAGMA DRAGON
Magma dragons have a reputation
among other dragons for being
unpredictable
and
brash.
Their
temperament and tendency for violent
outbursts ensure that the typical
magma dragon lives a solitary life,
with hatchlings often bickering or
ﬁghting to establish dominance among
themselves before they leave the nest.
A magma dragon always has a reason
for their outbursts and can always justify
their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely
feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically
active mountains or deep underground amid
vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all
true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards
of treasure, but the nature of their searing
lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to
metals, gems, and items capable of resisting
the heat of a volcano’s core.
