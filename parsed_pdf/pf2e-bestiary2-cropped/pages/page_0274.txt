RHOKA SWORDS
The rhoka sword is the preferred
weapon of urdefhan soldiers,
though all urdefhans
know how to wield these
instruments of war. These
uncommon advanced
weapons cost 4 gp, deal 1d8
slashing damage, have 2 Bulk,
and require 1 hand to use. Rhoka
swords are in the sword group and
have the deadly d8 and two-hand
1d10 traits.
Ravenous Attack ʚʖ The urdefhan makes one rhoka sword Strike and one jaws Strike
against a single creature. Its multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks.
Wicked Bite Ȱɵ Requirements The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its
last action; Eﬀect The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature’s
ﬂesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses
one of two options, each of which requires a DC 20 Fortitude save.
If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suﬀers both eﬀects,
using the same save result for both.
•	 Drain Blood The urdefhan drinks some of the creature’s blood. On a
failed save, the creature is drained 1 and the urdefhan regains 5 HP
(or, on a critical failure, it’s drained 2 and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).
•	 Drain Vitality (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the
creature’s vital essence. The creature becomes enfeebled 1 for 1 hour
on a failed save (or enfeebled 2 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
URDEFHAN TORMENTOR
Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably
unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of
Abaddon’s Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity.
With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons
into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to
stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.

The urdefhan lets out a battle cry, sending itself and its
allies into a fanatical frenzy. Each ally that hears the call
gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and
saving throws, and takes a –1 status penalty to AC. Aﬀected
allies must use at least one of their actions to Strike each round, if
they are able (even if it means attacking an ally, object, or thin
air). This lasts for 2d4 rounds.
