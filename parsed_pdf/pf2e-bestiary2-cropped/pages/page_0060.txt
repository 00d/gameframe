FORMED IN HIS IMAGE
Meladaemons have always been
gaunt and bestial, but they didn’t
always resemble jackals. When
Trelmarixian overthrew the previous
Horseman of Famine, one of his
ﬁrst acts as a ruler of Abaddon was
to forcibly twist the appearance of
his deacon caste to resemble his
own wicked form. He went on to
imbue meladaemons with other
jackal-like aspects as it suited him,
further warping them and cementing
their fealty.

DERGHODAEMON (RAVAGER DAEMON)
Derghodaemons
represent
death
through
unfathomable violence and being eaten alive.
Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to
bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the
elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inﬂict the same twisted
and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons
derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these ﬁends, the quicker they can
enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim
and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected
to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long—
the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience
severe visual warping. The derghodaemon’s appearance becomes more and more
twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous
urges to inﬂict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horriﬁc attack
derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming
infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of
ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death,
provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp
of the insects’ bodies don’t drive them to violent fury ﬁrst!
