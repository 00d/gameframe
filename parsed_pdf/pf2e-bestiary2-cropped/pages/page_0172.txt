FEY MANIPULATORS
Marrmoras exert a strange and
subtle dominance over other fey.
The fey under their control are ﬁlled
with both horror at the destruction
wrought by marrmoras and
fascination with their ﬁery power.
Marrmora
On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged
by ﬁre and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildﬁre devastates a wilderness
region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras
can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction.
They seek to reignite the ﬁres that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon
the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of
dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away
from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage
and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent
interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with
others only as a means to more efﬁciently spread their ﬁery devastation.
A marmorra’s twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark
has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands
ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken ﬂesh looks like charcoal‑burnt
wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They
trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies.
Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants
roasting in the ﬂames of their carefully curated ﬁres, there is little that
brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant
creatures cooking to a crisp.
