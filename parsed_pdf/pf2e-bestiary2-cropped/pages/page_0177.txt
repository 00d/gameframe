MUDWRETCH LIFESTYLES
Mudwretches are rarely encountered
alone. They inhabit swampy patches
in small groups, often gathering
near the ruins of sites that once held
great signiﬁcance. Mudwretches can
remain dormant for centuries, always
eager to lurch up to attack passersby.
They’re usually more interested
in defending territory than killing
intruders, and they won’t pursue
victims for long if they ﬂee.
Mudwretch
In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped
at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches,
though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy ﬂesh upon itself to form
a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature’s
general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies
or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They
have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries
out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from
living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than
one that’s comfortably wallowing on a river bank.

Susceptible to Desiccation If a mudwretch takes any
damage from horrid wilting or a similar eﬀect,
takes 10 or more ﬁre damage from a single
eﬀect, or spends more than 24 hours outside
of a source of suﬃcient hydration (such as
a swamp, river, well, or recent rainfall), it
becomes dehydrated. While dehydrated, the
mudwretch can’t Spew Mud, is sickened 2,
and is slowed 1 until it either fully immerses
in water, spends 1 minute in the rain, or
rehydrates in another way (such as via Gory Hydration).
Speed 20 feet, swim 20 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +10 (agile), Damage 1d8+4 bludgeoning plus Grab
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+2 bludgeoning, DC 18
Gory Hydration Ǻȓ Requirements The mudwretch is dehydrated;
Trigger The mudwretch deals Constrict damage to a living
creature that has blood; Eﬀect The mudwretch squeezes
harder, dealing 1d6 persistent bleed damage to the
target. The mudwretch absorbs this blood, removing
any penalties it had as a result of being dehydrated.
Mud Puddle Ȱɵ (concentrate) Until it next acts, the
mudwretch appears to be an ordinary puddle of mud.
It has an automatic result of 20 on Deception checks
to pass as a mud puddle and can make a ﬁst Strike
against a creature that walks onto the mud puddle
as a reaction.
Spew Mud ʚʖ (conjuration, primal) The mudwretch
spews a 20-foot line of pressurized mud that
deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). On a critical failure, a creature also
takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1
round. The mudwretch can’t Spew Mud again for 1d4 rounds.
