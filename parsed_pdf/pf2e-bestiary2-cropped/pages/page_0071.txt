LENG
Known variously as the Nightmare
Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams,
the frozen Plateau of Leng looms
physically and spiritually above the
Dreamlands. Both a part of that
dimension and a corruption of it, Leng
is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors
and ruled by the horrors’ ancient gods.
Denizen of Leng
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent
humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond
the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
dress themselves in ﬂowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the ﬁerce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even
higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests,
laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare
Realm with cold malice.

Planar Fast Healing A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng
at all times, and when away from Leng, they have fast healing 5.
They lose this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections
do not function. If killed, their body dissolves into nothingness
in 1d4 rounds, leaving behind their equipment. A slain denizen
reforms in Leng; they can be permanently killed only when
their planar fast healing doesn’t function.

Debilitating Bite (curse, occult) A creature that takes damage
from a denizen’s bite must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save
or become clumsy 1. Each time a target fails an additional
save against this ability, the condition value increases by 1
(to a maximum of clumsy 4). This condition value decreases
by 1 every 24 hours.
Leng Ruby (enchantment, occult) Many denizens of Leng carry
strange rubies mined from quarries in Leng. As long as a creature
holds a Leng ruby that it willingly accepted as a gift or payment
from a denizen of Leng, any denizen of Leng can target that
creature with outcast’s curse, phantom pain, or mind reading at
a range of 1 mile, and the bearer uses an outcome one
degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw
against outcast’s curse.
