GALISEMNI
Only powerful magic can
stabilize the Maelstrom for a
time, allowing stable islands to
form. Most prominent among
these is the massive planar
trade city of Galisemni, which
lies in the Borderlands, a
somewhat‑more‑stable region of
the Maelstrom where it brushes up
against the other Outer Planes.

a touch. The azuretzi must attempt a Thievery
check against the target’s Will DC.
Critical Success The azuretzi chooses
one spell of up to 3rd level

lost. The creature touched cannot cast the mock
spell until the azuretzi casts it ﬁrst or the 24 hour
