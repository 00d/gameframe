MAGICAL DINOSAURS
In a fantasy setting, magical eﬀects
or supernatural inﬂuences can
enhance dinosaurs by giving them
unexpected attacks, modes of
movement, or other abilities. You can
quickly create a memorable magical
beast simply by giving a dinosaur the
magical attack of another creature of
an equal level, such as a spinosaurus
gaining an acidic breath weapon akin
to that of an adult black dragon.
sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to
make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy
maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture
spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong
dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances
make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those
who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals
or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to ﬁght for the amusement of
others won’t discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones
seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus’s appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just
giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals
into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus’s potential. More
so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to ﬂeshwarping
procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance
the creatures’ viability
as effective guardians.
A spinosaurus can
measure up to 60 feet
in length and weighs
25,000 pounds.
