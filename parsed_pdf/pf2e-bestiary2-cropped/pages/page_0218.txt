QLIPPOTH LORDS
The most powerful qlippoth are
quasi-deities themselves, ancient
entities only rarely worshipped by non-
qlippoth. Of these monstrous divinities,
the Polymorph Plague, Yamasoth, is
the most well-known. Others include
Chavazvug the Crawling Inferno,
Isph-Aun-Vuln the Feaster Within, and
Thuskchoon the Everglutton.
Abyss, thulgants amuse themselves with a variety of diversions, such as maintaining
galleries of petriﬁed mortals or building massive, hive-like lairs ﬁlled with enslaved
minions. Each of these qlippoth is a horriﬁc tangle of limbs, with spiderlike legs,
writhing tentacles emerging from the top of its head, and three scorpion-like stingers.
