DENEBRUM
Most neothelids on Golarion reside in
the Vault of Derebrum, deep within
the Darklands. Here, in a vast cavern
of fetid pools of stinking swamps
and surreal forests of poisonous
fungi, neothelid hives nestle among
twisted spires of hardened resin that
look as horriﬁc as the monstrous
worms themselves. Tended by armies
of worm-like minions who worship
them as gods, they endlessly plot,
scheme, and wage war.
Neothelid
This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular bands of
teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and a vast alien
intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange dimensions
beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos.
Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn
and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time
when all other life is nothing more than food.
