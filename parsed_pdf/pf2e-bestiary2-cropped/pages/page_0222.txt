RAVEN TRADERS
Given enough time to develop the
relationship and establish what you
want, it is possible to engage a raven
in a sort of trade. Placing a small,
shiny object where the raven can take
it might entice it to grab the prize and
ﬂy oﬀ, returning 3d6 minutes later
with something from its own stash.
Convincing a raven to trade requires
a DC 20 Nature check to Command
an Animal and, of course, a raven who
has the inclination to trade with you
in the ﬁrst place.
Raven
Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.
RAVEN
These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of
solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the
periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the
wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a ﬂock, ravens live off scraps as often
as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own
kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is
rumored that this extends between ﬂocks as well.

Cunning A raven can use simple items as tools, such as
poking a stick at an opening to tease out a piece of food.
They are also quite adept at stealing objects. A raven can’t use
Thievery to Palm an Object, Disable a Device, or Pick a Lock,
but it can use Thievery to Steal light objects that it can carry
in its beak or talons or to accomplish other relatively simple tasks.

RAVEN SWARM
A ﬂock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up
to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases,
a raven swarm like the one presented here won’t attack larger foes, but when
manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger,
an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

Enraged Cunning There are few things as dangerously
persistent in the natural world as an angry unkindness of
ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most
barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney ﬂues, loosely
shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an
unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a Thievery check to bypass
many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20.
Swarming Beaks Ȱɵ The ravens’ angry pecking deals 1d8 piercing
damage to each enemy in the swarm’s space (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). A creature that critically fails its save is blinded
for 1d4 rounds as the ravens focus their attacks on the target’s
vulnerable face.
