FROGS AND TOADS
While they might look similar
in appearance, toads and frogs
are quite diﬀerent creatures,
particularly some of their oversized
variants. Frogs tend to dwell in
swampy or marshy areas, while
toads are found in drier regions
like forests, plains, grasslands, and
deserts. Monstrous toads also skew
to a larger size overall.
Toad
Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly
eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They’re known to eat giant
rats, then take over the rats’ burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This
leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly
explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests,
some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for
recreational use.

Tongue Grab A creature hit by the giant toad’s tongue becomes grabbed by the giant
toad. The creature isn’t immobilized, but it can’t move beyond the reach of the toad’s
tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a successful Strike against AC 15
that deals at least 6 slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the toad but prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
TOAD TEARS
A giant toad’s poison glands can be harvested and
used as raw materials to craft a specialized poison
known somewhat inaccurately as “toad tears” (likely
due to the harvesting process, which requires one to
dig the glands out from behind the eyes). One giant
toad’s poison gland can supply enough materials for
a single dose.

Toad tears can be mixed with any other foodstuﬀ or
drink, but the poison can also be ingested as is. The
process of reﬁning giant toad poison lessens its
deadly qualities, and as a result, toad tears are
rarely directly fatal. Yet those who are exposed
to toad tears often lose control of their actions,
making it a dangerous poison nevertheless.
