DEATHLESS FROST
Historically isolated in the remote
frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands,
frost trolls have increasingly been
encountered in more temperate
climates on Golarion. It’s unclear
what’s driving these ice-hearted
trolls southward, but some suspect
the machinations of a wrathful
demon lord are at play.
Troll
Towering brutes with slavering jaws and razor-sharp claws, trolls are voracious
predators. They are nigh invulnerable and single-minded in their pursuit, so they
throw themselves against prey with reckless abandon. Wounds that would cripple
or kill most other creatures regenerate into healthy troll ﬂesh within seconds.
Trolls don’t mark their hunting grounds with claw marks or urine as beasts
do. After gorging upon their kill, they suspend any meat, bones, or other bodily
detritus that remain from tree branches to mark their domains. Unfortunately,
trolls tend to treat these borders as approximations. Before a hapless traveler
even spots such a grisly marker and realizes that they have wandered into troll
territory, the trolls are already preparing to attack.
These pages present lesser-known varieties beyond the common troll.
FROST TROLL
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost
teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in
packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to
assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human
ﬂesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity
to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost
troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their
sickly, cracked ﬂesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
themselves with trophies of bone and hide ﬂayed from their kills.

CAVERN TROLL
Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom
of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in
their path—even rocks and minerals when more
nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky
goliaths can tunnel through stone with their
iron-sharp claws.
