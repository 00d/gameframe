VROLIKAI NEWCOMERS
When vrolikais ﬁrst manifest on the
Abyss, they have no base of power and
are, despite their abilities, relatively
defenseless from denizens even more
powerful than themselves. As a result,
most rely upon stealth and patience
for their ﬁrst few centuries while
they build up a network of minions
and establish their own Abyssal
fortiﬁcations before they turn their
attentions back to the Material Plane.

Black Flame Knives A vrolikai can manifest
a dagger-shaped blade of what looks
like crystallized black ﬂame in each of
their four hands. These weapons function as
+2 greater striking daggers, although they fade away
into nothingness 1 minute after a vrolikai no longer carries them.
Consume Death Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, necromancy, visual) As
nabasu, but the vrolikai does not have starvation vulnerability.
Focused Flames ʚʖ The vrolikai attacks a single target with
all of its black ﬂame knives. The demon makes a black
ﬂame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the
vrolikai deals the damage from a black ﬂame
knife Strike to the target, plus an additional
2d6 negative damage for every black ﬂame
knife they wield beyond the ﬁrst (typically
6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack,
the vrolikai deals the damage from one black
ﬂame knife to the target, though they still
miss completely on a critical failure. On a
critical hit, the victim becomes drained 2 as
the focused attack drains pure life essence
as well as damage. This counts toward the
vrolikai’s multiple attack penalty as a number
of attacks equal to the number of black ﬂame
knives the demon wields.
Mindwarping (emotion, enchantment, mental)
The sting of a vrolikai is mind-warping. A creature struck
must attempt a DC 44 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute.
Failure The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1. Further failed
saves against mindwarping increase the condition value
by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature also
becomes confused for 1 minute.
Stolen Death As nabasu.
