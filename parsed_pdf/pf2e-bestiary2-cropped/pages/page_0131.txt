WOOD GOLEM COMPONENTS
Unless they are badly damaged by
magical ﬁre, the rare woods and
exquisitely carved blocks used to
craft a wood golem retain much
of their value after the golem’s
destruction. Carpenters, sculptors,
and even some merchants will pay
a fair price for the remains of a
defeated wood golem. However, if
the golem belonged to a rich and
powerful person and its fragments
are thus recognizable, it may be more
diﬃcult to ﬁnd willing buyers.
Vulnerable to Endure Elements An ice golem can be targeted with endure elements
even if it’s not willing. If it is targeted, for 1 round it can’t use Breath Weapon or
beneﬁt from creeping cold, and its ﬁst attack doesn’t deal cold damage.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +15 (magical, versatile P), Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 cold
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, cold, evocation) The ice golem exhales a blast of freezing
mist that deals 6d6 cold damage in a 30-foot cone (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t
use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Creeping Cold (arcane, cold, evocation) When the ice golem gets a critical hit with a ﬁst
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 persistent cold damage and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
WOOD GOLEM
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
together from scraps of ﬁrewood and discarded burls. It’s less common for
wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to
be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their
owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems
to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve
dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don’t
bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically
see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids
often feel when facing a carrion or ﬂesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such
creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic
match between the wood golem’s appearance and such locations.
