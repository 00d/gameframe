HEAVENLY MOUNTAIN
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that
appears as a single massive mountain.
Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with
most archons occupying the second
level and base of army operations,
Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the
administrative heart of Heaven.
the fray. Those who witness the self-sacriﬁce of a star archon and live to tell the
tale describe the experience in terms that might beﬁt the sight of a supernova at
the instant the star collapses in on itself.

Blinding Soul (divine, evocation, light, visual) Whenever the star archon takes slashing
damage, bright light pours from their wounds. Non-archons within 10 feet must
attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature is dazzled for 1 round. On
a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds instead. The creature is then
temporarily immune for 1 round.
Explosive Rebirth (death, divine, evocation, ﬁre, good) When killed, the star archon
explodes in a blinding ﬂash of holy energy that deals 12d6 ﬁre damage and 12d6
good damage to anything in a 100-foot emanation, with a DC 40 basic Reﬂex
save. A non-archon creature that sees the explosion and critically fails its save is
permanently blinded as well. The slain star archon reincarnates 1d4 rounds later
as a shield archon (Bestiary 29).
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ A star archon can also make a Retributive Strike by throwing
its starknife, and the enemy and ally can be within 60 feet instead of 15 feet.
Speed 35 feet, ﬂy 75 feet
Melee Ȱɵ returning starknife +38 (agile, deadly 1d8, ﬁnesse, good, magical, reach
10 feet, versatile S), Damage 3d4+16 piercing plus 2d6 good and

Ranged Ȱɵ starknife +38 (agile, deadly 1d8, good, magical, thrown 60
feet, versatile S), Damage 3d4+16 piercing plus 2d6 good and 3d6 ﬁre

Archon’s Door As hound archon.
Prudent Asterism ʚʖ The star archon calculates a celestial
constellation and sends their starknife ﬂying along that
path from one foe to the next. It makes a starknife Strike
against a target within 60 feet. If the Strike hits, it can
make another Strike at a diﬀerent target within 60 feet of the ﬁrst target, and so on,
until it misses with a Strike or runs out of targets it hasn’t attacked within range of
the most recent target. The star archon can attack a given target only once per use
of this ability. These attacks don’t apply any range increment penalty, and the star
archon resolves all the attacks before increasing the multiple attack penalty.
BASTION ARCHON
The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly
uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons
converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a ﬁght that seems all
but lost, a fellow archon of signiﬁcant strength—such as a star archon—
can commit a brave act of self-sacriﬁce by dimensionally transposing
itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is
with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacriﬁce, but instead the
earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of
archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind’s greatest hope.
