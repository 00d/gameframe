ELEMENTAL ALIGNMENTS
More than other elementals, ﬁre
elementals tend to deviate from
neutrality, and are often good, evil,
or chaotic in nature. Lawful ﬁre
elementals are rare. Fire’s inherently
capricious nature seems to prevent
these creatures from succumbing to
the inﬂuence of order.
ﬁre belches a 15-foot cone of toxic smoke that deals 2d6 poison damage (DC 21 basic
Fortitude save). A creature that fails is also sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure).
STRIDING FIRE
An embodiment of the speed and chaos of a spreading blaze, a striding ﬁre
appears as a lithe and long-limbed humanoid composed of shifting-hued ﬂames
churning within a skeleton-like framework.

ﬁre was adjacent to at any point during this Stride must
attempt a DC 24 basic Reﬂex save. If it critically
fails, it is knocked prone by a wave of heated
air. The striding ﬁre can’t use Burning Rush for
1d4 rounds.
MAGMA SCORPION
Whether skittering through Abyssal wastelands
or basking in the searing sand of the deepest
deserts, magma scorpions have charred carapaces
constantly emitting vision-warping waves of heat.
