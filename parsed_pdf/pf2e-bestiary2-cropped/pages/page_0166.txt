NEWBORN LINNORMS
Almost all linnorms lead solitary
lives; they are too reprehensible for
even their own kind to tolerate for
any length of time. Most species do
not even meet to reproduce; rather,
female linnorms usually deposit a
solitary egg in a remote location,
which a wandering male linnorm
then fertilizes and places in a nook
suitable for incubation. Newborn
linnorms range in size from that of
adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls,
and their growth is rapid. Even a
juvenile linnorm is strong enough to
wreak havoc on a small settlement—
though most don’t dare to commit
such audacious pillaging, for fear of
evoking the anger of another, larger
linnorm in the area.
Melee Ȱɵ claw +31 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d8+16 slashing
Melee Ȱɵ tail +31 (magical, reach 25 feet), Damage 4d6+16 bludgeoning plus Improved Grab
Primal Innate Spells DC 36; Constant (7th) freedom of movement; (6th) true seeing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, ﬁre, primal, water) The shoal linnorm exhales scalding
steam that deals 12d8 ﬁre damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 36 basic Reﬂex save). The
steam lingers until the end of the linnorm’s next turn; anyone who enters the area
or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 ﬁre damage (DC 36 Reﬂex save negates).
During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight,
turning the area into diﬃcult terrain. All creatures in the steam become concealed,
and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The shoal
linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Shoal Linnorm Venom (ﬁre, poison) Saving Throw DC 36 Fortitude; Maximum Duration
10 rounds; Stage 1 4d6 ﬁre damage and enfeebled 1 (1 round); Stage 2 6d6 ﬁre damage
and enfeebled 2 (1 round)
FJORD LINNORM
Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in
the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as
they swim up the fjords for which they’re named, they are as vile as any other of
their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their
terriﬁed crews.
