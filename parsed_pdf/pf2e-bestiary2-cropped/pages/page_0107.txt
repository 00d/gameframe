DIVERSE ELEMENTALS
The Elemental Planes are more
than expanses of sky, rock, ﬁre,
and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and
storms ﬂoat through the Plane of Air.
The Plane of Earth includes verdant
groves, shining metal and crystal,
and irradiated wastelands. The Plane
of Fire features magma, suﬀocating
smoke, and radiant ﬁrelight. Amid the
endless sea of the Plane of Water are
pockets of ooze and brine, plus the
otherworldly environs of the deep.
