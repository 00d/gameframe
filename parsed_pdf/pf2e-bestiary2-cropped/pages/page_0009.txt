Aeon
Aeons are paragons of law above all else. True aeons embody opposing concepts
or forces and are tasked with maintaining balance between those two things,
while inevitables are living constructs that enforce laws both mortal and divine.
THELETOS
Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly
spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow
and ending in three-ﬁngered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges
from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos’s tentacles describe a
disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice
while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from.
Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies,
particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a
theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that
restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.

Envisioning When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic
projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all
creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be
vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly
with any other aeon on the same plane.

Fate Drain (curse, divine, mental) A creature
damaged by the theletos’s tentacle must
succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1. As long as the creature is stupeﬁed, it can
no longer beneﬁt from fortune eﬀects. If the target fails additional
saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a
maximum of stupeﬁed 4). This condition value decreases by 1
every 24 hours.
Wrath of Fate ʚʖ (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) The
theletos releases a 60-foot cone of energy from its center.
Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with
the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in
store for them and lack of clear pathways to
these potential futures. They must succeed at
MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
Theletoses care little for the individuals
and societies they manipulate, only
that balance between freedom and
fate is maintained. A theletos might
help a creature who has lost their
freedom escape, but it may also force
those who swore to perform an unjust
duty to stick to their word. If its plans
are thwarted, a theletos doesn’t seek
revenge, but instead looks for other
ways to redress the balance.
