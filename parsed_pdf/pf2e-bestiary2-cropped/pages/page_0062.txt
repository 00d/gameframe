STYX PASSAGE FEES
Gliding with eerie ease along the
murky River Styx, thanadaemons
are only too happy to oﬀer mortals
passage aboard their dilapidated
skiﬀs—for a price. Gold is typically
an acceptable payment for a
thanadaemon’s services, though these
ﬁends are well-known for altering the
details of arrangements after the fact,
and may just as likely demand a favor
or some esoteric good, such as a soul
gem, instead of coin.

Draining Strike (divine, necromancy) When a thanadaemon
damages a living creature with a melee Strike, the
creature must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or
become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the
thanadaemon increases the drained condition value
by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, fear, visual) The
thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can
see within 30 feet. The target must immediately
attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon’s
terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened,
a failed save causes it to become ﬂeeing for 1d4
rounds. After attempting its save, the creature is
temporarily immune to this ability until the start of
the thanadaemon’s next turn.
Soul Crush ʚʖ (manipulate) Requirements The
thanadaemon has a soul gem; Eﬀect The thanadaemon
crushes the soul gem in one hand and gains fast healing
15 for 1 minute.
PURRODAEMON (WAR DAEMON)
Few creatures embody war’s sheer amount of bloodshed
and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons
of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked
in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their
ﬂesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however,
these weapons are the purrodaemon’s arsenal. A
purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness
and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its
own ﬂesh as though drawing a sword from a
sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil
that weapons steeped in it become
powerful tools of war.
