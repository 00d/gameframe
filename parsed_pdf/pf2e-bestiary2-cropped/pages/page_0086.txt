DOPRILLU MASKS
A doprillu’s stylized mask isn’t a part
of the creature itself, though doprillus
inherently understand the mask’s
purpose and power. When born,
doprillus start out weak and small.
Once one matures and gains suﬃcient
intelligence and manual dexterity, it
carves its personal mask. The ﬁrst
time it dons the mask, the doprillu
rushes out to seek a ﬁght. This mask
is never replaced, and it might be
marred from hundreds of battles.
Doprillu
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate
masks at all times that ﬁll their wearers with magical strength and ﬁghting spirit.
Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On
neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when
a doprillu’s home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As beﬁts the
superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations:
hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.

Mask of Power A doprillu’s unique wooden mask is the source of its power. A
doprillu deprived of its mask loses its regeneration and its immunity to
enfeebled and slowed, and it immediately becomes enfeebled 1. The
enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu’s
turns, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the
doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the enfeebled
condition. A creature can pull oﬀ the mask with a successful DC 34
