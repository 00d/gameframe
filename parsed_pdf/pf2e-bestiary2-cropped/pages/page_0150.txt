EXILES FROM BEYOND
These disgusting parasites originally
manifested in the First World, but
the fey denizens of that realm found
them too awful to endure and exiled
them to the Material Plane. Over
time, the isqulugs sloughed oﬀ their
fey features for new, more powerful
bodies of their own. Reports of
stranger variants ﬂourishing in areas
such as demon-deﬁled Tanglebriar
and remote fungi-ridden vaults in Orv,
however, suggest their foothold on
Golarion has become more established
than previously thought.
Isqulug
The isqulug’s appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect.
The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and
a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy
transparent eggs ﬁlled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute
the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an
organic suit manufactured from the ﬂesh of those it has consumed, analogous to
the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of
movement and violence.

Expel Infestation ʚʖ The isqulug expels larvae
from the hivemind in its head in a 30-foot
cone. Creatures in this area take 6d10
piercing damage as the swarm feeds on their
ﬂesh (DC 30 basic Reﬂex save). Any creature
that takes damage is exposed to isqulugia.
The isqulug becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 1d4 rounds,
during which it can’t Expel Infestation.
Isqulugia (disease, incapacitation, primal, transmutation,
virulent) Isqulugia’s sickened, slowed, and paralyzed
conditions can’t be removed until this aﬄiction is removed;
Saving Throw DC 30 Fortitude; Stage 1 sickened 1 (1 hour);
Stage 2 fatigued and sickened 2 (1 day); Stage 3 fatigued
and slowed 1 (1 day); Stage 4 paralyzed (1 day); Stage 5
the creature dies, and its body violently transforms into a
new isqulug. Wish, similar magic, or a 9th-level resurrect
ritual can return the victim to life. The new isqulug
remains even if the victim is brought back to life.
Malleability The isqulug can Squeeze through
tight spaces as if it were a Small creature. While
Squeezing, it can move at its full Speed. The isqulug
can even Squeeze through spaces that typically ﬁt
only a Tiny creature, but does so at the standard speed
for Squeezing.
Swamp Stride An isqulug
ignores
diﬃcult
terrain that’s caused
by typical features
of swamps.
