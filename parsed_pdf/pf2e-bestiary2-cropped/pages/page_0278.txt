MYTHOLOGICAL ORIGINS
The vrykolakas (pronounced
“vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead
creature from Greek folklore. These
revenants appear as humans come
back after death to complete some
task left undone before they can
peacefully rest. Many are vengeful
and murderous, but some are simply
attempting to return to their former
lives, like a shoemaker rising from
the grave to mend his children’s
shoes, carry water, and chop
ﬁrewood. The Pathﬁnder version of
this creature is more associated with
a feral form of vampire.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) When Drinking Blood, the vrykolakas master
regains 19 HP.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
