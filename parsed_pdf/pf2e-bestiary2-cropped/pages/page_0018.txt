SOLAR GENESIS
Unlike most angels, solars are
created from divine energy,
sometimes blended with good souls.
They are joined in this distinction by
the ancient empyrean angels.

Aura of Protection (abjuration, aura, divine) 20 feet. Allies in the solar’s aura gain
a +2 status bonus to AC against evil creatures and a +2 status bonus to saves
against eﬀects from evil creatures. The bonus increases to +4 against control by
evil creatures and attacks by evil summoned creatures. When the solar or an ally
is hit by an attack from a creature in the aura, that foe must succeed at a DC 43
Will save or be blinded for 1 minute (this is an
incapacitation eﬀect). It’s then temporarily
immune for 1 minute.

Animate Weapon Ǻȓ Trigger The solar hits with a melee weapon
Strike while Animate Weapon is not already in eﬀect; Eﬀect The
solar’s weapon leaps into the air and moves with the solar as
if held with both hands. The weapon gains the eﬀects of the
dancing weapon rune for 1 minute.
Arrow of Mortality The solar doesn’t need to provide
ammunition for their bow. When they draw their
bow, they create a magical arrow of light that sheds
bright light in a 20-foot radius until the end of the
solar’s next turn. On a critical hit with the arrow, if
the target has 75 or fewer Hit Points after taking
the damage, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes
dying 1 (or, if it was already dying, increases its
dying value by 3).
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine,
polymorph, transmutation) The solar can
take on the appearance of any Small
or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change their Speed or Strikes.
Holy Armaments (divine, evocation)
Any weapon gains the eﬀect of a
holy property rune while a solar
wields it.
