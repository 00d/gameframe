DWEOMERCAT FAMILIARS
Particularly powerful spellcasters
sometimes take young dweomercat
cubs as familiars. Their
independence and ﬂightiness makes
dweomercats somewhat unreliable
allies, though, so one is never
sure whether their bond with a
dweomercat will be long-lasting or a
temporary aﬀair.
Dweomercat
Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey
upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes
encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is
thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are
famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near
them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to
instantly teleport across the battleﬁeld.

Alter Dweomer Ǻȓ (abjuration, arcane) Trigger The dweomercat is targeted by a
spell or is within the area of a spell as it is cast; Eﬀect The dweomercat gains an
eﬀect related to the school of the triggering spell. This eﬀect occurs before the
dweomercat is aﬀected by the triggering spell. The eﬀect lasts for 1 minute, until the
dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat Dismisses the eﬀect,
whichever comes ﬁrst.

of the dweomercat’s space. Anything in the cloud is concealed.

Prerequisites The dweomercat has at least one dimension
door spell remaining; Eﬀect The dweomercat casts
dimension door, then can make a melee Strike against
one creature adjacent to it at the end of its teleport.
If the dweomercat ends its teleport adjacent to a
creature under an ongoing spell eﬀect or who cast a
spell since the dweomercat’s last turn, this does not
expend a casting of dimension door.
Pounce Ȱɵ The dweomercat Strides and makes
a Strike at the end of that movement. If the
dweomercat began this action hidden, it remains
hidden until after this ability’s Strike.
