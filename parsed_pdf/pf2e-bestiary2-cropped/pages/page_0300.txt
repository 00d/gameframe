THE ETHER WAR
Xills see Material Plane creatures as
little more than incubators, but the
need for fresh hosts never abates,
for on their home plane, xills are
constantly at war. Only the relative
emptiness of the Ethereal Plane
keeps their conﬂict with creatures
like ether spiders from becoming too
overwhelming and outpacing the speed
at which new ranks of soldiers can
replace those who have fallen.
Xill
Xills visit the Material Plane, where they’re often known as ethereal stalkers,
primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane.
These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting
them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles.
Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while
they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.
