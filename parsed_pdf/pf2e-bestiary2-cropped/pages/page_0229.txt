RHINOCEROS HORNS
While some species have only a
single horn, many rhinos, including
woolly rhinos, have a second,
smaller horn on their brow directly
behind the larger one. Despite their
appearance and durability, rhino
horns aren’t bone or ivory, but rather
are composed of the same substance
as hooves and toenails. A rhino’s
horn continues to grow as it ages,
enabling a rhino to slowly regrow
a broken horn. While some value
rhino horns as trophies, the horns
themselves have no intrinsic value.
Rhinoceros
This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn
on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can
run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of
smell, their eyesight is relatively poor.
RHINOCEROS
Rhinoceroses are short‑tempered, territorial, and easily startled, and these traits
combined with their innate ferocity means their natural instinct when disturbed
is to attack. When intruders disturb or surprise rhinoceroses, the animals
respond by charging directly at the interlopers and then lashing out with their
mighty horns.

WOOLLY RHINOCEROS
Even bulkier than their non-woolly
cousins, these rhinoceroses have a
shaggy pelt of long, thick fur and a
huge crescent-shaped horn. Woolly
rhinos inhabit areas of arid tundra
and cold steppes, spending much of
their day grazing for sustenance.
