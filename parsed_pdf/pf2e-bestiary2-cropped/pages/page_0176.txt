MALARIA STRAINS
This pernicious disease is often
associated with mosquitoes. The
most common version of malaria
is presented on page 118 of the
Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
and while the variants inﬂicted
by mosquito swarms and giant
mosquitoes are deadlier, they don’t
have the chance to recur after
1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also
causes weakness and fevers, while
septic malaria causes painful and
infected lesions to form on the
body. Regardless of the strain you
contract, you can’t reduce your
sickened condition while you are
aﬀected with malaria.
Mosquito
While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their
giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous.
FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal
swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms
are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid
months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the
waterfront reaches of settlements.

Pyrexic Malaria (disease) The victim can’t reduce its sickened condition while it’s aﬀected
by pyrexic malaria; Saving Throw DC 20 Fortitude; Onset 4 days; Stage 1 sickened 1
(1 day); Stage 2 enfeebled 1 and sickened 1 (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4
unconscious (1 day); Stage 5 dead
Swarming Bites Ȱɵ Each enemy in the swarm’s space takes 1d6
piercing damage (DC 20 basic Reﬂex save) and is exposed to
pyrexic malaria. Creatures that fail the saving throw also take
1d4 persistent bleed damage.
GIANT MOSQUITO
These horriﬁcally enlarged versions of the common mosquito
often prey upon megafauna like dinosaurs and other large
creatures, but they won’t turn down a chance to drink the
blood of a smaller target—such as a humanoid.

mosquito uses its proboscis to drain blood
from the grabbed creature. This deals 3d6
damage, and the giant mosquito gains
temporary Hit Points equal to the damage
dealt. A creature that has its blood drained by a giant mosquito is
drained 1 until it receives healing of any kind or amount.

aﬀected by septic malaria; Saving Throw DC 24 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1
