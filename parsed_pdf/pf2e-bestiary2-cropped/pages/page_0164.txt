LEYDROTH LEGACY
On Golarion, the ﬁrst leydroths
were created by a secret society of
Azlanti sorcerers who drew their
powers from elemental bloodlines.
These sorcerers clashed often
against various wizardly guilds who
held power throughout the various
regions of Azlant, and intended
for leydroths to serve as weapons
of terror against their foes. Today,
leydroths remain isolated on certain
particularly dangerous islands
among the remnants of the shattered
continent of Azlant, but now and
then foolish explorers seek to
transport them back to the mainland.
Leydroth
In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both
supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent
weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the ﬁrst
leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true,
and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.
Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing
from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.
