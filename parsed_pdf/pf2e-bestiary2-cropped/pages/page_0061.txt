DAEMON HARBINGERS
The four Horsemen are the most
powerful of the daemonic demigods,
but they are only four of many. Far
more daemonic harbingers dwell on
Abaddon, each a unique and powerful
demigod in their own right that
enjoys sweeping inﬂuence among
daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector
(ruler of the slave city of Awaiting
Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian
(consort to the Horseman of Famine),
and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame
(patron to arsonists and agent of the
Horseman of War) are but three of
the dozens of harbingers who rule
realms in Abaddon.

Derghodaemon’s Stare Ȱɵ (divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) A
non-evil target must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become confused for 1 round, or 1
minute on a critical failure. It is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
Savage Assault ʚʖ The derghodaemon makes up to ﬁve claw
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count
toward the derghodaemon’s multiple attack penalty, but the
penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
Swarming Infestation ʚʖ The derghodaemon spews a
large swarm, making a swarm spit Strike against up to
two adjacent targets within range. Whether or not the
targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reﬂex
save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually
hit by the swarm spit). Persistent damage caused
by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the
creature takes any amount of damage from
an area eﬀect. The derghodaemon can’t use
this ability for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The swarm disperses as soon
as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage.
Success The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 1d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Failure The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 2d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the hissing sounds
caused by the infestation also cause the target to
become confused for 1 round; this additional eﬀect
has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.
THANADAEMON (DEATH DAEMON)
Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons
represent death via old age. They are among the
most patient daemons, and prefer to bide
their time to enact far-reaching, decades-
long plans rather than ﬁght (though they
are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman
of Death, they ply the waters of the River
Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are
thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar
(which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the
river’s muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.
