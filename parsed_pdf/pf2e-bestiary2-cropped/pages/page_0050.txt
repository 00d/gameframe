FISHER FILAMENTS
A cave ﬁsher can rapidly produce
a cord from a gland at the back of
its throat. This ﬁlament resembles
a semi-transparent silk rope and is
coated with an adhesive that traps
prey that comes in contact with it.
When reeling in its prey, the cave
ﬁsher consumes the ﬁlament as well,
slurping it up like a noodle.
A severed ﬁlament can be
harvested for use as rope. The
adhesive dries after about 10
minutes. A harvested ﬁlament gland
can’t produce new ﬁlaments, but
it can be used as 25 gp worth of
raw materials for creating potent
adhesives, such as sovereign glue.
Cave Fisher
Cave ﬁshers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground
structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave ﬁsher
excretes thin, tough, and very sticky ﬁlaments at its prey with lightning speed
to capture it.
A cave ﬁsher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything
smaller than a rat isn’t much of a meal for it. When a cave ﬁsher captures such
a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract
larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its ﬁlament doesn’t last long, the ﬁsher
frequently needs to eat one ﬁlament and excrete a new one. The ﬁlaments are
translucent and can be hard to see when they’re still and in darkness.
Cave ﬁshers hatch with the ability to excrete ﬁlaments, but they molt many
times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They
often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.

Pull Filament Ȱɵ The cave ﬁsher pulls a creature grabbed by its ﬁlament toward itself,
even suspending the target vertically if necessary. The cave ﬁsher attempts an
Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the cave ﬁsher
pulls the creature 15 feet closer to it (30 feet closer on a critical success).
Sticky Filament Any creature hit by the cave ﬁsher’s sticky ﬁlament is grabbed.
The cave ﬁsher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its ﬁlament, but it
automatically releases the creature if the cave ﬁsher moves beyond the ﬁlament’s
60-foot length. The cave ﬁsher can use only one ﬁlament at a time, and it can
sever the ﬁlament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The
ﬁlament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it.
This doesn’t deal any damage to the cave ﬁsher itself. The ﬁlament has AC 17, and
its Escape DC is 19.
