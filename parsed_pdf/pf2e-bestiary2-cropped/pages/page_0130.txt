ICE GOLEM COMPONENTS
When destroyed, the magic
sustaining an ice golem’s form
quickly dissipates. Unless it is in a
freezing environment, the golem’s
shattered remains soon melt
completely away. Still, the animating
magic can linger in shards of ice
that resist melting; these may fetch
a good price from wealthy folk to
preserve foods or chill beverages.
Pieces of ice that are captured and
magically preserved or allowed to
melt in sealed containers can also be
sold to scholars who may be able to
divine arcane secrets from the once
magically animated materials.
necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, unconscious; Resistances

Stench (aura, olfactory) 40 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the
aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as
long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, aﬀected creatures take
a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened
condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Vulnerable to Gentle Repose Casting a gentle repose spell on a carrion golem causes it
to grow stiﬀ. The golem attempts a DC 19 Fortitude save. It’s unaﬀected on a critical
success, slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds on a success, and on a failure is immobilized and
slowed for 1d4 rounds.

end or be reduced until the disease is cured; Saving Throw DC 19 Fortitude; Stage 1
carrier with no ill eﬀect (1d4 hours); Stage 2 sickened 1 (1 day); Stage 3 sickened 1
and slowed 1 as long as it remains sickened (1 day); Stage 4 unconscious (1 day);

ICE GOLEM
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from
individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a
humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates,
the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer
temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower
end of the scale as far as cost and difﬁculty to create, gives these constructs
unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful
in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians
for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem
standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the
chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice
golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

emanation, with a DC 19 basic Reﬂex save.
