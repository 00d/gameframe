LEECH SPECIES
The spotted hooktooth leech is
often found in areas frequented
by trolls, who sometimes wear
them as awful decorations, relying
on their regeneration to control
the bleeding eﬀects. The gigantic
elephant leech feeds on immense
beasts of the swamplands or jungles,
like elephants, froghemoths, and
dinosaurs, attacking from unexpected
range. But it’s the relatively small
gutleech that provides the most fuel
for nightmares, due to its awful habit
of feeding on victims from inside.
Leech
Though valued by apothecaries and ﬁeld medics as methods to reduce swelling
or drain blood, leeches are despised by most who encounter them, regardless
of the setting.
GIANT LEECH
Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws
ﬁlled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving
shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are
their favorite prey, but they won’t balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or
halﬂing-sized meal.

BROOD LEECH SWARM
Most smaller species of leeches do not tend to swarm, but
brood leeches are prone to gathering in seething, undulant
mats of squirming gluttony. When they gather in sufﬁcient
numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech’s
feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding.
In these situations, their mild venom can affect much
larger creatures than their usual prey.
