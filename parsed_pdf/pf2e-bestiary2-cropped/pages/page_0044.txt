Bog Strider
The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those
who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright
water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders
can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or ﬂeeing from
predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they
call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
A bog strider’s diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed
only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the ﬂesh of any sapient
creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to
ensure the society’s survival against the more aggressive creatures often found
in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community
is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community’s prosperity,
and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female
bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but
often such roles aren’t limited to a single gender, as every member of a small
community pitches in to help as they can.

Hurl Net Ȱɵ Requirements The bog strider is holding a net in
two hands; Eﬀect The bog strider hurls their net to hamper a
foe. They make a ranged Strike (with a +10 modiﬁer) against
a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet. On
a hit, the target is ﬂat-footed and takes a
–10‑foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds.
On a critical hit, the creature is instead
restrained. The DC to Escape the net is 16. A
creature adjacent to the target can Interact
with the net to remove it from the target.
Water Sprint ̂ˬ The bog strider Strides
up to three times in a straight line across
smooth water. They can make a single
Strike against a creature at the end of
this movement.
Water Stride The bog strider can stand
and move on the surface of water
or other liquids without
falling through. The bog
strider can go underwater if
they wish, but they must
Swim to do so.
TREMOR TAPPING
Seshes can communicate with other
bog striders via wavesense by
tapping at a water surface they’re
standing upon. Other creatures with
wavesense can detect these tappings,
but understanding them is typically
beyond non-seshes. A GM might
allow a character who has wavesense,
can speak Aquan, and spends a
signiﬁcant amount of time living
among bog striders to understand
tremor tapping or to communicate via
this unusual method.
