BUILDING WITH SHELLS
The shell of a giant snapping turtle
is over 20 feet long and is sturdy,
naturally curved, and waterproof,
making it a useful building material.
While boggards seldom have
advanced construction techniques,
they use giant snapping turtle shells
as roofs and rafts when available.
Boggards also incorporate smaller
turtle shells into their armor.
Turtle
These generally mild-mannered and docile creatures prefer to be left alone, but the
ill-tempered snapping turtle is a notably violent exception to this rule.
SNAPPING TURTLE
Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long ﬂexible neck, a sharp piercing
beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn’t prevent some spellcasters
from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have
shells around 18 inches in length.

its turn. This increases its AC to 18, but it can’t act except to reemerge, which it can
do as a single action.
GIANT SNAPPING TURTLE
If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle
seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain.
Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is
capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly
boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to
serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those
unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle ﬁnd that even
the creature’s stomach is somewhat armored, making it difﬁcult to cut through.
