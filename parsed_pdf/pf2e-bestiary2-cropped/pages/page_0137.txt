GRENDEL’S MOTHER
At the bottom of a remote mountain
lake ﬁlled with sea serpents is a
magical house—the lair of Grendel’s
mother. Among her many treasures is
a sword so big and heavy that only a
supernaturally strong individual can
wield it. When Grendel is injured, he
retreats here to heal.
Grendel
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there
is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility
is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking
settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting
celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.
Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won’t save the world from his
ravages for long. Once Grendel’s mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent
son’s death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the
sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts
heroes powerful enough to defeat him.
