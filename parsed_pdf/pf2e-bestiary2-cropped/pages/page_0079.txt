SOUL SWALLOWERS
The fact that devourers consume
souls makes them particularly hated
by the church of Pharasma and
psychopomps alike.
Devourer
When ﬁends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches
of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horriﬁc undead called devourers that
consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are
ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—
manifestations of the devourers’ most recently consumed souls.

Spell Deﬂection (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster who targets a devourer with
a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession,
spirit blast, or spirit song can attempt a counteract check to free a soul the
devourer has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds,
the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the
devourer can’t use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are
otherwise immune to these spells.

Devour Soul ʚʖ (death, divine, necromancy) The devourer touches
a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative damage (DC 31 basic
Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes
trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature
can’t be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a wish spell.
Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul
(see Spell Deﬂection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one
soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature
(see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast
spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature
is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul
charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by
powerful magic such as wish.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living
creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become
drained 1. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition
value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Soul Spells A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend
a number of soul charges equal to the spell’s level (similar to casting a spell
using charges from a staﬀ). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by
expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically
has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.
