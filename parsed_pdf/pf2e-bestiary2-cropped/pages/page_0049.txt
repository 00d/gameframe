CATOBLEPAS NESTS
A catoblepas den is an awful place
indeed—a ﬁlthy nest composed
of piles of decaying vegetation,
half‑ﬁnished or half-digested meals
of decaying animals, never-quite-dry
banks of mud, and tangles of thorny
branches. Worse, the catoblepas’s
stink infuses such a site, imposing
the beast’s ungodly stench upon
those who would explore and search
within for treasure. A catoblepas
nest can retain its stink in this way
for up to a week after it’s been
abandoned by its foul denizen.
Catoblepas
The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps,
the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods,
leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that
other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas
bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.
A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.

the aura must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed

creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover
from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
