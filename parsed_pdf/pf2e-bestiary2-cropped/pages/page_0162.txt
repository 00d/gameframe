LESHY HEROES
Occasionally, a leshy proves so
valuable to their community that
they’re uplifted as a hero. These
admired leshys are not all warriors;
outstanding artisans, caretakers,
or diplomats might also be lauded
as heroes.
Primal Innate Spells DC 17; 4th speak with plants
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The sunﬂower leshy
transforms into a Small ﬂower. This ability otherwise uses the eﬀects of tree shape.
Seed Spray ʚʖ (conjuration, primal) The sunﬂower leshy launches a deluge of seeds
from their head in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within
the area (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save). It gains a +2 status bonus to this damage against
dazzled creatures. The sunﬂower leshy can’t use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
FLYTRAP LESHY
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, ﬂytrap leshys get along well with other
leshys. Nonetheless, they’re among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the
most vulnerable places in the natural world with their ﬂytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of ﬂytrap leshys band together to create
amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal
defense suffuses ﬂytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between
multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight
humanoids—to a ﬂytrap leshy, though, there’s nothing strange about sharing your
innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your
home from an enemy.

Amalgam Ȱɵ (polymorph, primal, transmutation) A
ﬂytrap leshy can combine itself with an adjacent and
willing ﬂytrap leshy that is not currently aﬀected
by Amalgam. The leshy using Amalgam physically
merges with the target, restoring 3d8 Hit Points to the target. The
leshy can Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop,
the target leshy takes 3d8 damage. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once
and the original leshy gains the dying condition or increases their dying condition
value by 1 if they were already dying. As long as Amalgam is sustained, the target
leshy gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, its AC increases to 21,
and it gains an additional reaction at the start of each turn.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The
ﬂytrap leshy transforms into a Small ﬂytrap. This ability otherwise
uses the eﬀects of tree shape.
Flytrap Toxin (poison) Saving Throw DC 19 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6
rounds; Stage 1 sickened 1 (1 round), Stage 2 sickened 2 (1 round)
