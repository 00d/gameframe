VELSTRACS ON GOLARION
Velstracs are most often
encountered in the shadowy realm
of Nidal, where the state worship
of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced.
Indeed, many velstracs are created
from the souls of Joyful Things,
devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have
had their limbs amputated to focus
their minds on the veneration of
pain, sacriﬁce, and torment.

Glimpse of Stolen Flesh (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. When a

form. The creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or become stunned 1.

The

stares at a creature

30 feet. The creature must
immediately attempt a Will save
against
glimpse
of stolen ﬂesh. In
addition, if the creature
was already stunned, on a failed
save, it feels its internal organs twist
and writhe, and is clumsy 2 for 1
minute. After attempting this
save, the creature is then
temporarily
immune
until the start of the
interlocutor’s next turn.
Surgical Rend Ȱɵ This functions as the Rend
ability, dealing claw damage. In addition, if
the target is a living creature with organs and
muscle, the interlocutor opens a precise wound.
Until the creature is restored to its maximum Hit
Points, thus closing the wound, Strikes against the
creature deal 1d6 extra precision damage.
EREMITE
Eremites roam the planes to seek out ideal portions of
other creatures, such as a hero’s sword-arm or an angel’s
pinions. Eremites capture these specimens to clinically
test their true limits, then harvest specimens
and add them to their own bodies. An
eremite might attach tongues to their
hand as extra ﬁngers or a ﬁst to
the back of their neck in a horrid
“improvement.” Eremites average
7 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 pounds.
