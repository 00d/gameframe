MORLOCK MACHINERY
Morlocks tend toward brutish actions
and violent traditions and have little
interest in bettering their societies
or creating art. However, they have
a strange obsession with ancient
machinery and magical items,
particularly clockwork constructions.
Their knack for tinkering helps
keep ancient guardians and traps
functional, even if their work
backﬁres now and then.
Morlock
Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal
monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands.
Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and
their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four‑limbed shufﬂe
for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the
surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient
homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as
gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.
Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food,
even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks
encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger.
A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.

Instinctual Tinker ʚʖ The morlock tinkers with an adjacent
construct or mechanical hazard. They attempt a
Crafting check against the construct’s or
hazard’s Fortitude DC. The morlock can’t
succeed if the target’s level is more than
double the morlock’s.
Critical Success The target gains 4d6 HP and a
+1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls for 1 minute.
Success The target gains 2d6 HP.
Critical Failure The morlock injures
itself, taking 2d6 damage (typically
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, but
potentially a diﬀerent type at the GM’s
discretion).
Leap Attack ʚʖ The morlock Strides up to twice its
Speed, during which it attempts a High Jump or
a Long Jump. At any point during its movement,
the morlock can make a melee Strike against
an enemy in its reach. The morlock then can’t
use Leap Attack for 1 round.
Sneak Attack A morlock’s Strikes deal an extra 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Swarming Stance A morlock can share the same space as
another morlock, but no more than two morlocks can
occupy the same space. When morlocks share the same space,
they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls.
