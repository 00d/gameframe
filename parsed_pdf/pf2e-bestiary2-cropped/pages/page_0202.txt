EXTRAPLANAR HUMANOIDS
An important distinction exists
between planar scions and extraplanar
humanoids, such as fetchlings.
Fetchlings and other extraplanar
humanoids represent true ancestral
groups with their own physical and
cultural identities and traditions.
Planar scions are members of diverse
ancestries who share a similar
inheritance from extraplanar beings
and, with exception of marids, typically
integrate into other humanoid societies
instead of building their own.
with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and
ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to
each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural
splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they
are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random
direction, departing with only their hope that they’ll discover whatever mystery
lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads ﬁnd that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in
such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also ﬁnd time
to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a speciﬁc portion of a fortiﬁcation or a remote
location on a wilderness trail.

SULI
Because their genie forebears are native to the Material
Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large
the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are
often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring
harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.
Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other
geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful
pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or
humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that
bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffed-
up ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution
easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis’ boasts not
only glorify themselves, but also secure their
companions’ and families’ accomplishments
in history, with the ultimate goal of
spinning stories that will be retold for
generations. This is especially true
for sulis who have lived with other
geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a
strong connection to an Elemental Plane.
Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek
to integrate with other humanoid societies. They work
to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their
