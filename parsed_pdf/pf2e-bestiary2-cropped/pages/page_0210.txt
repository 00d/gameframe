PSYCHOPOMP FOES
Psychopomps’ greatest enemies are
creatures that devour or steal souls,
such as astradaemons and night
hags. Their other opponents include
necromancers, proteans, and those
who have unnaturally extended their
lifespan, such as liches.
CATRINA
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these
souls, helping to convince them of the ﬁnality of their fate to ease a spirit’s passing.
Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can’t accept their death. They
perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion
for a mortal’s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help
an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright ﬂowers and colorful dresses,
giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most
catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and
carry garlands of ﬂowers.

Calming Presence (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation) 30 feet. A

Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to calming
presence for 24 hours.
Success The creature’s attack rolls take a –1 status penalty for 1 round.
Failure Any emotion eﬀects that would aﬀect the creature are suppressed and the
creature can’t use hostile actions. If the creature is subjected to hostility from any
other creature, it ceases to be aﬀected by calming presence and is temporarily
immune to calming presence for 24 hours.
Critical Failure As failure, but hostility doesn’t end the eﬀect.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +14 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 2d8+2 bludgeoning plus

Divine Innate Spells DC 22; 4th dimension door, talking

Compel Condemned Ȱɵ (divine, enchantment, incapacitation,

within 30 feet to approach and allow the catrina to kiss
them, in preparation for using Kiss of Death. The target
must attempt a DC 22 Will save.
Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune
to Compel Condemned for 24 hours.
Failure The creature must spend each of its actions to move closer to the catrina as
quickly as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the compelled creature is
adjacent to the catrina, it stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature takes any damage,
the eﬀect ends and the creature is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for
24 hours. This eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if the catrina uses this ability again on
subsequent rounds, it extend the duration by 1 round for all aﬀected creatures.
Critical Failure As failure, but damage does not end the eﬀect.
Kiss of Death ʚʖ (death, divine, manipulate, necromancy) The catrina gives a long,
passionate kiss to an unconscious or willing creature, dealing 3d6 negative damage.
Any creature damaged by the same catrina’s Kiss of Death for 3 consecutive rounds
becomes unconscious and is dying 1.
