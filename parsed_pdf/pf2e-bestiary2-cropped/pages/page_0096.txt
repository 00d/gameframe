MOSCHABBATT
The ancient magma dragon

treasures of his vast hoard.

UMBRAL DRAGON
While the other primal dragons
hail from the Elemental Planes, the
cruel and unceasingly malicious
umbral dragons originate in the
depths of the Shadow Plane.
Their sleek black scales and
serpentine grace allow them to
strike from hiding, and they are
known for playing with their
prey before ﬁnally ﬁnishing
it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome
appetites prefer the necrotic ﬂesh of undead creatures
to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of
accidental beneﬁt to nearby humanoid societies,
but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures
for the taste, rather than out of any desire to
protect others from the undead. The beneﬁt
is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons
exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to
