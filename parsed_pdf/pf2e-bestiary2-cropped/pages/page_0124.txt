UNKNOWN ORIGINS
Frost worms are clearly supernatural
in origin, though the source of their
magical abilities remains unclear.
Research is hampered by the fact
that neither the corpse nor its magic
survive the creature’s death, and live
frost worms are notoriously diﬃcult
and dangerous to keep or transport.
Evidence exists that the winter
witches of Irrisen may have created
the ﬁrst frost worms, while other
clues suggest they hail from the
distant planet of Triaxus.
Frost Worm
The frost worm’s single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous
mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually
two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth.
An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouﬂage, burrowing, and
deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive,
high‑pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared
it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.
The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while
it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such
regions. A frost worm that somehow ﬁnds itself in temperate or even tropical
environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time,
creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.

Death Throes (cold, evocation, primal) When a frost worm dies, it
explodes in a 100-foot burst of searing cold blood. All creatures
and objects in range take 10d8 cold damage (DC 29 basic
Reﬂex save).
Worm Chill (aura, cold, evocation, primal) 5 feet. A creature
that enters or begins its turn in the emanation takes 3d6
cold damage (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save).
Freezing Blood Ǻȓ (cold) Trigger The frost worm takes
piercing or slashing damage; Eﬀect The frost worm’s
freezing blood sprays out on a random creature within
10 feet of the frost worm. That creature takes 7d6 cold
damage (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save).

Melee Ȱɵ jaws +25, Damage 3d8+10 piercing plus 2d6
persistent cold
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (cold, evocation, primal) The frost
worm exhales a blast of frost, dealing 13d6 cold damage
to creatures in a 50-foot cone (DC 32 basic Reﬂex save). It
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Worm Trill Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, enchantment,
mental, primal) The frost worm emits a hypnotic
trill. Each non–frost worm creature within 100
feet must attempt a DC 32 Will save. The
eﬀects of Worm Trill last for 1 round, but if the
frost worm uses this ability again on subsequent
rounds, it extends this duration by 1 round for any
creature already aﬀected.
Success The creature is unaﬀected and is
immune to Worm Trill for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated by the frost
worm.
Critical Failure As failure, but the fascinated
condition doesn’t end if the frost worm uses
hostile actions against the creature.
