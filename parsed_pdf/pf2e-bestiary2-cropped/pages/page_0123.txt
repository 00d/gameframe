ALIEN ORIGINS
Froghemoths have been known to
suddenly abandon an established lair
to seek a new home, as if in response
to some cosmic convergence or
subspace signal imperceptible to
other creatures. Some argue that
the froghemoth is never fully
comfortable in any environment
because it isn’t from this world at
all, and that these wanderings are
instinctual urges to seek out its true
home—a home not represented by
the strange world in which the beast
ﬁnds itself trapped.
Froghemoth
A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth
is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote
Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a
frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its
eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.

Otherworldly Vision A froghemoth’s alien eyes allow it to perceive creatures within 30
feet, even if they are invisible or ethereal. It can still be fooled by successful Stealth
checks to Hide, but it has Perception DC 38 in such cases. It also sees through and is
unaﬀected by illusions with the visual trait if they are within 30 feet.
AC 32, all-around vision; Fort +26, Ref +21, Will +23
HP 285; Immunities electricity
Electric Torpor Though a froghemoth is immune to electricity damage, it is slowed 1 for
1 round whenever it would have otherwise taken electricity damage.
Speed 20 feet, swim 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +27 (reach 10 feet), Damage 3d12+14 piercing
plus Improved Grab
Melee Ȱɵ tentacle +27 (agile, reach 15
feet), Damage 3d8+14 bludgeoning
plus Improved Grab
Melee Ȱɵ tongue +27 (agile, reach
30 feet), Damage 2d10+14
piercing plus barbed tongue
Aquatic Ambush Ȱɵ
Barbed Tongue A creature hit
by the froghemoth’s tongue
becomes grabbed by the
froghemoth.
The
creature
isn’t immobilized, but it can’t
move beyond the reach of the
froghemoth’s tongue. A creature
can sever the tongue with a successful
Strike against AC 31 that deals at least 15
slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the froghemoth but prevents it
from using its tongue Strike until
it regrows its tongue, which
takes 1 minute.
Flailing Tentacles ʚʖ The
froghemoth makes up to four
tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These count toward the froghemoth’s
multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t
increase until after all the attacks.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ 3d6+12, DC 33
Retract Tongue ʚʖ The froghemoth pulls a creature grabbed by its
tongue toward itself. The froghemoth rolls an Athletics check against
the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the froghemoth pulls the
creature into an adjacent space, and if it critically succeeds it can
also make a bite Strike against the creature after the pull.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) Large, 3d6+9 bludgeoning, Rupture 24
