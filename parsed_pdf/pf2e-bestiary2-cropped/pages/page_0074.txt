HELLFIRE
Stinking, sulfurous hellﬁre is infused
with evil. Hellﬁre always deals a
combination of ﬁre damage and evil
damage, though the speciﬁc ratio
depends on the hellﬁre’s origin. Certain
types of hellﬁre can impose other
eﬀects on creatures as well, such as
sapping their strength or memories.

OSYLUTH (BONE DEVIL)
An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels
in the sadism and torture for which Hell is so well
known. These devils’ charge is to seek out heresies,
both among mortals and among other ﬁends—a
commandment they uphold with unwavering
fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps
of Hell’s ﬁfth layer, Stygia; where heresies and
the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually
rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell,
they build massive, calciﬁed hives where they perform their vile
interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils
and petitioners alike.
