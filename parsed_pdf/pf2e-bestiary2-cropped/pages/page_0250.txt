SHIVER ADDICTS
Talented alchemists process dream
spider venom into an addictive drug
called shiver (Gamemastery Guide
121). Those who become addicted to
shiver may be driven in desperation
to seek out dream spiders and allow
them to bite their ﬂesh in order
to get their ﬁx—a tactic that often
backﬁres awfully as the spiders feed.
Spider
Spiders range dramatically in size, yet all are to some extent venomous.
DREAM SPIDER
A dream spider’s webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same
hallucinogenic compound as the creature’s toxin. Originally denizens of tropical
jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly
thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to
produce the drug known as shiver.

OGRE SPIDER
These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement
of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage
of an ogre’s leer. Ogres themselves ﬁnd the appearance of ogre spider
faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres’
attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and well-
fed spiders.
