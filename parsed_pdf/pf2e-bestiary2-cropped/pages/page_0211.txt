VANTH SCYTHES
Vanths’ favored weapon is the scythe,
a choice that even further adds to
their fearsome appearance and can
lead to unfortunate associations with
the Grim Reaper or Urgathoa among
more superstitious mortals. Vanths
ﬁnd such comparisons to be ignorant
at best or insulting at worst. Some
vanths infuse their scythes with
diﬀerent qualities, such as cold iron
or silver, depending on the nature of
their most common enemies.
VANTH
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as
vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask
resembling a vulture’s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to ﬁght against those who
would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to
the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war,
vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any
emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.

A vanth’s scythe is its symbol of
oﬃce and gains a measure of its
personal power. This scythe becomes
a +1 scythe and is treated as if it were
adamantine while the vanth wields it. A
vanth whose scythe is taken or destroyed
can infuse a new one with an hour of work.
Spirit Touch As esobok, but 2d6.
Vanth’s Curse ʚʖ (curse, divine, enchantment,
misfortune) Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The
vanth bestows a curse on a creature by touching it with its scythe.
The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected and is temporarily
immune to Vanth’s Curse for 24 hours.
Success The target feels a momentary shudder of doom and is
stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute by the distracting sensation.
Failure The target becomes morose and glum as it accepts its own inevitable fate. For
1 hour, the target is stupeﬁed 2. Each time the target gains the dying condition, the
stupeﬁed condition value increases by 1, to a maximum value of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the eﬀect is permanent.
