DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

Draconic Resistance A dracolisk has resistance 10 to the type of damage it produces
with its breath weapon (see below).
Petrifying Glance Ǻȓ (arcane, aura, transmutation, visual) Trigger A creature within 30
feet that the dracolisk can see starts its turn; Eﬀect The target must attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save. If it fails, it becomes slowed 1 for 1 minute as its body stiﬀens.
Speed 20 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +21, Damage 2d12+8 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +21 (agile), Damage 2d10+8 slashing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The dracolisk breathes a gout of energy based
on its draconic heritage, as noted below. This breath weapon deals 6d10 damage
of the appropriate type, with a DC 28
basic save of a type indicated in
parenthesis below. The dracolisk
can’t use Breath Weapon again for
1d4 rounds.
Black (acid) 60-foot line of acid (Reﬂex)
Blue (electricity) 60-foot line of electricity (Reﬂex)
Green (poison) 30-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)
Red (ﬁre) 30-foot cone of ﬁre (Reﬂex)
White (cold) 30-foot cone of cold (Reﬂex)
Petrifying
Gaze
ʚʖ
(arcane,
concentrate,
incapacitation,
transmutation, visual) The dracolisk stares at a creature it can
see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt
a DC 28 Fortitude save. If it fails and has
not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed
1. If the creature already was slowed
by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a
failed save causes the creature to be
petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this
manner can be instantly restored
to ﬂesh by being coated (not just
splashed) with fresh dracolisk or
basilisk blood no more than 1 hour
old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood
to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner.
Savage Jaws ʚʖ The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its
jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S ) .
This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.
