SHOCKER LIZARD TRAPS
Kobolds are particularly fond of using
shocker lizards in their trap designs,
although such traps rarely keep the
shocker lizards’ safety and comfort in
mind, forcing these cruel but creative
kobolds to constantly replace the
permanently restrained lizards they’ve
set up to defend their lairs.
Shocker Lizard
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard
dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their
scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning
strong enough to harm signiﬁcantly larger foes. Though they’re meek and docile
when encountered alone, shocker lizards are signiﬁcantly more aggressive in
packs, when they can amplify each other’s electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difﬁcult to domesticate because they’re
dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept
alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and
weighs 25 pounds.

Greater Electrolocation A shocker lizard can sense minute electrical charges in living
creatures, which it can use as a precise sense at a range of 20 feet. This distance
increases to 100 feet against any creature that has used an electricity eﬀect within
the last minute.

Ranged Ȱɵ shock +10 (nonlethal, range increment 5 feet), Damage 2d6 electricity
Amplify Voltage Ǻȓ Trigger A shocker lizard within 20 feet
makes a shock Strike or uses Discharge; Eﬀect The
shocker lizard lends some of its electrical power to the
nearby lizard. This either causes the other lizard’s
shock Strike to lose the nonlethal trait or increases
the DC of its Discharge to 20.
Discharge ʚʖ (electricity) The shocker
lizard releases a blast of lightning
from its body. Creatures within
a 10-foot emanation take 3d6
electricity damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). The shocker lizard can’t
use
Discharge
for
1d4
rounds.
Shocking Burst ̂ˬ (electricity,
evocation, primal) The shocker
lizard hunkers down and begins
to spark with electricity, which it
releases in a 10-foot emanation that
deals 3d8 electricity damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). The shocker lizard can’t use
Shocking Burst again for 1 minute.
Up to four shocker lizards can combine
their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards
can delay the release of their electricity until
any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes
its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create
an emanation with the combined area from all participating
shocker lizards. For each additional shocker lizard that joins
the burst, the damage increases by 3d8 and the save DC increases by 1
(to a maximum of four lizards dealing 12d8 damage with a DC 21 save).
