JABBERWOCKS AND DRAGONS
Although jabberwocks may fear
vorpal weapons and are ﬁlled with
rage against all mortal creatures,
few things invite a jabberwock’s
wrath more than a Material Plane
dragon. Some scholars believe that
in the same way the First World is
believed to have been a template or
“ﬁrst draft” of the Material Plane,
dragons were created in the likeness
of jabberwocks. A jabberwock
that learns of a nearby dragon will
attempt to kill it to the exclusion of
all other priorities.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level
24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a
jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World,
mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of ﬁre, and
have eyes that burn with blue ﬂames that deal cold damage instead of ﬁre damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and
slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the
normal ﬂy Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock’s whifﬂing
aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.

Primal Innate Spells DC 43; Constant (10th) true seeing
Burble ʚʖ The jabberwock creates a blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense
in the various languages it knows (and invariably some languages it doesn’t know),
creating one of two eﬀects. The jabberwock can’t Burble again for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Confusion (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) 60 feet. Each creature in the
emanation must succeed at a DC 46 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Sonic Beam (evocation, primal, sonic) The jabberwock focuses its Burbling into a
60-foot line of sonic energy that deals 24d6 sonic damage to creatures in the area
(DC 46 basic Reﬂex save).
Jaws That Bite If the jabberwock makes a jaws attack and rolls a natural 19 on the d20
roll, the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if the 19 would be a failure.
Whiﬄing Ǻȓ (aura) Trigger The jabberwock Flies or makes a wing Strike; Eﬀect The
jabberwock’s wings whiﬄe, creating severe winds within a 30-foot emanation. These
winds move outward from the jabberwock, and they persist until the start of the
jabberwock’s next turn. During this time, ﬂight of any kind in the emanation requires a
successful DC 43 Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight, and creatures ﬂying toward
the jabberwock are moving through greater diﬃcult terrain. Creatures on the ground
in the emanation must succeed at a DC 43 Athletics check to approach the jabberwock.
