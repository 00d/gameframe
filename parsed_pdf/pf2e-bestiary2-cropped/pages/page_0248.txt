SOUL GLUTTONS
As if soul eaters weren’t frightening
enough, there exists on Abaddon
much larger variants of these
monsters, known as soul gluttons.
Appearing as roiling, inky black
clouds and possessing a half dozen
arms, soul gluttons are much deadlier
than their smaller kin and are also
much more dangerous to conjure,
as they have a disturbing knack for
wriggling out of a conjurer’s control.
Soul Eater
Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange
ﬁends from the inky swamps of Abaddon.

Caster Link (detection, divine, divination) A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with
its conjurer. While both are on the same plane, the soul eater knows the location of its
conjurer per its ﬁnd target ability. If the soul eater’s target dies before the soul eater
can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the
soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them.
Find Target (detection, divine, divination) When a soul eater is
conjured to the Material Plane to ﬁnd a speciﬁc
creature, it gains the beneﬁts of a 5th-level
locate spell that isn’t blocked by lead or
running water. The conjurer must
have seen the target and must
speak the target’s name while
conjuring the soul eater in
order to grant this ability.

Requirements The soul eater is adjacent to a dying
creature; Eﬀect The soul eater attempts to
devour the dying creature’s soul. The creature
must attempt a DC 25 Will save. A creature
that dies as a result of Drain Soul can’t be
restored to life except by a spell or ritual of 8th
level or higher. If the soul eater that used Drain
Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that
creature’s corpse and the creature has been dead no
longer than 1 minute, the creature’s soul returns to
its body and is restored to life, leaving the creature
unconscious and dying 1 but no longer doomed.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes doomed 1, or
increases its doomed value by 1 if it was already doomed.
Failure As success, but doomed 2.
Critical Failure As success, but doomed 3.
Mind-Numbing Touch (curse, divine, necromancy) When a soul eater hits a creature with
its claw Strike, the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become stupeﬁed
1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure). Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases
the stupeﬁed value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. This condition
value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night’s rest. As long as the
creature is stupeﬁed by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any doomed
value that creature might have.
