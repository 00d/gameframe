ZANEMBIS
While most cloud dragons prefer
solitude and avoid confrontations,
Zanembis is an excellent example of
how failed dragonslaying attempts
can create problems. Previously
content to dwell atop Angel Peak in
the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud
dragon has grown vengeful and
violent in the wake of unexpected and
unjustiﬁed attacks on his lair.
creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other
true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon’s
penchant for living in the moment is not a personality ﬂaw—they’re more than
capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won’t make foolish
choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have
little interest in worrying about the future and are as conﬁdent in their ability to
handle tomorrow’s problems as they are today’s.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural
result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended
periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather
a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a
cloud dragon, a diversiﬁed hoard is a perfect hoard.
