NABASU GROWTH
A nabasu stores their stolen deaths
until they ﬁnally become satiated.
For most, this occurs after consuming
death from at least 100 mortals, but
the exact timing is left to the GM. The
demon then travels to the Abyss and
transforms into a vrolikai.

Death-Stealing Gaze (aura, divine, necromancy, visual) 30 feet. When a non-demon ends its
turn in the aura, it must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If it fails, it becomes drained 1.
Starvation Vulnerability A nabasu denied food suﬀers painful backlash as their demonic
nature feeds on their own corrupted spirituality. If a nabasu’s Consume Death is disrupted
(such as by a ﬁghter using Disruptive Stance) or a creature resists the eﬀect with a
critical success, the nabasu takes 4d6 mental damage.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 50 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +20 (evil, magical), Damage 2d12+9 piercing plus

vampiric touch
Rituals DC 26; Abyssal pact
Consume Death Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, necromancy,
visual) The nabasu focuses their death-stealing
gaze upon a single target they can see within
30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a
Fortitude save against death-stealing gaze.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and
the nabasu suﬀers starvation vulnerability.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is aﬀected by death-
stealing gaze and becomes drained 1. If
the creature was already drained 1 by the
death-stealing gaze before attempting
the save, a failed save increases the
value of the drained condition by 1, to a
maximum of drained 4. The nabasu gains
10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained
creature is temporarily immune until the
start of the nabasu’s next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature
increases the amount of drain by 2.
Stolen Death A creature that dies while suﬀering
drain from a nabasu’s death-stealing gaze rises as
a ghoul (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 168) the next midnight.
HEZROU (TOAD DEMON)
Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps,
mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land
and in the water. A hezrou’s presence has an obvious effect
on nearby ﬂora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot
and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much
easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long
exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations
and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities
of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where
