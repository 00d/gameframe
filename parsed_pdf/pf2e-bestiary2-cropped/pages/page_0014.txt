Akata
An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes,
a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast,
as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but
it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.
When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into
a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal—the skymetal noqual. An akata can
hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though
it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a
few minutes’ time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void
of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts
with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring
ﬁght among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then
animates the corpse—now a void zombie (page 288)—which shambles about of
its own accord.
AKATA
CREATURE 1
RARE
N
MEDIUM
ABERRATION
Perception +6; darkvision, no hearing, scent (imprecise) 30 feet
Skills Acrobatics +7, Athletics +7, Stealth +7
Str +4, Dex +2, Con +4, Int –4, Wis +3, Cha +0
Hibernation After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete resin that
encases it in a noqual cocoon. The cocoon has Hardness 9, 40 HP, and a
Broken Threshold of 18. It has resistance 5 to damage from magical
sources. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata can’t be
harmed, and it doesn’t need to eat or drink. While inside the
cocoon, the akata gains lifesense 30 feet. The akata remains
in a state of hibernation until it is exposed to extreme
heat or senses a living creature, at which point it can
burst free of its cocoon in 1d4 minutes.
No Hearing An akata has no auditory senses. It is
immune to auditory eﬀects, automatically
critically fails Perception checks that
require it to hear, and takes a –2
status penalty to Perception checks
(but not initiative rolls) that involve
sound but also rely on other senses.
AC 16; Fort +9, Ref +5, Will +6
HP 15; Immunities disease; Weaknesses
salt water 5; Resistances ﬁre 5, poison 5
No Breath An akata doesn’t breathe and is immune
to eﬀects that require breathing (such as an
inhaled poison).
Salt Water Vulnerability Salt water acts as an extremely
strong acid to an akata. Full immersion in salt water deals
4d6 acid damage per round.
Speed 30 feet, climb 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +9 (agile), Damage 1d6+4 piercing plus void death
Void Death (disease) An akata implants its parasitic larval young into
any creature it bites, but only Medium or Small humanoids
make suitable hosts; all other creatures are immune to
this disease; Saving Throw DC 17 Fortitude; Stage 1
carrier with no ill eﬀect 1 (1 day); Stage 2 drained 1
(1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 drained 2
and fatigued (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage
6 dead and corpse rises as a void zombie (page 288)
in 2d4 hours
NOQUAL COCOONS
An akata’s noqual cocoon, despite
its crystalline appearance, is in fact
made of a rare skymetal with a glassy
green sheen. Noqual is as easy to
work as iron but much lighter, and
it is valued for its magic-resistant
qualities, but the noqual from an
akata’s cocoon is very low quality and
can’t be used as a crafting material.
