FLAME AND FATHOM MEET
Though ﬁre and water classically
oppose one another, in the right
mixture they can become a dangerous
combination. Water elementals heated
to a scalding temperature through
natural factors such as underwater
volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent
ﬁre damage with their Strikes, while
ﬁre elementals infused with moisture
might exude clouds of obscuring or
even blinding steam.
Elemental, Water
Water elementals that become infused with cold or mist have increased mobility
in regions outside of bodies of water.
ICICLE SNAKE
Translucent and capable of hanging suspended and near motionless, icicle snakes
sense the heat of living creatures as a threat and attempt to use their camouﬂage
and chilling bite against foes.

Mist Cloud (aura, conjuration, primal,
