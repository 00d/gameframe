MEPHIT INTERACTIONS
Diﬀerent types of mephits that can
be found on the same elemental
plane often develop friendly (or, in
some cases, ﬁerce) rivalries with
one another. While mephits from
elementally opposed planes (such
as ﬁre and water) may have strong
opinions about the superiority of
their own element, the fact that they
rarely see such mephits means that
when they do encounter them, they
often get along better than they do
with their close neighbors.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits are small, weak creatures that serve at the whims of other elemental entities.
The mephits presented here are less common than air mephits, earth mephits, and the
like, as they are a blend of two different elements rather than focusing on one alone.
DUST MEPHIT
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency
to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insigniﬁcant
and minor difﬁculty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making
themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They
tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.

ICE MEPHIT
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their ﬁre mephit kin, ice
mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most
mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company.
Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness,
and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
few moral qualms about acting selﬁshly
and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
should the chance arise.
