BLODEUWEDDS AND NYMPHS
Nymphs often think of blodeuwedds
as uncouth or too wild, while the
reverse holds true for blodeuwedds,
who consider nymphs to be spoiled
and pampered “princesses” who
take the beautiful parts of the world
in which they dwell for granted. It
speaks volumes to blodeuwedds’
strength of personality that they
don’t let these bitter emotions
control them. Very few of their kind
drift into actual evil—yet likewise,
very few of them display the
kindness that nymphs do.
Blodeuwedd
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the
boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or
around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural
world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of
great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them
for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians
of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from
forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part
of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow
cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to
the other, regardless of their actual goals.

Allergen Aura (aura, primal) A blodeuwedd exudes a 30-foot
aura of pollen and irritating allergens. A non-plant living
creature that begins its turn in the aura must succeed at
a DC 22 Fortitude save or become sickened 2. A creature
that succeeds at its save is then temporarily
immune to the allergen aura for 24 hours. A
blodeuwedd can suppress this aura or activate
it again as a free action.

to Make an Impression on and make very simple
Requests of animals.

Change Shape ʚʖ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) A

attack. In owl form, its statistics change as follows: Size Small; Speed ﬂy 60

A blodeuwedd can return to their normal form as a free action.
Living Footsteps Every Stride action taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants,
grasses, and wildﬂowers to sprout from the ground, though they can suppress this
eﬀect if they desire. In a region or terrain that wouldn’t normally support
plant life, these plants thrive for 1 minute before withering away.
Nature’s Infusion ʚʖ Frequency once per day; Eﬀect While surrounded
by any ﬁeld or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd can infuse themself with
borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. The blodeuwedd
gains 15 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour.
