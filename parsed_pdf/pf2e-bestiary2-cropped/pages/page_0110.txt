SAND MIMICS
Sand sentries have no true culture
or society of their own, but they
are endlessly fascinated with the
society and culture of humanoids
they encounter. They can shape their
appearance to mimic any similarly
sized humanoids, and although
they always remain obviously
composed of sand, they do their best
to mimic the day-to-day activities
they observe other humanoids
performing. Of course, structures
and objects sand sentries build from
sand never last, but this never seems
to stiﬂe their obsession.
SAND SENTRY
CREATURE 6
N
MEDIUM
EARTH
ELEMENTAL
Perception +14; darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet
Skills Acrobatics +14, Stealth +14 (+17 in sand)
Languages Terran
Str +5, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +0, Wis +2, Cha +1
AC 24; Fort +16, Ref +12, Will +14
HP 94; Immunities bleed, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Glass Armor When the sand sentry takes ﬁre or lightning damage, its outer layer of sand
fuses into sheets of hardened glass for 1 minute. This increases the sand sentry’s AC to
26 and grants it resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, force, piercing, and slashing
damage. A sand sentry can’t use earth glide while glass armor is active.
Speed 25 feet, burrow 50 feet; earth glide
Melee Ȱɵ  ﬁst +17, Damage 2d8+8 bludgeoning plus blinding sand
Earth Glide As living boulder.
Blinding Sand When the sand sentry critically hits with a ﬁst Strike, the target is blinded
for 1 round.
GRANITE GLYPTODONT
This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back
and a ﬂail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with
all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the ﬂesh of those it
calciﬁes, as if the mere proximity of ﬂesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.

EARTH
ELEMENTAL
Perception +17; darkvision, tremorsense (imprecise) 90 feet
Skills Athletics +18
Str +6, Dex +1, Con +6, Int +0, Wis +5, Cha +0
AC 28; Fort +18, Ref +13, Will +17
HP 145; Immunities bleed, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Speed 30 feet, burrow 20 feet; earth glide
Melee Ȱɵ  tail +20 (forceful, reach 10 feet, versatile piercing), Damage 2d12+9
bludgeoning plus calciﬁcation
Calciﬁcation (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) A blow from a granite
glyptodont’s tail hardens the ﬂesh of the creature struck. The target must
succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or become slowed 1 (or
slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves
against calciﬁcation increase the value of the
slowed condition. Once a creature’s actions are
reduced to 0 by calciﬁcation, that creature
becomes petriﬁed. If the creature isn’t
petriﬁed, the slowed conditions end once 1
minute passes without the creature failing a
save against calciﬁcation.
Every 24 hours after it was petriﬁed,
the creature can attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it
becomes ﬂesh again, but is slowed 1 for
the next 24 hours. On a critical success,
the creature recovers and isn’t slowed.
On a failure, the creature remains
petriﬁed, but can try again in 24 hours.
On a critical failure, the petriﬁcation
is permanent, and the creature can’t
attempt any more saves.
Earth Glide As living boulder.
