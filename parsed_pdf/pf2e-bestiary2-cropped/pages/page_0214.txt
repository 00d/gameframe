QLIPPOTH AND MORTALS
As qlippoth lost territory to their
demonic rivals, they realized that the
only way to stem the tide of demonic
forces was to starve them of the
sinful souls that the Abyss uses to
spawn new demons. While qlippoth
have no concept of how they
might go about preventing sin by
changing the way mortals act, they
do understand that exterminating
mortal life would solve the problem
as well.
SHOGGTI
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims,
bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no
doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-
like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its
forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

NYOGOTH
Little more than a coiled mass of intestines
encircling a massive gaping maw, this
qlippoth is an Abyssal scavenger, subsisting on
the ﬁlth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth
alike, although it relishes any opportunity to
consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role
in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid
beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure
its next meal.
