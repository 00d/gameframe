be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite
meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced
with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons ﬂee into
the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk
their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by
loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have
a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek
to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down
through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they’ve fed upon.
