UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS
Nuckelavees are equally delighted to
murder and feed upon both hapless
peasants and altruistic naturalists
engaged in the process of cleaning
up pollution. Indeed, those who
would seek to purify such sites
are often regarded as the greater
threat by a nuckelavee, as without a
befouled land to dwell in, the foul fey
would wither away.
Nuckelavee
When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee to
it from the First World. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold: a horselike
monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly from its
back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen
hybrid form, as though it survived its own ﬂaying.
When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction
across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the
cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those
who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn’t
discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
