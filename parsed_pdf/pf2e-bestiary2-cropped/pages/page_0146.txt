HODAG TALES
Those who’ve encountered hodags
tend to create larger-than-life
reports of the sighting. In the
dense Verduran Forest, lumberjacks
working for the Lumber Consortium
regale each other with competing
stories about Big Marna, a legendary
hodag who the loggers claim has
killed two dozen people. Inhabitants
of Echo Wood in the River Kingdoms
spin lore about Black Shiv, a hodag
spotted haunting the outskirts of
small settlements, and in recent
months, hunters and miners in the
southwestern reaches of Ravounel
speak of a frightening undead hodag
called Ghouliegut.
Hodag
Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers’ or miners’
tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote
areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous
beasts ﬁrsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.
Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators’ long
claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines
that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their
wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark.
The hodags’ rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to
blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red
eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage
by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily
moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.
In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a
foul‑smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between
their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and
weighs upward of 700 pounds.

Rip and Tear ʚʖ The hodag makes two claw Strikes and one
jaws Strike in any order.
Toss ʚʖ The hodag Strides, then
makes a Strike against
a target in reach. If it
moves at least 20 feet
and succeeds at its
Strike, the hodag
deals damage normally
and then attempts an
Athletics check against
the creature’s Fortitude DC to
toss the enemy into the air. On
a success, the tossed creature is thrown
10 feet in a straight line in the direction of the hodag’s
choice and then lands prone. If the creature is knocked
into a solid object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as
well before landing prone. The hodag can instead toss
a creature straight up in the air. The creature lands in
the same square where it started, takes
1d6 bludgeoning damage, and
lands  prone.
