DESTRACHAN LANGUAGE
The Destrachan language can be
learned by other creatures, but
without a destrachan’s unique vocal
organs, non-destrachans can convey
only basic notions and concepts with
it. In most cases, it’s better to speak
Undercommon to a destrachan than
attempt to use its own language.
Destrachan
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its
forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular
head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in
its vicinity. This cruel monster’s true weapon, however, is an ampliﬁed version of
the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates
with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles,
but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans
understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often
be reasoned with.
An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won’t hesitate to
make a meal of carrion it ﬁnds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures
take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking
and subduing them, then devouring them alive.

Painful Harmonics ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, incapacitation, occult)
The destrachan emits a sonic cry in either a 60-foot cone or a
30-foot burst. This discordant ululation resonates along
the nerves and bones of living creatures in the area,
manifesting as waves of incapacitating pain washing
over the victims. Each living creature in the area must

Shattering Harmonics ʚʖ (evocation, occult,

against a single item within 60 feet that is
made of crystal, metal, stone, or wood. The
target object takes 7d8 sonic damage. If the
item is attended, its bearer can attempt a
DC 26 basic Reﬂex save for the item. The
destrachan can’t use Shattering Harmonics
again for 1d4 rounds.
