WOOD GIANT CELEBRATIONS
Despite the seriousness with which
wood giants approach their duties,
or perhaps because of it, wood giant
gatherings are joyous occasions.
Wood giants most often gather to
sing, dance, seek life partners, and
celebrate their hard work.
Giant
Giants prosper in many environments, and although they are quite diverse, they
all tend to have equally larger-than-life personalities.
WOOD GIANT
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval
forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of
nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out.
Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild
places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part
of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense
humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most
giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense
forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely
with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness
regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory,
foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands.
While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey
creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most
fey as far too ﬂighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200
pounds.

Piercing Shot Ȱɵ The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it
glances oﬀ the ﬁrst target to strike another target behind the ﬁrst
one. The wood giant chooses two targets in a direct line, one of which
must be giving lesser cover to the other, then makes a single ranged
Strike with its longbow against both targets. This attack ignores
the lesser cover the ﬁrst target provides to the second. The wood
giant rolls damage only once, and applies it to each creature it hits.
Piercing Shot counts as two attacks for the wood giant’s multiple
attack penalty.
