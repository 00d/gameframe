ROGUE ELEPHANTS
Elephants of all species are, by
nature, social creatures who form
strong bonds with one another, but
when an elephant separates from
its herd—either due to tragedy or an
individual streak of viciousness—they
become known as rogue elephants.
These dangerous solitary creatures
are ill-tempered and quick to attack
anything that approaches them, and
often have the elite adjustments to
their statistics.
Elephant
Primeval variants of the elephant dwell in remote regions of the world.
ANANCUS
The anancus is an ancient species of elephant with unusually long tusks and a
trunk shorter than its more modern cousins.
