aapoph makes both attacks.
COIL SPY
Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve their
innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as members
of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of
their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more
efﬁciently inﬁltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme
step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in
methods of inﬁltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be
capable of inﬁltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they’re
expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people,
most Coil spies also ﬁnd personal pursuits to keep them occupied in
the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it’s rarely due to a lack
of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they
pursue their hedonistic desires.
