JELLYFISH SPECIES
A large number of types of
monstrous jellyﬁsh dwell in the
world’s oceans, each with their
own unusual specialty in hunting.
The immense vampire jellyﬁsh is a
blood-drinking monster that often
attacks sailors aboard ships. Among
the largest are the dreaded whaler
jellyﬁsh, colossal creatures that feed
on whales or even krakens.
Jellyfish
Many varieties of jellyﬁsh drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on ﬁsh and
other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyﬁsh pose a
threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyﬁsh are animals,
they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system.
FIRE JELLYFISH SWARM
While individually one of these ﬁst-sized jellyﬁsh is merely a nuisance, in great
numbers, ﬁre jellyﬁsh can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water,
they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their
bright coloration, but those who are stung by ﬁre jellyﬁsh learn the larger reason
for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.

GIANT JELLYFISH
Unlike its smaller cousins, the giant jellyﬁsh is an active

open water. It can even squeeze its enormous
bell-shaped body into the tight conﬁnes of
shipwrecks to drape its mane of tentacles
across the exposed ﬂesh of its prey.
