ABADDON
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane
of pure evil for only the most corrupt
souls. If Hell is a realm of torture
and systematic depravity, Abaddon
is its twisted cousin—a place where
one can ﬁnd only misery and
despair in ample quantities, with
neither the strictures of Hell nor
the chaotic freedom of the Abyss.
For evildoers who seek simply to
inﬂict their wickedness on others,
Abaddon is a rich hunting ground
where one can revel in turpitude,
though visitors be forewarned: the
competition is ﬁerce.
Daemon
Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.
PISCODAEMON (VENOM DAEMON)
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards,
delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on
a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and
even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons’ preferred
tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River
Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They
are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by
drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget
their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.

MELADAEMON (FAMINE DAEMON)
Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst,
and revel in spreading the same despair that brought
about their mortal demise. When they aren’t blighting
ﬁelds, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies,
they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures
can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that
result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian,
Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other
daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.
