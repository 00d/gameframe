FIRE ELEMENTAL TREASURE
Often, nothing remains after
defeating a ﬁre elemental but a pile
of ashes and the fading smell of
smoke. But sometimes, fragments
of their elemental power remain
behind. At the GM’s discretion, a ﬁre
elemental can leave behind ashes,
lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering
cinders that are valuable components
for the construction of ﬁre-themed
magic items.
Elemental, Fire
Fire elementals sometimes incorporate burning materials into their being, or
possibly superheated materials such as molten rock or searing smoke.
EMBER FOX
Ember foxes resemble their canid namesakes, save for the ﬂames that make their
fur and the tips of their long whiskers ﬂicker and glow.

FILTH FIRE
These creatures look like roiling clouds of black smoke churning above a
mound of burning refuse. Leering faces form and fade in the smoke above,
while the burning trash writhes in spasmodic lurches, obviously alive.
