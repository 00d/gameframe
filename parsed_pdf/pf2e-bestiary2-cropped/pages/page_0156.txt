KORRED DANCES
Despite their insular nature, korreds
love to dance. On certain auspicious
dates, korreds hold great festivals
of music and dance in ancient stone
circles deep within forest glades.
A few non-korred fey sometimes
receive invitations to these dances,
but any non-fey who interrupts the
dance is berated at best or attacked
at worst.
Korred
Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long,
animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural afﬁnity and admiration for
stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or
wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don’t take
kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who
stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their
minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to ﬂow freely, often wearing only a
belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears—though this belt and
pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.

Animated Hair (aura, primal, transmutation) 5 feet.
The korred’s long, animated hair reaches out
and interferes with creatures in the area. The
korred can select which targets are aﬀected by their
animated hair. An aﬀected creature that ends its turn in the
emanation must succeed at a DC 18 Reﬂex save or become clumsy 1
(clumsy 2 on a critical failure) as long as it remains in the aura.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ club +14, Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning
Ranged Ȱɵ rock +14 (brutal, range increment 20 feet), Damage 1d6+7
bludgeoning
Ranged Ȱɵ club +14 (thrown 10 feet), Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning
Primal Innate Spells DC 21; 6th stone tell; 4th shape stone (at will), shatter
(at will)
Hair Snare Ȱɵ (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) The korred causes a
long, tangled length of their hair to detach from their body and snake out
to coil around an adjacent creature. The creature must attempt a DC 21
Reﬂex save. The korred cannot use Hair Snare again for 1d4 rounds.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The hair wraps around the creature. The creature takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all of its Speeds until it Escapes (DC 21) or until
the korred uses Hair Snare again (at which point the previous snare drops to
the ground, no longer animated).
Critical Failure The creature is immobilized until it Escapes (DC 21) or the korred
uses Hair Snare again.
Otherworldly Laugh ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, incapacitation, primal, sonic) Frequency
three times per day; Eﬀect The korred unleashes an otherworldly laugh. Each non-fey
creature within a 30-foot burst must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save. On a failure, the
creature is slowed 1 for 1 round (or stunned 1 on a critical failure).
Stone Stride ʚʖ (conjuration, earth, primal, teleportation) The korred steps into a block
of stone large enough for them to ﬁt inside and instantly teleports to any other stone
within 30 feet that has the same minimum size. Once the korred enters the stone, they
instantly know the rough locations of other suﬃciently large stones within 30 feet.
They can exit from the original stone, if they prefer. They can’t carry extradimensional
spaces with them when they Stone Stride; if the korred attempts to do so, Stone
Stride fails.
