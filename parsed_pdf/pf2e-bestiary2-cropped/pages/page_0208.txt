IMENTESH
The loquacious proteans known as imenteshes serve as missionaries, spies, and
heralds of chaos to further the protean goal of reality’s dissolution. Imenteshes
are cunning, curiously diplomatic, and profoundly whimsical. They travel
beyond the Maelstrom for their work, frequently adopting extravagant
personal attire and decorations that often border upon the garish, all to curry
favor with less chaotic beings.
