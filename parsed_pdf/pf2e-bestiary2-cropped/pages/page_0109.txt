LOOTING EARTH ELEMENTALS
Earth elementals sometimes have
valuable gemstones or minerals
incorporated into their bodies,
and once they are slain, these
valuables can be scavenged as
treasure. Gemstones, precious
metals such as silver or gold ore,
or rarer materials such as mithral
or adamantine can be harvested
from these creatures, although the
more expensive finds tend to be
incorporated into only the most
powerful earth elementals.
Elemental, Earth
Certain earth elementals manifest as speciﬁc types of material, be they boulders,
sand, or crystals.
LIVING BOULDER
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones
and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship’s hull covered in barnacles.
Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders ﬁll much the same role
on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.

EARTHEN DESTRIER
This wave of dirt takes the crude likeness of the melded
forequarters of a charging warhorse and a rocky knight
wielding a rudimentary lance of gray stone.

destrier makes a lance arm Strike against the creature it’s trampling at a –5
penalty.
Trample ̂ˬ Medium or smaller, hoof, DC 20
SAND SENTRY
Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and
featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace.
The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area
of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles,
making them well suited for long-term service.
