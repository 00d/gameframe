LERRITAN CAVALCADES
Every few decades, lerritans gather in
large bands to travel from one volcanic
region to another, razing every sign
of civilization they ﬁnd along the
way. Lerritan cavalcades contain
up to a dozen lerritans and their
lackeys: crimson worms, powerful ﬁre
elementals, and ﬁre giants.
Lerritan
Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling
lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay
homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of ﬁre, and they bully other ﬁery
creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn
forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water.

Throw Rock Ȱɵ A lerritan can break stony scales oﬀ its body to
throw; these scales reform at the end of each round, so the
lerritan is never without a supply of rocks to hurl.
Volcanic Eruption ʚʖ (earth, evocation, ﬁre, primal) The volcano
on the lerritan’s back erupts and sends lava bombs raining
down in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 12d12 ﬁre damage.
Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 46 Reﬂex
saving throw. The lava globules quickly cool into heavy
stones, transforming the area into greater diﬃcult
terrain for non-lerritans. The lerritan can’t use
Volcanic Eruption for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage and is
encumbered for 1 round.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is immobilized

Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is encased
in a rocky crust with lava on
the inside. The creature is
restrained (Escape DC
46), can’t breathe, takes
3d12 persistent ﬁre
damage, and can’t
recover from this
persistent ﬁre damage
until freed.
