DOMINION SEEDLINGS
Moonflower seeds are tough and
fibrous, capable of surviving the
fire of reentry into a planet’s
atmosphere. They are often
dropped by agents of the Dominion
of the Black in orbit above
unsuspecting worlds.
Moonflower
These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged
blossoms. A gaping mouth sits at the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most
creatures smaller than the moonﬂower whole. Moonﬂowers can move slowly on
their powerful roots or use them to attack, but usually they dig them deeply into
the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey.
Though moonﬂowers can’t speak in the conventional sense, they communicate
telepathically with other moonﬂowers. Explorers who encounter a single
moonﬂower can thus be assured that any other moonﬂowers in the vicinity will
be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonﬂower’s telepathic
communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over
by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream
of the future shared by all moonﬂowers is unknown.
Moonﬂowers are alien life‑forms from a long-dead planet, but
their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been ensured through the
machinations of the Dominion of the Black, a sinister, alien organization from
the dark places between the stars.

Light Pulse ʚʖ (evocation, light, primal, visual) 50 feet. The moonﬂower

wrapped in a tight cocoon and extruded from
the moonﬂower’s body into an adjacent square.
The creature continues to be Swallowed Whole.
It can’t use Acrobatics to Escape a pod, but other
creatures can attempt to Rupture the pod. The
cocooned creature takes half damage from any
damage dealt to the cocoon. Once the cocoon is
Ruptured, it deﬂates and decays.
Pod Spawn Should a Small or larger creature die within a
pod prison, the pod transforms into an adult moonﬂower
with full Hit Points after 1d4 hours of growth. The
newly formed moonﬂower has its own consciousness,
but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles
the creature that died within. The dead creature’s
equipment remains inside the new moonﬂower and can
be retrieved if the moonﬂower is slain.
