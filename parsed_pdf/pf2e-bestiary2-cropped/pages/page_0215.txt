QLIPPOTH REALMS
Although it is widely accepted
that qlippoth have lost incalculable
territory in the Abyss to demonkind,
these ﬁends still control vast regions
in the deepest reaches of that plane.
Some sages suggest the troubling
possibility that perhaps qlippoth still
hold more territory of the Abyss than
demons do, but because demons are
more concerned with mortal life, we
simply interact with the layers they
control more often. For all we know,
these dour sages postulate, the
Abyss teems with endless swarms of
qlippoth that have yet to make their
move against mortal life.

CHERNOBUE
The chernobue infects all creatures it encounters
with itself, spreading pain and calamity wherever it
ﬂops and writhes. It sheds ruin and sups on anguish,
but a chernobue can sometimes be persuaded to pause
for a few moments of conversation if its partner in
discourse can keep its attention by providing
enough atrocious details. Resembling a
tumor-like growth of oily blackness, this
vile monstrosity has numerous muscular
tentacles, a single glaring baleful eye, and a drooling, toothy maw
in the middle of its body.
