LYCANTHROPY
Many scholars refer to the curse of
the werecreature as “lycanthropy,”
but technically this is correct only
when speaking of werewolves.
Nevertheless, the word has gained
traction in certain circles, and as a
result it’s not uncommon to hear
the whispers of locals who fear
lycanthropes even when a ravenous
weretiger is the real threat. Naturally,
the werecreatures themselves don’t
take this ignorance lightly, and tend
to see being equated with a werewolf
as a great insult. Unless, of course, the
werecreature is a werewolf!

WERETIGER
These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true
apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal.
Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them
ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of
environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated
cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders)
often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming
overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear loose-
ﬁtting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a ﬁght.
