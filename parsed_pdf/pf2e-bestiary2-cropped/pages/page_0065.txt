SIGNS OF MURDER
Babaus revel in their art and often
leave behind a grim token or marker
as a signature. They may leave a
distinctive mutilation upon the
bodies of their victims, rather than
harvesting keepsakes and trophies
for a personal collection. Babaus
want their legacy to grow among
those they hunt and kill.
Demon
The living embodiment of mortal souls obsessed with sin and empowered by the
Abyss, demons are armed and armored by their prior lives’ obsessions.
BABAU (BLOOD DEMON)
The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits,
yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus
form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal
murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.

Mercy Vulnerability Babaus revel in gore, and
when wounds are healed, they recoil in
pain. When a creature heals from damage
that the babau dealt on their last turn
with Grievous Strike, sneak attack, or a
critical hit, the demon takes 4d6 mental
damage. The babau can take this mental
damage only once per round.
Reactive Slime Ǻȓ Trigger A creature
within the babau’s reach successfully
hits the babau with a Strike; Eﬀect The
babau excretes a gout of acidic, bloodlike
slime against the attacker and its weapon. The
attacker must attempt a DC 24 Reﬂex save.
Critical Success The attacker is unaﬀected.
Success The attacker takes 1d6 acid damage.
Failure The attacker takes 2d6 acid damage.
Critical Failure As failure, except the weapon used to Strike
the babau becomes broken, unless the weapon is made of
a material that is immune to acid.

Grievous Strike ʚʖ The babau attacks with the intent of creating a particularly
horriﬁc and gory wound. The babau makes a melee Strike. This counts
as two attacks when calculating the daemon’s multiple attack penalty. If
this Strike hits, the babau deals an additional 2d6 damage of the same
damage type, and the creature struck is frightened 2.
Sneak Attack The babau’s Strikes deal an extra 2d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
