ANCIENT INTELLECTS
Each radiant warden’s animating
force consists of raw positive
energy fused to the soul of a
willing sacriﬁce—usually an
astronomer or scholar near the
end of their natural life. Focused
now on protecting a site from any
intrusion­—including by curious
archaeologists or adventurers—a
radiant warden might pause before
an attack if approached peacefully.
Unfortunately, these constructs are
prone to speaking in vague riddles
or complex mathematical diatribes
that can be as confusing as they are
intriguing; often, discussions break
down as frustration mounts on
either side (or both).
Radiant Warden
The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of
years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien
aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians
expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space
have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets,
planes, or dimensions.
Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their
bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on
their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.
