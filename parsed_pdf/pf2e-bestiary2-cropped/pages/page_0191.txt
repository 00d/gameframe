OTHER ONI
Diﬀerent oni exist for nearly every
humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask
their golden skin and four-ﬁngered
claws in human form, while ja oni
hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include
wind yai (who take their form from
cloud giants) and the immensely
powerful void yai (who form from
other yai and ascend to rule over
rune giants).
FIRE YAI
Fire yai take the form of ﬁre giants. Like ﬁre giants, ﬁre yai are shrewd and
militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage
in battle to conquer and control others, ﬁre yai also love the thrill of war, ﬁghting
for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a ﬁre yai with a true challenge in combat can
potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai’s
third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of ﬁre.

Smoke Form ʚʖ (concentrate, primal, transmutation)
The ﬁre yai transforms into a cloud of smoke and then
Flies up to its ﬂy speed. This movement does not trigger
reactions, and the ﬁre yai can move through spaces occupied
by other creatures. The ﬁre yai returns to its physical form
after this move, and must end the movement in a space in which
it can ﬁt. All creatures in spaces through which the ﬁre yai moves
with Smoke Form must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or
become sickened 3. The ﬁre yai cannot use Smoke Form
for 1d4 rounds.
