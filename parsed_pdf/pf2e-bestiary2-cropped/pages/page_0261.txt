TICK DISEASES
Giant ticks and tick swarms can
potentially inﬂict diseases other than
tick fever. Drawing from the list on
pages 118–119 of the Gamemastery
Guide, potential diseases that a
tick could spread include blinding
sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or
scarlet fever. The saving throw DC
should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant
ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).
Tick
These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other
infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid
locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature.
GIANT TICK
This grotesque tick is the size of a dog and scurries with surprising speed.

Speed 15 feet, climb 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ hypostome +8 (ﬁnesse), Damage 1d6+1 plus attach and tick fever
Attach When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed hypostome
attaches it to that creature. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the giant tick
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is ﬂat-footed
while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on
which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping
the attachment or removing the giant tick in other ways doesn’t cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The giant tick is attached to a creature; Eﬀect The giant
tick uses its hypostome to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to. This deals 1d4
damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A
creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick is drained 1 until it receives healing
(of any kind or amount).
Tick Fever (disease); Saving Throw DC 17 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 enfeebled (1
day); Stage 2 enfeebled 2 (1 day).
TICK SWARM
This swarm of thousands of ﬁst-sized ticks forms a moving carpet
of bloated insects—a nauseating and intimidating sight.

Cling Ǻȓ Trigger A creature leaves the swarm’s
space; Eﬀect The swarm takes 1d6 damage
as ticks cling to the creature and continue
biting, dealing 3d6 persistent piercing
damage. Immersion in water reduces the
DC of the ﬂat check to end this persistent
damage to 5, and any area damage dealt to
the creature destroys these clinging ticks.
Speed 25 feet, climb 25 feet
Swarming Bites Ȱɵ Each enemy in the swarm’s space takes 3d6 piercing
damage (DC 28 basic Reﬂex save) plus Cling and exposure to tick fever.
