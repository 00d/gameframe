THUNDER AND FIRE
Thunderbirds have a complex
relationship with phoenixes, whom
they regard as too kindly and patient
with human civilizations, even as
they admire phoenixes’ beauty
and mastery over elements that
thunderbirds cannot control. Often,
encounters with phoenixes escalate
into violent arguments, but it’s rare
for one of these meetings to end
in a thunderbird’s death, and even
rarer for a phoenix to be signiﬁcantly
threatened by the upstart challenger.
Thunderbird
Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed.
Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before ﬂooding begins.
When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many
settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.
Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop
nests, where the young are struck by their ﬁrst bolts of lightning and learn the
mysteries of the storm.

Storm Aura (air, aura, evocation, primal, water) 100 feet. The thunderbird is surrounded
by a cyclone of wind and driving rain. This area is greater diﬃcult terrain for ﬂying
creatures, who must successfully Maneuver in Flight (DC 27) or be blown 30 feet
away from the thunderbird. Creatures on the ground must succeed at a DC 27 Reﬂex
save to perform any move action and are knocked prone on a critical failure. The
driving rain in the storm aura imposes a –2 circumstance penalty on Perception
checks and extinguishes smaller ﬂames. A thunderbird can deactivate or
activate the storm aura as a free action with the concentrate trait.

damage and 6d6 sonic damage (DC 30 basic Reﬂex save). The
