PLANETAR JUSTICE
Planetars know pathways to travel
between many planes of existence,
and they use these frequently to
deliver messages, warnings, and
ultimatums to those whose actions
have attracted angelic concern. If a
situation can be resolved with swift
on-the-spot justice, a planetar takes
that route in hopes of staving oﬀ an
escalation of violence.

SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.
