PRIMAL DRAGON HOARDS
Primal dragons may hail from other
planes of existence than chromatic or
metallic dragons, but they share one
thing in common with those types—
an obsession with treasure. Speciﬁc
details on the types of treasures each
category of primal dragon favors are
detailed in their respective entries
on the following pages; beyond
those broad guidelines, the treasures
in a dragon’s hoard should match
the themes of that type of dragon.
A brine dragon’s treasures should
have nautical themes to them, for
example, while an umbral dragon
would have collected treasures
of grim and shadowy nature; a
crystal dragon focuses on gemstone
valuables, and a cloud dragon seeks
items that grant ﬂight or produce an
exotic scent. Of them all, the magma
dragon’s treasure hoards are most
akin to that of the classic dragon—
provided the items collected can
survive at the blazing temperatures
that tend to be present in these
dragons’ volcanic dens!
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The dragon breathes a thundercloud
that deals 11d6 electricity damage in a 40-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save). They
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Cloud Walk The cloud dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ The dragon makes two claw Strikes and one horn Strike in any order.
Draconic Momentum The dragon recharges their Breath Weapon whenever they score
a critical hit with a Strike.
