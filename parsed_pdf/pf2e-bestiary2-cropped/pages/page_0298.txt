WORMS REDEEMED
In rare situations, once a spellcaster
rises as a worm that walks it might
recant its evil ways, given the right
inﬂuence and enough time. Many
of these worms that walk seek self-
destruction, not out of abhorrence at
their new form but at the realization
of the evils they wrought while alive.
Others, though, take advantage of
their second chance and use their
new life to help undo the ruin and
horror they might have aﬄicted upon
the world in their prior existence.
eﬀect performed on the area reduces the DC of this ﬂat check by 2, to a minimum of
DC 5. If any of these ﬂat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm
that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping
or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to ﬁnish oﬀ the worm
that walks.
Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with
reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as
the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should
deal three-quarters of that damage.
Squirming Embrace Ȱɵ The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a
space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an
additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a
basic Reﬂex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2.
Swarm Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm
of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While
discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions
and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small
enough for its individual worms to ﬁt without having
to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back
into its normal form.
WORM THAT WALKS
This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One
Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and
strives to further its evil plots in its new life.
