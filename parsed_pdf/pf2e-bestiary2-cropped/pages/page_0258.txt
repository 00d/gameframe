TENDRICULOS LACQUER
Objects coated with tendriculos
lacquer gain resistance 5 to acid.
Making and applying tendriculos
lacquer requires a 5th-level formula,
the Alchemical Crafting skill feat,
and the ﬂuid from the stomach of a
tendriculos. A successful DC 20 Craft
check and 4 days of work are enough
to protect 1 Bulk of items with no
other cost in materials, but the ﬂuid is
used up even on a failed check.
Tendriculos
These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where
the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries.
Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled
forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey
as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices ﬁnish the meal, while
swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature.
When collected, neutralized, and reﬁned, the digestive ﬂuids of a tendriculos
form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos’s acid resistance.
A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the
Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different
tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have
little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined
fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even
closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great
patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive
when handed over.
When it has ﬁnished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into
a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach.
Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible
portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived
digestion and indicate that a tendriculos’s hunting grounds lie nearby.
Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near
populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous
appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast
forth millions of spores. Spores that
happen to alight on carrion grow into
new tendriculoses.
