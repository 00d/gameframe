VERDUROUS CONGREGATION
When verdurous oozes gather in
suﬃcient number, they can merge
together into conjoined forms.
These enlarged blobs develop red
and white connecting vessels that
pulse hideously as thick, green ﬂuid
moves within them. While conjoined,
the oozes move as one creature.
Their usual enliven foliage and
sleep gas auras double in size, and
they become even more aggressive,
feeding voraciously on any metal or
ﬂesh they can ﬁnd.
Constrict Ȱɵ 2d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 24
Sleep Gas ʚʖ (incapacitation, mental, poison, sleep) The verdurous ooze adjusts its aura
of supernatural vapors to aﬀect living creatures within a 20-foot emanation, forcing
them to attempt a DC 24 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and becomes temporarily immune to Sleep
Gas for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes
up automatically.
Critical Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 hour, it
wakes up automatically.
Verdurous Ooze Acid A verdurous ooze’s acid damages only metal and ﬂesh—not bone,
stone, or other materials.
CARNIVOROUS BLOB
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the
stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto
unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant
for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When
a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it
lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming
every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until
it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at
which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping
food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way
to defeat it. The blob’s ability to split into smaller
oozes that might stay hidden after a ﬁght means it can
be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.

Carnivorous Blob Acid A carnivorous blob’s acid damages
only ﬂesh—not bone, stone, wood, or other materials—
but is nonetheless devastating. Whenever a creature
takes damage from this acid, it must succeed at a
DC 33 Fortitude save or become drained 1 (drained 2
on a critical failure). On each subsequent failure, the
drained condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a
critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.
