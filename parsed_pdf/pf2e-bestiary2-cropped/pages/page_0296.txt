TERRITORIAL BEASTS
Wolverines are territorial animals
and ﬁercely defend their kills,
even from larger predators or
when they’re outnumbered. They
claim wide swaths of forests or
frozen tundra as their territory,
marking it with a pungent odor that
serves as a warning to those who
recognize the smell. Wolverines
have voracious appetites and tend to
aggressively devour their food with
reckless abandon.
Wolverine
Few creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.
WOLVERINE
Wolverines resemble small bears, to which they are related. Stocky and muscular
with long claws, wolverines are about 3 feet in length and weigh approximately 40
pounds. They have a thick fur coat that protects them from the cold temperatures
of the forests and frozen tundras where they reside.

rage that lasts either for 1 minute, until there are no enemies it can perceive, or until
it falls unconscious, whichever comes ﬁrst. While raging, the wolverine has AC 17,
its jaws Strike deals 1d8+7 damage, and its claw Strike deals 1d6+7 damage. While
raging, the wolverine can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait, except for Seek.
After it’s stopped raging, a wolverine can’t use Wolverine Rage again for 1 minute.
GIANT WOLVERINE
Giant wolverines grow to the approximate size of
horses and claim even more expansive territories
than their more diminutive wolverine cousins.
While a smaller wolverine will defend its prey
from armed humanoids, a giant wolverine is
unafraid to stalk and kill such creatures.
