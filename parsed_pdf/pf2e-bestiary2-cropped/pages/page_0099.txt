DRAGONFLY SPECIES
While dragonﬂies come in many
colors, the diﬀerences between
species sometimes extend beyond
aesthetic variation. Giant blue
dragonﬂies are larger toxic versions
of the insects with a numbing bite
that boggards use to craft poisons.
Cave dragonﬂies are slower but
stronger variants that dwell in large
cavern systems. The legendary
storm dragonﬂies are truly immense
creatures that can use their powerful
wings to stun foes.
Dragonfly
Dragonﬂies hunt with a combination of agile power and deadly speed. In their
early life stages these insects are entirely aquatic predators, but they take to the air
once they’ve molted. Most live around bodies of water suitable for spawning, but
giant dragonﬂies have been known to ﬂy many miles when on the hunt. Though
their gossamer wings and colorful bodies are beautiful at ﬁrst glance, an unwary
adventurer lured in by the display runs a very real risk of becoming lunch.
GIANT DRAGONFLY NYMPH
The aquatic, wingless offspring of dragonﬂies are called dragonﬂy nymphs. Giant
dragonﬂy nymphs can be several feet in length and mostly hunt in shallow waters,
eating carrion and ambushing living creatures with their fully grown counterparts.
They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct to eat as
much as possible to sustain their growth.
