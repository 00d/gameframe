FIRST WORLD PETITIONERS
A soul sent to the First World does
not become a petitioner. Rather, they
immediately reincarnate into a fey
creature whose temperament and
role match their mortal personalities.
This process tends to leave souls
who incarnate into the First World
with slightly more fragments of
memories than most petitioners, yet
still not enough that they remember
who they once were.
