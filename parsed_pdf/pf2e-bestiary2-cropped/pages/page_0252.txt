OTHER SPORTLEBORES
While the creature presented here
is the most common of its type,
the sportlebore is in fact an entire
family of insects that specialize in
mimicking everyday objects. Other
varieties of sportlebore include the
spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore;
the corpse-eating sportlegore; and
the sportleglug, which is so small it
can burrow into leather wineskins
and drink their contents without
the bag spilling a drop. Like the
sportlebore, most of these vermin
aren’t too dangerous as individuals
but can turn into a real problem if
their numbers are left unchecked.
Sportlebore
The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin
that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or
jerky, a sportlebore can ﬂawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by ﬂexing, contorting,
and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding
under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into
a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking
any creatures it thinks it can consume.
SPORTLEBORE
On its own, a single sportlebore functions as a hazard rather than a creature.
