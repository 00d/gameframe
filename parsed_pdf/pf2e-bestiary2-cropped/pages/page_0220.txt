COASTAL HUNTERS
Quoppopaks prefer to hunt at dawn
and dusk, prowling seashores and
estuaries for fresh meat. While they
could easily live oﬀ of the minerals
and tiny organisms they ﬁlter from
the water sucked through their
ventral tubes, they delight in killing
living creatures. Despite their cruel
natures, quoppopaks don’t mind
hunting alongside others of their
kind if it means they’ll be able to
create even more carnage.
Quoppopak
Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses,
and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of
an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in
a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey’s mouth and is capable of intaking
ﬂuids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land,
they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the
ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through
their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through
their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can’t expel ﬂuids, it
still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but
they are located inside the creatures’ abdomens, allowing them to draw their
air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can
hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to
humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters’ water reserves
quickly deplete.

Flooding Thrust ʚʖ Requirements The quoppopak’s ventral tube
is in water; Eﬀect The quoppopak uses Tentacle Stab against
a creature within reach; if either of these Strikes hits, the
creature must attempt a DC 30 Reﬂex save. On a failed
save, the quoppopak shoots water through its tentacles
into the creature, dealing 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage
and making the creature sickened 1 as its internal
organs ﬁll with water (double damage and
sickened 2 on a critical failure).
Tentacle Stab Ȱɵ Frequency once per
round; Eﬀect The quoppopak makes
two tentacle Strikes against the same
creature. These Strikes deal piercing
damage instead of bludgeoning,
and the quoppopak can’t Grab
with them. Its multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until
after both attacks.
Water Glide
The
quoppopak
can stand and move on the
surface of water or other liquids
without falling through. It can
go underwater if it wishes, but it
must Swim to do so.
