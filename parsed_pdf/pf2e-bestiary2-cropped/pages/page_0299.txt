DREAD WRAITH ORIGINS
The most unusual dread wraiths
are those that coalesce from an
amalgamation of evil spirits, often
in regions where such spirits are
shredded from their consciousnesses
and churned in foci of negative
energy, such as the Negative Energy
Plane or on the Isle of Terror.
Wraith, Dread
These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals
are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths
haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel
greater distances to sow terror or amass inﬂuence, often sticking to dark glades or
sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to
be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead
to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer
might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly
malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw
several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.

Draining Presence (aura, negative) 10 feet. A creature entering the aura must succeed at
a DC 26 Fortitude save or become drained 1. It recovers after it has been out of the
aura for 1 minute. This drained condition value is cumulative with the drained value
caused by drain life, but not with multiple draining presence auras. A creature
that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to draining presence for 24 hours.
Sunlight Powerlessness A dread wraith caught in sunlight is stunned 2 and
clumsy 2.

Melee Ȱɵ spectral hand +21 (ﬁnesse, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d10+7
negative plus drain life
Absorb Wraith ʚʖ The dread wraith extends its hand toward
another wraith creature within 100 feet. The target wraith
dissolves and streaks toward the dread wraith in a straight
line, dealing 6d10 negative damage to each creature along the
line (DC 28 basic Fortitude save). The dread wraith absorbs the
essence of the target wraith, becoming quickened and gaining a
+10-foot status bonus to its ﬂy Speed for a number of rounds
equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its
extra action only to Fly or Strike. An unwilling target can
attempt a DC 28 Will save to resist being absorbed.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the dread wraith
damages a living creature with its spectral hand
Strike, the wraith gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the target must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude
save or become drained 1. Further damage dealt
by the wraith increases the drained condition value
by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Wraith Spawn (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid
slain by a wraith’s spectral hand Strike rises as a wraith
spawn after 1d4 rounds. This wraith spawn is under the
command of the dread wraith that killed it. It doesn’t have drain
life or wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies,
the wraith spawn becomes a full-ﬂedged, autonomous wraith; it
regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn.
