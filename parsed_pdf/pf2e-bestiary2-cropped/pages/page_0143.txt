AQUATIC CAVALRY
Protecting the harbor of Absalom
and the shores of Starstone Isle,
the elite Wave Riders use combat-
trained hippocampi as mounts. The
Wave Riders harass enemy ships,
defend against aquatic foes, and
intercept smugglers.
Hippocampus
The strange beasts known as hippocampi resemble terrestrial horses from head
to midbody, but on their legs, they have splayed ﬁns instead of hooves, and in
place of horses’ hindquarters, they have powerful tails resembling those of ﬁsh.
Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and
brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi
tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that
provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to
provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike,
as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be
that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though
hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most
handlers outﬁt them with the lightest options available. More often they are
trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi
do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while
ﬂopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them
differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species,
such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best
presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.
HIPPOCAMPUS
Hippocampi serve as steeds for aquatic humanoids or roam wild in the sea.
