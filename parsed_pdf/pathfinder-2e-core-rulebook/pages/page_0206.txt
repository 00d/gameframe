You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your
school. Arcane schools are described in detail on page 207.
If you don’t choose a school, you’re a universalist, a
wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of
magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all
eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks
the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.
Universalist wizards are described on page 209.
Arcane Bond
You place some of your magical power in a bonded item.
Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate
a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically
an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring,
or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other
item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.
DRAIN BONDED ITEM [free-action]
ARCANE
WIZARD
Frequency once per day
Requirements You haven’t acted yet on your turn.
You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your
turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today
and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still
Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.
Arcane Thesis
During your studies to become a full‑fledged wizard, you
produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a
variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on

the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics
presented in this book are below; your specific thesis
probably has a much longer and more technical title like
“On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis
of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.”
Improved Familiar Attunement
You’ve long held that fine-tuning the magic that bonds
wizard and familiar can improve the mystic connection,
compared to the safe yet generic bond most wizards
currently use. You’ve formed such a pact with your familiar,
gaining more advantages from it than most wizards. You
gain the Familiar wizard feat as a bonus feat. Your familiar
gains an extra ability, and it gains an additional extra
ability when you reach 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.
Your connection with your familiar alters your arcane
bond class feature so that you store your magical energy
in your familiar, rather than an item you own; you also
gain the Drain Familiar free action instead of Drain
Bonded Item. Drain Familiar can be used any time an
ability would allow you to use Drain Bonded Item and
functions identically, except that you draw magic from
your familiar instead of an item.
Metamagical Experimentation
You’ve realized that the practice known as metamagic is a
holdover from a time long ago, when wizards had to work
out their own spells and variations rather than rely on spells
recorded by others and passed down over the years. This
allows you efficient access to various metamagic effects.
