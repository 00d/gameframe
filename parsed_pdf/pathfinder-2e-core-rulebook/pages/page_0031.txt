Sample Character
This step-by-step example illustrates the process of
creating a Pathfinder character.
Steps 1 and 2
Adam is making his first Pathfinder character. After
talking about it with the rest of the group, he’s decided to
make a dwarven druid. After jotting down a few ideas, he
begins by writing down a 10 for each ability score.
Step 3
Adam looks up the dwarf entry in Chapter 2. He records
the ability boosts to his Constitution and Wisdom scores
(bringing both up to 12). He also applies the ability flaw
to his Charisma, dropping it to 8. For his free ability
boost, he chooses Dexterity to boost his defenses, raising
it to 12 as well. He also records the 10 Hit Points the
ancestry gives him. Next, he returns to his character
sheet to record the size, Speed, language, and darkvision
ability he gets from being a dwarf. Finally, he decides on
a heritage, writing “rock dwarf” next to dwarf, and he
picks an ancestry feat, deciding on Rock Runner, to show
his character’s strong connection to stone.
Step 4
Looking through the backgrounds, Adam likes the idea
of a solitary dwarven druid, and the nomad background
makes for a good choice. For the first ability boost
granted by the background, Adam chooses Wisdom, and
for the free ability boost, he choses Constitution, taking
both up to 14. On the second page, he writes “Assurance
(Survival)” in the Skill Feats area, on the Background line.
Finally, returning to the first page, he writes “cave” next
to the first Lore skill entry and checks the box under the
“T” for that skill and Survival.
Step 5
Adam writes “druid” on the class line of his character sheet
and fills in the number 1 in the level box. The druid class
grants an ability boost to its key ability score, which is
Wisdom, so Adam’s character has his Wisdom raised to 16.
Step 6
Adam applies four more ability boosts to his ability
scores to determine his starting scores. After giving it
some thought, he applies them to Wisdom (raising it
to 18), since that’s the most important ability score for
his class, and to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
(raising them to 12, 14, and 16, respectively) to make him
better in combat. He then looks at Table 1–1 to determine
the ability modifiers for each score and writes all of his
ability scores and modifiers down on his character sheet.
Step 7
As Adam applies his class, he has a number of things to
figure out. First, he starts by recording all of his initial
proficiencies, marking the appropriate boxes in the
Armor Class, Saving Throws, Weapon Proficiencies, Spell
Attack Roll, and Spell DCs areas of his sheet. Turning to
skills, he marks Nature as trained and notes that once he
picks his druid order, he’ll become trained in another skill
determined by that order. He then gets to choose three
more skills (if he had a higher Intelligence, he would have
gotten more). He decides on Athletics, Diplomacy, and
Medicine, marking all of them as trained. Next, he adds
the 8 Hit Points from the druid class and his Constitution
modifier of +3 to the 10 Hit Points from his dwarf
ancestry for an impressive 21 total Hit Points.
Moving on to class features, Adam marks down wild
empathy in the class feats and abilities area, as well as the
Shield Block feat in the bonus feats area. He makes note of
the anathema for being a druid and records Druidic in his
language section. Next, he looks through the druid orders
and decides upon the wild order, which gives him his final
trained skill (Intimidation), the ability to cast wild morph,
as well as the Wild Shape feat, which lets him cast a spell
to turn into an animal. He writes these spells in the focus
spell area of his character sheet and also notes that he has
1 Focus Point to use to cast these spells.
Finally, a druid can cast a limited number of primal
spells. Although he can change them every morning, Adam
is curious, and he turns to Chapter 7: Spells to decide
what spells he might cast. He jots down five cantrips and
two 1st-level spells and marks them as prepared.
Step 8
Next up, Adam turns to Chapter 6: Equipment. He’s
trained in medium armor, but since wearing metal armor is
anathema to druids, he chooses hide armor. For weapons,
he decides on a spear, but he buys two just in case he wants
to throw the first one. He writes all of these on the front of
his character sheet. Adam lists the spear under both melee
Strikes and ranged Strikes, and he also writes the claws he
gains from wild morph under his melee Strikes, because
he’s sure that he’ll be casting that spell a lot. He records the
rest of his gear in the Inventory section on the second page,
along with coin left over after buying his starting gear.
Step 9
Adam records all of the ability modifiers for Perception,
saving throws, Strikes, and skills. He then puts a “+3” in
the box marked Prof to indicate his proficiency bonus
for each statistic he’s trained in (1 for his level, plus 2 for
being trained) and "+5" in any that he is an expert. Then,
he adds up his modifiers for each statistic.
Step 10
Finally, Adam fills out the final details of his character,
noting his neutral alignment and calculating his AC and
Bulk limits. Last but not least, he fills in some last-minute
information about his character and decides on a name.
Gar the dwarf druid is ready for his first adventure!
