Barding
You can purchase special armor for animals, called
barding (shown on Table 6–18). All animals have a trained
proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-trained
animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the
same rules as armor except for the following. The Price
and Bulk of barding depend on the animal’s size. Unlike
for a suit of armor, barding’s Strength entry is listed as a
modifier, not a score. Barding can’t be etched with magic
runes, though special magical barding might be available.
Items and Sizes
The Bulk rules in this chapter are for Small and Medium
creatures, as the items are made for creatures of those
sizes. Large creatures can carry more, and smaller
creatures can carry less, as noted on Table 6–19.
These rules for Bulk limits come up most often when a
group tries to load up a mount or animal companion. The
rules for items of different sizes tend to come into play
when the characters defeat a big creature that has gear,
since in most cases, the only creatures of other sizes are
creatures under the GM’s control. In most cases, Small or
Medium creatures can wield a Large weapon, though it’s
unwieldy, giving them the clumsy 1 condition, and the
larger size is canceled by the difficulty of swinging the
weapon, so it grants no special benefit. Large armor is
simply too large for Small and Medium creatures.
Bulk Conversions for Different Sizes
As shown in Table 6–19, Large or larger creatures are
less encumbered by bulky items than Small or Medium
creatures, while Tiny creatures become overburdened
more quickly. A Large creature treats 10 items of 1 Bulk
as 1 Bulk, a Huge creature treats 10 items of 2 Bulk
as 1 Bulk, and so on. A Tiny creature treats 10 items
of negligible Bulk as 1 Bulk. Negligible items work in
a similar way—a Huge creature treats items of 1 Bulk

Items of Different Sizes
Creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium need items
appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk
and possibly a different Price. Table 6–20 provides the
Price and Bulk conversion for such items.

*	An item that would have its Bulk reduced below 1 has
light Bulk.
For example, a morningstar sized for a Medium
creature has a Price of 1 gp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a
Huge creature has a Price of 4 gp and 4 Bulk. One made
for a Tiny creature still costs 1 gp (due to its intricacy)
and has 1/2 Bulk, which rounds down to light Bulk.
Because the way that a creature treats Bulk and the
Bulk of gear sized for it scale the same way, Tiny or
Large (or larger) creatures can usually wear and carry
about the same amount of appropriately sized gear as a
Medium creature.
Higher-level magic items that cost significantly more
than 8 times the cost of a mundane item can use their
listed Price regardless of size. Precious materials, however,
have a Price based on the Bulk of the item, so multiply
the Bulk value as described on Table 6–20, then use the
formula in the precious material’s entry to determine the
item’s Price. See page 578 for more information.
