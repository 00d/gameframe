piercing (damage type) A type of physical damage. 452
plane 418–419
plant (trait) Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal
plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter
in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

Player Character (character or PC) A character created and controlled by a player
other than the GM. 13

Point Out [one-action] (specialty basic action) Indicate an undetected creature’s location. 472
poison (damage type) 452
poison (trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An
item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction. 457–458, 550—554
polymorph (trait) These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t
be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under
the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts
to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has
no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect
are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to
take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic
creature of a general type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can
be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless
otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking,
and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there’s doubt about
whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you;
the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any items.
positive (damage type) 452
positive (trait) Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal
positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.
possession (trait) Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit
into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect.
While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake
up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter
the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that
amount of damage as mental damage.
A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect
its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and
abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities
that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and
purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or
purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save,
Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills,
spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant
(the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s
invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit
from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body.
The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act.
If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its
true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal
and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the
possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession
or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the
possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.
potion (trait) A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it. 562–564
pp (platinum piece) 271
precious (trait) Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait.

precision (damage type) A type of damage that increases the attack’s listed damage,
using the same damage type, rather than adding a separate amount. 452
prediction (trait) Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near
future. Most predictions are divinations.
preparations See also daily preparations. 480, 500
prerequisite Many feats and other abilities can be taken only if you meet their
prerequisites. Prerequisites are often feats or proficiency ranks. 18
press (trait) Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action
with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple
attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure.
The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press
action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example,
you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)
Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when
it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.
Price The amount of currency it usually costs to purchase an item. 271, 535

world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical. 299
