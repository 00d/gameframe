Natural Disasters
Climate and environmental features can be a hindrance
or long-term threat, but natural disasters represent acute
danger, especially to those directly exposed to their fury.
The damage in the following sections uses the categories in
Table 10–11: Environmental Damage on page 512.
Avalanches
Though the term avalanche specifically refers to a
cascading flow of ice and snow down a mountain’s slope,
the same rules work for landslides, mudslides, and other
similar disasters. Avalanches of wet snow usually travel
up to 200 feet per round, though powdery snow can
travel up to 10 times faster. Rockslides and mudslides
are slower, sometimes even slow enough that a character
might be able to outrun them.
An
avalanche
deals
major
or
even
massive
bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path.
These victims are also buried under a significant mass.
Creatures caught in an avalanche’s path can attempt
a Reflex save; if they succeed, they take only half the
bludgeoning damage, and if they critically succeed, they
also avoid being buried.
Burial
Buried creatures take minor bludgeoning damage each
minute, and they potentially take minor cold damage
if buried under an avalanche of snow. At the GM’s
discretion, creatures without a sufficient air pocket could
also risk suffocation (page 478). A buried creature is
restrained and usually can’t free itself.
Allies or bystanders can attempt to dig out a buried
creature. Each creature digging clears roughly a 5-foot-
by-5-foot square every 4 minutes with a successful
Athletics check (or every 2 minutes on a critical success).
Using shovels or other proper tools halves the time.
Blizzards
Blizzards combine cold weather, heavy snow, and strong
winds. They don’t pose a single direct threat as other
disasters do; instead, the combination of these factors all
at once poses a substantial impediment to characters.
Collapses
Collapses and cave-ins occur when caverns or buildings
fall, dumping tons of rock or other material on those
caught below or inside them. Creatures under the
collapse take major or massive bludgeoning damage and
become buried, just as with an avalanche. Fortunately,
collapses don’t spread unless they weaken the overall
integrity of the area and lead to further collapses.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes often cause other natural disasters in the
form of avalanches, collapses, floods, and tsunamis, but
they also present unique threats such as fissures, soil
liquefaction, and tremors.
Fissures
Fissures and other ground ruptures can destabilize
structures, but more directly they lead to creatures taking
bludgeoning damage from falling into a fissure.
Soil Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when granular particles shake to
the point where they temporarily lose their solid form
and act as liquids. When this happens to soil, it can
cause creatures and even whole buildings to sink into
the ground. You can use the earthquake spell for more
specific rules, though that spell represents only one
particular kind of localized quake.
Tremors
Tremors knock creatures prone, causing them to fall or
careen into other objects, which can deal bludgeoning
damage appropriate to the severity of the quake.
Floods
Though more gradual floods can damage structures and
drown creatures, flash floods are similar to avalanches,
except with a liquid mass instead of a solid one. Instead
of burying creatures, a flash flood carries creatures and
even massive objects away, buffeting the creatures and
potentially drowning them. The drowning rules appear
on page 478.
