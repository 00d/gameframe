ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration 8 hours
You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to
detect via magic. Nondetection attempts to counteract all
detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the
target or the target’s gear throughout the duration, counting
cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully
counteracting a divination that targets an area or multiple
targets negates the effects only for nondetection’s target.
