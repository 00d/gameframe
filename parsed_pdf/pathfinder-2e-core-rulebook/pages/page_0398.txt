experiences a dream of your choice. If it sleeps for at least 1
minute, it gains the benefit of the dream for the remainder of

UNCOMMON
CLERIC
NECROMANCY
Domain indulgence
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them
past the worst of their affliction or intensify their misery.
This spell attempts to progress a disease affliction, a poison
affliction, or persistent poison damage affecting the target.
If the target is affected by more than one of these, you can
choose from among those you are aware of; otherwise the
GM chooses randomly. An unwilling target can attempt a
Will save to negate take its course.
The effect of this spell depends on whether you’re attempting
to end an affliction or persistent poison damage, and whether
you are attempting to help or hinder the target’s recovery.
•	 Affliction The target immediately attempts its next
saving throw against the affliction. You can grant
the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or
a –2 status penalty to its saving throw against
the affliction.
•	 Persistent Poison You can cause the target take the
persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast
this Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next
turn). Whether or not you do so, the target attempts
an additional flat check against the persistent poison
damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or
20 instead of the normal DC.
Heightened (7th) You can attempt to progress any number of
the target’s eligible afflictions and persistent poison damage.

DIVINATION
FORTUNE
Domain fate
Cast [reaction] somatic
Trigger You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.
Range 120 feet; Targets the triggering creature
You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or
uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status
bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw’s
result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it’s a
failure, it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure
can’t be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical
failure, such as improved evasion.
If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success
and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don’t
expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.
Heightened (8th) The bonus on the saving throw is +2.

of water.

direction along the ground or 20 feet in any direction
through a body of water.
