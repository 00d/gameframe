•	 If you have Wild Shape, you can morph your hands
into wild claws. Your hands transform into incredibly
sharp claws. These claws are an unarmed attack you’re
trained in and deal 1d6 slashing damage each (agile,
finesse). You can still hold and use items with your
hands while they’re transformed by this spell, but you
cannot hold an item while attacking. If you have Insect
Shape, you can instead transform your mouth into wild
jaws, an unarmed attack you’re trained in that deals
1d8 piercing damage.
•	 If you have Elemental Shape, you can morph your body
to be partially composed of elemental matter, granting
you resistance 5 to critical hits and precision damage.
•	 If you have Plant Shape, you can morph your arms into
long vines, increasing your reach to 10 feet (or 15 feet
with a reach weapon).
•	 If you have Soaring Shape, you can cast the spell as
a two-action activity ([two-actions] somatic, verbal) to grow
wings from your back. These wings allow you to fly
with a fly Speed of 30 feet.
Heightened (6th) You can choose up to two of the effects from
the list. Wild claws leave terrible, ragged wounds that also
deal 2d6 persistent bleed damage on a hit, and wild jaws are
envenomed, also dealing 2d6 persistent poison damage on a hit.
Heightened (10th) You can choose up to three of the effects
from the list. Wild claws deal 4d6 persistent bleed damage on
a hit, and wild jaws deal 4d6 persistent poison damage on a hit.

POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute (or longer)
You infuse yourself with primal essence and transform yourself
into another form. You can polymorph into any form listed in
pest form, which lasts 10 minutes. All other wild shape forms
last 1 minute. You can add more forms to your wild shape list
with druid feats; your feat might grant you some or all of the
forms from a given polymorph spell. When you transform into
a form granted by a spell, you gain all the effects of the form
you chose from a version of the spell heightened to wild shape’s
level. Wild shape allows you to use your own shapeshifting
training more easily than most polymorph spells. When you
choose to use your own attack modifier while polymorphed
instead of the form’s default attack modifier, you gain a +2
status bonus to your attack rolls.
Heightened (2nd) You can also wild shape into the forms listed
in animal form.
