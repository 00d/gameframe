Rogue Feats
At every level that you gain a rogue feat, you can select one of the following feats.
You must satisfy any prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
NIMBLE DODGE [one-action[reaction]
FEAT 1
ROGUE
Trigger A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.
Requirements You are not encumbered.
You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the
triggering attack.
TRAP FINDER
FEAT 1
ROGUE
You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by
traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check to find traps
that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements
to find the trap.
You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. If you have
master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.
TWIN FEINT [two-actions]
FEAT 1
ROGUE
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
You make a dazzling series of attacks with both weapons, using the first attack to
throw your foe off guard against a second attack at a different angle. Make one Strike
with each of your two melee weapons, both against the same target. The target is
automatically flat‑footed against the second attack. Apply your multiple attack penalty
to the Strikes normally.
YOU’RE NEXT [reaction]
FEAT 1
EMOTION
FEAR
MENTAL
ROGUE
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
Trigger You reduce an enemy to 0 hit points.
After downing a foe, you menacingly remind another foe that you’re coming after them
next. Attempt an Intimidation check with a +2 circumstance bonus to Demoralize a single
creature that you can see and that can see you. If you have legendary proficiency in
Intimidation, you can use this as a free action with the same trigger.
2ND LEVEL
BRUTAL BEATING
FEAT 2
ROGUE
Prerequisites ruffian racket
The brutality of your critical hits shakes your foes’ confidence. Whenever your Strike is a
critical hit and deals damage, the target is frightened 1.
DISTRACTING FEINT
FEAT 2
ROGUE

Your Feints are far more distracting than normal, drawing your foes’ attention and allowing
you and your allies to take greater advantage. While a creature is flat-footed by your Feint,
