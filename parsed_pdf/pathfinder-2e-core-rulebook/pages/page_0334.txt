SLEEP
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (somatic, verbal)
Range planetary; Targets up to 12 creatures you know by
name and have met in person
Duration 1 hour
When you Cast this Spell, any targets—including you—can choose
to immediately fall asleep. The spell ends for any creatures that
don’t choose to fall asleep. Sleepers join a shared dream, where
they can communicate with one another as though they were in
the same room. Individual targets leave this shared dream upon
awakening, and if all the targets awaken, the spell ends.
DREAM MESSAGE
SPELL 3
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (somatic, verbal)
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you know by name and
have met in person
Duration 1 day
You send a message to your target’s dream. The message is
one-way, up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words). If
the target is asleep, they receive the message instantly. If
not, they receive it the next time they sleep. As soon as they
receive it, the spell ends, and you know the message was sent.
Heightened (4th) You can target up to 10 creatures you know by
name and have met in person. You must send the same message
to all of them; the spell ends for each creature individually.

ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 willing sleeping creature
Duration 8 hours
You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore
the endless possibilities of its own potential within the ever-
changing backdrop of its dreamscape. If it sleeps the full 8 hours
uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day
of downtime retraining, though it can’t use dreaming potential
for any retraining that would require either an instructor or
specialized knowledge it can’t access within the dream.
