During combat encounters...
You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently
alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.
During social encounters...
You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.
While exploring...
You’re a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context
and helpful reconnaissance for the group’s adventure. Your spells and performances
inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.
In downtime...
You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for
yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might
attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.
You Might...
•	 Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.
•	 Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.
•	 Follow your muse, whether it’s a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical
concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret
lore that few others have.
Others Probably...
•	 Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a
guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles.
•	 Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more
than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.
•	 Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of
your beguiling magic.
You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a captivating
persuader. Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate
souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a
charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar,
scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne’er-
do-well and a jack-of-all-trades, it’s dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none.
