Doors
Opening an unlocked door requires an Interact action
(or more than one for a particularly complicated or large
door). Stuck doors must be Forced Open, and locked ones
require a character to Pick the Lock or Force them Open.
Floors
Wooden floors are easy to walk on, as are flagstone floors
made of fitted stones. However, floors of worn flagstone
often contain areas of uneven ground.
Gates
Walled settlements often have gates that the city can close
for defense or open to allow travel. A typical gate consists
of one portcullis at each end of a gatehouse, with murder
holes in between or other protected spots from which
guards can attack foes.
Guards
Most settlements of significant size have guards working
in shifts to protect the settlement at all hours, patrolling
the streets and guarding various posts. The size of this
force varies from one guard for every 1,000 residents to a
force 10 times this number.
Portcullises
A portcullis is a wooden or iron grate that descends
to seal off a gate or corridor. Most are raised on ropes
or chains operated by a winch, and they have locking
mechanisms that keep them from being lifted easily. The
rules on lifting a portcullis or bending its bars appear in
the sidebar on this page. If a portcullis falls on a creature,
use a slamming door trap (page 523).
Rooftops
Rooftops make for memorable ambushes, chase scenes,
infiltrations, and running fights. Flat roofs are easy
to move across, but they’re rare in any settlement that
receives significant snowfall, since heavy buildups of snow
can collapse a roof. Angled roofs are uneven ground, or
inclines if they’re especially steep. The peak of an angled
roof is a narrow surface.
Hurdling from roof to roof often requires a Long Jump,
though some buildings are close enough to Leap between.
A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof, or
a Leap followed by Grabbing an Edge and Climbing up.
Sewers
Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level
and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend
and  descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer
workers access, while channels in the center carry the waste
itself. Less sophisticated sewers, or sections those workers
don’t usually access, might require wading through disease-
ridden waste. Sewers can be accessed through sewer grates,
which usually require 2 or more Interact actions to open.
DOORS, GATES, AND WALLS
Some of the most common obstacles that characters
face in urban areas and dungeons are doors, gates,
and walls.
Climbing
The table below gives the typical DC for Athletics checks
to Climb a structure, which is usually a simple DC. You
might adjust the difficulty based on the specifics of the
structure and environment.
Demolishing
A character might want to smash their way through
a door, a window, or certain walls. The Hardness, Hit
Point, and Broken Threshold values provided in the table
below are based on the material the structure is typically
made out of, so a portcullis made of iron, for example,
has a higher Hardness than one of wood. For more on
damaging objects, see page 272.
Strong walls, such as well-maintained masonry
or hewn stone, can’t be broken without dedicated
work and proper tools. Getting through such walls
requires downtime.

Forcing Open
Structures that can be opened—such as doors, gates, and
windows—can be Forced Open using Athletics. This is
usually necessary only if they’re locked or stuck. The DC
to Force Open a structure uses the Thievery DC of its lock
but adjusts it to be very hard (increasing the DC by 5).
If there’s no lock, use the following table; when lifting
a portcullis, use the lock DC or the DC from the table,
whichever is higher.
