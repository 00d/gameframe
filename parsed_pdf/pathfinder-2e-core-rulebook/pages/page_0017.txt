Using This Book
While this chapter is here to teach you the basics of
Pathfinder, the rest of this rulebook serves as a reference
manual during play, and it is organized to make finding
the rule you need as easy as possible. Rules are grouped
together in chapters, with the early chapters focusing on
character creation. The last two chapters contain rules
for GMs, with advice on how to run a game of Pathfinder
and a rich array of treasure. The following is a summary
of what you can expect to find in each chapter.
Chapter 1: Introduction
This introduction is designed to help you understand the
basics of Pathfinder. This chapter also includes the rules
for building and leveling up a character. The chapter ends
with an example of building a 1st-level character.
Chapter 2: Ancestries & Backgrounds
The rules for the most common ancestries in the Age of
Lost Omens are in this chapter, including their ancestry
feat options. Backgrounds are at the end of this chapter,
along with a section about languages, as these are most
often influenced by your choice of ancestry.
Chapter 3: Classes
This chapter contains the rules for all 12 classes. Each
class entry includes guidelines on playing the class, rules
for building and advancing a character of that class,
sample builds, and all of the class feats available to
members of that class. This chapter also includes rules
for animal companions and familiars, which can be
acquired by members of several different classes. At the
end of this chapter are the rules for archetypes—special
options available to characters as they increase in level.
These rules allow a character to dabble in the abilities of
another class or concept.
Chapter 4: Skills
The rules for using skills are presented in this chapter,
and they detail what a character can do with a given
skill, based on that character’s proficiency rank.
Ancestry, background, and class can define some of
a character’s skill proficiencies, and each character
can also select a few additional skills to reflect their
personality and training.
Chapter 5: Feats
As a character advances in level, they gain additional
feats to represent their growing abilities. General feats
and skill feats (which are a subset of general feats) are
presented in this chapter.
Chapter 6: Equipment
Armor, weapons, and other gear can all be found in this
chapter, along with the price for services, cost of living,
and animals (such as horses, dogs, and pack animals).
Chapter 7: Spells
This chapter starts with rules for casting spells,
determining their effects, and getting rid of foes’ spells
(called counteracting). After that, the spell lists for
each spellcasting tradition are included, making it easy
to quickly find spells by their level. Next are rules for
every spell, presented in alphabetical order. Following
the spell descriptions are all of the focus spells—special
spells granted by specific class abilities and feats. While
most spells appear on multiple spell lists, focus spells
are granted only to members of a specific class and are
grouped together by class for ease of reference. Finally, at
the end of the chapter are rules for rituals, complicated
and risky spells that any character can cast.
Chapter 8: the age of lost omens
The setting of Golarion is described in this chapter,
including a brief overview of the world and its people,
followed by a timeline of events. Most importantly,
characters who venerate a deity should look to this
chapter to find the rules associated with their faith.
Chapter 9: Playing the Game
This important chapter contains the universal rules
needed to play Pathfinder, including rules for the various
modes of play, the basic actions that every character can
perform, the rules for combat, and the rules for death and
dying. Every player should be familiar with this chapter,
especially the GM.
Chapter 10: Game Mastering
Packed full of guidelines and advice, this chapter helps
Game Masters tell an interesting and compelling story.
It also includes advice on creating a fun and encouraging
game space and guides for empowering players to create
characters they want to play. This chapter also includes
rules that are particularly important for the GM to know,
such as rules dealing with traps, environmental dangers,
and afflictions (such as curses, diseases, and poisons), as
well as guidance on setting DCs and handing out rewards
to player characters.
Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure
The treasures characters find during their adventures
take many forms, from gold and gemstones to powerful
magical weapons. This chapter details guidelines for
distributing treasure to characters, as well as descriptions
of hundreds of magic items. This chapter also contains
the rules for alchemical items.
Appendices
The back of this book has an appendix with the rules
for all of the conditions that you will find in the game.
This section also includes a blank character sheet, and an
index with a comprehensive glossary of common terms
and traits that you’ll encounter in the game.
