If you critically fail a save against fear, veil of confidence
ends immediately, and you increase any frightened condition
you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
VIBRANT THORNS
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
MORPH
PLANT
TRANSMUTATION
Domain nature
Cast [one-action] somatic
Duration 1 minute
Your body sprouts a coat of brambly thorns that harm those
that strike you and thrive on life magic. Adjacent creatures
that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that hit
you with unarmed attacks, take 1 piercing damage each time
they do. Anytime you cast a positive spell, the damage from
your thorns increases to 1d6 until the start of your next turn.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1, or 1d6 after you
cast a positive spell.

FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
Domain nightmares
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You fill the creature’s mind with a terrifying vision out of its
nightmares. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is frightened 1.
Failure The target is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target is frightened 3.

immediately wakes up before attempting its save, and if it fails
its save, it gains the fleeing condition for 1 round in addition to
the effects noted above.
WEAPON SURGE

UNCOMMON
CLERIC
EVOCATION
Domain zeal
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range touch; Targets 1 weapon you’re wielding
Holding your weapon aloft, you fill it with divine energy. On
your next Strike with that weapon before the start of your
next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll and the
weapon deals an additional die of damage. If the weapon has
a striking rune, this instead increases the number of dice from
the striking rune by 1 (to a maximum of 3 extra weapon dice).
If the target weapon leaves your possession, weapon
surge immediately ends.
WORD OF FREEDOM
FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Domain freedom
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 round
You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature.
You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice:
confused, frightened, grabbed, or paralyzed. The target isn’t
affected by the chosen condition, and if you suppress the
grabbed condition, the target automatically breaks free from
any grab affecting it when you Cast the Spell.
If you don’t remove the effect that provided the condition,
the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a
spell was making the target confused for 1 minute, word of
freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the
confused condition would return afterward.
WORD OF TRUTH
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
DIVINATION
Domain truth
Cast [one-action] verbal
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You speak a statement you believe to be true and that is free of
any attempt to deceive through twisting words, omission, and
so on. The statement must be 25 words or fewer. A symbol of
your deity glows above your head, and anyone who sees you
and hears your statement knows that you believe it to be true.
Each time you Sustain this Spell, you can repeat this effect.

Cast 1 hour (somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 freshly picked berry

You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, allowing
it to heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A living
creature that eats the berry with an Interact action gains as
much nourishment as from a square meal for a typical human
and regains 1d8+5 Hit Points. If it’s not consumed during the
