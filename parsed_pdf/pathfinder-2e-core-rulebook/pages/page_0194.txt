Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of
your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as
an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (page
194). You choose these from the common spells from the
tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other
spells from that tradition to which you have access. You
can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell
slot of an appropriate spell level.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a
spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you
gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is
always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other
spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level
spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two
other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you
might choose a higher-level version of a spell you already
have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it
wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might
want to replace some of the spells you previously learned.
Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can
swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of

swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells
by retraining during downtime (page 481).
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Sorcerer Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 198.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Signature Spells
3rd
You’ve learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of
that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn
heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a
signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also
retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different
