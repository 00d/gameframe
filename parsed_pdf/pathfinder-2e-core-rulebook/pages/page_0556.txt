Armor
Suits of armor can be crafted from precious materials or
infused with magic to grant them abilities exceeding those
of typical armor. Many suits of magic armor are created
by etching runes onto them, as described on page 580.
The magic armor stat block lists the Price and
attributes of the most common armors you can
make with fundamental runes. Other special
suits of armor might be made of precious
materials, and some are specially crafted
items all on their own.
Precious Material Armor
Suits of armor made of precious
materials are more expensive and
sometimes grant special effects.
You can make leather armor
out of dragonhide, wooden
armor out of darkwood, and metal armor
out of any precious materials except for
darkwood. Because armor’s Bulk is
reduced when the armor is worn, use
its carried Bulk when determining
its material Price. (Materials are on
page 577.)

COLD IRON ARMOR
ITEM 5+
Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
Cold iron armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A
creature with weakness to cold iron (such as most demons
and fey) that critically fails an unarmed attack against a
creature in cold iron armor becomes sickened 1. A creature
with weakness to cold iron is sickened 1 as long as it wears
cold iron armor.

DARKWOOD ARMOR
ITEM 12+
UNCOMMON
Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
Darkwood armor is 1 Bulk lighter than normal (or
light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on
armor that normally has light Bulk). It’s easier
to wear than normal wood armor, reducing
the Strength score necessary to ignore its
check penalty by 2 and reducing its Speed
penalty by 5 feet. (There are no types of
wood armor in this book.)

DRAGONHIDE ARMOR
ITEM 12+
UNCOMMON
Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
Dragonhide armor is immune to one damage type based
on the type of dragon it is made from (as listed in the
table on page 579). Wearing armor made from dragonhide
also grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC and
saving throws against attacks and spells that deal the
corresponding damage type.

gp + 160 gp per Bulk; Craft Requirements The initial raw

ELVEN CHAIN
ITEM 13+
UNCOMMON
Usage worn armor; Bulk 1
Elven chain is a chain shirt made of mithral (page 579) that
glitters in even the faintest light. It grants a +2 item bonus
to AC and has no check penalty.
Created by elven artisans employing ancient crafting
techniques, elven chain is exceptionally quiet. Unlike other
chain shirts—even other mithral chain shirts—elven chain
does not have the noisy  trait. This suit of armor can be
etched with runes like any other mithral chain shirt.
