If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.
Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you
were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking,
the GM might give you half your bonus because the item
requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

STEADY BALANCE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions.
Whenever you roll a success using the Balance action, you
get a critical success instead. You’re not flat-footed while
attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven
ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt
an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge.
STREETWISE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your
local settlement. You can use your Society modifier instead
of your Diplomacy modifier to Gather Information. In any
settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall
Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of
information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather
Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you
know the information without spending time gathering it. If
you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently
attempt to Gather Information normally.
STUDENT OF THE CANON
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Religion
You’ve researched many faiths enough to recognize notions
about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure
at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or
to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure
instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets
of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead,
and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
SUBTLE THEFT
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
When you successfully Steal something, observers (creatures
other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance
penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft.
Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception,
taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn’t end your
undetected condition.
SURVEY WILDLIFE
 FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
You can study details in the wilderness to determine the
presence of nearby creatures. You can spend 10 minutes
assessing the area around you to find out what creatures
are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation.
Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM
based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can
attempt a Recall Knowledge check with a –2 penalty to learn
more about the creatures just from these signs. If you’re a
master in Survival, you don’t take the penalty.
SWIFT SNEAK
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You can move your full Speed when you Sneak. You can use Swift
Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead
of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
TERRAIN EXPERTISE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
Your experience in navigating a certain type of terrain
makes you supremely confident while doing so. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks in one of the
following types of terrain, chosen when you select this feat:
aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp,
or underground.
Special You can select this feat more than once, choosing a
different type of terrain each time.
TERRAIN STALKER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Stealth
Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list:
rubble, snow, or underbrush. While undetected by all
non-allies in that type of terrain, you can Sneak without
attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than
5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point
during your movement. This also allows you to automatically
approach creatures to within 15 feet while Avoiding Notice
during exploration as long as they aren’t actively Searching
or on guard.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
choose a different type of terrain.
