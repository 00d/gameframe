SAMPLE RANGER
STEALTHY COMPANION
FEAT 14
RANGER
Prerequisites Camouflage
You’ve trained your animal companion to blend in to its
surroundings. Your animal companion gains the benefit of the
Camouflage feat. If your companion is a specialized ambusher,
its proficiency rank for Stealth increases to master (or
legendary if it was already master).
TARGETING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
PRESS
RANGER
Prerequisites Hunter’s Aim
You carefully track your prey’s position and defenses, allowing
you to follow up around obstacles that block your shot.
Make a ranged weapon Strike against your hunted prey. You
ignore the target’s concealed condition and all cover.
WARDEN’S GUIDANCE
FEAT 14
RANGER
You can convey your prey’s location to your allies, no matter
how well hidden it is. As long as your hunted prey is observed
by you, all your allies who roll failures and critical failures
when Seeking it get a success instead. Your allies need to be
able to see or hear you to gain this benefit. You have to be able
to call out or use gestures for your allies to get this benefit.
16TH LEVEL
GREATER DISTRACTING SHOT
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites Distracting Shot
Even a single missile can throw off your enemy’s balance, and
more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit
your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until
the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit
it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat‑footed
until the end of your next turn instead.
IMPROVED TWIN RIPOSTE
FEAT 16
RANGER
At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional
reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte
against your hunted prey. You can use this extra reaction even
if you are not benefiting from Twin Parry.
LEGENDARY MONSTER HUNTER
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites legendary in Nature, Master Monster Hunter
Your knowledge of monsters is so incredible that it reveals
glaring flaws in your prey. Your bonus from Monster Hunter
(and the bonus from Monster Warden if you have it) increases
from +1 to +2 for you and any allies who benefit.
SPECIALIZED COMPANION
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites Incredible Companion
ARCHER
You keep your distance from your prey, shooting
arrows with incredible precision to hinder or kill
those you hunt.
ABILITY SCORES

you want to use a composite bow or thrown weapon, or
Intelligence to be more skilled.
