different spell of that level without swapping any spells;
this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts 
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats 
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Expert Spellcaster 
7th
Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and
spell DCs increase to expert.

Bard Feats 
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bard
class feat (page 99).
Skill Feats 
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Lightning Reflexes
3rd
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank in
Reflex saves increases to expert.
Signature Spells 
3rd
Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of
that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn
heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a
signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
level at which you learned the previous spell. You can
also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a
