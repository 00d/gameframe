You swiftly deflect incoming flames. The target gains fire

FORCED QUIET
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
CLERIC
Domain secrecy
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration varies
You quiet the target’s voice, preventing it from giving away
valuable secrets. This doesn’t prevent the target from talking
or providing verbal spell components, but no creature more
than 10 feet away can hear its whispers without succeeding
at a Perception check against your spell DC, which might
interfere with auditory or linguistic effects as well as
communication. The spell’s duration depends on the target’s
Fortitude save. After attempting its save, the target becomes
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The duration is 1 round.
Failure The duration is 1 minute.
Critical Failure The duration is 10 minutes.

DIVINATION
REVELATION
Domain truth
Cast [one-action] somatic
Area 30-foot emanation
Duration 1 round
Divine insight lets you see things as they truly are. The GM
attempts a secret counteract check against each illusion that is
at least partially within the area. Instead of counteracting the
illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds
against an illusory disguise spell, you see the creature’s true
form but illusory disguise doesn’t end).
The area moves with you for the duration of the spell, and
the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time a new
illusion is within the area.
Heightened (7th) You can allow everyone to see through
illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.
HEALER’S BLESSING

UNCOMMON

NECROMANCY
Domain healing
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature
Duration 1 minute
Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to
positive energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a
healing spell, it regains 1 additional Hit Point.
The target regains additional Hit Points from healer’s
blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing
spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a
duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.
Heightened (+1) The additional healing increases by 2 HP.

presence guiding your aim. Make a spell attack roll against
the target. The stone deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6

solid ground may take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and must
attempt a Reflex saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
