Cleric
You are an ordained priest of your deity and have even
learned how to cast a few divine spells. Though your main
training lies elsewhere, your religious calling provides
you divine gifts.
Multiclass Cleric characters
The cleric archetype is a great way to create a character
of another class who’s a devotee of a particular deity.
The many domains available to clerics of different deities
present a variety of options for focus spells.
•	 Alchemist clerics work well with the chirurgeon
field, healing various ailments with either alchemy
or spells.
•	 Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent
domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch.
•	 Divine sorcerer clerics double down as the ultimate
divine spellcasters.
•	 Other spellcaster clerics diversify their options,
becoming theurgic characters who combine two
magical traditions.

You cast spells like a cleric. You gain access to the Cast a Spell
activity. You can prepare two common cantrips each day from
the divine spell list in this book or any other cantrips you learn
or discover. You’re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for
divine spells. Your key spellcasting ability for cleric archetype
spells is Wisdom, and they are divine cleric spells. Choose a
deity as you would if you were a cleric. You become bound
by that deity’s anathema. You become trained in Religion and
your deity’s associated skill; for each of these skills in which
you were already trained, you instead become trained in a skill
of your choice. You don’t gain any other abilities from your
choice of deity.
