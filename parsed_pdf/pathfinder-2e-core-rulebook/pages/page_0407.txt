You transform your flesh and organs into a bizarre amalgam
of glistening skin, rough scales, tufts of hair, and tumorous
protuberances. This has three effects:
•	 You gain resistance 10 to precision damage and
resistance 10 to extra damage from critical hits. If the
resistance is greater than the extra damage, it reduces
the extra damage to 0 but doesn’t reduce the attack’s
normal damage.
•	 You gain darkvision.
•	 Acid oozes from your skin. Any creature that hits you
with an unarmed attack or with a non-reach melee
weapon takes 2d6 acid damage.
Heightened (+2) The resistances increase by 5, and the acid
damage increases by 1d6.
