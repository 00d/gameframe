Simple DCs
Sometimes you need to quickly set a Difficulty Class. The
easiest method is to select a simple DC from Table 10–4
by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task
(that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task).
If it’s something pretty much anyone would have a decent
chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree
of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or
legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the
task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true
history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check
to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master
proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information,
so you’d set the DC at 30—the simple master DC.
Simple DCs work well when you need a DC on the fly
and there’s no level associated with the task. They’re most
useful for skill checks. Because there isn’t much gradation
between the simple DCs, they don’t work as well for
hazards or combatants, where the PCs’ lives are on the line;
you’re better off using level-based DCs for such challenges.

Level-Based DCs
When you’re determining a skill DC based on something
that has a level, use Table 10–5 to set the DC. Find the
level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since
spells use a 1–10 scale, use the Spell Level column for them.
Use these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or
Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn
Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so
on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles
instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you
might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was
constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You
could simply say only someone with master proficiency
could climb it, and use the simple DC of 30. Or you
might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the
dungeon crafted the wall, and use the 15th-level DC of
34. Either approach is reasonable!
Note that PCs who invest in a skill become more likely
to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase in level,
and the listed DCs eventually become very easy for them.

*	If a spell is uncommon or rare, its difficulty should be
adjusted accordingly.
Adjusting Difficulty
You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline,
whether to account for PCs’ areas of expertise or to
represent the rarity of spells or items. A DC adjustment
represents an essential difference in the difficulty of a task
and applies to anyone attempting a specific check for it.
Adjustments happen most often with tasks whose DCs
are based on their level. Adjustments use a scale of –10
to +10, from incredibly easy checks to incredibly hard
Difficulty Classes
As the Game Master, it’s up to you to set the difficulty classes (DCs) for checks that don’t
use a predefined DC. The following sections offer advice on how to set appropriate DCs
and tweak them as needed to feel natural for your story. Picking a simple DC and using a
level-based DC each work well in certain circumstances, and you can adjust both types of
DC using the advice on adjusting difficulty.
