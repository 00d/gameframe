14TH LEVEL
SPECIALIZED COMPANION
FEAT 14
DRUID
Prerequisites Incredible Companion
Your animal companion continues to grow in power and ability,
and it is now cunning enough to become specialized. Your
animal companion gains one specialization of your choice. (See
the Animal Companion section on page 214.)

add a different specialization to your companion.
TIMELESS NATURE
FEAT 14
DRUID
With primal magic sustaining you, you cease aging. The
overflowing primal energy gives you a +2 status bonus to saves
against diseases and primal magic.
VERDANT METAMORPHOSIS
FEAT 14
DRUID
Prerequisites leaf order
You transform into a plant version of yourself. You gain the
plant trait and lose any trait that’s inappropriate for your new
form (typically humanoid for a PC, but also possibly animal or
fungus). You can change from a form that looks mostly like
your old self into a tree or any other non-creature plant as
a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This has the
same effect as tree shape, except you can turn into any kind of
non-creature plant and your AC is 30.
If you rest for 10 minutes while transformed into a non-
creature plant during daylight hours under direct sunlight,
you recover half your maximum Hit Points. If you take your
daily rest in this way, the rest restores you to maximum Hit
Points and removes all non-permanent drained, enfeebled,
clumsy, and stupefied conditions, as well as all poisons and
diseases of 19th level or lower.
