MAGICAL SHORTHAND 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Learning spells comes easily to you. If you’re an expert in a
tradition’s associated skill, you take 10 minutes per spell level to
learn a spell of that tradition, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If
you fail to learn the spell, you can try again after 1 week or after
you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the
tradition’s associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per
spell level, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level.
You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works
as if you were using Earn Income with the tradition’s associated
skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to
you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free
if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.
MULTILINGUAL 

SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society

you learn additional languages.
