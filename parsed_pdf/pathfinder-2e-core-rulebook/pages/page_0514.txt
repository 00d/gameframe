Rubble
Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is difficult
terrain. Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather
than navigated through is uneven ground.
Sand
Packed sand doesn’t usually significantly impede a
character’s movement, but loose sand is either difficult
terrain (if it’s shallow) or uneven ground (if it’s deep).
The wind in a desert often shifts sand into dunes, hills
of loose sand with uneven ground facing the wind and
steeper inclines away from the wind.
Forest
These diverse environments include jungles and other
wooded areas. They are sometimes struck by wildfires.
Canopies
Particularly dense forests, such as rain forests, have a
canopy level above the ground. A creature trying to reach
the canopy or travel along it must Climb. Swinging on
vines and branches usually requires an Acrobatics or
Athletics check. A canopy provides cover, and a thicker
one can prevent creatures in the canopy from seeing those
on the ground, and vice versa.
Trees
While trees are omnipresent in a forest, they typically
don’t provide cover unless a character uses the Take
Cover action. Only larger trees that take up an entire
5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to
provide cover automatically.
Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a
character to Take Cover. Heavy undergrowth is greater
difficult terrain that automatically provides cover. Some
sorts of undergrowth, such as thorns, might also be
hazardous terrain, and areas with plenty of twisting roots
might be uneven ground.
Mountain
Mountain environments also include hills, which share
many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme
features. The most common disasters here are avalanches.
Chasms
Chasms are natural pits, typically at least 20 feet long
and clearly visible (barring mundane or magical efforts to
conceal them). The main danger posed by a chasm is that
characters must Long Jump to get across. Alternatively,
characters can take the safer but slower route of Climbing
down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the
far side to get across.
Cliffs
Cliffs and rock walls require creatures to Climb to
ascend or descend. Without extensive safety precautions,
a critical failure can result in significant falling damage.
Rubble
Mountains often have extremely rocky areas or shifting,
gravelly scree that makes for difficult terrain. Especially
deep or pervasive rubble is uneven ground.
