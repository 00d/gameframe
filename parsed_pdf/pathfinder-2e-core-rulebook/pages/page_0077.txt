Alchemist Feats
At every level that you gain an alchemist feat, you can select one of the following
feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ALCHEMICAL FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials,
reagents, and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar appears to be a small
creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects
depending on your creative process. Like other familiars, your alchemical familiar assists
you in your laboratory and on adventures. The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to
determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers (see Familiars on page 217 for
more information).
ALCHEMICAL SAVANT
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy
on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate
and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item
you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you
roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
FAR LOBBER
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You’ve learned how to throw a longer distance. When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has
a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.
QUICK BOMBER [one-action]
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You keep your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches from which you draw without thinking. You
Interact to draw a bomb, then Strike with it.
