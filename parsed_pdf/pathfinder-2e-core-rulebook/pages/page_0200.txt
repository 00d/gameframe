You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can select four familiar or master
abilities each day, instead of two.
4TH LEVEL
ARCANE EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
ARCANE
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants arcane spells
Your arcane legacy grants you an exceptional aptitude for intellectual and academic
pursuits. You become trained in one skill of your choice. Additionally, you keep a book of
arcane spells similar to a wizard’s spellbook. You add all the spells in your spell repertoire
to this book for free, and you can add additional arcane spells to the book by paying the
appropriate cost and using your Arcana skill, similarly to how a wizard can Learn Spells to
add those spells to his spellbook.
During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of arcane spells.
If it isn’t in your spell repertoire, add it to your spell repertoire until the next time you
prepare. If it’s already in your spell repertoire, add it as an additional signature spell
for that day.
BESPELL WEAPON [free-action]
FEAT 4
SORCERER
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell.
You siphon the residual energy from the last spell you cast into one weapon you’re wielding.
Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of a type depending on
the school of the spell you just cast.
•	 Abjuration force damage
•	 Conjuration or Transmutation the same type as the weapon
•	 Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental damage
•	 Evocation a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the spell didn’t deal damage
•	 Necromancy negative damage
DIVINE EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
DIVINE
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants divine spells
The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you. You gain an additional
spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast your choice of heal or
harm. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if they aren’t in your
spell repertoire.
OCCULT EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
OCCULT
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants occult spells
Glimpses of the obscure secrets of the universe loan you power. You become trained in one
skill of your choice. Additionally, once per day, you can spend 1 minute to choose one mental
occult spell you don’t know and add it to your spell repertoire. You lose this temporary spell
the next time you make your daily preparations (though you can use this ability to add it
again later).
PRIMAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
PRIMAL
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants primal spells
You can call upon the creatures of the wild for aid. You gain an additional spell slot of
your highest level, which you can use only to cast summon animal or summon plants and
fungi. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if it they aren’t in your
spell repertoire.
