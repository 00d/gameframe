Alchemist
During combat encounters...
You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party
with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient
and powerful weapon.
During social encounters...
You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets,
such as poisons and diseases.
While exploring...
You keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice
on all things alchemical and mysterious.
In downtime...
You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering
your alchemical knowledge.
You Might...
•	 Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a
single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
•	 Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you’ve made,
and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
•	 Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.
Others Probably...
•	 Think you’re some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don’t understand
that you don’t cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only
heighten this misconception.
•	 Don’t understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
•	 Assume that if you haven’t caused a catastrophe with your experimentations,
you inevitably will.
There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker,
and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You’re fascinated by
uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you’re constantly
experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality.
You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your
unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body
to their limits.
