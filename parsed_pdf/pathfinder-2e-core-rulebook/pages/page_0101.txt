Prerequisites polymath muse
You keep a book of occult spells, similar to a wizard’s spellbook, and can use its spells to
supplement your spell repertoire. Add all the spells in your repertoire to this book for free.

paying the appropriate cost, similar to a wizard.
During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of occult spells. If that

day. If it isn’t in your repertoire, treat it as though it were until your next daily preparations.
