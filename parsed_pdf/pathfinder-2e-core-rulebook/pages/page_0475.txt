Table 9–1 also lists the typical reach for creatures of each
size, for both tall creatures (most bipeds) and long creatures
(most quadrupeds). See page 455 for more about reach.
The Space entry lists how many feet on a side a creature’s
space is, so a Large creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot
space (4 squares on the grid). Sometimes part of a creature
extends beyond its space, such as if a giant octopus is
grabbing you with its tentacles. In that case, the GM will
usually allow attacking the extended portion, even if you
can’t reach the main creature. A Small or larger creature or
object takes up at least 1 square on a grid, and creatures
of these sizes can’t usually share spaces except in situations
like a character riding a mount. Rules for moving through
other creatures’ spaces appear below.

Multiple Tiny creatures can occupy the same square.
At least four can fit in a single square, though the GM
might determine that even more can fit. Tiny creatures can
occupy a space occupied by a larger creature as well, and
if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.
Move Actions That Trigger Reactions
Some reactions and free actions are triggered by a creature
using an action with the move trait. The most notable
example is Attack of Opportunity. Actions with the move
trait can trigger reactions or free actions throughout
the course of the distance traveled. Each time you exit
a square (or move 5 feet if not using a grid) within a
creature’s reach, your movement triggers those reactions
and free actions (although no more than once per move
action for a given reacting creature). If you use a move
action but don’t move out of a square, the trigger instead
happens at the end of that action or ability.
Some actions, such as Step, specifically state they don’t
trigger reactions or free actions based on movement.
Moving Through a Creature’s Space
You can move through the space of a willing creature. If
you want to move through an unwilling creature’s space,
you can Tumble Through that creature’s space using
Acrobatics. You can’t end your turn in a square occupied
by another creature, though you can end a move action
in its square provided that you immediately use another
move action to leave that square. If two creatures end
up in the same square by accident, the GM determines
which one is forced out of the square (or whether one
falls prone).
Prone and Incapacitated Creatures
You can share a space with a prone creature if that
Triggering Moves
1.	 Valeros can approach position 1
with the Stride action without
triggering reactions.
2.	 If Valeros approaches this
way to position 2, he triggers
reactions
from
both
the
hobgoblin and the troll. The
troll has a reach of 10 feet,
so Valeros triggers reactions
from both enemies when
he moves out of the second
square and into the third.
3.	 If Seoni Strides to position 3,
she triggers reactions from the
hobgoblin and the troll. Because
of its 10-foot reach, the troll
could use its reaction when
Seoni left either square. She
could Step twice to get there to
avoid triggering reactions, but
that uses 2 actions instead of 1.
