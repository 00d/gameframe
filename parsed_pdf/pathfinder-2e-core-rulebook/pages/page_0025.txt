Speed, and languages, and contributes to their Hit Points.
Each also grants ability boosts and ability flaws to represent
the ancestry’s basic capabilities.
You’ll make four decisions when you select your
character’s ancestry:
•	 Pick the ancestry itself.
•	 Assign any free ability boosts and decide if you are
taking any voluntary flaws.
•	 Select a heritage from those available within that
ancestry, further defining the traits your character
was born with.
•	 Choose an ancestry feat, representing an ability your
hero learned at an early age.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s ancestry and heritage in the
appropriate space at the top of your character sheet’s first
page. Adjust your ability scores, adding 2 to an ability
score if you gained an ability boost from your ancestry, and
subtracting 2 from an ability score if you gained an ability
flaw from your ancestry. Note the number of Hit Points your
character gains from their ancestry—you’ll add more to this
number later. Finally, in the appropriate spaces, record your
character’s size, Speed, and languages. If your character’s
ancestry provides them with special abilities, write them
in the appropriate spaces, such as darkvision in the Senses

Step 2
Start Building
Ability Scores
At this point, you need to start building your character’s
ability scores. See the overview of ability scores on pages
19–20 for more information about these important
aspects of your character and an overview of the process.
Your character’s ability scores each start at 10, and as
you select your ancestry, background, and class, you’ll apply
ability boosts, which increase a score by 2, and ability flaws,
which decrease a score by 2. At this point, just note a 10 in
each ability score and familiarize yourself with the rules for
ability boosts and flaws on page 20. This is also a good time
to identify which ability scores will be most important to
your character. See The Six Ability Scores on page 19 and
the class summaries on pages 22–23 for more information.

Step 3
Select an Ancestry
Select an ancestry for your character. The ancestry
summaries on page 22 provide an overview of Pathfinder’s
core ancestry options, and each is fully detailed in
Chapter  2. Ancestry determines your character’s size,
