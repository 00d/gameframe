FAERIE FIRE
SPELL 2
EVOCATION
LIGHT
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Duration 5 minutes
All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned
in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the
duration. Visible creatures can’t be concealed while affected
by faerie fire. If the creatures are invisible, they are concealed
while affected by faerie fire, rather than being undetected.
FALSE LIFE
SPELL 2
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 8 hours
You create a reservoir of vitality from necromantic energy,
gaining a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 6 plus your
spellcasting ability modifier.
Heightened (+1) The temporary Hit Points increase by 3.
FALSE VISION
SPELL 5
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Area 100-foot burst
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on
an area. Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise
detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what
is actually in the area. You can Sustain the Spell each round
to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a
complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher level than
false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to
disbelieve the illusion, though even if they’re successful,
they can’t learn what’s truly going on in the area.

You cause the air itself to arrest a fall. The target’s fall slows to
60 feet per round, and the portion of the fall during the spell’s
duration doesn’t count when calculating falling damage. If the
target reaches the ground while the spell is in effect, it takes no
damage from the fall. The spell ends as soon as the target lands.
