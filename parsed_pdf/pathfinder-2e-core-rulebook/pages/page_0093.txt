ATTACK

CONCENTRATE
INSTINCT RAGE
Prerequisites spirit instinct
You call forth an ephemeral apparition, typically the ghost
of an ancestor or a nature spirit, which takes the form of a
wisp. The spirit wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed
attack against an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp’s
attack modifier is equal to your proficiency bonus for martial
weapons plus your Strength modifier plus a +2 item bonus,
and it applies the same circumstance and status bonuses
and penalties that you have. On a hit, the wisp deals damage
equal to 4d8 plus your Constitution modifier. The damage is
your choice of negative or positive damage; don’t apply your
Rage damage or your weapon specialization damage, but
circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that would
also affect the wisp’s damage apply. If your wisp’s Strike is a
critical hit, the target becomes frightened 1. This attack uses
and counts toward your multiple attack penalty as if you were
the one attacking.
