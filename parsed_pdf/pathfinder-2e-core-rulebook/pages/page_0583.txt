UPGRADING ARMOR AND WEAPON RUNES
You’ll often want to upgrade the fundamental runes of magic armor or a magic weapon you already have. This requires
upgrading each rune separately. Tables 11–5 and 11–6 summarize the Price of each step, with a number in parentheses
indicating the item’s level for the Craft activity. This also indicates the typical progression for an adventurer to follow when
upgrading their armor and weapons. The tables here don’t include progressions that aren’t as likely to come up, like turning
a +1 weapon directly into a +1 greater striking weapon.

Property Runes
Property runes add special abilities to armor or a weapon
in addition to the item’s fundamental runes. If a suit of
armor or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same
rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade
a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the
same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune.
Rune abilities that must be activated follow the rules
for activating magic items on page 532.
Armor Property Runes
ANTIMAGIC
RUNE 15
UNCOMMON
 ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 6,500 gp
Usage etched onto armor
This intricate rune displaces spell energy, granting you a +1
status bonus to saving throws against magical effects.
Activate [reaction] command; Frequency once per day; Trigger A
spell targets you or includes you in its area; Effect The armor
attempts to counteract the triggering spell with the effect of
a 7th-level dispel magic spell and a counteract modifier of +26.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of dispel magic.
ENERGY-RESISTANT
RUNE 8+
ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Usage etched onto armor
These symbols convey protective forces from the Elemental
Planes. You gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
The crafter chooses the damage type when creating the rune.
Multiple energy-resistant runes can be etched onto a suit of
armor; rather than using only the highest-level effect, each must
provide resistance to a different damage type. For instance, a +2
acid-resistant greater fire-resistant breastplate would give you
acid resistance 5 and fire resistance 10.
Type energy-resistant; Level 8; Price 420 gp
Type greater energy-resistant; Level 12; Price 1,650 gp
You gain resistance 10 to the specified damage type.
ETHEREAL
RUNE 17
UNCOMMON
 CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 13,500 gp
Usage etched onto armor
An ethereal rune replicates armor on the Ethereal Plane.
Activate [one-action] command; Frequency once per day; Effect You
gain the effects of an ethereal jaunt spell. This doesn’t require
concentration and lasts for 10 minutes or until you choose to
return to material form as a free action.
Craft Requirements Supply a casting of 9th level ethereal jaunt.
FORTIFICATION
RUNE 12+
ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Usage etched onto medium or heavy armor
A fortification rune wards against the most deadly attacks.
Each time you’re critically hit while wearing the etched armor,
attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal
hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1
and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 2.
