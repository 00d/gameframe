skill with halfling weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants
you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also
gain that proficiency in the sling, halfling sling staff, shortsword, and all
halfling weapons in which you are trained.
HALFLING ADVENTURERS
Halflings’ natural wanderlust
and opportunistic nature make
them ideal adventurers. Many
people put up with their vivacious
attitudes in return for the natural
talents they provide and the
popular superstition that traveling
with a halfling is good luck.
Typical backgrounds for
halflings include acrobat,
criminal, emissary, entertainer,
laborer, and street urchin.
Halflings make great clerics
and rogues, but many also
become monks or rangers.
