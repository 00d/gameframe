GNOME ADVENTURERS
Adventure is not so much a
choice as a necessity for most
gnomes. Adventuring gnomes
often claim mementos, allowing
them to remember and relive
their most exciting stories.
Gnomes often consider the
entertainer, merchant, or nomad
backgrounds. In addition, the
animal whisperer, barkeep,
gambler, and tinker backgrounds
are particularly appropriate.
Gnomes’ connection to magic
makes spellcasting classes
particularly thematic for you,
especially classes that match the
tradition of your primal innate
spells, such as druid or primal
sorcerer, though wellspring
gnomes might choose others.
