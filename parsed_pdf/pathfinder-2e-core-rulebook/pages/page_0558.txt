Specific Magic Armor
These suits of armor have abilities far different from
what can be gained by etching runes. A specific magic
armor lists its fundamental runes, which you can
upgrade, add, or transfer as normal. You can’t etch
any property runes onto a specific armor that it doesn’t
already have.

This suit of +2 resilient chain mail is made of fine white
links of a strange and slightly translucent pale metal, and
the sleeves and skirt are fashioned into smaller trails that
resemble feathers. Unlike normal chain mail, celestial armor
has no Speed reduction, its armor check penalty is 0, and its
Bulk is 1.
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws
against fiends. You appear radiant while you wear the armor,
giving you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks against all
creatures except fiends.
If you are not good, you are drained 2 while wearing
celestial armor. You can’t recover from this condition while
wearing the armor.

Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 resilient full
plate is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with
your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.
While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet’s
horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a
+2 weapon potency rune. They deal 2d8
piercing damage and have the deadly d12
trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the
target must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude
save against the Abyssal plague disease
(page 316). The horns can’t be etched
with any runes.
