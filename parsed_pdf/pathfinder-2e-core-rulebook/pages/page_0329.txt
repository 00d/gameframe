DETECT ALIGNMENT
SPELL 1
UNCOMMON
DETECTION
DIVINATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot emanation
Your eyes glow as you sense aligned auras. Choose chaotic,
evil, good, or lawful. You detect auras of that alignment. You
receive no information beyond presence or absence. You can
choose not to detect creatures or effects you’re aware have
that alignment.
Only creatures of 6th level or higher—unless divine
spellcasters, undead, or beings from the Outer Sphere—have
alignment auras.
Heightened (2nd) You learn each aura’s location and strength.
ALIGNMENT AURA
The strength of an alignment aura depends on the level
of the creature, item, or spell. The auras of undead, clerics
and other divine spellcasters with a patron deity, and
creatures from the Outer Sphere are one step stronger
than normal (faint instead of none, for example).

DETECTION
DIVINATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot emanation
You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You
receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic.
You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the
magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.
You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower
level than the level of your detect magic spell. However, items
that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance
(such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.
Heightened (3rd) You learn the school of magic for the highest-
level effect within range that the spell detects. If multiple
effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.
Heightened (4th) As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source
of the highest-level magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you
don’t learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source
to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).
DETECT POISON
SPELL 1
UNCOMMON
DETECTION
DIVINATION
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object or creature
You detect whether a creature is venomous or poisonous, or if
an object is poison or has been poisoned. You do not ascertain
whether the target is poisonous in multiple ways, nor do you
learn the type or types of poison. Certain substances, like lead
and alcohol, are poisons and so mask other poisons.
Heightened (2nd) You learn the number and types of poison.
DETECT SCRYING
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
DETECTION
DIVINATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot emanation
Duration 1 hour
By tapping into trace divinatory auras, you detect the presence
of scrying effects in the area. If detect scrying is higher level
than a scrying effect, you gain a glimpse of the scrying
creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.
Heightened (6th) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
DIMENSION DOOR
SPELL 4
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly
transport yourself and any items you’re wearing and holding
from your current space to a clear space within range you can
see. If this would bring another creature with you—even if you’re
carrying it in an extradimensional container—the spell is lost.
