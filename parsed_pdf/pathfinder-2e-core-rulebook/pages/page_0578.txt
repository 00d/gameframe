Materials
Most items are made from readily available materials—
usually leather, wood, or steel—but some weapons and
armor are made from more exotic materials, giving
them unique properties and other advantages. Weapons
made from precious materials are better able to harm
certain creatures, and armor of these materials provides
enhanced protection.
Most materials are metals; they can be used to make
metal weapons and armor. The GM is the final arbiter of
what items can be made using a material. An item can be
made with no more than one precious material, and only
an expert in Crafting can create it. Some rare and exotic
materials require master or even legendary proficiency.
A material’s Price depends on how hard it is to work,
its scarcity, and its purity; most items made with precious
materials use an alloy, blend, or coating rather than using
the material in its purest form. The three grades of purity
for precious materials are low-grade, standard-grade, and
high-grade. Regardless of a precious material’s purity, an
item made from it gains the full effects of the precious
material, but creating higher-level items and more powerful
magic runes with precious material requires greater purity.
Some precious materials are available only at certain
grades. For instance, adamantine can’t be low-grade, and
orichalcum must be high-grade. Items made of materials
with a lower grade than expected for the item’s level, or of
a higher grade than necessary, will mention the precious
material’s grade.
Material Statistics
Table 11–4 below provides the Hardness, Hit Points,
Broken Threshold, and example items for some types
of common materials. The table has separate entries for
thin items (like shields), ordinary items (like armor), and
reinforced or durable structures (such as walls).
Stone is a catchall for any hard stone, such as granite
and marble. Likewise, wood covers ordinary woods, such
as oak and pine. Metal weapons and armor are assumed
to be made of iron or steel unless noted otherwise.
If an object consists of more than one material, the
GM typically uses the statistics for the strongest material
involved. For instance, breaking a wall made of paper
panels over a woven wooden framework would require
damaging thin wood, not paper. However, the GM
might choose the weaker material based on the item’s
function. For instance, breaking the wooden handle of
a hammer rather than its iron head would still render
the item unusable. Sometimes an item is even less sturdy
than the Hardness and Hit Points provided for a thin
object; for instance, a twig doesn’t take 9 damage to
break, even though it’s made of thin wood. Similarly,
a particularly sturdy item or structure might have even
higher Hardness and Hit Points. Certain structures,
particularly thick walls, are so reinforced that you have
to break them down over time with tools. (Page 515 has
more information on walls.)
Precious Materials
Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for
base materials. For example, a hammer’s head could be
made of adamantine instead of iron. Items made of a
precious material cost more than typical items; not only
does precious material cost more, but the crafter must
invest more time working with it. In addition, more
powerful items require precious materials of greater purity.
