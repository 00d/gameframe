Weapon Traits
Weapons and unarmed attacks with the weapon trait can
have the following traits.
Agile: The multiple attack penalty you take with this
weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead
of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent
attacks in the turn.
Attached: An attached weapon must be combined with
another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of
item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding
or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to
attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to
a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of
a shield bash, but only if you’re wielding the shield. An
attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the
item it’s attached to, and typically an item can have only one
weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed
to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10
Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove
the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item
is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
Backstabber: When you hit a flat-footed creature,
this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its
normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if
the weapon is a +3 weapon.
Backswing: You can use the momentum from a missed
attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack.
After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this
weapon before the end of your turn.
Deadly: On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon
damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the
weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon
has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has
a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater
striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical
hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal
damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.
Disarm: You can use this weapon to Disarm with the
Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses
the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds
the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item
bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to
Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take
the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical
success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.
Dwarf: Dwarves craft and use these weapons.
Elf: Elves craft and use these weapons.
Fatal: The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical
hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size
instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one
additional damage die of the listed size.
Finesse: You can use your Dexterity modifier instead
of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this
melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when
calculating damage.
Forceful: This weapon becomes more dangerous as you
build momentum. When you attack with it more than once
on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus
to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice,
and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to
damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.
Free-Hand: This weapon doesn’t take up your hand,
usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand
weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered
by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform
manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a
free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand
