INCREDIBLE COMPANION
FEAT 10
RANGER
Prerequisites Mature Animal Companion
Your animal companion continues to grow and develop. It
becomes a nimble or savage animal companion (your choice),
gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of
companion (page 214).
MASTER MONSTER HUNTER
FEAT 10
RANGER
Prerequisites master in Nature, Monster Hunter
You have a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of all creatures of
the world. You can use Nature to Recall Knowledge to identify
any creature. In addition, you gain the benefits of Monster
Hunter (and Monster Warden, if you have it) on a success as
well as a critical success.
PENETRATING SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
OPEN
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.
You shoot clear through an intervening creature to hit your
prey. Choose a target that is giving lesser cover to your hunted
prey. Make a single ranged Strike with the required weapon
against the chosen target and your hunted prey. This attack
ignores any lesser cover the chosen target provides your
hunted prey. Roll damage only once, and apply it to each
creature you hit. A Penetrating Shot counts as two attacks for
your multiple attack penalty.
TWIN RIPOSTE [reaction]
FEAT 10
RANGER
Trigger A creature within your reach critically fails a Strike
against you.
Requirements You are benefiting from Twin Parry
A clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to
an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee Strike or use a
Disarm action against the triggering opponent.
WARDEN’S STEP
FEAT 10
RANGER
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You can guide your allies to move quietly through the
wilderness. When you Sneak during exploration in natural
terrain, you can designate any number of your allies to gain
the benefits as if they were using that activity during that
exploration. This requires no action on their part.
12TH LEVEL
DISTRACTING SHOT
FEAT 12
RANGER
The sheer power of your attacks, or the overwhelming number
of them, leaves an enemy flustered. If you critically hit your
hunted prey with a ranged weapon, or hit it at least twice on
the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until the
start of your next turn.
DOUBLE PREY
FEAT 12
RANGER
You can focus on two foes at once, hunting both of them down.
When you use the Hunt Prey action, you can pick two creatures
as your prey.
LIGHTNING SNARES
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites master in Crafting, Snare Specialist
You can rig a trap with incredible speed. When you create a
snare that normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it
using a single Interact action instead.
SECOND STING [one-action]
FEAT 12
PRESS
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a
different hand.
You read your prey’s movements and transform them into
openings, so failures with one weapon set up glancing blows
with the other. Make a melee Strike with one of the required
weapons against your hunted prey. The Strike gains the
following failure effect.
Failure You deal the damage the other required weapon would
have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes
dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, not
just weapon damage dice.)
SIDE BY SIDE
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites an animal companion
You and your animal companion fight in tandem, distracting
your foes and keeping them off balance. Whenever you and
your animal companion are adjacent to the same foe, you are
both flanking that foe with each other, regardless of your
actual positions.
14TH LEVEL
SENSE THE UNSEEN [reaction]
FEAT 14
RANGER
Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you can catch even the slightest
cues, such as their minute movements or the shifting of
air currents on your skin. Even though you failed at the
triggering check, you automatically sense any undetected
creatures in the area where you’re Seeking, making them
merely hidden to you.
SHARED PREY
FEAT 14
RANGER
Prerequisites Double Prey, Warden’s Boon
Hunting as a duo, you and your ally both single out your prey.
When you use Hunt Prey and select only one prey, you can
grant your Hunt Prey benefits and hunter’s edge to an ally
in addition to gaining them yourself. The ally retains these
benefits until you use Hunt Prey again.
