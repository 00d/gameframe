flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must
still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use
the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the
feats’ prerequisites.
Armor Mastery 
17th
Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your
proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored
defense, increase to master.
Versatile Legend 
19th
You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to legendary, and your
proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to master. Your proficiency rank
for your fighter class DC increases to master.
Fighter Feats
At each level that you gain a fighter feat, you can select one of the following feats.
You must satisfy any prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
DOUBLE SLICE [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
You lash out at your foe with both weapons. Make two Strikes, one with each of your two
melee weapons, each using your current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have
the same target. If the second Strike is made with a weapon that doesn’t have the agile trait,
it takes a –2 penalty.
If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects
from both weapons. You add any precision damage only once, to the attack of your choice.
Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once.
This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
EXACTING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
PRESS
You make a controlled attack, fully accounting for your momentum. Make a Strike. The
Strike gains the following failure effect.
Failure This attack does not count toward your multiple attack penalty.
POINT-BLANK SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
OPEN
STANCE
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.
You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while
you are in this stance, you don’t take the penalty to your attack rolls from the volley trait.
When using a ranged weapon that doesn’t have the volley trait, you gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon’s first range increment.
POWER ATTACK [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit
unsteady. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple
attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least
10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to
three extra dice.
