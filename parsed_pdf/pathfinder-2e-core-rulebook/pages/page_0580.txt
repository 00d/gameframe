DRAGONHIDE
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item
normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in
color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came
from. Due to the scales’ resiliency, it can also be used to Craft
armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate,
half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without
metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type,
depending on the type of dragon (see the table below).
Type standard-grade dragonhide object; Level 8; Price 350 gp

MITHRAL
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
Mithral is renowned for its lightness, durability, and
effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and
lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly
lighter hue. Mithral weapons and armor are treated as if
they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with
weakness to silver. A metal item made of mithral is lighter
than one made of iron or steel: the item’s Bulk is reduced by
1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect
on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item
made of this material is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not
its reduced Bulk for being made of mithral, but reduce the
Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size
of the item.

ORICHALCUM
MATERIAL 17+
RARE
 PRECIOUS
The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for
its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery
metal isn’t as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum’s
time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness
and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn’t
destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.

SILVER
MATERIAL 2+
 PRECIOUS
Silver weapons are a bane to creatures ranging from devils to
werewolves. Silver items are less durable than steel items, and
low-grade silver items are usually merely silver-plated.
