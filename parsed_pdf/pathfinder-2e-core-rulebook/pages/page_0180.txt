Rogue
During combat encounters...
You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision
instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against
rank-and-file soldiers.
During social encounters...
Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and
ferreting out information are second nature to you.
While exploring...
You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset,
since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.
In downtime...
You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a
thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own.
You Might...
•	 Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world.
•	 Know where to attain illicit goods.
•	 Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code.
Others Probably...
•	 Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to
trust you.
•	 Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use
questionable methods.
•	 Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.
You are skilled and opportunistic­. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions,
you take advantage of your opponents’ missteps and strike where it hurts
most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and
likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of
every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is
the breadth and depth of your skills.
