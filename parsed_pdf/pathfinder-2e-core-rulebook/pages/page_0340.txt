FLESH TO STONE
SPELL 6
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature made of flesh
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration varies
You try to turn the target’s flesh into stone. The target must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude
save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has
the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition
increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save
reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable
to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the
creature is petrified permanently. The spell ends if the
creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
