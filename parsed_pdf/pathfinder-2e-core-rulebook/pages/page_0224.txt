Champion
You have sworn a solemn oath to your deity, who has
granted you champion powers to aid you in your cause.
Multiclass Champion characters
The champion archetype greatly improves defenses,
particularly armor. It’s a great way for a character to gain
armor proficiency or a powerful defensive reaction.
