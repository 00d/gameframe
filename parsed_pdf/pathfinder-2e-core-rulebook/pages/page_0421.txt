At the heart of the Inner Sea stands the Isle of Kortos,
raised from the waters thousands of years ago as
Aroden’s first deific act. This amazing feat marks the
dawn of the Age of Enthronement and the first year of
the Absalom Reckoning calendar. The city of Absalom
itself, the largest in the Inner Sea region, sprawls on the
southern shore of this isle, and at the city’s heart stands
the legendary Starstone Cathedral. Within the walls of
this structure, the Starstone ever waits to test its next
supplicants—the few mortals who pass this mystic test
become gods themselves. This has made Absalom an
oft-besieged metropolis, but in its nearly 5,000 years, it
has never once fallen.
Absalom, called by many the City at the Center of the
World, boasts a population of over 300,000, and its culture
is a true melting pot in both ancestry and belief. Even the
city’s architecture reflects this, as one might expect of a
settlement of its age. From the towering and majestic
temples of the Ascendant Court to the close-packed
shops and guildhalls of the Petal District and the sagging
shanties in the Puddles, Absalom’s neighborhoods never
fail to present a memorable skyline. Many world-reaching
organizations were born in Absalom, notably the
Pathfinder Society (page 436).
The Isle of Kortos, also known as Starstone Isle, has
a similarly diverse ecosystem. The verdant forests and
grasslands of the west provide many of the resources
Absalom needs, but to the east, the rugged stony desert
known as the Scrape, the dangerous Riven Hills, and
the newly formed necromantic wasteland known as the
Tyrant’s Grasp present far harsher climates. The Isle
of Erran, just north of Starstone Isle, hosts the second-
largest city in the area, Escadar. A rough seaport with
more than its share of shady dealings and dangerous
types, Escadar also hosts large shipyards and maintains
a strong navy that helps to keep the surrounding waters
of the Inner Sea safe. A number of smaller islands also
skirt the coast of the Isle of Kortos—some barren, some
serving as hideouts for criminals and outcasts.
Rising from the center of the Isle of Kortos are the
Kortos Mounts, a short but rugged range of tors that
have, over the years, been ruled by minotaurs, harpies,
dragons, and worse. A few treacherous passes allow
travel through the mountains, but with the northern
shore of the Isle of Kortos being dominated by the soggy
tangles of Dunmire, these northern reaches offer little to
draw anyone other than bandits and adventurers into
these still-untamed lands.
