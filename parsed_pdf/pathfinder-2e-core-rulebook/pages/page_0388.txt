CHAMPION
Cast [reaction] somatic
Trigger An ally is hit by a Strike, or an ally fails a saving throw
against an effect that doesn’t affect you.
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 ally
You form a link with an ally, allowing you to take harm in
their stead. All the effects of the hit or failed save are applied
to you instead of the ally. For example, if the target critically
fails a saving throw against a fireball, you would take double
damage. These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or
other abilities you have that might mitigate them in any way,
although those of the target apply before you take the effect.

you to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become unconscious or dying.

trait or that would leave no remains, such as disintegrate.
