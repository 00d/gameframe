Class Features
You gain these abilities as a barbarian. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at
1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted in at the start of this class.
Rage
You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.
RAGE [one-action]
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
MENTAL
Requirements You aren’t fatigued or raging.
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus
your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute,
until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall
unconscious, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop
raging. While you are raging:
•	 You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and
unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if
your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
•	 You take a –1 penalty to AC.
•	 You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless
they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.
After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary
Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.
Instinct
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you
learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your
instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain
behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances
at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your
instinct. For more information, see Instincts on page 86.
Barbarian Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter,
you gain a barbarian class feat. Barbarian class feats are
described beginning on page 88.
Skill Feats 
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Deny Advantage 
3rd
Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren’t flat-
footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your
level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using
surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
General Feats 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts 
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if
it starts below 18.
