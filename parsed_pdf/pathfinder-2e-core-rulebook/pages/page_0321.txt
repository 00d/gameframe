TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration varies
You transform the target creature into a harmless animal
appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor features of the harmless
animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing
it to be sickened 1. When it recovers from the sickened
condition, its features revert to normal.
Failure The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If
it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original
form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.
Critical Failure The target is transformed into the chosen
harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.

Area 5-foot emanation; Targets enemies in the area
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Targets that
fail their Will saves take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls as
long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn
after you cast bane, you can use a single action, which has
the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5
feet and force enemies in the area that weren’t yet affected
to attempt another saving throw. Bane can counteract bless.

You send the target back to its home plane. The target must

specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and
not from a spell component pouch. This spell fails if you aren’t
on your home plane when you cast it.
Critical Success The target resists being banished and you are
stunned 1.
Success The target resists being banished.
