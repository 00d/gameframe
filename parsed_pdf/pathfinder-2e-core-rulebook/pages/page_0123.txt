REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
a range, increase that spell’s range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if
the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
CLERIC
You study a wider range of simple spells. You can prepare two additional cantrips each day.
COMMUNAL HEALING
FEAT 2
CLERIC
HEALING
POSITIVE
You’re a conduit for positive energy, and as you channel it through you, it heals some of your
minor injuries. When you cast the heal spell to heal a single creature other than yourself,
you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of the heal spell.
EMBLAZON ARMAMENT
FEAT 2
CLERIC
EXPLORATION
Carefully etching a sacred image into a physical object, you steel yourself for battle. You
can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The
symbol doesn’t fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol
you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly
disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine
focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This
benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.
•	 Shield The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce
more damage with the Shield Block reaction.)
•	 Weapon The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.
SAP LIFE
FEAT 2
CLERIC
HEALING
You draw the life force out of your enemies to heal your own wounds. When you cast a
harm spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell
level of your harm spell. If you aren’t a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
TURN UNDEAD
FEAT 2
CLERIC
Undead harmed by your positive energy might flee, compelled by an innate aversion to the
force opposite undeath. When you use a heal spell to damage undead, each undead of your
level or lower that critically fails its save gains the fleeing condition for 1 round.
