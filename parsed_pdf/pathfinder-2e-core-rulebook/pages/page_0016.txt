Judy rolls a 16, adding Kyra’s +8 with Religion to get a
total of 24.
Erik:
At first, you thought this thing might be a
ghoul, which is a type of undead that feasts
on the flesh of the dead, but the terrible smell
reveals the truth. This thing is a ghast, a more
powerful type of ghoul. You are pretty sure
that its stench can make you sick and that its
claws can paralyze you with a touch.
Judy:
This is bad. I am going to spend my last two
actions to cast bless. It gives anyone next to me
a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
Casting this spell is an activity that requires two actions
to complete, and it has two components. The complex
gestures needed to invoke the spell are the somatic
component, and Kyra’s prayers to her deity are the
verbal component.
Erik:
Okay! The ghast leaps from the casket straight
toward Merisiel. The stench of its rotting
body is absolutely horrific up close. Attempt a
Fortitude save!
James rolls an 8, for a total of 14.
Erik:
Not quite enough—you gain the sickened 1
condition, which is going to give you a –1
penalty to most of your d20 rolls. Next, it
lunges at you, trying to bite you!
James:
Oh no! I use my reaction to nimbly dodge out
of the way.
Erik rolls an attack roll for the ghast, getting an 9 on the
die. Looking at the monster’s statistics, he adds 11 for a
total of 20. Merisiel’s AC is normally 19, but the Nimble
Dodge feat lets her use her reaction to increase her AC by 2
against a single attack. In this case, it turns the ghast’s attack
into a miss.
Erik:
Does a 20 hit you?
James:
Nope, just missed!
Erik:
You twist away from the ghast as its tongue
leaves a slimy film on your armor. With its final
action, the undead menace lashes out at you
with its claw.
Erik rolls a second attack with the ghast, this time with its
claw. Normally this attack would take a –5 multiple attack
penalty, but since the claw has the agile trait, the penalty is
only –4. He rolls a 19 on the die, adds 11 for the ghoul’s
attack modifier and subtracts 4, for a total of 26.
Erik:
You may have dodged the ghast’s bite, but the
thing’s bony claw rakes across your face!
Erik knows this is a hit and rolls the ghast’s claw damage,
getting a total of 8.
Erik:
Take 8 points of damage, and I need you to
attempt a Fortitude saving throw as a numbing
sensation spreads from the wound.
James rolls a Fortitude saving throw. He gets a 4 on the
die, and after adding his bonus and the penalty from the
sickened condition, it comes out to only a 9.
James:
This isn’t my day. I don’t suppose a 9 is good
enough?
Erik:
I am afraid not. You are paralyzed!
Erik notes that Merisiel is paralyzed, making her unable
to act, but she will get a new saving throw at the end of
each of her turns to shake off the effect.
Erik:
A dry, creaking laugh escapes the ghast’s curled
lips, but that’s the end of its turn. Valeros, you
are the last one to act this round.
Lyz:
About time, too! I raise my shield and use my
final two actions to make a Sudden Charge!
Sudden Charge is a fighter feat that lets Valeros move up
to twice his Speed and attack at the end of his movement,
all for only two actions.
Erik:
As you draw near, the smell is horrific. Attempt
a Fortitude save.
After rolling, Lyz gets a 19 on the Fortitude save.
Erik:
You fight off the nausea from this thing’s
stench. Make your attack roll.
Lyz rolls the die and it comes up a 20.
Lyz:
I got a 20! That must be a critical success!
Erik:
Your blade hits the vile creature right in the
neck, dealing double damage!
Lyz rolls a 5 on her d8, then adds 4 because of Valeros’s
Strength modifier. Because it is a critical success, she then
doubles the total.
Lyz:
A mighty 18 damage! That surely had to kill it!
Erik:
I’m afraid not. Black ichor runs from the deep
wound on its neck, but it only turns to look at
you. You can see burning hatred in its eyes!
Lyz:
Uh-oh.
That is the end of the first round of combat. The second
round begins immediately after this, using the same
initiative order as before. The fight is far from over…
