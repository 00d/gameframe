Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill
any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the
land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a –10-
foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once
per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within
the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the
concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a
melee unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier. If the
attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and
makes it immobilized for 1 round or until the creature Escapes
(against your spell DC), whichever comes first.

or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of
suggestion (page 374), with the message substituting for
the spoken suggestion. On a successful save, the target is
temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the
