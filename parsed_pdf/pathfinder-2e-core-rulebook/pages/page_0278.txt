Raise a Shield is the action most commonly used with
shields. Most shields must be held in one hand, so you
can’t hold anything with that hand and Raise a Shield. A
buckler, however, doesn’t take up your hand, so you can
Raise a Shield with a buckler if the hand is free (or, at
the GM’s discretion, if it’s holding a simple, lightweight
object that’s not a weapon). You lose the benefits of Raise
a Shield if that hand is no longer free.
When you have a tower shield raised, you can use the
Take Cover action (page 471) to increase the circumstance
bonus to AC to +4. This lasts until the shield is no longer
raised. If you would normally provide lesser cover against
an attack, having your tower shield raised provides
standard cover against it (and other creatures can Take
Cover as normal using the cover from your shield).
If you have access to the Shield Block reaction (from
your class or from a feat), you can use it while Raising
your Shield to reduce the damage you take by an amount
equal to the shield’s Hardness. Both you and the shield
then take any remaining damage.
Shield Statistics
Shields have statistics that follow the same rules as armor:
Price, Speed Penalty, and Bulk. See page 274 for the rules
for those statistics. Their other statistics are described here.
AC Bonus
A shield grants a circumstance bonus to AC, but only
when the shield is raised. This requires using the Raise a
Shield action, found on page 472.
Hardness
Whenever a shield takes damage, the amount of damage it
takes is reduced by this amount. This number is particularly
relevant for shields because of the Shield Block feat
(page 266). The rules for Hardness appear on page 272.

1  Gaining a shield’s circumstance bonus to AC requires using the Raise a Shield action (found on page 472).
2 Getting the higher bonus for a tower shield requires using the Take Cover action (page 471) while the shield is raised.
HP (BT)
This column lists the shield’s Hit Points (HP) and Broken
Threshold (BT). These measure how much damage the
shield can take before it’s destroyed (its total HP) and how
much it can take before being broken and unusable (its BT).
These matter primarily for the Shield Block reaction.
Attacking with a Shield
A shield can be used as a martial weapon for attacks,
using the statistics listed for a shield bash on Table 6–7:
Melee Weapons (page 280). The shield bash is an option
only for shields that weren’t designed to be used as
weapons. A shield can’t have runes added to it. You can
also buy and attach a shield boss or shield spikes to a
shield to make it a more practical weapon. These can be
found on Table 6–7. These work like other weapons and
can even be etched with runes.
Shield Descriptions
Each type of shield is described in more detail below.
Buckler: This very small shield is a favorite of duelists
and quick, lightly armored warriors. It’s typically made of
steel and strapped to your forearm. You can Raise a Shield
with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or
are holding a light object that’s not a weapon in that hand.
Wooden Shield: Though they come in a variety of shapes
and sizes, the protection offered by wooden shields comes
from the stoutness of their materials. While wooden shields
are less expensive than steel shields, they break more easily.
Steel Shield: Like wooden shields, steel shields come
in a variety of shapes and sizes. Though more expensive
than wooden shields, they are much more durable.
Tower Shield: These massive shields can be used to
provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size,
they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.
Shields
A shield can increase your character’s defense beyond the protection their armor provides.
Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its
bonus to AC only if they use an action to Raise a Shield. This action grants the shield’s bonus
to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. A shield’s Speed penalty applies
whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.
