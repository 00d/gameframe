2ND LEVEL
POISON RESISTANCE
FEAT 2
ALCHEMIST
Repeated exposure to toxic reagents has fortified your body
against poisons of all kinds. You gain poison resistance equal
to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving
throws against poisons.
REVIVIFYING MUTAGEN
FEAT 2
ALCHEMIST
While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that
mutagen’s power to heal yourself. This uses a single action,
which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Once the
action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2
item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen’s
duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of
Persistent Mutagen.
SMOKE BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 2
ADDITIVE 1
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb with
a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.
You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in
addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates
a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which
corner of the target’s space (or the space in which the bomb
lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have
the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed
to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a
strong wind.
4TH LEVEL
CALCULATED SPLASH
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb’s
splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash
trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the
normal amount.
EFFICIENT ALCHEMY
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
Thanks to the time you’ve spent studying and experimenting,
you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches
that don’t require any additional attention. When spending
downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice
as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending
additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating
elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch
using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the
amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients
needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of
progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also
does not change the number of items you can create in a batch
using advanced alchemy.
