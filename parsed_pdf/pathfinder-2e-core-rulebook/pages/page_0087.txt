Greater Weapon Specialization 
15th
The weapons you’ve mastered become truly fearsome in
your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization
increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if
you’re legendary. You gain a greater benefit from your
instinct’s specialization ability.
Indomitable Will 
15th
Your rage makes it difficult to control you. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Heightened Senses 
17th
Your instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.
Quick Rage 
17th
You recover from your Rage quickly, and are soon ready
to begin anew. After you spend a full turn without raging,
you can Rage again without needing to wait 1 minute.
Armor of Fury 
19th
Your training and rage deepen your connection to your
armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium
armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.
Devastator 
19th
Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care about
resistance, and your barbarian abilities are unparalleled.
Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC
increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore 10 points
of a creature’s resistance to their physical damage.
Instincts
You channel your rage through an instinct. You decide
what your instinct means to you. It could be a creature or
symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source
or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage,
or state of mind. Each instinct grants an instinct ability,
plus more abilities you can gain via instinct feats. It also
determines what damage you resist with raging resistance
and, at higher levels, increases the additional damage you
deal when you Rage.
Each instinct lists acts that are anathema to it.
Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct’s
abilities and any instinct feats until you spend 1 day of
downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of
your other barbarian abilities.
Animal Instinct
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage,
granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that
revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise
to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at
war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your
personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf
or another werecreature. Select an animal from Table 3–3:
Animal Instincts that best matches your chosen animal.

Anathema
Flagrantly disrespecting an animal of your chosen kind is
anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.
Bestial Rage (Instinct Ability)
When you Rage, you gain your chosen animal’s unarmed
attack (or attacks). The specific attack gained, the damage it
deals, and its traits are listed on Table 3–3: Animal Instincts.
These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action
gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.
Specialization Ability
Increase the damage die size for the unarmed attacks
granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the
additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for your chosen
animal’s unarmed attacks. The frog’s tongue attack and
deer’s antler attack gain reach 10 feet. If you have greater
weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage
from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks.
Raging Resistance
You resist piercing and slashing damage.
Dragon Instinct
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest
incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic
majesty, or you gained your connection by drinking or
bathing in dragon’s blood or after watching a marauding
wyrm burn your village. Select a type of dragon from Table
3–4: Dragon Instincts to be your instinct’s dragon type.
Chromatic dragons tend to be evil, and metallic dragons
tend to be good.
