SQUEEZE
EXPLORATION
MOVE
You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you
can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small
spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain (page 475) that
you can move through more quickly and without a check.
Critical Success You squeeze through the tight space in
1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
Success You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
Critical Failure You become stuck in the tight space. While
you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another
Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that
check other than a critical failure causes you
to become unstuck.
Sample Squeeze Tasks
Trained space barely fitting your
shoulders
Master space barely fitting your head
Arcana (Int)
Arcana measures how much you know about arcane
magic and creatures. Even if you’re untrained, you can
Recall Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about arcane theories; magic
traditions; creatures of arcane significance (like
dragons and beasts); and the Elemental, Astral,
and Shadow Planes.
Arcana Trained ACTIONS
You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
•	 Decipher Writing about arcane theory.
•	 Identify Magic, particularly arcane magic.
•	 Learn a Spell from the arcane tradition.
BORROW AN ARCANE SPELL
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook,
you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s
spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the
spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning
the Spell.
Success You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal
spell preparation.
Failure You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot
remains available for you to prepare a different
spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell
until the next time you prepare spells.
Athletics (Str)
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical
prowess. When you use the Escape basic action (page
470), you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your
unarmed attack modifier.
CLIMB [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have both hands free.
You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it’s
particularly easy, you must attempt an Athletics check. The
GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and
