Alchemical Bombs
An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical
components that explode when the bomb hits a creature
or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though
some produce other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait.
Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you
make a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as
you would for any other weapon. It takes one hand to
draw, prepare, and throw a bomb. Due to the complexity
involved in preparing bombs, Strikes to throw alchemical
bombs gain the manipulate trait. The bomb is activated
when thrown as a Strike—you don’t have to activate
it separately.
Splash Trait
Most bombs also have the splash trait. When you use a
thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your
Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a
splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all
creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target)
take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical
failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage.
Add splash damage together with the initial damage against
the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness.
You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.
For example, if you threw a lesser acid flask and hit
your target, that creature would take 1d6 persistent acid
damage and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures
within 5 feet of it would take 1 acid splash damage. On
a critical hit, the target would take 2d6 persistent acid
damage, but the splash damage would still be 1. If you
missed, the target would take 1 splash damage. If you
critically failed, no one would take any damage.
