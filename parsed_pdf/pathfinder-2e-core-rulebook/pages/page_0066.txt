Your ancestry entry states which languages you know at
1st level. Typically, this means you can both speak and read
these languages. Having a positive Intelligence modifier
grants a number of additional languages equal to your
Intelligence modifier. You can choose these languages
from the list presented in your character’s ancestry entry
and from those available from your region or ethnicity.
Ask your GM if there’s a language you want to select that
isn’t on these lists. If your Intelligence changes later on,
you adjust your number of languages accordingly.
The languages presented here are grouped according to
how common they are throughout the Inner Sea region.
Languages that are common are regularly encountered in
most places, even among those who aren’t native speakers.
Languages that are uncommon (see Table 2–2 and Regional
Languages) are most frequently spoken by native speakers,
but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others
interested in the associated cultures.
Druidic is a secret language, and is available only to
characters who are druids. In fact, druids are prohibited
from teaching the language to non-druids (described
further in Anathema on page 130).
It is possible for your character to learn languages later
in their adventuring career. Selecting the Multilingual feat,
for example, grants a character two new languages chosen
from those listed in Table 2–1: Common Languages and
Table 2–2: Uncommon Languages. Other abilities and
effects might grant access to common or uncommon
languages, as detailed in their descriptions.

Regional Languages
Regional languages depend on the game world you’re
playing in. Chapter 8: The Age of Lost Omens lists the
regional languages of the Pathfinder world and where
they’re spoken (page 432). These languages are uncommon.
Most characters learn the Common language. This is
the most widely used language in the region where the
campaign takes place. In the Inner Sea region of Golarion,
the Common tongue is Taldane, for example. Characters
with Common might face a language barrier if they travel
somewhere with a different Common language.
Sign Language
and Reading Lips
The language entry for most characters lists languages they
use to communicate in spoken words. However, you might
know the signed version of a language or know how to read
lips. You can learn these by taking the Sign Language and
Read Lips skill feats. If you are creating a character who is
deaf, hard of hearing, or unable to speak, discuss with your
GM whether it makes sense for your character to know sign
languages or lip reading. If so, your GM might allow you to
select one of these feats for free (even if you don’t meet the
prerequisites) to represent your character concept.
Languages
The people of the Inner Sea region speak dozens of different languages, along with
hundreds of dialects and regional variations. While a character can generally get by
with Taldane, also known as Common, knowing another language is vital in some
regions. Being able to speak these tongues can help you with negotiation, spying
on enemies, or just conducting simple commerce. Languages also afford you the
chance to contextualize your character in the world and give meaning to your other
character choices.
