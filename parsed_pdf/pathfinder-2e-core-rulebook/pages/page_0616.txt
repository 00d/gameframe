RING OF WIZARDRY
ITEM 7+
UNCOMMON
 ARCANE
 DIVINATION
 INVESTED
Usage worn; Bulk —
This ring is made from the purest platinum and
is covered in esoteric arcane symbols. It does
nothing unless you have a spellcasting class feature
with the arcane tradition. While wearing the ring of
wizardry, you gain a +1 item bonus to Arcana checks and
have two additional 1st-level arcane spell slots each day. You
prepare spells in these slots or cast from them spontaneously,
just as you normally cast your spells.
If you take off the ring for any reason, you lose the
additional spell slots. You can’t gain spell slots from more
than one ring of wizardry per day, nor can a single
ring of wizardry grant spell slots more than once
per day.
If you can cast arcane spells in a variety of
different ways (such as if you are a draconic
bloodline sorcerer with the wizard multiclass
archetype), you can divide the spell slots as you
wish among your various sources of arcane spells.
Type I; Level 7; Price 360 gp
Type II; Level 10; Price 1,000 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 2nd-level spell slots
and one 1st-level spell slot.
Type III; Level 12; Price 2,000 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 3rd-level spell slots
and one 2nd-level spell slot.
Type IV; Level 14; Price 4,500 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 4th-level spell slots
and one 3rd-level spell slot.
Craft Requirements You have a spellcasting class feature with
the arcane tradition.
ROBE OF EYES
ITEM 17
UNCOMMON
 DIVINATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 13,000 gp
Usage worn garment; Bulk 1
This garment appears to be an ordinary robe until donned, at
which point numerous strange and alien eyes of varied shapes
and colors open and blink across its fabric. While wearing the
robe, you gain a +3 item bonus to Perception checks, and
you constantly benefit from the effects of a 2nd-level see
invisibility spell.
You can also see powerful magic auras. The highest-level
magic aura within 30 feet of you glows in a color that reveals
its school to you and allows you to determine where the effect
originates. This can narrow down the origin point of the effect
to a 5-foot-cube, but not more precisely than that.
