DEATH
EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MENTAL
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy
or sorrow. Once targeted, the creature becomes temporarily
immune for 1 minute. The effect of the spell depends on the
target’s level and current Hit Points.
16th or Lower The target dies instantly.
17th If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly;
otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes dying 1.
18th or Higher The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to
0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.

COMPOSITION
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range touch
Duration 1 round
You mime creating an invisible 10-foot-by-10-foot stretch of
wall adjacent to you and within your reach. The wall is solid
to those creatures that don’t disbelieve it, even incorporeal
creatures. You and your allies can voluntarily believe the wall
exists to continue to treat it as solid, for instance to climb
onto it. A creature that disbelieves the illusion is temporarily
immune to your house of imaginary walls for 1 minute. The
wall doesn’t block creatures that didn’t see your visual
performance, nor does it block objects. The wall has AC 10,
Hardness equal to double the spell’s level, and HP equal to
quadruple the spell’s level.
INSPIRE COMPETENCE
CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON
BARD
CANTRIP
COMPOSITION EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MENTAL
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 ally
Duration 1 round
Your encouragement inspires your ally to succeed at a task.
This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to
Aid your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the
circumstances. When you later use the Aid reaction, you can
roll Performance instead of the normal skill check, and if you
roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are legendary in
Performance, you automatically critically succeed.
The GM might rule that you can’t use this ability if the act
of encouraging your ally would interfere with the skill check
(such as a check to Sneak quietly or maintain a disguise).
