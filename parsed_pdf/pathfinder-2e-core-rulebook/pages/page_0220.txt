Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats
instead of class feats. Start by finding the archetype that
best fits your character concept, and select the archetype’s
dedication feat using one of your class feat choices. Once
you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from
that archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet its
prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still subject
to any selection restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For
example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted
you a 4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could
swap out that class feat only for an archetype feat of 4th
level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you
gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you
select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy
its requirements before you can gain another dedication
feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat
by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s
list. You cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you
have any other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another feat,
such as the alchemist’s basic concoction. You must always
meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way.
Two special kinds of archetypes are designated by the
class and multiclass traits. The archetypes in this book
are all multiclass archetypes.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t
select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are
a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
fighter can’t select the Fighter Dedication feat).
Class Archetypes
Archetypes with the class trait represent a fundamental
divergence from your class’s specialties, but one that exists
within the context of your class. You can select a class
archetype only if you are a member of the class of the same
name. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a
class’s static class features, in addition to any new feats they
offer. It may be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level
if it alters or replaces some of the class’s initial class features.
In that case, you must take that archetype’s dedication feat
at 2nd level, and after that you proceed normally. You can
never have more than one class archetype.
Spellcasting Archetypes
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of
spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character
from a spellcasting class. In this book, the spellcasting
archetypes are bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and
wizard, the multiclass archetypes for the five main
spellcasting classes, but future books might introduce
spellcasting archetypes that aren’t multiclass archetypes.
A spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls,
staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a
spellcasting class can.
Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to
cast cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a
basic spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and
a master spellcasting feat. These feats share their name
with the archetype; for instance, the wizard’s master
spellcasting feat is called Master Wizard Spellcasting.
All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes
have restrictions depending on the archetype; for
instance, the bard archetype grants you spell slots
you can use only to cast occult spells from your bard
repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with occult spells
in your sorcerer repertoire.
Basic Spellcasting Feat: Available at 4th level, these feats
grant a 1st-level spell slot. At 6th level, they grant you a
2nd‑level spell slot. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd-
level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“basic spellcasting benefits.”
Expert Spellcasting Feat: Taken at 12th level, these feats
make you an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the
appropriate magical tradition and grant you a 4th-level
spell slot. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-level spell
slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-level spell
slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “expert
spellcasting benefits.”
Master Spellcasting Feat: Upon reaching 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and
DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you
a 7th-level spell slot. At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-
level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“master spellcasting benefits.”
Archetypes
There are infinite possible character concepts, but you might find that the feats and skill
choices from a single class aren’t sufficient to fully realize your character. Archetypes allow
you to expand the scope of your character’s class.
