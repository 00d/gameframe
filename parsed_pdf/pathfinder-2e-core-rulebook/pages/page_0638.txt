splash (trait) When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add
your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails,
succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including
the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure),
the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together
with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses
or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit. 544

stance (trait) A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an
action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts
until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the
encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you
use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can
enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

or more is even better—a critical success. If a stat block has no success entry, that
means there is no effect on a success. 445–446
suffocation 478
summoned (trait) A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the
summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create
things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to
cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers
the summoning magic, causing the summoned creature’s spell to fail and the
summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard
abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of
its abilities. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but
the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses
its 2 actions for that turn. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells
and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the
spell that called them ends.
