You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend
against. You reduce the spell’s level by 1, and targets of the
spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks,
AC, or DC against it.
You can’t reduce the spell’s level below its minimum. For

a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level. Targets still gain
all the other benefits, even if you don’t reduce the spell’s level.
