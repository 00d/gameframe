SORCERER
You are confident in your spellcasting technique, and you

action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action
isn’t disrupted.

Your magical blood makes you more resistant to magic. You
gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against spells and
magical effects.
CROSSBLOODED EVOLUTION
FEAT 8
SORCERER
Odd interactions in your bloodline provide you with
unexpected spells. You can have one spell in your spell
repertoire from a tradition other than the one that matches
your bloodline. You cast that spell as a spell from your
bloodline’s tradition. You can swap which spell you add and
from which tradition as you could any other sorcerer spell, but
you can’t have more than one spell from another tradition in
your spell repertoire at the same time using this feat.

OVERWHELMING ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 10
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You alter your spells to overcome resistances. If the next
action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount
of the target’s resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic
damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the
spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused
by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by
wall of fire. A creature’s immunities are unaffected.
DEMONBLOOD
The grotesque and chaotic creatures of the Abyss left
their mark on your family’s bloodline. You have a
vicious streak and find wanton destruction thrilling.
ABILITY SCORES
Your Charisma is most important, and boosting Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution make you a better combatant.
