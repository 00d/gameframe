Alchemist
Page 70
The alchemist uses their skill at crafting
to create alchemical items—such as
bombs, elixirs, and poisons—that they
use to defeat foes and aid allies. Smart
and resourceful, an alchemist often has
just the right tool for the job and esoteric
knowledge to help their friends get out of a jam.
Barbarian
Page 82
The barbarian is a fearsome embodiment
of rage, focusing the deadly power
of their anger against anyone who
stands in their way. A barbarian is
quick to enter battle and, once their fury
has been unleashed, is immensely strong,
often unpredictable, and nearly unstoppable.
Bard
Page 94
An artist and a scholar, the bard uses
performance and esoteric learning to
bolster their companions and foil their
enemies. Sometimes sneaky and quite
often charming, the bard adventures
with pizzazz and talent backed up by
an impressive repertoire of occult magic.
Champion
Page 104
A defender of good who straps on
armor and wields a righteous weapon,
the champion protects the innocent
and vanquishes evil. Steadfast in their
beliefs, and devoted to both a deity and
an aspect of good, they follow a strict code
as they fight to make the world a better place.
Cleric
Page 116
The cleric is dedicated to the
worship of a single deity and draws
divine magic from this devotion.
Clerics
can
be
vastly
different
depending on who they worship, and
whether they’re cloistered clerics who
pursue one of their deity’s domains or war
priests who serve as the sword arm of their god.
Druid
Page 128
The druid walks the wild, primordial
places of the world without fear,
harnessing the primal magic of nature
and controlling it with calm purpose.
A devotee of the wilderness, the druid
finds nourishment in its power, allies
among its creatures, and strength in its fury.
Fighter
Page 140
With calculated daring and fearless
determination, the fighter tracks down
and confronts their enemies while
defending allies from harm. A master
of the battlefield, the fighter is quick to
exploit opportunities and strike any who
stumble within reach of their sword or bow.
Monk
Page 154
The monk seeks perfection in all things,
and that includes transforming their
body into the perfect weapon. They
can be walking with calm purpose
and
contemplating
the
subtleties
of existence in one minute and then
transform into a blur of deadly blows in the next.
Ranger
Page 166
Resourceful and cunning, the ranger
is a hunter, tracker, and warrior who
preserves the natural world and
protects civilization from its ravages.
Whether they use a bow, crossbow,
a pair of weapons, or snares, the ranger
is a fearsome enemy and great ally in the wild.
Rogue
Page 178
Cunning and quick, the rogue brings
skill and expertise few of their comrades
can match. In battle, they excel at
sneak attacks and ambushes. Their
racket gives them the tools they need
to get the job done, and their wide array of
skill choices lets them specialize as they see fit.
Sorcerer
Page 190
The intense magic the sorcerer
commands
comes
from
neither
study nor worship—it comes from
their blood. Their magical abilities
depend on whether they have the
blood of dragons, angels, fey, aberrant
creatures, or some other being flowing
through their veins and powering their spells.
Wizard
Page 202
The wizard is the arcane master of
spellcasting, plucking incredible power
from reality through complicated
spell formulas. They stride with
confidence, without a need for armor
or weapons, enacting their will upon the
world and bringing woe upon their enemies.
