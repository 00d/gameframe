character don’t know what the effect is, such as if your
character is unconscious, you still decide if you’re willing.
Some effects target or require an ally, or otherwise
refer to an ally. This must be someone on your side, often
another PC, but it might be a bystander you are trying to
protect. You are not your own ally. If it isn’t clear, the GM
decides who counts as an ally or an enemy.
Areas
Some effects occupy an area of a specified shape and size.
An area effect always has a point of origin and extends out
from that point. There are four types of areas: emanations,
bursts, cones, and lines. When you’re playing in encounter
mode and using a grid, areas are measured in the same
way as movement (page 463), but areas’ distances are
never reduced or affected by difficult terrain (page 475) or
lesser cover (page 476). You can use the diagrams below
as common reference templates for areas, rather than
measuring squares each time. Many area effects describe
only the effects on creatures in the area. The GM determines
any effects to the environment and unattended objects.
Burst
A burst effect issues forth in all directions from a single
