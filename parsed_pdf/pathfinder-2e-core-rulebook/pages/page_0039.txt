Elf
As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can
come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving the world in ancient times, they
returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most
notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves
are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among
themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on
living up to these ideals.

Others Probably...
• Focus on your appearance, either admiring
your grace or treating you as if you’re
physically fragile.
•	Assume you practice archery, cast
spells, fight demons, and have perfected
one or more fine arts.
Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect,
and mysterious charm in a way that is practically
magnetic to members of other ancestries. They
are often voraciously intellectual, though their
studies delve into a level of detail
that most shorter-lived peoples
find excessive or inefficient.
Valuing kindness and beauty,
elves ever strive to improve
their manners, appearance,
and culture.
Elves are often rather
private people, steeped in
the secrets of their groves and
kinship groups. They’re slow to
build friendships outside their
kinsfolk, but for a specific reason:
they subtly and deeply attune
to their environment and their
companions. There’s a physical
element to this attunement, but
it
isn’t
only
superficial.
Elves

lives
among
shorter‑lived peoples often develop
a skewed perception of their own
mortality and tend to become
morose after watching generation

the Forlorn.
If you want a character who is
magical, mystical, and mysterious,
you should play an elf.
You Might...
•	 Carefully
curate
your
relationships with people
with shorter lifespans, either
keeping a careful emotional
distance or resigning yourself
to outliving them.
•	 Adopt specialized or obscure interests
simply for the sake of mastering them.
•	 Have features such as eye color, skin tone,
• Worry that you privately look down on
them, or feel like you’re condescending
and aloof.
Physical Description
While generally taller than humans, elves
possess a fragile grace, accentuated by
long features and sharply pointed ears.
Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped,
featuring large and vibrant-colored
pupils that make up the entire visible
portion of the eye. These pupils give
them an alien look and allow them to see
sharply even in very little light.
Elves

to
their
environment and their companions,
and they often take on physical traits
reflecting their surroundings. An elf who
has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries,
for example, might exhibit verdant hair and
gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a
desert might have golden pupils and skin.
