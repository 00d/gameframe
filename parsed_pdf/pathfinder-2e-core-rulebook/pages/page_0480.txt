Much of exploration mode involves movement and
roleplaying. You might be traveling from one town to
another, chatting with a couple of merchants an outpost
along the way, or maybe having a terse conversation with
the watchful city guards at your destination. Instead of
measuring your rate of movement in 5-foot squares every
round, you measure it in feet or miles per minute, hour,
or day, using your travel speed. Rather than deciding on
each action every turn, you’ll engage in an exploration
activity, and you’ll typically spend some time every day
resting and making your daily preparations.
Travel Speed
Depending on how the GM tracks movement, you move
in feet or miles based on your character’s Speed with the
relevant movement type. Typical rates are on the table below.

The rates in Table 9–2 assume traveling over flat and clear
terrain at a determined pace, but one that’s not exhausting.
Moving through difficult terrain halves the listed movement
rate. Greater difficult terrain reduces the distance traveled to
one-third the listed amount. If the travel requires a skill check
to accomplish, such as mountain climbing or swimming, the
GM might call for a check once per hour using the result
and the table above to determine your progress.
Exploration Activities
While you’re traveling and exploring, tell the GM what
you’d generally like to do along the way. If you to do
nothing more than make steady progress toward your
goal, you move at the full travel speeds given in Table 9–2.
When you want to do something other than simply
travel, you describe what you are attempting to do. It
isn’t necessary to go into extreme detail, such as “Using
my dagger, I nudge the door so I can check for devious
traps.” Instead, “I’m searching the area for hazards” is
sufficient. The GM finds the best exploration activity to
match your description and describes the effects of that
activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast you
can travel and be effective.
These are most common exploration activities.
AVOID NOTICE
 EXPLORATION
You attempt a Stealth check to avoid notice while traveling
at half speed. If you have the Swift Sneak feat, you can move
at full Speed rather than half, but you still can’t use another
exploration activity while you do so. If you have the Legendary
Sneak feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second
exploration activity. If you’re Avoiding Notice at the start of
an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a
Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see
if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as
normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).
DEFEND
EXPLORATION
You move at half your travel speed with your shield raised. If
combat breaks out, you gain the benefits of Raising a Shield
before your first turn begins.
DETECT MAGIC
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
You cast detect magic at regular intervals. You move at half
your travel speed or slower. You have no chance of accidentally
overlooking a magic aura at a travel speed up to 300 feet per
minute, but must be traveling no more than 150 feet per minute
to detect magic auras before the party moves into them.
FOLLOW THE EXPERT
AUDITORY
 CONCENTRATE
 EXPLORATION
 VISUAL
Choose an ally attempting a recurring skill check while exploring,
such as climbing, or performing a different exploration tactic
that requires a skill check (like Avoiding Notice). The ally must
be at least an expert in that skill and must be willing to provide
assistance. While Following the Expert, you match their tactic
or attempt similar skill checks. Thanks to your ally’s assistance,
you can add your level as a proficiency bonus to the associated
skill check, even if you’re untrained. Additionally, you gain
a circumstance bonus to your skill check based on your ally’s
proficiency (+2 for expert, +3 for master, and +4 for legendary).
Exploration Mode
While encounters use rounds for combat, exploration is more free form. The GM determines
the flow of time, as you could be traveling by horseback across craggy highlands, negotiating
with merchants, or delving in a dungeon in search of danger and treasure. Exploration lacks
the immediate danger of encounter mode, but it offers its own challenges.
