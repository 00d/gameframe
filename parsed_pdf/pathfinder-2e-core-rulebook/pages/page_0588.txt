Specific Shields

from their typical counterparts.
ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD
ITEM 11
ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 1,350 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This wooden shield (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) is carved with
images of overlapping fletched arrows.
Activate [reaction] Interact; Trigger A ranged weapon Strike targets
a creature within 15 feet of you when you have this shield
raised, and the attacker has not yet rolled their attack; Effect
The triggering Strike targets you instead of its normal target.
If it hits, you gain the effects of the Shield Block reaction.
DRAGONSLAYER’S SHIELD
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
 ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 670 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
A dragonslayer’s shield is a steel shield covered with
dragonhide from a certain type of dragon, which distinguishes
each shield from the others. While raised, this steel shield
(Hardness 8, HP 32, BT 16) grants its circumstance bonus to
Reflex saves against area effects (as well as to AC, as normal).
While you hold the shield, it also grants you a +2 circumstance
bonus to Will saves against a dragon’s frightful presence
ability. The shield has resistance 10 against the damage type
corresponding to the type of dragon whose hide was used in
its creation (see dragonhide on page 579); this applies after
reducing the damage for Hardness, so when you use Shield
Block, the dragonslayer’s shield takes 18 less damage from
attacks of that damage type. You can use Shield Block against
attacks that deal damage of that type.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include at
least 30 gp of dragonhide.
FLOATING SHIELD
ITEM 11+
UNCOMMON
 MAGICAL
Usage strapped to 1 hand; Bulk L
A floating shield is usually carved with wing motifs. This
buckler (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) can protect you on its own.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect The
shield magically releases itself and floats off your arm into
the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as
if you had Raised the Shield. Because you’re not wielding the
shield, you can’t use reactions such as Shield Block with the
shield, but you gain its benefits even when using both of your
hands. After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending
its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can
Interact to grasp it, ending its floating effect early.
Type floating shield; Level 11; Price 1,250 gp
Type greater floating shield; Level 16; Price 9,000 gp
You can activate the shield any number of times per day.
