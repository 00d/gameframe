Shields
All magic shields are specific items with a wide variety
of protective effects, as described in their entries. Unlike
magic armor, magic shields can’t be etched with runes.
Precious Material Shields
Shields made of precious materials are more expensive
and have different durabilities. You can make bucklers
and most shields out of any of these precious materials,
but only darkwood can be used to make tower shields.
