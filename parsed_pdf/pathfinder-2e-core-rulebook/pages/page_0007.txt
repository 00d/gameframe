With a haunting moan, shambling bodies rose up from the forgotten
battlefield. Given foul unlife by the necromancy of the Whispering
Tyrant, the corpses still wore the tattered raiment of their former

when he returned, and they were the first to fall in his rebirth.
“Aroden is dead!” Valeros spat out the dead god’s name like a
curse as he drew his sword and readied his battered shield. “He’s
not coming back to save us this time.” Kyra and Merisiel shared his
