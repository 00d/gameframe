Hirelings
Paid laborers can provide services for you. Unskilled
hirelings can perform simple manual labor and are
untrained at most skills. Skilled hirelings have expert
proficiency in a particular skill. Hirelings are level 0. If
a skill check is needed, an untrained hireling has a +0
modifier, while a skilled hireling has a +4 modifier in their
area of expertise and +0 for other skill checks. Hirelings’
rates double if they’re going adventuring with you.
Transportation
The cost to hire transportation includes standard travel
with no amenities. Most transit services provide basic
sleeping arrangements, and some provide meals at the
rates listed on Table 6–14. Arranging transportation into
dangerous lands can be more expensive or impossible.
Spellcasting
Spellcasting services, listed on Table 6–15, are uncommon.
Having a spell cast for you requires finding a spellcaster
who knows and is willing to cast it. It’s hard to find
someone who can cast higher-level spells, and uncommon
spells typically cost at least 100% more, if you can find
someone who knows them at all. Spells that take a long
time to cast (over 1 minute) usually cost 25% more. You
must pay any cost listed in the spell in addition to the
Price on the table.

Animals
The Prices for animals are listed both for renting and for
purchasing them outright. You usually need to pay for
animal rentals up front, and if the vendor believes the
animal might be put in danger, they typically require a
deposit equal to the purchase Price. Most animals panic
in battle. When combat begins, they become frightened
4 and fleeing as long as they’re frightened. If you
successfully Command your Animal using Nature (page
249), you can keep it from fleeing, though this doesn’t
remove its frightened condition. If the animal is attacked
or damaged, it returns to frightened 4 and fleeing, with
the same exceptions.
Warhorses and warponies are combat trained. They
don’t become frightened or fleeing during encounters in
this way.
Statistics for the animals appear in the Pathfinder Bestiary.
