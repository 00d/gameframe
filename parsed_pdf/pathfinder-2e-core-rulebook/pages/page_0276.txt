MATERIALS
Most suits of armor and weapons are made from ordinary,
commonly available materials like iron, leather, steel, and
wood. If you’re not sure what a suit of armor is made of,
the GM determines the details.
Some armor, shields, and weapons are instead
made of precious materials. These often have inherent
supernatural properties. Cold iron, for example, which
harms fey, and silver can damage werecreatures. These
materials are detailed beginning on page 577.
Comfort: The armor is so comfortable that you can
rest normally while wearing it.
Flexible: The armor is flexible enough that it doesn’t
hinder most actions. You don’t apply its check penalty to
Acrobatics or Athletics checks.
Noisy: This armor is loud and likely to alert others
to your presence when you’re using the Avoid Notice
exploration activity (page 479).
Armor Specialization Effects
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits
with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization
effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group
your armor belongs to, as listed below. Only medium and
heavy armors have armor specialization effects.
Chain: The armor is so flexible it can bend with a
critical hit and absorb some of the blow. Reduce the
damage from critical hits by either 4 + the value of the
armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 6 + the value
of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor. This can’t
reduce the damage to less than the damage rolled for the
hit before doubling for a critical hit.
Composite: The numerous overlapping pieces of
this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain
resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of the
armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value
of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
Leather: The thick second skin of the armor disperses
blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain
resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value
of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the
value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
Plate: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a
cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage
equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for
medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency
rune for heavy armor.
Armor Descriptions
Each type of armor is described in more detail below.
Breastplate: Though referred to as a breastplate,
this type of armor consists of several pieces of plate
or half‑plate armor (page 276) that protect the torso,
chest, neck, and sometimes the hips and lower legs. It
strategically grants some of the protection of plate while
allowing greater flexibility and speed.
Chain Mail: A suit of chain mail consists of several
pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked
together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain
shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively
protecting most of the body.
Chain Shirt: Sometimes called a hauberk, this is a long
shirt constructed of the same metal rings as chainmail.
However, it is much lighter than chainmail and protects
only the torso, upper arms, and upper legs of its wearer.
