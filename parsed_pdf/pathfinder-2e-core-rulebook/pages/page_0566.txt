Varying Statistics
Table 11–3 indicates the item level and Price of a
scroll, both of which are based on the level of the spell
contained on the scroll. Any costs to Cast the Spell are
added to the scroll’s Price when the scroll is crafted, so
a scroll containing a spell with a Cost entry will have a
higher Price than what appears on the table. The scroll’s
rarity matches the spell’s rarity.
The traits for a scroll vary based on the spell it contains.
A scroll always has the consumable, magical, and scroll
traits, plus the traits of the spell stored on it.

Crafting a Scroll
The process to Craft a scroll is much like that to Craft any
other magic item. When you begin the crafting process,
choose a spell to put into the
scroll. You have to either Cast
that Spell during the crafting
process, or someone else must
do so in your presence. Casting
that Spell doesn’t produce its normal
effects; instead, the magic is trapped
inside the scroll. The casting must come
from a spellcaster expending a spell slot.
You can’t Craft a scroll from a spell
produced from another magic item, for
example. The caster has to provide any
cost of the spell.
Like other consumables, scrolls can be crafted
in batches of four. All scrolls of one batch must
contain the same spell at the same level, and you
must provide one casting for each scroll crafted.
Sample Scrolls
A wide variety of spells can appear on scrolls. The
following specific scrolls are just examples.

Talismans
An item with the talisman trait is a magical charm, gem,
stone, or other small object affixed to armor, a shield, or
a weapon (called the affixed item). Each talisman holds a
sliver of combat knowledge or magical energy that can be
unleashed for a momentary boost of power or enhanced
ability. Many talismans can be activated as a free action
when you use a particular action or activity. A talisman is
a consumable item and has the talisman trait.
You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a
talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns
out permanently, usually crumbling into a fine dust.
Affixing a Talisman
Each talisman’s stat block indicates the type of item it
can be affixed to. Affixing or removing requires using
the Affix a Talisman activity. A single talisman can be
affixed to only one item at a time, and an
item can have only one talisman affixed to
it at a time.

You spend 10 minutes affixing a talisman to an

using the repair kit with both hands. You can
also use this activity to remove a talisman. If
more than one talisman is affixed to an item,
the talismans are suppressed; none of them
can be activated.
