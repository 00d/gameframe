a cause. It can be to attain an item, claim a patch of land,
slay a creature, war with a group, or be entirely peaceful.
Your cause can’t force the targets to harm one another or
themselves. The targets become completely dedicated to
that cause, depending on their levels. They choose their
own actions, but they favor direct action over inaction or
indirect action.
•	 13th or Lower The target is so dedicated to the cause
that it pursues the cause to the death (unless you
say otherwise).
•	 14th The target is dedicated to the cause, but the spell
ends for the target if it’s reduced to half its maximum
Hit Points or fewer. •

can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns
to end the spell for itself.

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from
penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter
the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch
or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area,
even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness.
This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell’s
level or lower. Light can’t pass through, so creatures in the
area can’t see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of
pure darkness.
Heightened (4th) Even creatures with darkvision (but not
greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness. They
treat targets seen through the darkness as concealed.
