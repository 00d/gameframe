Armor
Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper
movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your armor
provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re wearing it.
Armor Class
Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can
defend against attacks. When a creature attacks you, your
Armor Class is the DC for that attack roll.
Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your
armor’s Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor’s
item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties
Use your proficiency bonus for the category (light,
medium, or heavy) or the specific type of armor you’re
wearing. If you’re not wearing armor, use your proficiency
in unarmored defense.
Donning and Removing
Armor
Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so
make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning
and removing armor are both activities involving many
Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5
minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to
remove any armor.
Armor Statistics
Table 6–3: Unarmored Defense provides the statistics
for the various forms of protection without wearing
armor. Table 6–4: Armor provides the statistics for suits
of armor that can be purchased and worn, organized
by category. The columns in both tables provide the
following statistics.
Category
The armor’s category—unarmored, light armor, medium
armor, or heavy armor—indicates which proficiency
bonus you use while wearing the armor.
AC Bonus
This number is the item bonus you add for the armor
when determining Armor Class.
Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)
This number is the maximum amount of your
Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you
are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you
have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing
a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from
your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing
that armor.
Check Penalty
While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to
Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for
those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor’s
Strength threshold (see Strength below), you don’t take
this penalty.
Speed Penalty
While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty
listed in this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other
movement types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim
Speed, to a minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the
armor’s Strength threshold (see below), you reduce the
penalty by 5 feet.
Strength
This entry indicates the Strength score at which you are
strong enough to overcome some of the armor’s penalties.
If your Strength is equal to or greater than this value,
you no longer take the armor’s check penalty, and you
decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet (to no penalty if the
penalty was –5 feet, or to a –5-foot penalty if the penalty
was –10 feet).
Bulk
This entry gives the armor’s Bulk, assuming you’re
wearing the armor and distributing its weight across
your body. A suit of armor that’s carried or worn usually
has 1 more Bulk than what’s listed here (or 1 Bulk total
for armor of light Bulk). An armor’s Bulk is increased or
decreased if it’s sized for creatures that aren’t Small or
Medium in size, following the rules on page 295.
Group
Each type of medium and heavy armor belongs to an
armor group, which classifies it with similar types of
armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, typically
to grant armor specialization effects, which are described
on page 275.
Armor Traits
The traits for each suit of armor appear in this entry.
Armor can have the following traits.
Bulwark: The armor covers you so completely that
it provides benefits against some damaging effects.
On Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such
as a fireball, you add a +3 modifier instead of your
Dexterity modifier.
