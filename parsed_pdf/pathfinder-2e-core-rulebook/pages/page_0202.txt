QUICKENED CASTING [free-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Frequency once per day
In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a
spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a sorcerer
cantrip or a sorcerer spell that is at least 2 levels lower than
the highest level sorcerer spell you can cast, reduce the
number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
12TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE FOCUS
FEAT 12
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline spell
Your focus recovers faster. If you have spent at least 2 Focus
Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 2 Focus
Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
MAGIC SENSE 
FEAT 12
DETECTION
DIVINATION
SORCERER
You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the
presence of magic auras as though you were always using a
1st-level detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of
vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level
detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal
benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a
free action at the start or the end of your turn.
14TH LEVEL
INTERWEAVE DISPEL [one-action]
FEAT 14
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Prerequisites dispel magic in your spell repertoire
You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects
at a foe. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell
against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell
attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast dispel
magic on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as
normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
REFLECT SPELL 
FEAT 14
SORCERER
Prerequisites Counterspell
When you successfully use Counterspell to counteract a
spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn
that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell
affects only the original caster, even if it’s an area spell or it
would normally affect more than one creature. The original
caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the
reflected spell as normal.
16TH LEVEL
EFFORTLESS CONCENTRATION [reaction[free-action]
FEAT 16
SORCERER
Trigger Your turn begins.
You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately
gain the effects of the Sustain a Spell action, allowing you to
extend the duration of one of your active sorcerer spells.
GREATER MENTAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 16
ARCANE
SORCERER
Prerequisites Arcane Evolution or Occult Evolution
Your bloodline’s deep connection to mental essence greatly
enhances your spell repertoire. Add one spell to your spell
repertoire for each spell level you can cast.
GREATER VITAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 16
DIVINE
SORCERER
Prerequisites Divine Evolution or Primal Evolution
Vital power surges through you like a font of energy. Twice
per day, you can cast a spell after you’ve run out of spell slots
of the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this
feat must be of different spell levels.
18TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
SORCERER
Prerequisites Bloodline Focus
Your blood’s power replenishes your focus. If you have spent
at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you
recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
GREATER CROSSBLOODED EVOLUTION
FEAT 18
SORCERER
Prerequisites Crossblooded Evolution
Your bloodline is extraordinarily complex. You can have up
to three spells from other traditions in your spell repertoire,
rather than just one. These spells must each be of a different
spell level, but they don’t need to be from the same tradition.
20TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE CONDUIT [one-action]
FEAT 20
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Frequency once per minute
Your inborn magical nature lets you redirect ambient energies
to fuel your spells. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of
5th level or lower that has no duration, you don’t expend the
spell’s slot when you cast it.
BLOODLINE PERFECTION 
FEAT 20
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline paragon
You command the ultimate powers of your bloodline and
tradition. You gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
METAMAGIC MASTERY 
