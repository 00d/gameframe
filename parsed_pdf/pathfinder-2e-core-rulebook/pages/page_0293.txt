to Pick Locks and Disable Devices. If your thieves’ tools
are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock
picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools;
this doesn’t require using the Repair action.
Tool: This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools
that don’t have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe,
shovel, or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill,
ice hook, or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be
used as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a
short tool or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the
damage type that’s appropriate or adjusts the damage
if needed.
Torch: A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot
radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet). It can be
used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4
bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage.
Vial: A simple glass vial holds up to 1
ounce of liquid.
Waterskin: When it’s full, a
waterskin has 1 Bulk and contains
roughly 1 day’s worth of water for
a Small or Medium creature.
Writing Set: Using a writing set, you
can draft correspondence and scribe scrolls. A
set includes stationery, including a variety of paper
and parchment, as well as ink, a quill or inkpen,
sealing wax, and a simple seal. If you’ve written a large
amount, you can refill your kit with extra ink and paper.
