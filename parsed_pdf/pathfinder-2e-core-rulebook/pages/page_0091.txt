TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites animal instinct
Your proficiency in unarmored defense increases to expert.
While you are raging and unarmored, your skin transforms
into a thick hide resembling your animal’s skin. You gain a
+1 status bonus to AC instead of taking a –1 penalty to AC;
if you have the greater juggernaut class feature, this status
bonus increases to +2. The thickness of your hide gives you a
Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +3.
ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY [reaction]
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and
the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty,
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
