 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 465 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This peculiar rod is strange and unpredictable. Each time it is
activated, it produces one of a variety of effects at random.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect Choose a creature
within 60 feet and roll d% on the table below to determine the
rod’s effect. If an entry lists only a spell name, the rod casts
that spell at its lowest level. You make any decisions for a
spell cast by the rod unless otherwise indicated, except that it
must target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose
must be the center of the spell’s area, if it has an area but no
targets. If the spell’s range is less than 60 feet, increase the
range to 60 feet.
Any spell DC required is DC 27, and any spell attack roll
required is +17. If the rod casts a spell on you, you don’t get a
saving throw or other defense against it.
Once activated, the rod can’t be activated again for 1d4 hours.
