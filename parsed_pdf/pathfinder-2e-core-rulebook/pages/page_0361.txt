You create a seven-layered sphere to protect an area. This
multicolored sphere functions like a prismatic wall but is shaped
in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner of your space. You must
form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t
pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.

Area 30-foot cone
A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open
hand. Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table
below to see which beam affects it, then attempt a saving
throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional
traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by
multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving
throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the
effect for that creature.

PRISMATIC WALL
SPELL 8
ABJURATION
LIGHT
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three‑actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 hour
You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light.
The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30
feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space
so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the
spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects.
The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and
dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that
come into the wall’s light must attempt a Will save; they’re
dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a
failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are
then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour.
A prismatic wall has seven different layers, each a different
color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a
5th-level chromatic wall (page 323) spell of that color, and
the others have the effect of a 7th-level chromatic wall spell
of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall
must attempt a saving throw against each component wall.
The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned
to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the
indigo and violet walls.
The wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of
the wall’s level or lower; each color must be counteracted by
its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be
done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then
violet). A given color can’t be affected until the previous color
is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that
color’s effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends
prismatic wall. You can Dismiss the spell.

ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Area 100-foot burst
Duration 24 hours
From outside, the area looks like a bank of impenetrable black
fog. Sensory stimuli (such as sounds, smells, and light) don’t
pass from inside the area to outside the area. Scrying spells
can’t perceive any stimuli from the area, and mind-reading
effects don’t work in the area.

EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and
you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a
spell attack roll against your target’s AC. This is normally a
ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against
a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal
1d4 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On
a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4
persistent fire damage.
Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent
damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
PROJECT IMAGE
SPELL 7
ILLUSION

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within
range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image,
the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than one
whose area is an emanation, you can cause the spell effect
