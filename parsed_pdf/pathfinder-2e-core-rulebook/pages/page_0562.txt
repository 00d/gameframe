Activate [one-action] command
Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When
an activated vine arrow hits a target, the arrow’s shaft splits
and grows, wrapping the target in vines. The target takes a
–10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or
until it Escapes against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target
is also immobilized until it Escapes.
VIPER ARROW
ITEM 4
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 17 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] command
The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its
iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an
activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into
a viper (Pathfinder Bestiary 302). The target is affected by the
viper’s poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in
an open space adjacent to the target.
The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your
turn, even though you didn’t use the Sustain a Spell action. It is
under the GM’s control, but it generally attacks the creature the
arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of summon animal.
Oils
Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that
are typically applied to an object and are used up in the
process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually
takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil,
and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can
only apply an oil to an item or creature within your
reach. Because the process is so thorough, it is usually
impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an
item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that
target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.

 MAGICAL
 OIL
Price 13,000 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This oil contains energy that repels nearly all types of magic.
When you apply this oil to armor, the creature wearing the
armor becomes immune to all spells, effects of magic items
(the wearer’s and those of others), and effects with the magical
trait for 1 minute. The oil affects neither the magic of the armor
nor the fundamental runes of weapons attacking the wearer.
Magical effects from a source of 20th level or higher, such as a
deity, still function on the armor’s wearer.

 OIL
Price 140 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each
aligned oil is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law
(such as a good-aligned oil). A weapon anointed with this oil
gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment:
anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), holy (good), or unholy (evil).
This lasts for 1 minute.

A shimmering liquid, nectar of purification is often stored
in bottles similar to those used for vinegar. This oil casts a
1st-level purify food and drink spell over any food or drink onto

immune to divination magic of 8th level or lower (such as
