VENGEFUL OATH
FEAT 2
CHAMPION
OATH
Prerequisites paladin cause
You’ve sworn an oath to hunt down wicked evildoers and
bring them to judgment. Add the following tenet to your code
after the others: “You must hunt down and exterminate evil
creatures that have committed heinous atrocities as long as
you have a reasonable chance of success and aren’t engaged
in a mission that would prevent your doing so.”
You can use lay on hands to damage a creature you witness
harming an innocent or a good ally as if it were undead; in this
case, lay on hands deals good damage instead of positive damage
and gains the good trait. This good damage can affect non-evil
creatures. This doesn’t prevent you from healing such a creature
with lay on hands; you choose whether to heal or harm.
