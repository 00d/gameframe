Alchemical Items
Alchemical items are not magical. They instead use the
properties of volatile chemicals, exotic minerals, potent
plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as
alchemical reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t
radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed
or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set
amount of time or until they are countered in some way,
typically physically.
Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times they straddle
the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable.
Alchemists can infuse reagents with some of their own
essence, allowing them to efficiently create short-lived
alchemical items at no monetary cost. Even in these cases,
alchemical items don’t radiate magic auras, instead using
the alchemist’s infused essence as one additional catalyst
for the item’s alchemical effects.
Rules for creating alchemical items are found in the
Craft activity on page 244, and you must have the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to use Crafting to create
alchemical items. Critically failing a Crafting check to
make alchemical items often causes a dangerous effect,
such as an explosion for a bomb or accidental exposure
for a poison, in addition to losing some of the materials.
Some alchemical items have additional requirements
beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these items list
their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.
All alchemical items have the alchemical trait. Most
also have the consumable trait, which means that the item
is used up once activated. The bomb, elixir, and poison
traits indicate special categories of alchemical items, each
of which is described on the following pages. Alchemical
items without any of these traits are called alchemical
tools, and are described further on page 554.
This section contains the following subcategories.
Special rules appear at the start of the relevant section.
•	 Alchemical bombs appear on page 544.
•	 Alchemical elixirs are listed on page 546.
•	 Alchemical poisons begin on page 550.
•	 Alchemical tools can be found on page 554.
