Cover
1.	 Valeros and the ogre don’t have any cover
from one another. The line from the center
of Valeros’s space to the center of the ogre’s
space doesn’t pass through blocking terrain
or other creatures.
2.	The ogre and Seoni have lesser cover from
one another. The line between the centers
of their spaces doesn’t pass through any
blocking terrain, but does passes through
Valeros’s space.
3.	The ogre and Merisiel have cover from one
another. The line between the centers of
their spaces crosses blocking terrain.
4.	Kyra and the ogre can barely see one
another, but have cover from one another
because the line between the centers of
their spaces goes through blocking terrain.
Because there’s so much blocking terrain
in the way, the GM will likely rule this is
greater cover.

Cover
When you’re behind an obstacle that could block
weapons, guard you against explosions, and make you
harder to detect, you’re behind cover. Standard cover
gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves
against area effects, and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak,
or otherwise avoid detection. You can increase this to
greater cover using the Take Cover basic action, increasing
the circumstance bonus to +4. If cover is especially light,
typically when it’s provided by a creature, you have lesser
cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A
creature with standard cover or greater cover can attempt
to use Stealth to Hide, but lesser cover isn’t sufficient.

Cover is relative, so you might simultaneously have
cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies
only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a
creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you don’t have
line of effect (page 457) and typically can’t target it at all.
Usually, the GM can quickly decide whether your target
has cover. If you’re uncertain or need to be more precise,
draw a line from the center of your space to the center of
the target’s space. If that line passes through any terrain or
object that would block the effect, the target has standard
cover (or greater cover if the obstruction is extreme or the
target has Taken Cover). If the line passes through a creature
instead, the target has lesser cover. When measuring cover
against an area effect, draw the line from the effect’s point
of origin to the center of the creature’s space.
Cover and Large Creatures
If a creature between you and a target is two or more sizes
larger than both you and your target, that creature’s space
blocks the effect enough to provide standard cover instead
of lesser cover. The GM might determine that a creature
doesn’t gain cover from terrain that it’s significantly larger
than. For example, a Huge dragon probably wouldn’t
receive any benefit from being behind a 1-foot-wide pillar.
Special Circumstances
Your GM might allow you to overcome your target’s cover
in some situations. If you’re right next to an arrow slit,
you can shoot without penalty, but you have greater cover
against someone shooting back at you from far away.
Your GM might let you reduce or negate cover by leaning
around a corner to shoot or the like. This usually takes an
action to set up, and the GM might measure cover from an
edge or corner of your space instead of your center.
Special Battles
Sometimes fights occur while the characters are atop
mounts or when the PCs take to the sky or seas.
