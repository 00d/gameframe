ADVANCEMENT SPEEDS
By varying the amount of XP it takes to gain a level, you
can change how quickly characters gain power. The game
rules assume a group playing with standard advancement.
Fast advancement works best when you know you won’t
be playing a very long campaign and want to accomplish
as much as possible quickly; slow advancement works
best for a gritty campaign where all progress is hard won.
You can alter XP from one adventure to the next to get
a different feel. During a street-level murder mystery and
travel through a haunted wilderness, you might use slow
advancement. When the PCs reach the dungeon, you might
switch to standard or fast advancement. The values below
are just examples. You can use values even higher or lower.

Advancement Speed
XP to Level Up


Fast
800 XP


Standard
1,000 XP


Slow
1,200 XP
Story-Based Leveling
If you don’t want to deal with managing and handing out
XP, or if you want to have progression based solely on
events in the story, you can ignore the XP process entirely
and instead simply decide when the characters level up.
Generally, the characters should gain a level every three
to four game sessions, just after the most appropriate big
event that happens during that time, such as defeating a
significant villain or achieving a major goal.
Currency
A party will find money and other treasure that isn’t
useful on its own but that can be sold or spent on other
things. The gp values in the Party Currency column don’t
refer only to coins. Gems, art objects, crafting materials
(including precious materials), jewelry, and even items of
much lower level than the party’s level can all be more
interesting than a pile of gold.
If you include a lower-level permanent item as part of a
currency reward, count only half the item’s Price toward
the gp amount, assuming the party will sell the item or use
it as crafting material. But lower-level consumables might
still be useful, particularly scrolls, and if you think your
party will use them, count those items at their full Price.
Other Types of Treasure
Not all treasure has to be items or currency. Crafters can
use the Crafting skill to turn raw materials directly into
items instead of buying those items with coins. Knowledge
can expand a character’s abilities, and formulas make good
treasure for item-crafting characters. A spellcaster might
get access to new spells from an enemy’s spellbook or an
ancient scholar, while a monk might retrain techniques with
rarer ones learned from a master on a remote mountaintop.
Treasure and Rarity
Giving out uncommon and rare items and formulas
can get players more interested in treasure. It’s best to
introduce uncommon items as a reward fairly regularly
but rare items only occasionally. These rewards are
