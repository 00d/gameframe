You make the target overconfident, leading it to ascribe failure
to external factors. If the target fails at an attack roll or skill
check, it takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls and skill
checks until the end of its turn (or the end of its next turn, if it
attempted the roll outside its turn). If the creature fails a second
time while taking this penalty, the penalty increases to –2. The
duration depends on the target’s Will save. After attempting its
save, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
