character an additional item of their current level. If your
party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and
passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the
new character less than the values on the table or reduce
some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures.
Item Selection
You should work with the new character’s player to decide
which items their character has. Allow the player to make
suggestions, and if they know what items they want their
character to have, respect their choices unless you believe
those choices will have a negative impact on your game.
At your discretion, you can grant the player character
uncommon or rare items that fit their backstory and
concept, keeping in mind how many items of those rarities
you have introduced into your game. The player can also
spend currency on consumables or lower-level permanent
items, keeping the rest as coinage. As usual, you determine
which items the character can find for purchase.
A PC can voluntarily choose an item that has a lower
level than any or all of the listed items, but they don’t gain
any more currency by doing so.
If you choose, you can allow the player to instead start
with a lump sum of currency and buy whatever common
items they want, with a maximum item level of 1 lower
than the character’s level. This has a lower total value than
the normal allotment of permanent items and currency,
since the player can select a higher ratio of high-level items.

Buying and Selling Items
Characters can usually buy and sell items only during
downtime. An item can typically be sold for only half its
Price, though art objects, gems, and raw materials can be
sold for their full Price (page 271).
