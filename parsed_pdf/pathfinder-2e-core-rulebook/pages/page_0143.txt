Class Features
You gain these abilities as a fighter. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Attack of Opportunity
Ever watchful for weaknesses, you can quickly attack
foes that leave an opening in their defenses. You gain the
Attack of Opportunity reaction.
ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY [reaction]
Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and
the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty,
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
Fighter Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a fighter class feat. Fighter class feats are described
beginning on page 144.
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (found on page
266), a reaction that lets you reduce damage with
your shield.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Bravery
3rd
Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you
have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and
keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save
against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition,
reduce its value by 1.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
