Universalist Wizards
Instead of specializing narrowly in an arcane school, you
can become a universalist wizard—by studying all the
schools equally, you devote yourself to understanding
the full breadth of the arcane arts. For each level of spell
you can cast, you can use Drain Bonded item once per
day to recall a spell of that level (instead of using it only
once per day in total). You gain an extra wizard class
feat, and you add one 1st-level spell of your choice to
your spellbook.
Wizard Feats
At each level that you gain a wizard feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
COUNTERSPELL [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
ARCANE
WIZARD
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared.
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations,
you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You expend a
prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of
that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the
triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering
spell (page 458).
ESCHEW MATERIALS
FEAT 1
WIZARD
You can use clever workarounds to replicate the arcane essence
of certain materials. When Casting a Spell that requires material
components, you can provide these material components without
a spell component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils
in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still
must have a hand completely free. This doesn’t remove the need
for any materials listed in the spell’s cost entry.
FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
WIZARD
You make a pact with creature that serves you and assists your
spellcasting. You gain a familiar (page 217).
HAND OF THE APPRENTICE
FEAT 1
WIZARD
Prerequisites universalist wizard
You can magically hurl your weapon at your foe. You gain the
hand of the apprentice universalist spell. Universalist spells
are a type of focus spell, much like school spells. You start
with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. See Arcane Schools on page
207 for more information about focus spells.
