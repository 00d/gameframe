You have an incredible ability to invest more magic items.
Increase your limit on invested items from 10 to 12.
INTIMIDATING GLARE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize
loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don’t
take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.
INTIMIDATING PROWESS
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites Strength 16, expert in Intimidation
In situations where you can physically menace the target when
you Coerce or Demoralize, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not
sharing a language. If your Strength score is 20 or higher and
you are a master in Intimidation, this bonus increases to +2.
INVENTOR
FEAT 7
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Crafting
You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things
are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime
to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works
just like the Craft activity: you spend half the Price of the
formula up front, attempt a Crafting check, and on a success
either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for
longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend
the additional time in research, design, and development, rather
than in creating an item. Once it’s complete, you add the new
formula you invented to your formula book.
KIP UP [free-action]
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Acrobatics

LASTING COERCION
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
When you successfully Coerce someone, the maximum time
they comply increases to a week, still determined by the GM.
If you’re legendary, the maximum increases to a month.
LEGENDARY CODEBREAKER
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Society
Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you
can decipher information with little more than a quick read
through a text. You can Decipher Writing using Society
while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend
the full amount of time that’s ordinarily required and roll a
success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed
while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly
word-for-word understanding of the document.
GROUP COERCION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check
result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible
to get a different degree of success for each target. The number
of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to four if
you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.
GROUP IMPRESSION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
When you Make an Impression, you can compare your
Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead
of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for
each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re
an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.
HEFTY HAULER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You can carry more than your frame implies. Increase your
maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.
HOBNOBBER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You are skilled at learning information through conversation.
The Gather Information exploration activity takes you half as
long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you’re a
master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal
speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you
get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you
learn with Gather Information is accurate.
IMPECCABLE CRAFTING
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Crafting, Specialty Crafting
You craft flawless creations with great efficiency. Whenever you
roll a success at a Crafting check to make an item of the type you
chose with Specialty Crafting, you get a critical success instead.
