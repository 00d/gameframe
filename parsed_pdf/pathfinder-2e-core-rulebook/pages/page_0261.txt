Deception to Impersonate normally, and to Lie when necessary.
CRAFT ANYTHING
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Crafting
You can find ways to craft just about anything, despite
restrictions. As long as you have the appropriate Crafting skill
feat (such as Magical Crafting for magic items) and meet the
item’s level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about
any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or
providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add
to the item’s cost, including castings of spells that themselves
have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the
philosopher’s stone that have exclusive means of access and
Crafting. The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.

It takes more to kill you than most. You die from the dying
condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.
DIVINE GUIDANCE
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Religion
You’re so immersed in divine scripture that you find meaning
and guidance in your texts in any situation. Spend 10 minutes
Deciphering Writing on religious scriptures of your deity

conundrum you face, and then attempt a Religion check (DC
determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant
passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward
or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum. For
example, the GM might provide you with a cryptic poem or hint
that can guide you to the next step of solving your problem.
DUBIOUS KNOWLEDGE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action
You’re a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes
from reputable sources. When you fail a Recall Knowledge

a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don’t have any way to
differentiate which is which.
EXPEDITIOUS SEARCH
FEAT 7
GENERAL
Prerequisites master in Perception
You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding
details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When
Searching, you take half as long as usual to Search a given
area. This means that while exploring, you double the Speed
you can move while ensuring you’ve Searched an area before
walking into it (up to half your Speed). If you’re legendary in
Perception, you instead Search areas four times as quickly.
CLOUD JUMP
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Athletics
Your unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible
distances. Triple the distance you Long Jump (so you could jump
60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you High Jump, use
the calculation for a Long Jump but don’t triple the distance.
When you Long Jump or High Jump, you can also increase
the number of actions you use (up to the number of actions you
have remaining in your turn) to jump even further. For each extra
action, add your Speed to the maximum distance you jump.

CONFABULATOR
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception
Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the
circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts

in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you’re legendary,
your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.
CONNECTIONS
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Society, Courtly Graces
You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or
meet important people. When you’re in an area with connections
(typically a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building
connections, or possibly another area in the same nation), you
can attempt a Society check to arrange a meeting with an
important political figure or ask for a favor in exchange for a
later favor of your contact’s choice. The GM decides the DC
based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure’s prominence.
CONTINUAL RECOVERY
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You zealously monitor a patient’s progress to administer
