STUDIOUS CAPACITY

BARD
Prerequisites enigma muse, legendary in Occultism
Your continued study of occult magic has increased your
magical capacity, allowing you to cast spells even when it seems

use this ability to cast a spell of your highest spell level.

The world is a stage upon which you are always playing. You
are permanently quickened; you can use your extra action
only to cast a composition cantrip that requires 1 action to
cast. While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are
performing an eligible composition cantrip while using any
exploration tactic. Even before your first turn in a combat
encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your
previous turn.
IMPOSSIBLE POLYMATH
FEAT 18
BARD
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, or Religion,
Esoteric Polymath
Your esoteric formulas are so unusual that they allow you to
dabble in magic from diverse traditions that other bards don’t
understand. As long as you’re trained in Arcana, you can add
arcane spells to your book from Esoteric Polymath; as long
as you’re trained in Nature, you can add primal spells to your
book; and as long as you are trained in Religion, you can add
divine spells to your book.
Like your other spells in your book, you can add one of
these spells from another tradition to your repertoire as an
occult spell each day using Esoteric Polymath, but you can’t
retain any spells from another tradition when you prepare
again, even if you have Eclectic Polymath.

effects continue for their remaining duration.
