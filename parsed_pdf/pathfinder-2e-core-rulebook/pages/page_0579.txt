A number of precious materials are described below. The
Price entry for each material gives the Price of a simple
non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk
(if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk),
as well as Prices for different amounts of the material itself.
Prices for armor, shields, and weapons made of precious
material are in the Armor (page 555), Shields (page 586),
and Weapons (page 599) sections of this chapter.
Crafting with Precious Materials
Only an expert crafter can create a low-grade item, only
a master can create a standard-grade item, and only a
legendary crafter can create a high-grade item. In addition,
to Craft with a precious material, your character level
must be equal to or greater than that of the material.
Low-grade items can be used in the creation of magic
items of up to 8th level, and they can hold runes of up
to 8th level. Standard-grade items can be used to create
magic items of up to 15th level and can hold runes of
up to 15th level. High-grade items use the purest form
of the precious material, and can be used to Craft magic
items of any level holding any runes. Using purer forms
of common materials is so relatively inexpensive that the
Price is included in any magic item.
When you Craft an item that incorporates a precious
material, your initial raw materials for the item must
include that material; at least 10% of the investment
must be of the material for low-grade, at least 25% for
standard-grade, and all of it for high-grade. For instance,
a low-grade silver object of 1 Bulk costs 20 gp. Of the 10
gp of raw materials you provide when you start to Craft
the item, at least 1 gp must be silver. The raw materials
you spend to complete the item don’t have to consist of the
precious material, though the GM might rule otherwise in
certain cases.
After creating an item with a precious material, you can
use Craft to improve its grade, paying the Price difference
and providing a sufficient amount of the precious material.
ADAMANTINE
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON

Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one

and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an
incredibly sharp edge.

COLD IRON
MATERIAL 2+
 PRECIOUS
Weapons made from cold iron are deadly to demons and fey alike.
Cold iron looks like normal iron but is mined from particularly
pure sources and shaped with little or no heat. This process is
extremely difficult, especially for high-grade cold iron items.

Type cold iron ingot; Price 100 gp; Bulk 1
Type low-grade cold iron object; Level 2; Price 20 gp per Bulk

DARKWOOD
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
Darkwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old-
growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but
has a slight purple tint. A darkwood item’s Bulk is reduced by
1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an
item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made
of darkwood is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced
Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before
making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.
Type darkwood branch; Price 500 gp; Bulk L
Type darkwood lumber; Price 5,000 gp; Bulk 1
Type standard-grade darkwood object; Level 8; Price 350 gp
per Bulk
Type high-grade darkwood object; Level 16; Price 6,000 gp
