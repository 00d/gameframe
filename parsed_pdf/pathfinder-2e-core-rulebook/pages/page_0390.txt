CLERIC
Clerics can gain the following domain spells by selecting
the Domain Initiate or Advanced Domain feat.
AGILE FEET
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
TRANSMUTATION
Domain travel
Cast [one-action] somatic
Duration until the end of the current turn
The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your
movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to
your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting
agile feet, you can Stride or Step; you can instead Burrow,
Climb, Fly, or Swim if you have the appropriate Speed.
APPEARANCE OF WEALTH
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
ILLUSION
Domain wealth
Cast [two-actions] material, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the
spell’s area. Each creature within 20 feet of the area that
could be enticed by material wealth must attempt a Will
saving throw. A creature that enters the area automatically
disbelieves the illusion, and disbelieving the illusion ends
any fascinated condition imposed by the spell. As long as
you Sustain the Spell, other creatures react to the treasure
like they would any other illusion, but they are not at risk of
becoming fascinated.
Critical Success The creature disbelieves the illusion and is
unaffected by it.
Success The creature is fascinated by the wealth until it has
completed its first action on its next turn.
Failure The creature is fascinated by the illusion.
ARTISTIC FLOURISH
FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
TRANSMUTATION
Domain creation
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 15 feet; Targets 1 item or work of art that fits entirely
within the range
Duration 10 minutes
You transform the target to make it match your artisanal
and artistic vision. If you have expert proficiency in
Crafting, the item grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls
if it’s a weapon or skill checks if it’s a skill tool. The target
is a beautiful and impressive piece for its new quality, but
the effect is obviously temporary, so its monetary value
doesn’t change.
When you cast this spell, any previous artistic flourish you
had cast ends.
Heightened (7th) If you have master proficiency in Crafting,
the item grants a +2 item bonus instead.
Heightened (10th) If you have legendary proficiency in
Crafting, the item grants a +3 item bonus instead.
ATHLETIC RUSH
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
TRANSMUTATION
Domain might
Cast [one-action] somatic
Duration 1 round
Your body fills with physical power and skill. You gain a +10-
foot status bonus to Speed and a +2 status bonus to Athletics
checks. As a part of Casting this Spell, you can use a Stride,
Leap, Climb, or Swim action. The spell’s bonuses apply during
that action.
BIT OF LUCK
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CLERIC
DIVINATION
FORTUNE
Domain luck
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from
disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it
can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the
spell ends.
If you cast bit of luck again, any previous bit of luck you
cast that’s still in effect ends. After a creature has been
targeted with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for
24 hours.

You strengthen a target’s ambition, increase its resentment of
allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change.
The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes a –1 status penalty to its saving
throws and other defenses against attempts to Coerce it,
Request something of it, or use mental effects to convince
it to do something (such as a suggestion spell). This penalty
applies only if the target is being encouraged to advance its
own ambitions.
Failure As success, but the penalty is –2.
Critical Failure The target is overcome with ambition, taking
whatever actions would advance its own agenda over those
of anyone else, even without attempts to convince it.
