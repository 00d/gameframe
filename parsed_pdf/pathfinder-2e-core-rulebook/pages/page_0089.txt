instead of the normal damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each
time you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or
unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it
more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine
and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.
Specialization Ability
When using spirit rage, increase the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater
weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when using spirit rage to 13.
Raging Resistance
You resist negative damage, as well as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of
undead creatures, regardless of the damage type.
Barbarian Feats
At every level that you gain a barbarian feat, you can select one of the following
feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ACUTE VISION
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
When you are raging, your visual senses improve, granting you darkvision.
MOMENT OF CLARITY [one-action]
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE RAGE
You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you
can use actions with the concentrate trait even if those actions don’t have the rage trait.
RAGING INTIMIDATION
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
Your fury fills your foes with fear. While you are raging, your Demoralize and Scare to Death
actions (from the Intimidation skill and an Intimidation skill feat, respectively) gain the rage
trait, allowing you to use them while raging. As soon as you meet the prerequisites for the
skill feats Intimidating Glare and Scare to Death, you gain these feats.
RAGING THROWER
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
Thrown weapons become especially deadly in your fury. You apply the additional damage
from Rage to your thrown weapon attacks. If you have the Brutal Critical feat or the
devastator class feature, apply their benefits to thrown weapon attacks.
SUDDEN CHARGE t[two-actions]
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
OPEN
With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your
movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against
that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming
instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
2ND LEVEL
ACUTE SCENT
FEAT 2
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites Acute Vision or darkvision
When you Rage, your sense of smell improves. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.
