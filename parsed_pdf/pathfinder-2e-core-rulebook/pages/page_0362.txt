to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the
image is an illusion, it can’t benefit from spells, though visual
manifestations of the spell appear. The image has the same AC
and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the
spell ends.
Heightened (+2) The maximum duration you can Sustain the
Spell increases to 10 minutes.
PROTECTION
SPELL 1
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
You ward a creature against a specified alignment. Choose
chaotic, evil, good, or lawful when you cast this spell.
The target gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and
saving throws against creatures and effects of the chosen
alignment. This bonus increases to +3 against effects
from such creatures that would directly control the target
and against attacks made by summoned creatures of the
chosen alignment.
This spell gains the trait that opposes the alignment you
chose—if you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait,
and vice versa; if you choose evil, this spell gains the good
trait, and vice versa.

SCRYING
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range see text
Duration sustained
You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a
location you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions
with your normal visual senses and continuously transmits
what it sees to you.
The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can
either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front
of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all
directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the
eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the
eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can
attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt
Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye
destroys it and ends the spell.
