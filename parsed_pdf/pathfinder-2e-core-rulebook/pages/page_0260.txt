BONDED ANIMAL
FEAT 2
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Nature
You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7
days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not
a companion or other special animal). After this duration,
attempt a DC 20 Nature check. If successful, you bond with
the animal. The animal is permanently helpful to you, unless
you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful
animal is easier to direct, as described under Command an
Animal on page 249.
Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had.
You can’t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion
(though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).
BREATH CONTROL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
You have incredible breath control, which grants you
advantages when air is hazardous or sparse. You can hold your
breath for 25 times as long as usual before suffocating. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled
threats, such as inhaled poisons, and if you roll a success on
such a saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
CANNY ACUMEN
FEAT 1
GENERAL
Your avoidance or observation is beyond the ken of most in
your profession. Choose Fortitude saves, Reflex saves, Will
saves, or Perception. You become an expert in your choice. At
17th level, you become a master in your choice.
CAT FALL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your
falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you’re an expert in
Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you’re a master in
Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you’re legendary
in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don’t take
damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
CHARMING LIAR
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When
you get a critical success using the Lie action, the target’s
attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d
succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This
works only once per conversation, and if you critically
succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you
choose one creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying
to impart seemingly important information, inflate your
status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies
can’t achieve.
