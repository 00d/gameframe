affect the primary check depending on their results.
Critical Success You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the
primary check.
Success No bonus or penalty.
Failure You take a –4 circumstance penalty to the primary
check.
Critical Failure As failure, and you reduce the degree of
success of the primary skill check by one step.
Effect
A ritual’s effect depends on the result of the primary check.
If an effect lists a save DC, use your spell DC for the ritual’s
magic tradition (or 12 + your level + your highest mental
ability modifier, if you don’t have a spell DC).
Rituals
The following rituals are just a small sample of the many
that exist.
ANIMATE OBJECT
RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON
TRANSMUTATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, see Table 7–1; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert); Secondary Checks Crafting
Range 10 feet; Target 1 object
You transform the target into an animated object with a level
up to that allowed by Table 7–1 and of a type corresponding
to the object (so a broom would become an animated broom).
Critical Success The target becomes an animated object of the
appropriate type. If it’s at least 4 levels lower than you, you
can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning
it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding
it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate
traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your
control. If it doesn’t become a minion, you can give it one
simple command. It pursues that goal single‑mindedly,
ignoring any of your subsequent commands.
Success As critical success, except an animated object that
doesn’t become your minion stays in place and attacks
anyone that attacks it or tries to steal or move it, rather
than following your command.
Failure You fail to create the animated object.
Critical Failure You create the animated object, but it goes
berserk and attempts to destroy you.
ATONE
RITUAL 4
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense and offerings worth a total value
of 20 gp × the target’s level; Secondary Casters 1, must be
the ritual’s target
Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Nature or Religion (whichever is used for the primary check)
Range 10 feet; Targets another creature of up to 8th level who
is a worshipper of the same deity or philosophy as you
You attempt to help a truly penitent creature atone for its
misdeeds, typically actions contrary to your deity’s alignment
or anathema to your deity. If the creature isn’t truly penitent,
the outcome is always a critical failure. This ritual uses Nature
if the target is a druid, and Religion in all other cases.
Critical Success The creature receives absolution for its
misdeeds, allowing it to regain standing with your deity. It
returns to its previous alignment (if its alignment shifted)
and regains any abilities it lost. Before the atonement is
complete, the creature must perform a special quest or
other task chosen by your deity, as befits its misdeeds. If
completed during downtime, this task should take no less
than 1 month. For 1 month, the target receives divine insight
just before performing an act that would be anathema to
your deity or contrary to your deity’s alignment.
Success As critical success, but the creature gains no special
insight regarding its subsequent actions.
Failure The creature does not receive absolution and must
continue to meditate and redress its misdeeds. Any future
atone rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as much and gain
a +4 circumstance bonus to primary and secondary checks.
Critical Failure The creature offends your deity and is
permanently cast out from the faith. The creature can’t
rejoin your religion without a more direct intervention.
Heightened (5th) Increase the maximum target level by 2 and
the base cost by 20 gp.
