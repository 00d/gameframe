Weapons
Weapons can be crafted from precious materials or infused
with magic to grant them powerful and unusual abilities.
Precious Material Weapons
Weapons made of precious materials are more expensive
and sometimes have special effects. You can make metal
weapons out of any of these materials except darkwood,
and wooden weapons out of darkwood. To determine the
Price of 10 pieces of ammunition, use the base Price for a
single weapon, without adding any extra for Bulk.
