Character Creation
Unless you’re the GM, the first thing you need to do when
playing Pathfinder is create your character. It’s up to you to
imagine your character’s past experiences, personality, and
worldview, and this will set the stage for your roleplaying
during the game. You’ll use the game’s mechanics to
determine your character’s ability to perform various tasks
and use special abilities during the game.
This section provides a step-by-step guide for creating a
character using the Pathfinder rules, preceded by a guide to
help you understand ability scores. These scores are a critical
part of your character, and you will be asked to make choices
about them during many of the following steps. The steps of
character creation are presented in a suggested order, but
you can complete them in whatever order you prefer.
Many of the steps on pages 21–28 instruct you to fill out
fields on your character sheet. The character sheet is shown
on pages 24–25; you can find a copy in the back of this book
or online as a free pdf. The character sheet is designed to
be easy to use when you’re actually playing the game—but
creating a character happens in a different order, so you’ll
move back and forth through the character sheet as you
go through the character creation process. Additionally, the
character sheet includes every field you might need, even
though not all characters will have something to put in each
field. If a field on your character sheet is not applicable to
your character, just leave that field blank.
All the steps of character creation are detailed on the
following pages; each is marked with a number that
corresponds to the sample character sheet on pages 24–25,
showing you where the information goes. If the field
you need to fill out is on the third or fourth page of the
character sheet, which aren’t shown, the text will tell you.
If you’re creating a higher-level character, it’s a good
idea to begin with the instructions here, then turn to
page 29 for instructions on leveling up characters.
The Six Ability Scores
One of the most important aspects of your character is
their ability scores. These scores represent your character’s
raw potential and influence nearly every other statistic on
your character sheet. Determining your ability scores is
not done all at once, but instead happens over several
steps during character creation.
Ability scores are split into two main groups: physical
and mental. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are
physical ability scores, measuring your character’s physical
power, agility, and stamina. In contrast, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma are mental ability scores and
measure your character’s learned prowess, awareness, and
force of personality.
Excellence in an ability score improves the checks and
statistics related to that ability, as described below. When
imagining your character, you should also decide what
ability scores you want to focus on to give you the best
chance at success.
Strength
Strength measures your character’s physical power.
Strength is important if your character plans to engage in
hand-to-hand combat. Your Strength modifier gets added
to melee damage rolls and determines how much your
character can carry.
Dexterity
Dexterity measures your character’s agility, balance, and
reflexes. Dexterity is important if your character plans
to make attacks with ranged weapons or use stealth to
surprise foes. Your Dexterity modifier is also added to
your character’s AC and Reflex saving throws.
Constitution
Constitution measures your character’s overall health
and stamina. Constitution is an important statistic for
all characters, especially those who fight in close combat.
Your Constitution modifier is added to your Hit Points
and Fortitude saving throws.
Intelligence
Intelligence measures how well your character can learn
and reason. A high Intelligence allows your character to
analyze situations and understand patterns, and it means
they can become trained in additional skills and might be
able to master additional languages.
Wisdom
Wisdom measures your character’s common sense,
awareness, and intuition. Your Wisdom modifier is added
to your Perception and Will saving throws.
Charisma
Charisma measures your character’s personal magnetism
and strength of personality. A high Charisma score helps
you influence the thoughts and moods of others.
