Worn Items
This section includes magic items you wear. Most have the
invested trait, which means you can wear no more than 10
(page 531). Worn items include the following subcategories,
with special rules appearing at the start of the section.
•	 Apex Items on this page.
•	 Companion Items on page 604.
•	 Other Worn Items on page 604.
Apex Items
When you Invest an Item that has the
apex trait, it improves one of your ability
scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18,
whichever grants the higher score. This gives you all the
benefits of the new ability score until the investiture runs
out: increasing Intelligence lets you become trained in an
additional skill and learn a new language,
increasing Constitution gives you more
Hit Points, and so on.
An apex item grants this benefit only
the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour
period, and you can benefit from only one
apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item
when you already have one invested, you don’t
gain the ability score increase, though you
do gain any other effects of Investing
the Item.
