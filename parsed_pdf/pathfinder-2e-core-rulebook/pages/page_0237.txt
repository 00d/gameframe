EXTRA PREPARATION
When Earning Income, you might be able to spend days
of downtime to prepare for your task, which adjusts the
DC of the skill check. This might involve rehearsing a play,
studying a topic, and so on. The GM determines how long
preparation takes and how much the DC changes. This is
most useful when you’re trying a task that’s higher level
than you; otherwise such tasks have an increased DC!
ENDING OR INTERRUPTING TASKS
When a task you’re doing is complete, or if you stop
in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new
task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance,
if you quit your job working at the docks, you’ll need to
find another place of employment instead of picking up
where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of
downtime looking for leads on new jobs.
However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or
event that wouldn’t prevent you from returning to the old
job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where
you left off, assuming the task hasn’t been completed by
others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check
when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking,
if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can,
but if you had a bad initial roll, you can’t try for a better one
by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed
during the break—usually because you leveled up while
adventuring—you can attempt a new check.

Earn Income (Trained)
You can use a skill—typically Crafting, Lore, or
Performance—to earn money during downtime. You
must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to
set up, and your income depends on your proficiency
rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because this
process requires a significant amount of time and involves
tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it
won’t come up in every campaign.
In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill
to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually, this is
scholarly work, such as using Religion in a monastery to
study old texts—but giving sermons at a church would still
fall under Performance instead of Religion. You also might
be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using
Acrobatics to perform feats in a circus or Thievery to pick
pockets. If you’re using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or
Performance, the DC tends to be significantly higher.
EARN INCOME
DOWNTIME
You use one of your skills to make money during downtime.
The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative
job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the
GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can
attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though
