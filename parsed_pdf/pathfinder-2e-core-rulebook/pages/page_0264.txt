LEGENDARY LINGUIST
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Society, Multilingual
You’re so skilled with languages you can create a pidgin instantly.
You can always talk to any creature that has a language—even a
language you don’t know­—by creating a new pidgin language that
uses simplified terms and conveys basic concepts. To do so, you
must first understand at least what medium of communication
the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on).
LEGENDARY MEDIC
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Medicine
You’ve discovered medical breakthroughs or techniques that
achieve miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can
spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a Medicine check
to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, doomed, or drained
condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that
created the condition. If the effect’s source is an artifact, above
20th level, or similarly powerful, increase the DC by 10.
LEGENDARY NEGOTIATION [three-actions]
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Diplomacy
You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You
attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent
cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You
take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the
DC of the Request based on the circumstances—it’s generally
at least a very hard DC of the creature’s level. Some creatures
might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might
ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.
LEGENDARY PERFORMER
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Performance, Virtuosic Performer
Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed
at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you
and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than
normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC’s disposition.
For instance, if you’re well-known for cruel and demanding
behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be
friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance,
you attract higher-level audiences than your location would
allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and
angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear
you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by
2 levels or more, determined by the GM.
LEGENDARY PROFESSIONAL
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Lore
Your fame has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if
you have Warfare Lore, you might be a legendary general or
tactician). This works as Legendary Performer above, except
you gain higher-level jobs when you Earn Income with Lore.
LEGENDARY SNEAK
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Stealth, Swift Sneak
You’re always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even
when there’s nowhere to hide. You can Hide and Sneak even
without cover or being concealed. When you employ an
exploration tactic other than Avoiding Notice, you also gain
the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to. See
page 479 for more information about exploration tactics.
LEGENDARY SURVIVALIST
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Survival
You can survive indefinitely without food or water and can
endure severe, extreme, and incredible cold and heat without
taking damage from doing so.
LEGENDARY THIEF
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Thievery, Pickpocket
Your ability to Steal defies belief. You can attempt to Steal
something that is actively wielded or that would be extremely
noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or
armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1
minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time
consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you
must have some means of staying hidden, such as the cover of
darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a –5 penalty to your
Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely
prominent—like a suit of full plate armor—onlookers will quickly
notice it’s gone after you steal it.
LENGTHY DIVERSION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue
to remain hidden after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for
an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation,
as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).
LIE TO ME
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying
to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone
trying to Lie to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than
your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This
doesn’t apply if you don’t have a back-and-forth dialogue, such
as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
MAGICAL CRAFTING
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
You can Craft magic items, though some have other requirements,
as listed in Chapter 11. When you select this feat, you gain
formulas for four common magic items of 2nd level or lower.
