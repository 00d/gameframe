Barbarian
There’s a rage deep inside you that sometimes breaks
loose, granting you some of the might of a barbarian in
addition to your other abilities.
Multiclass Barbarian characters
The barbarian archetype is a great choice for characters
that emphasize Strength and melee attacks more than
usual for their class, as long as they can handle Rage’s
spellcasting restriction. It’s especially good for characters
looking to add more damage.
