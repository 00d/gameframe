Step 4
Pick a Background
Your character’s background might represent their
upbringing, an aptitude they’ve been honing since their
youth, or another aspect of their life before they became an
adventurer. Character backgrounds appear in Chapter 2,
starting on page 60. They typically provide two ability
boosts (one that can be applied to either of two specific
ability scores, and one that is free), training in a specific
skill, training in a Lore skill, and a specific skill feat.
CHARACTER SHEET
Record your character’s background in the space at the
top of the first page of your character sheet. Adjust
your ability scores, adding 2 to an ability score if you
gained an ability boost from your background. Record
the skill feat the background provides in the Skill Feat
section of your character sheet’s second page. On the
first page, check the “T” box next to the name of the
specific skill and for one Lore skill to indicate your
character is trained, then write the name of the Lore
skill granted by your background.

Step 5
Choose a Class
At this point, you need to decide your character’s class.
A class gives your character access to a suite of heroic
abilities, determines how effectively they fight, and
governs how easily they can shake off or avoid certain
harmful effects. Each class is fully detailed in Chapter 3,
but the summaries on pages 22–23 provide an overview
of each and tells you which ability scores are important
when playing that class.
You don’t need to write down all of your character’s
class features yet. You simply need to know which class
you want to play, which determines the ability scores that
will be most important for your character.
CHARACTER SHEET
Write your character’s class in the space at the top of the
first page of your character sheet, then write “1” in the
Level box to indicate that your character is 1st level. Next
to the ability scores, note the class’s key ability score,
and add 2 to that ability score from the ability boost the
