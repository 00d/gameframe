For most classes, you gain a general feat when you reach
3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. Each time you gain
a general feat, you can select any feat with the general trait
whose prerequisites you satisfy.
General feats also include a subcategory of skill feats,
which expand on what you can accomplish via skills.
Chapter 5: Feats
All kinds of experiences and training can shape your character beyond what you learn by
advancing in your class. Abilities that require a degree of training but can be learned by
anyone—not only members of certain ancestries or classes—are called general feats.
These feats also have the skill trait. Most characters gain
skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. When
you gain a skill feat, you must select a general feat with the
skill trait; you can’t select a general feat that lacks the skill
trait. The level of a skill feat is typically the minimum level
at which a character could meet its proficiency prerequisite.
