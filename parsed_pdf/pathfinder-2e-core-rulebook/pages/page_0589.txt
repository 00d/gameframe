of Torag.

for a Shield Block, the forge warden rings
out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith,
and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires
of a furnace.

forge warden to Shield Block an adjacent creature’s
attack and the shield takes damage; Effect The attacking
creature takes 2d6 fire damage.

SPINED SHIELD
ITEM 7
EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 360 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Five jagged spines project from the surface of this steel shield
(Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12). The spines are +1 striking shield
spikes. When you use the Shield Block reaction with this
shield, the spines take the damage before the shield itself
does. When the shield would take damage (after
applying Hardness), one spine snaps off per
6 damage, reducing the damage by 6. The
shield takes any remaining damage. When
there are no spines left, the shield takes
damage as normal.
When all the spines are gone, you
lose the ability to attack with them until
the spines regenerate the next day.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You shoot
one of the shield’s spines at a target. A
fired spine uses the spikes’ statistics, but it is
a martial ranged weapon with a range increment
of 120 feet.
