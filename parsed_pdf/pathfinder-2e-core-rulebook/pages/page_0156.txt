Monk
During combat encounters...
You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers.
You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding
specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let
you change up your combat style for different situations, and ki abilities allow you
to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air.
During social encounters...
Your perceptiveness lets you see through falsehoods, and your philosophical training
provides insight into any situation.
While exploring...
You climb up walls, dodge traps, overcome obstacles, and leap over pits. You usually
stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you’re
well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily.
In downtime...
You diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies.
You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect.
You Might...
•	 Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation.
•	 Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or
succumbing to despair.
•	 Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace with your
present self.
Others Probably...
•	 Marvel at your feats of physical prowess.
•	 Think you’re more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets.
•	 Come to you for philosophical advice.
The strength of your fist flows from your mind and spirit. You seek
perfection—honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into
an orderly bastion of wisdom. You’re a fierce combatant renowned for martial
arts skills and combat stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge
of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating
on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment.
