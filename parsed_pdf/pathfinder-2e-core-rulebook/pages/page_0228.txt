Monk
Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed
you to hone your mind, body, and spirit to new heights.
Multiclass MONK characters
The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character
that fights unarmored or with unarmed attacks.
•	 Barbarian monks with the animal instinct can
combine the barbarian’s excellent unarmed damage
with the monk’s diverse unarmed special abilities.
•	 Champion monks are perfect for champions of
Irori or other deities who favor unarmed attacks.
•	 Fighter monks can supplement free-hand fighting
and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit.
•	 Rogue monks are incredibly effective because
stances grant some of the best agile finesse attacks
and flurry gives more sneak attacks.
•	 Spellcaster monks can fight with a free hand and
still use material components to cast spells.
