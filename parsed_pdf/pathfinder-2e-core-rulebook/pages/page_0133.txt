Wild Empathy
You have a connection to the creatures of the natural
world that allows you to communicate with them on a
rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an
Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests
of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to
make your case.

*	The primal hierophant class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.
Storm
You carry the fury of the storm within you, channeling
it to terrifying effect and riding the winds through the
sky. You are trained in Acrobatics. You also gain the
Storm Born druid feat. You gain the tempest surge order
spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in
your focus pool by 1. Polluting the air or allowing those
who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go
unpunished is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t
force you to take action against merely potential harm
to the environment or to sacrifice yourself against an
obviously superior foe.)
Wild
The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world
infuses you, granting you the ability to change your
shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature.
You are trained in Intimidation. You also gain the
Wild Shape druid feat. You gain the wild morph order
spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations
of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t
prevent you from buying and using processed goods or
staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come
to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place
your permanent home.)
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (found on page
266), a reaction that lets you reduce damage with
your shield.
