MELODIOUS SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 4
BARD
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
You subtly weave your spellcasting into your performance.
If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a
Performance check against all observers’ Perception DCs. If
your Performance check is successful against an observer’s
Perception DC, that observer doesn’t notice that you are
Casting a Spell, even though normally spells have sensory
manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious
to those around you, and verbal, somatic, and material
components are extremely overt. You hide all of these as part
of an ordinary performance.
This hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a
ray streak out from you or see you vanish.
TRIPLE TIME
FEAT 4
BARD
You learn the triple time composition cantrip (page 387),
which speeds up you and your allies for a round.
VERSATILE SIGNATURE
FEAT 4
BARD
Prerequisites polymath muse
While most bards are known for certain signature
performances and spells, you’re always tweaking your
available repertoire. When you make your daily preparations,
you can change one of your signature spells to a different
spell of that level from your repertoire.
6TH LEVEL
DIRGE OF DOOM
FEAT 6
BARD
You learn the dirge of doom composition cantrip (page 386),
which frightens your enemies.
HARMONIZE [one-action]
FEAT 6
BARD
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites maestro muse
You can perform multiple compositions simultaneously. If your
next action is to cast a composition, it becomes a harmonized
composition. Unlike a normal composition, a harmonized
composition doesn’t end if you cast another composition,
and you can cast another composition on the same turn as
a harmonized one. Casting another harmonized composition
ends any harmonized composition you have in effect.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 
FEAT 6
BARD
You don’t lose spells easily. If a reaction would disrupt your
spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed,
your action isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
ECLECTIC SKILL
FEAT 8
BARD
Prerequisites polymath muse, master in Occultism
