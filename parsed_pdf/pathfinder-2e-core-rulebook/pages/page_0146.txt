REACTIVE SHIELD [reaction]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Trigger An enemy hits you with a melee Strike.
Requirements You are wielding a shield.
You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the
last second. You immediately use the Raise a Shield action and gain your shield’s bonus to
AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you’re determining
the outcome of the triggering attack.
SNAGGING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Requirements You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
You combine an attack with quick grappling moves to throw an enemy off balance as long
as it stays in your reach. Make a Strike while keeping one hand free. If this
Strike hits, the target is flat-footed until the start of your next turn or until
it’s no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
SUDDEN CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
OPEN
With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you
end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a
melee Strike against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing,
Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.
2ND LEVEL
AGGRESSIVE BLOCK [free-action]
FEAT 2
FIGHTER
Trigger You use the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent
that triggered Shield Block is adjacent to you and is your
size or smaller.
You push back as you block the attack, knocking your
foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push
the triggering creature, either automatically Shoving it 5
feet or causing it to become flat-footed until the start of
your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether
to be moved or become flat-footed. If it chooses to be
moved, you choose the direction. If the Shove would
cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult
terrain, or enter another creature’s space, it must
become flat-footed instead of being moved.
ASSISTING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 2
FIGHTER
With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat.
You can use the Aid action with a ranged weapon you
wield. Instead of being within reach of the target,
you must be within maximum range of the target. An
Assisting Shot uses ammunition and incurs penalties
just like any other attack.
BRUTISH SHOVE [[one-action]
n-action] FEAT 2
FIGHTER
PRESS
Requirements You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon.
