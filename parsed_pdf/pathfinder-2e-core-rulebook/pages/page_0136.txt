passing whatever rites of initiation that order requires and gaining access to its secrets.
Choose an order other than your own. You gain a 1st-level feat that lists that order as a
prerequisite, and you are now a member of that order for the purpose of meeting feat
prerequisites. If you commit acts anathema to your new order, you lose all feats and
abilities requiring that order but retain your other druid feats and abilities. You don’t gain
any of the other benefits of the order you chose.
Special You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must choose a
different order other than your own.
POISON RESISTANCE [one-action]
FEAT 2
DRUID
Your affinity for the natural world grants you protection against some of its dangers. You
gain poison resistance equal to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving
throws against poisons.
4TH LEVEL
FORM CONTROL [one-action]
FEAT 4
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Strength 14, Wild Shape
With additional care and effort, you can take on an alternate form for a longer period
of time. If your next action is to cast wild shape, wild shape’s spell level is 2 lower than
normal (minimum 1st level), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed
duration (whichever is longer). You can still Dismiss the form at any time, as permitted
by the spell.
MATURE ANIMAL COMPANION
FEAT 4
DRUID
Prerequisites Animal Companion
Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion, which grants it
additional capabilities. See the animal companion rules on page 214 for more information.
Your animal companion is better trained than most. During an encounter, even if you don’t
use the Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your
turn that round to Stride or Strike.
ORDER MAGIC
FEAT 4
DRUID
Prerequisites Order Explorer
You have delved deeper into the teaching of a new order, gaining access to a coveted order
spell. Choose an order you have selected with Order Explorer. You gain the initial order spell
from that order.
Special You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you must choose a
different order you have selected with Order Explorer.
THOUSAND FACES
FEAT 4

Your form is as mutable as the weather, changing to meet your whim. You add the forms
listed in humanoid form to your wild shape list.
WOODLAND STRIDE
FEAT 4
DRUID
Prerequisites leaf order
You can always find a path, almost as if foliage parted before you. You ignore any
difficult terrain caused by plants, such as bushes, vines, and undergrowth. Even plants
manipulated by magic don’t impede your progress.
