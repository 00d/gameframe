You can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them.
You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while
supporting your allies with your skills.
During social encounters...
When you speak, it’s with the voice of practical experience, especially involving
wilderness exploration.
While exploring...

for trouble, constantly alert for danger even when it’s not overt.

its bounty.

Some rangers believe civilization wears down the soul, but still needs to be
protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from
the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could
champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts,
haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and
are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.
