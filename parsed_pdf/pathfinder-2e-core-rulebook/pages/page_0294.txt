Consumable Magic Items
You can typically purchase holy and unholy water in
a settlement. Particularly good settlements tend to ban
unholy water and evil settlements tend to ban holy water.
Holy Water: You can throw holy water like a bomb,
dealing 1d6 good damage to fiends, undead, and other
creatures weak to good damage.
Unholy Water: You can throw unholy water like a
bomb, dealing 1d6 good damage to celestials and other
creatures weak to evil damage.
Potions
Potions are magic items you drink to gain a variety of
benefits. For more on potions, see page 562.
Minor Healing Potion: After drinking a minor healing
potion, you regain 1d8 Hit Points.
Scrolls
Scrolls are magical scriptures that hold the necessary magic
to cast a particular spell without using your spell slots.
The Price listed in the table is for a scroll with a common
1st‑level spell. For more on scrolls, see page 564.
Talismans
A talisman is a special, single-use item you affix to your
armor, a weapon, or elsewhere, allowing you to activate
the talisman later for a special benefit. For more on
talismans, see page 565.
Potency Crystal: When you affix the crystal to a weapon
and activate it, this talisman empowers the weapon for
the rest of the turn, granting it a +1 item bonus to attack
rolls and a second weapon damage die.
Formulas
Formulas are instructions for making items with the
Craft activity. You can usually read a formula as long
as you can read the language it’s written in, though you
might lack the skill to Craft the item. Often, alchemists
and crafting guilds use obscure languages or create codes
to protect their formulas from rivals.
You can buy common formulas at the Price listed on
Table 6–13, or you can hire an NPC to let you copy
their formula for the same Price. A purchased formula
is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment of light
Bulk. You can copy a formula into your formula book in
1 hour, either from a schematic or directly from someone
else’s formula book. If you have a formula, you can
Craft a copy of it using the Crafting skill. Formulas for
uncommon items and rare items are usually significantly
more valuable—if you can find them at all!
If you have an item, you can try to reverse‑engineer
its formula. This uses the Craft activity and takes the
same amount of time as creating the item from a formula
would. You must first disassemble the item. After the
base downtime, you attempt a Crafting check against the
same DC it would take to Craft the item. If you succeed,
you Craft the formula at its full Price, and you can keep
working to reduce the Price as normal. If you fail, you’re
left with raw materials and no formula. If you critically
fail, you also waste 10% of the raw materials you’d
normally be able to salvage.
The item’s disassembled parts are worth half its Price
in raw materials and can’t be reassembled unless you
successfully reverse-engineer the formula or acquire the
formula another way. Reassembling the item from the
formula works just like Crafting it from scratch; you use
the disassembled parts as the necessary raw materials.

Items with Multiple Types
If an item has multiple types of different levels, each
type has its own formula, and you need the formula for
the specific type of item you want to Craft. For example,
if you have a formula for a type I bag of holding but not
