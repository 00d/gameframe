NECKLACE OF FIREBALLS
ITEM 5+
EVOCATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Usage worn; Bulk —
This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous
red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated,
it briefly appears in its true form: a golden chain with golden
spheres attached by fine threads.
Numerous varieties of the necklace of fireballs exist. Each
has a different basic Reflex save DC and includes a combination
of spheres dealing different amounts of damage, as listed for
each type below. When all the beads are gone, the necklace
becomes a non-magical hemp string.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You detach a sphere from the
necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you
activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact
action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a fireball where it
lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere
within 70 feet, though at the GM’s discretion you might
need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually
challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of
your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.
