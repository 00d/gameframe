other powerful creatures have. Any creature that has a status bonus to saving throws
against magic reduces that bonus by 1 against your spells.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 
FEAT 6
WIZARD
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your concentration when you Cast a
Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you
succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
ADVANCED SCHOOL SPELL
FEAT 8
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane school
You gain access to a powerful new school spell depending on your arcane school. If you’re an
abjurer, you gain energy absorption; if you’re a conjurer, you gain dimensional steps; if you’re a
diviner, you gain vigilant eye; if you’re an enchanter, you gain dread aura; if you’re an evoker, you
gain elemental tempest; if you’re an illusionist, you gain invisibility cloak; if you’re a necromancer,
you gain life siphon; and if you’re a transmuter, you gain shifting form. The descriptions of these
spells are on pages 406–407. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
BOND CONSERVATION [one-action]
FEAT 8
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond
Requirements The last action you used was Drain Bonded Item.
By carefully manipulating the arcane energies stored in your bonded item as you drain it, you
can conserve just enough power to cast another, slightly weaker spell. If the next action you
use is to Cast a Spell using the energy from Drain Bonded Item, you gain an extra use of Drain
Bonded Item. You must use this extra use of Drain Bonded Item before the end of your next
turn or you lose it, and you can use this additional use only to cast a spell 2 or more levels
lower than the first spell cast with Drain Bonded Item.
UNIVERSAL VERSATILITY
FEAT 8
WIZARD
Prerequisites universalist wizard, Hand of the Apprentice
You can access the fundamental abilities of any school of magic. During your daily
preparations, choose one of the eight school spells gained by 1st-level specialist wizards.
You can use that school spell until your next daily preparations. When you Refocus, you can
choose a different school spell from among those eight school spells, replacing the previous
one. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
10TH LEVEL
OVERWHELMING ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 10
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
With a complex gesture, you alter the energy of your spell to overcome resistances. If the
next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target’s resistance
to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage
the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the
spell, such as the wall created by wall of fire. A creature’s immunities are unaffected.
QUICKENED CASTING [free-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Frequency once per day
In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If
your next action is to cast a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell that is at least 2 levels lower
