bow without changing your grip, but the other hand must
be free when you shoot. To properly wield a 1+ weapon,
you must hold it in one hand and also have a hand free.
Weapons requiring two hands typically deal more damage.
Some one-handed weapons have the two-hand trait, causing
them to deal a different size of weapon damage die when
used in two hands. In addition, some abilities require you
to wield a weapon in two hands. You meet this requirement
while holding the weapon in two hands, even if it doesn’t
require two hands or have the two-hand trait.
Group
A weapon or unarmed attack’s group classifies it with
similar weapons. Groups affect some abilities and what
the weapon does on a critical hit if you have access to
that weapon or unarmed attack’s critical specialization
effects; for full details, see page 283.
Weapon Traits
The traits a weapon or unarmed attack has are listed in
this entry. Any trait that refers to a “weapon” can also
apply to an unarmed attack that has that trait.
Ammunition
Some entries in the ranged weapons tables are followed
by an entry indicating the type of ammunition that
weapon launches. The damage die is determined by the
weapon, not the ammunition. Because that and other
relevant statistics vary by weapon, ammunition entries
list only the name, quantity, Price, and Bulk.
