GOBLIN ADVENTURERS
To some degree, almost every
goblin is an adventurer, surviving
life on the edge using skill and
wits. Goblins explore and hunt
for treasures by nature, though
some become true adventurers
in their own rights, often after
being separated from their group
or tribe.
Goblins often have the
acrobat, criminal, entertainer,
gladiator, hunter, and street
urchin backgrounds. Consider
playing an alchemist, since many
goblins love fire, or a bard, since
many goblins love songs. As
scrappy survivors, goblins are
often rogues who dart about the
shadows, though their inherently
charismatic nature also draws
them to the pursuit of magical
classes such as sorcerer.
