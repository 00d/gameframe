some combination of armor potency and resilient runes.
The following stat block provides a quick reference for
these types of armor.
MAGIC ARMOR
ITEM 5+
ABJURATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
A suit of magic armor is simply a suit of
armor or explorer’s clothing etched with
fundamental runes. An armor potency
rune increases the armor’s item bonus
to AC, and a resilient rune adds an item
bonus to saving throws.
The Prices here are for all types of armor.
You don’t need to adjust the Price from leather
armor to full plate or the like. These armors
are made of standard materials, not precious
materials such as mithral.

This armor has a +1 armor potency rune (increase the
item bonus to AC by 1).

ARMOR ALTERNATIVES
If you don’t want to wear armor, or you’re trained in
only unarmored defense, you can wear either explorer’s
clothing or bracers of armor. Explorer’s clothing can be
etched with runes just like armor can, so it can provide
item bonuses to AC or saves.
Bracers of armor give a +1 item bonus to AC with no Dex
modifier cap, and also grant a bonus to saves. This item
can be found on page 607.
