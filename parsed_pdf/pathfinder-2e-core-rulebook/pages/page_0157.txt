Class Features
You gain these abilities as a monk. Abilities gained at higher
levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies representing
your basic training, which are noted at the start of this class.
Flurry of Blows
You can attack rapidly with fists, feet, elbows, knees, and
other unarmed attacks. You gain the Flurry of Blows action.
FLURRY OF BLOWS [one-action]
FLOURISH
MONK
Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature,
combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes
normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of
Blows only once per turn.
Monk Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a monk class feat.
Powerful Fist
You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons.
The damage die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of
1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when
making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks,
because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly
force. You don’t take this penalty when making a lethal
attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats are listed in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Incredible Movement
3rd
You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status
bonus to your Speed whenever you’re not wearing armor.
The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have
beyond 3rd.
Mystic Strikes
3rd
Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues
them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks
become magical, allowing them to get past resistances
to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item
such as handwraps of mighty fists to gain an item bonus to
attack rolls or increase your attacks’ weapon damage dice.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
