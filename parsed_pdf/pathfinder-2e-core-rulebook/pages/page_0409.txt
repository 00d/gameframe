Casting Rituals
When you take charge of a ritual, you are its primary
caster, and others assisting you are secondary casters. You
can be a primary caster for a ritual even if you can’t cast
spells. You must know the ritual, and the ritual’s spell
level can be no higher than half your level rounded up.
You must also have the required proficiency rank in
the skill used for the ritual’s primary check (see Checks
below), and as the primary caster, you must attempt this
skill check to determine the ritual’s effects. The primary
skill check determines the tradition.
Rituals do not require spell slots to cast. You can
heighten a ritual up to half your level rounded up, decided
when the ritual is initiated. A ritual always takes at least
1 hour to perform, and often longer. While a ritual is a
downtime activity, it’s possible—albeit risky—to perform
a ritual during exploration with enough uninterrupted
time. A ritual’s casting time is usually listed in days. Each
day of casting requires 8 hours of participation in the
ritual from all casters, with breaks during multiday rituals
to allow rest. One caster can continue a multiday ritual,
usually with some light chanting or meditation, while the
other casters rest. All rituals require material, somatic,
and verbal components throughout their casting time.
Learning Rituals
Learning a ritual does not count against any limits on
spells in your spell repertoire or on any other normal
spellcasting ability. Rituals are never common, though if
you look hard, you can probably find someone who can
perform an uncommon ritual for you. They may still be
unwilling to teach it to you.
Cost
A ritual’s Cost entry lists valuable components required to
cast the ritual. If a ritual doesn’t have any such components,
it won’t have a Cost entry. The cost is consumed when you
attempt the primary skill check. Costs are often presented
as a base cost multiplied by the target’s level and sometimes
the spell’s level. If the target’s level is lower than 1, multiply
the cost by 1 instead. Heightened versions that increase
the base cost multiply it by the target’s level or another
value as appropriate. Most rituals that create permanent
creatures, such as create undead, use costs based on the
level of the spell, as presented on Table 7–1.
Secondary Casters
Many rituals need additional secondary casters, who also
don’t need to be able to cast spells. Unlike a primary caster,
a secondary caster doesn’t need a minimum level or skill
proficiency. The Secondary Casters entry, if present, indicates
the minimum number of secondary casters required.
Checks
At the ritual’s culmination, you must attempt the skill
check listed in the Primary Check entry to determine the
ritual’s outcome. Primary checks usually have a very hard
DC for a level that’s twice the ritual’s spell level. As with
other downtime activities, fortune and misfortune effects
can’t modify your checks for the ritual, nor can bonuses
or penalties that aren’t active throughout the process.
The GM can adjust the DCs of rituals, add or change
primary or secondary checks, or even waive requirements
to fit specific circumstances. For example, performing a
ritual in a location where ley lines converge on the night
of a new moon might make a normally difficult ritual
drastically easier.
Secondary Checks
Often, a ritual requires secondary checks to represent aspects
of its casting, usually with a standard DC for a level twice
the ritual’s spell level. A different secondary caster must
attempt each secondary check. If there are more secondary
casters than checks, the others don’t attempt any.
Secondary casters attempt their checks before you
attempt the primary check; no matter their results, the
ritual proceeds to the primary check. Secondary checks
Rituals
A ritual is an esoteric and complex spell that anyone can cast. It takes much longer to cast
a ritual than a normal spell, but rituals can have more powerful effects.
