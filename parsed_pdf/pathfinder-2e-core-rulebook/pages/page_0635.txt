Core Rulebook
634
material (spell component) 303
materials 577–579
mechanical (trait) A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object. 521, 522
Medicine (skill) Heal people and help them recover from afflictions. (Wis) 248–249
Medium (size) 473–475
mental (damage type) 452
mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object
or a mindless creature.
metamagic (trait) Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats,
tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly
before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free
actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits
of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are
part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself. 304
mindless (trait) A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental
attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental ability modifiers are –5. They are
immune to all mental effects.
minion (trait) Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature
with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. Your minion
acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it
commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s
a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain
an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single action
with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no
actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended
for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals
follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.
misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice.
You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple
misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a
fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel
each other out, and you roll normally. 449
mithral (material) 579
mode of play The three types of playing the game—encounters, exploration, and
downtime—each has a different time scale and degree of rules precision. 10–12,
468–481

the role of any monster the PCs encounter. 8
	 monster identification 238–239, 506
morph (trait) Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any
Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected
by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more
than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same
manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph
effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph
effects can be used together and which can’t.

training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s
dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name. 219
multiple attack penalty You take this penalty on all attacks after the first on your
turn. This is a –5 penalty on your second attack and –10 on all subsequent attacks
(or –4 and –8 if your weapon or unarmed attack has the agile trait). 446
multiplying 444
mutagen (trait) An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the
subject’s body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more
beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are
polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time.
