Hazard Format
Hazards are presented in a stat block format similar to
those used for monsters. A few notes regarding the format
follow the sample stat block.
HAZARD NAME
HAZARD [LEVEL]
TRAITS
Stealth This entry lists the Stealth modifier for a complex
hazard’s initiative or the Stealth DC to detect a simple
hazard, followed by the minimum proficiency rank to detect
the hazard (if any) in parentheses. If detect magic can be
used to detect the hazard, this information is located here
as well.
Description This explains what the hazard looks like and might
include special rules.
Disable The DC of any skill checks required to disable the
hazard are here; if the hazard can be counteracted, its spell
level and counteract DC are listed in parentheses.
AC the hazard’s AC; Saving Throws the hazard’s saves. Usually
only haunts are subject to Will saves.
Hardness the hazard’s Hardness; HP the hazard’s Hit Points,
with its Broken Threshold in parentheses; Immunities the
hazard’s immunities; Weaknesses the hazard’s weaknesses,
if any; Resistances the hazard’s resistances, if any
Action Type [reaction] or [free-action] This is the reaction or free action the
hazard uses; Trigger The trigger that sets off the hazard
appears here. Effect For a simple hazard, this effect is often
all the hazard does. For a complex hazard, this might also
cause the hazard to roll initiative.
Routine This section describes what a complex hazard does on
each of its turns during an encounter; the number in parentheses
after the word “Routine” indicates how many actions the hazard
can use each turn. Simple hazards don’t have this entry.
Action Any action the hazard can use appears here. Typically,
this is a melee or ranged attack.
Reset If the hazard can be reset, that information is here.
Level
The hazard’s level indicates what level of party it’s a good
challenge for. If the hazard involves a toxin, curse, or other
non-spell feature, that feature’s level is the hazard’s level.
Traits
The most notable hazard traits are trap (constructed to
harm intruders), environmental (natural hazards), and
haunt (spectral phenomena). Traps have a trait to indicate
whether they’re magical or mechanical. Hazards that have
initiative and a routine have the complex trait.
Stealth or Stealth DC
Complex hazards list their Stealth modifier, which they
use for initiative, instead of their Stealth DC. If you need
the DC, it’s equal to this modifier + 10.
Simple Hazards
A simple hazard uses its reaction only once, after which
its threat is over unless the hazard is reset.
HIDDEN PIT
HAZARD 0
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 18 (or 0 if the trapdoor is disabled or broken)
Description A wooden trapdoor covers a pit that’s 10 feet
square and 20 feet deep.
Disable Thievery DC 12 to remove the trapdoor
AC 10; Fort +1, Ref +1
Trapdoor Hardness 3, Trapdoor HP 12 (BT 6); Immunities
critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect
The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage
(typically 10 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use
the Grab an Edge reaction to avoid falling.
Reset Creatures can still fall into the trap, but the trapdoor
must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.
