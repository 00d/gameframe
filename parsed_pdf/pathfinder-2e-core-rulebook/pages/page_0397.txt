You learn a single enigmatic word connected to the creature’s
fate in that time frame. Fate is notoriously inscrutable, and the
word isn’t necessarily meant to be taken at face value, so the
meaning is often clear only in hindsight. The GM rolls a secret
DC 6 flat check. If the creature’s fate is too uncertain, or on a
failed flat check, the spell yields the word “inconclusive.” Either
way, the creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.
