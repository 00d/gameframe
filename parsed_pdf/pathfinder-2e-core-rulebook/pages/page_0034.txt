Chapter 2: Ancestries & Backgrounds
Your character’s ancestry determines which people they call their own, whether it’s diverse
and ambitious humans, insular but vivacious elves, traditionalist and family-focused
dwarves, or any of the other folk who call Golarion home. A character’s ancestry and their
experiences prior to their life as an adventurer—represented by a background—might be
key parts of their identity, shape how they see the world, and help them find their place in it.
A character has one ancestry and one background, both
of which you select during character creation. You’ll also
select a number of languages for your character. Once
chosen, your ancestry and background can’t be changed.
This chapter is divided into three parts:
•	 Ancestries express the culture your character hails
from. Within many ancestries are heritages—
subgroups that each have their own characteristics.
An ancestry provides ability boosts (and perhaps
ability flaws), Hit Points, ancestry feats, and
sometimes additional abilities.
•	 Backgrounds, starting on page 60, describe training
or environments your character experienced
before becoming an adventurer. Your character’s
background provides ability boosts, skill training,
and a skill feat.
•	 Languages, starting on page 65, let your character
communicate with the wonderful and weird
people and creatures of the world.
Ancestry Entries
Each entry includes details about the ancestry and
presents the rules elements described below (all of these
but heritages and ancestry feats are listed in a sidebar).
Hit Points
This tells you how many Hit Points your character gains
from their ancestry at 1st level. You’ll add the Hit Points
from your character’s class (including their Constitution
modifier) to this number. For more on calculating Hit
Points, see Step 7: Record Class Details, on page 25.
Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the ancestry.
Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight
range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half that.
Speed
This entry lists how far a member of the ancestry can move
each time they spend an action (such as Stride) to do so.
Ability Boosts
This lists the ability scores you apply ability boosts to
when creating a character of this ancestry. Most ancestries
provide ability boosts to two specified ability scores, plus
a free ability boost that you can apply to any other score
of your choice. For more about ability boosts, see page 20.
Ability Flaw
This lists the ability score to which you apply an ability
flaw when creating a character of this ancestry. Most
ancestries, with the exception of humans, include an ability
flaw. For more about applying ability flaws, see page 20.
Languages
This tells you the languages that members of the ancestry
speak at 1st level. If your Intelligence modifier is +1 or
higher, you can select more languages from a list given
here. More about languages can be found on page 65.
Traits
These descriptors have no mechanical benefit, but they’re
important for determining how certain spells, effects, and
other aspects of the game interact with your character.
Special Abilities
Any other entries in the sidebar represent abilities, senses,
and other qualities all members of the ancestry manifest.
These are omitted for ancestries with no special rules.
Heritages
You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed
down to you from your ancestors or common among
those of your ancestry in the environment where you were
born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can’t
change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or
ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have
more or fewer members from a particular heritage.
Ancestry Feats
This section presents ancestry feats, which allow you to
customize your character. You gain your first ancestry
feat at 1st level, and you gain another at 5th level, 9th
level, 13th level, and 17th level, as indicated in the class
advancement table in the descriptions of each class.
Ancestry feats are organized by level. As a starting
character, you can choose from only 1st-level ancestry
feats, but later choices can be made from any feat of
your level or lower. These feats also sometimes list
prerequisites—requirements that your character must
fulfill to select that feat.
