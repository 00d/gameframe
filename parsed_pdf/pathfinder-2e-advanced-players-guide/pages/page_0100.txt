PATRON’S GIFT
19TH
Your patron grants you the power to command incredible
works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and
can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting.
Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can’t be used
for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell
slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don’t
gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can
take the Patron’s Truth feat (page 105) to gain a second slot.
