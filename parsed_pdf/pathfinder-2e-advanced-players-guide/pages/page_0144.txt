spell in a slot 2 levels higher than normal. This doesn’t grant
any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell
lasts up to 10 minutes. For example, if you prepared animal
form in a 4th-level slot with Form Retention, you would cast
a 2nd-level animal form that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the
spell can be Dismissed, that doesn’t change.
12TH LEVEL
DIVINER SENSE
FEAT 12
DIVINATION
FORTUNE
WIZARD
You sense magical dangers. When using the Detect Magic
exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the
better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical
effect or magic item and is in range of your detect magic.
FORCIBLE ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 12
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
You perform complex manipulations to make the energy from
your spells so powerful that your enemies remain vulnerable
to it afterward. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that deals
acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you can select one
target that was damaged to gain weakness 5 to that damage
type until the end of your next turn. If a spell deals multiple
types of energy damage, choose one that the target gains
weakness to. This has no effect on creatures with resistance
or immunity to the energy type you choose.
18TH LEVEL
SECOND CHANCE SPELL
FEAT 18
ENCHANTMENT
WIZARD
When your target proves resilient to your magical
deceptions, you can try them again on someone else. When
you cast an enchantment spell that targets one creature
and that creature critically succeeds at its Will save, you
can Cast the Spell again before the end of your next turn on
a different creature without expending an additional spell
slot. The second casting doesn’t grant you any benefits
that you would normally gain for Casting a Spell from a
spell slot.
20TH LEVEL
SPELL MASTERY
FEAT 20
WIZARD
You have mastered a handful of spells to such a degree
that you can cast them even if you haven’t prepared them
in advance. Select any four spells of 9th level or lower
that you have access to; each spell you select must be of
a different level. These spells are automatically prepared
when you make your daily preparations, and they have
their own spell slots. You can select a different array of
spells by spending 1 week of downtime retraining your
mastered spells.
