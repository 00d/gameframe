RESOUNDING BRAVERY

Even your fears serve as fuel for your fighting spirit. When
you critically succeed at a Will save against a foe’s ability, you
gain a +1 status bonus to saves and a number of temporary Hit
Points equal to half your level for 1 minute. These benefits are
doubled if you critically succeed against a fear effect.
10TH LEVEL
CUT FROM THE AIR [reaction]
FEAT 10
FIGHTER
Trigger You are the target of a physical ranged Strike.
Requirements You’re aware of the attack, not flat-footed against
it, and either have a hand free or are wielding a melee weapon.

bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses,
you knocked or cut it out of the air.
OVERPOWERING CHARGE
FEAT 10
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Barreling Charge
You trample foes as you charge past. When you use Barreling
Charge
and
successfully
move
through a creature’s space, that
creature takes bludgeoning damage
equal to your Strength modifier. On a
critical success, the creature takes double
damage and is flat-footed until the end of
your next turn.
16TH LEVEL
OVERWHELMING BLOW [three-actions]
FEAT 16
FIGHTER
You throw your weight into a powerful attack that leaves you
vulnerable. Make a melee Strike. This counts as three attacks
when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits,
you get a critical hit. If you roll a critical hit, your attack also
gains the deadly d12 trait. Whether or not you hit, you become
stunned 1 and are flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
18TH LEVEL
SMASH FROM THE AIR
FEAT 18
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Cut From the Air
Your expertise enables you to knock away spells. You can use
Cut from the Air against ranged spell attack rolls.
20TH LEVEL
ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY
FEAT 20
FIGHTER
Prerequisites improved flexibility
Your experience keeps you on your toes, making you
adaptable to even the most dangerous challenges. When you
gain a fighter feat using combat flexibility, you gain three
fighter feats instead of two. While the first feat must still be
8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and
the third feat can be up to 18th level. You can use the first
feat to meet the prerequisites of the second or third feats and
the second feat to meet the prerequisites of the third feat.
You must meet all feats’ prerequisites. In addition, you can
adapt to the battlefield’s challenges by spending 1 hour to
train. If you do, you can reselect the feats chosen with combat
flexibility as if you had made your daily preparations. You
can’t trade out limited-use abilities that you’ve already used,
such as Determination.
