Alchemical Items
Alchemical items aren’t magical—instead, they leverage
volatile substances in careful combination to produce
exceptional results. The full rules for alchemical items begin
on page 543 of the Core Rulebook. The following table
lists alchemical items arranged by level and category, as a
reference for characters involved with alchemical crafting.

This flask holds a pressurized red-brown gas flecked

to the next Athletics check to Climb each
space. The crystals in each space crumble after the creature
leaves, whether Climbing or moving through the caltrops.

and 4 piercing splash damage.
