traveling harmlessly through living and undead creatures
between you and your target, blocked only by solid objects. If
the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that requires a spell
attack roll, your targets don’t benefit from cover provided by
living or undead creatures.

Prerequisites harmful font or healing font
Frequency once per hour
If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action
heal or harm spell to damage creatures, you can harness
the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. You
use your heal or harm spell to attempt to
counteract one effect in the spell’s area with
the chaotic, evil, good, or lawful trait. The
chosen trait must oppose one component of
your deity’s alignment; if your deity is neutral,
you can choose any one trait.
18TH LEVEL
MIRACULOUS POSSIBILITY FEAT 18
CLERIC
Your deity empowers you to perform
minor miracles, allowing you to readily
adapt to the fluctuating needs of your
duties. Once during your daily preparations,
you can use a spell slot to hold sheer divine
potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use
this spell slot to cast any spell you know from the divine spell list
that’s at least 2 levels lower than the slot you designate. The spell
acts in all ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don’t have any
particular spell prepared in that slot until you cast it.
SHARED CLARITY
FEAT 18
CLERIC
Prerequisites Premonition of Clarity
You can project your premonitions of clarity to your allies.
When you use Premonition of Clarity, allies within 15 feet of
you who failed the same saving throw against the same mental
effect can also spend their reactions to reroll the failed saving
throw with a +2 circumstance bonus.
