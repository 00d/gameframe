Saving Throw Will
You reveal a glimpse of the impossible conflicts between the
divine anathema behind your curse, forcing you to reckon
with another’s conflicts as well. You and the target each take
9d6 mental damage with a basic Will save, and the target
is stunned 1 if it critically fails its save. You get a degree of
success one better than you rolled for your saving throw.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 3d6.

Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an
affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of
healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points. You attempt to
counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has,
suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than
removing it. The target is then temporarily immune to delay
affliction for 1 day. You don’t need to have identified the name
of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it;
for instance, you couldn’t delay an ingested poison during its
onset period unless you were aware of the poison.
Heightened (+1) The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points
and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction.

Mystery lore
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 60 feet; Targets up to 6 creatures
Saving Throw Will; Duration until the start of your next turn
You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental
nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or
weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due
to Recall Knowledge or previous experience with the targets,
such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information
is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that
target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness
you chose (thus triggering the creature’s weakness), or
loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you
chose a resistance.
