WITCH
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You reshape the target’s shadow into a deadly form, such as
strangling hands, a dangerous weapon, harrying runes, or the
like, and command it to attack the target. When you Cast the
Spell, and each time you Sustain the Spell, the shadow makes
a Strike against the target. The shadow moves along with the
foe, always remaining within reach. If you Sustain the Spell
multiple times in a round, you gain this effect each time. The
shadow uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.
The shadow’s Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless
of its shape, the shadow’s Strikes deal damage equal to 1d10
plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You choose the type of
damage when you Cast the Spell, choosing from bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage. The shadow doesn’t take up
space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature
would. The shadow can’t make any attacks other than its Strike.
The shadow vanishes if the target moves into an area
of complete darkness or enters an area with light from all
directions such that the target doesn’t cast a shadow. If
another effect is controlling the target’s shadow when you
cast malicious shadow, you can attempt to counteract that
effect to temporarily take control of the shadow, but the
original effect resumes when malicious shadow ends.
