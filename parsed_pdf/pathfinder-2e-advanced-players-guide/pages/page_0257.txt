Snares
Some rangers, as well as characters with the snarecrafter
archetype (page 194), quickly set dangerous traps called
snares to catch their foes. Making them requires the
Snare Crafting feat. Full rules for snares appear on page
589 of the Core Rulebook.

The snare deals 9d8 piercing damage to the first creature
to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 31
Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is knocked aside by the snare’s
deployment, taking half damage, and is flat-footed until the
end of its next turn.
Failure The creature is captured by the cage, taking full
damage and falling prone. It is immobilized while it
remains within the cage. It can get free by Escaping
(DC 31) or by destroying the cage (Hardness 5, HP 30,
object immunities).
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature takes
double damage.

Price 180 gp
This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The
first creature to enter the square takes 5d8 piercing damage
and 5d8 slashing damage, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. On
a critical failure, the hooks piercing its flesh make the creature
immobilized until it successfully Escapes (DC 27).
Magic Consumables
Though they might last a fleeting moment, these magic
items can decide the outcome of an entire battle or
quest. You can find these magic consumables organized
by level and subcategory on the treasure tables on pages
250–251. The Core Rulebook contains full rules for
special categories of items, such as talismans, and the page
numbers where they appear can be found in the glossary
and index, starting on page 266 of this book.
ANTLER ARROW
ITEM 2
CONJURATION
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
Price 7 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] Interact
Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter
with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully
restrain their foes. When an activated antler arrow hits a
target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must
succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the
surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow
(Core Rulebook 284).
If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you
have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC
of the Athletics check increases to 15.

the feather, the creature you damaged burns with holy light. The

penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by
5. These effects last until the end of your next turn.
