Mystery battle
Cast [two-actions] or [three-actions] somatic, verbal
You gain the ability to perform a specialized combat technique
from the vast wealth of martial knowledge your mystery
provides. When you Cast this Spell, you use the action granted
by one common fighter feat from pages 144–153 of the Core
Rulebook or pages 126–127 of this book (your GM might add
feats to this list). If you Cast this Spell using 2 actions, the
granted action must be a single action, and if you Cast this
Spell using 3 actions, you can instead choose a feat that grants
a 2-action activity. The chosen feat’s level can be no higher
than heroic feat’s spell level. The feat can’t have a Frequency
entry, and you must meet its prerequisites and requirements
in order to select it.

Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible
chill to your enemy. The target is cloaked in the freezing void,
which deals 3d6 cold damage immediately and when you
Sustain the Spell on future turns, with a basic Fortitude save.
The target is fatigued for as long as the effect persists.

Mystery life
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of
healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch.
You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5
to negative damage, and your unarmed Strikes deal an extra
1d4 positive damage.
You can touch a living creature with an Interact action to
restore 6d8 Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches
you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the
same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily
immune to life-giving form’s healing for 1 minute. This is
a positive healing effect. You can’t heal yourself with
life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage
(such as an undead) that touches you or damages you
with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon
instead takes 3d4 positive damage, and it doesn’t become
temporarily immune.
You can Dismiss this spell.
Heightened (+1) Increase the Hit Points restored with an
Interact action by 1d8, the positive damage by 1, and the
resistance and weakness by 1.

Mystery life
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature other than you
Duration 1 minute
You forge a connection of life energy between you and your
target, distributing harm between both of you. When you first
Cast the Spell, the target recovers 1d4 Hit Points. The first
time each round that the target takes damage, reduce the
damage it takes by 3 (to a minimum of 0 damage). You lose 3
Hit Points each time, or the total damage dealt, if less than 3;
this damage ignores any immunities or resistances you have
and can’t otherwise be mitigated in any way.
The spell ends immediately if you fall unconscious. You can
Dismiss the spell.
Heightened (3rd) You can target 2 creatures other than
you. Increase the initial healing to 3d4 and the maximum
damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 5.
Heightened (6th) You can target 3 creatures other than
you. Increase the initial healing to 6d4 and the maximum
damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 10.
Heightened (9th) You can target 4 creatures other than
you. Increase the initial healing to 9d4 and the maximum
damage reduced and Hit Points lost to 15.
