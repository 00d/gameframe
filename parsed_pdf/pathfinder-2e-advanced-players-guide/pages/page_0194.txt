DARKNESS
EVOCATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration varies
You dance, Striding up to half your Speed. At either the start or
end of your Stride, you create an area of magical darkness in a
10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with
magical darkness that works the same way as that created
by a darkness spell of the same level. When you create the
darkness, attempt a Performance check to
dance, with a standard DC for your level, to
determine the duration of the darkness.

SHADOW ILLUSION
FOCUS 6
AUDITORY
ILLUSION
SHADOW
VISUAL
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet
Duration sustained
You create a shadowy illusion of a
creature or a stationary object, but the
illusion can exist only in an area of dim light
or darkness. The spell ends if the illusion is
ever out of an area of dim light or darkness. If the
illusion is an object, it must fit within a 20-foot burst,
and the creature can be of any size up to Gargantuan,
filling a 20-foot-by-20-foot space.
The object or creature appears to animate
naturally; it even generates the appropriate
sounds and smells, and feels believable to the
touch, though its coloring is always muted.
If the illusion is a creature, shadow
illusion has the effects of an illusory
creature spell of the same level,
except it deals 2d8 damage plus
your spellcasting ability modifier,
instead of the amount listed in
illusory creature.
Heighten (+2) The area that an illusory
object can fit in increases by 10 feet.
The damage of the illusory creature’s
Strike increases by 1d8.
SHADOW JUMP
FOCUS 5
CONJURATION
SHADOW
TELEPORTATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements You are
in dim light or darkness.
Range 120 feet
You instantly transport yourself from one shadow to another.
Teleport yourself and any items you’re wearing and holding
from your current space to a clear space you can see that’s in
dim light or darkness and within range. You can transport your
familiar with this spell, but if shadow jump would bring any
other creature with you—even if you’re carrying the creature in
an extradimensional container—the spell is disrupted.
Heightened (8th) When you arrive at your destination, you can
become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you are
no longer in an area of dim light or darkness, whichever comes
first. The invisibility is an illusion effect.
