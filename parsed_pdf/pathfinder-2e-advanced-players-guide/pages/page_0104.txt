8TH LEVEL
INCREDIBLE FAMILIAR
FEAT 8
WITCH
Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar
Your familiar is imbued with even more magic than other
familiars. You can select a base of six familiar or master
abilities each day, instead of four.
Special Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a
witch to this amount.
MURKSIGHT
FEAT 8
WITCH
Your vision pierces through non-magical fog, mist, rain, and
snow. You don’t take circumstance penalties to ranged attacks
or Perception checks caused by non-magical precipitation, and
your targeted attacks don’t require a flat check to succeed
against a target concealed only by such effects.
WITCH’S BOTTLE
FEAT 8
WITCH
Prerequisites Cauldron
You spend 10 minutes and 1 Focus Point brewing a special
potion containing the power of one of your hexes that targets
a creature. A creature that consumes this potion is targeted
by the hex. If the hex has a sustained duration and you have
cackle (page 237), you can cast cackle into the bottle just
before you seal it. If you do, the hex’s duration is extended
as if you had cast cackle the round after the hex was cast
(typically this extends the duration by 1 round). Your cackling
laugh sounds out when the potion is unsealed.
Any potion you create this way loses its power the next
time you make your daily preparations. While the potion is in
your possession, you can render it inert using a single action
that has the concentrate trait. You can’t regain the Focus Point
you spent to create the potion (or the Focus Point you spent
to cast cackle) until the potion is consumed or loses its magic.
10TH LEVEL
MAJOR LESSON
FEAT 10
WITCH
Your patron grants you even greater secrets. Choose a major,
greater, or basic lesson from the list on page 100. You gain its
associated hex, and your familiar learns the associated spell.
Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you’re 14th
level or higher, and a third time if you’re 18th level or higher.
Choose a different lesson each time.
