Your Spellcasting Style
If you’re playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider your personal
spellcasting style. Casters of different traditions have the biggest gulf in how
they cast spells, but there’s also differentiation between—and within—classes!
PREPARING YOUR SPELLS
If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you do so. Typically, arcane
spellcasters consult their books, self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters
pray to fill their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult casters
attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while referencing occult texts; and
primal casters might seek natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a
grove or underground cavern.
Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend to wake up with their
magical reserves restored. This might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a
teeming thrum throughout the body, or even a sense of impending dread or awe.
CASTING YOUR SPELLS
For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful process. For another,
it’s a moment of triumph as they outsmart their enemy with just the right trick.
The Spell Components sidebar describes how spell components might impact
the way you cast spells. Think about what they might mean for you. Do your
verbal components use your own voice? Resonate out with a different timbre
due to the magic in your words? Resemble the voice of your deity? For somatic
components, what gestures do you make? They could be abstract, like forming
quick sigils that look like hand signals. Or maybe they’re direct: pointing your
finger or raising a fist. The particulars of material components are abstracted, so
you can customize those you like best for your spells.
REFOCUSING
Your class briefly describes what you need to do to Refocus, such as communing
with a familiar for the witch or meditating for the monk. Start out with some
idea of what this looks like for you, and refine it during play. What you need to
do to Refocus is broadly defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense
in the story. One witch might share a treat to commune with their familiar, while
another might endure a lecture from their familiar on their patron’s virtues.
CHAPTER 5: SPELLS
Here you’ll find spells beyond those listed in the Core Rulebook, including ones that
dispense horrid curses, make you immune to nearly all types of harm, and manifest
mischievous monkey spirits to vex your foes! The following pages contain new magical
powers for casters of every tradition.
SPELL COMPONENTS
The rules about how spell components
work when casting are located on page
303 of the Core Rulebook. But it can
also help to understand what these
components might mean to spellcasters.
Shouting out verbal components
forces magic out into the world via a
word laden with magical power. Spells
that require only a verbal component
tend to be direct and forceful, such as
power word kill or power word stun.
Verbal components are especially
unsubtle, so spells that benefit from
stealth, such as invisibility, might not
have any verbal components in favor of
having somatic components, material
components, or both.
Somatic components, such as
twisting your hand in a complex
gesture, shape magical energy
into directed forms. While verbal
components bring forward powerful
forces, somatic components compel
those forces to obey the spellcaster’s
wishes. Spells that have only somatic
components typically have a physical
effect or require touching a creature.
Material components aren’t
ubiquitous like somatic and verbal
components. They’re used primarily for
spells with physical effects, especially
ones with a longer duration or that alter
or control a large area, such as walls or
zones of dangerous terrain. A material
component pouch typically contains
everything you need. This doesn’t mean
the materials are interchangeable,
though—one spell might need powdered
iron and another a particular gemstone.
Certain spells have focus components,
objects of concentrated power that
don’t get used up in the same way that
material components do. Essential for
shaping and attuning the magic of the
spell, these might be intriguing and
elegant items in their own right.
