ForenSic medicine
You’ve learned that in most cases, especially murders, criminals tend to leave more
evidence of the crime on the body than they’d like to believe. Information from
bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life cycle of carrion insects can
provide valuable clues that help reconstruct the scene.
You’re trained in Medicine and gain the Forensic Acumen (page 206) and Battle
Medicine (Core Rulebook 258) skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a
success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to your level, and the target
becomes temporarily immune for only 1 hour, not 1 day.
interrogAtion
People can’t help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your
firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others
talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth
of your investigations.
You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No Cause for Alarm skill feat (page
208). You can also Pursue a Lead over the course of a conversation rather than
spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1
minute or longer. For example, while trying to Make an Impression, you could
pursue the creature you’re conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead
about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also
gain the Pointed Question action.
POINTED QUESTION [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question
of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a
Diplomacy check against the creature’s Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune
for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target must directly answer your question. It doesn’t have to answer
truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature
attempts to Lie to you.
Success As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
Critical Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you
decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
INVESTIGATOR FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat.
STRATEGIC STRIKE
When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When
making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to
Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.
As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic
strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained
or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
SKILL INCREASES
2ND
You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every
level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which
you’re already trained.
