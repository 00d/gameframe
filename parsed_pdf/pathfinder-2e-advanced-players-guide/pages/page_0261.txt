Permanent Magic Items
and Runes
These peculiar or awe-inspiring magic items might be
the spoils of bold adventures or the creations of diligent
research and toil in a crafter’s workshop. As
permanent items, they can be used repeatedly
over an adventurer’s career. You can find
these permanent items organized by level
and subcategory on the treasure tables on
pages 250–251.
Full rules for special types of items, such as
staves and wands, are in the Core Rulebook,
and the page numbers where they appear can

EARTHGLIDE CLOAK
ITEM 15
EARTH
INVESTED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 6,500 gp
Usage worn cloak; Bulk —
This brown-and-gold robe covers you from head to toe. Its
weighty fabric doesn’t move with the wind, instead hanging
still as if carved of stone.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Effect You
Burrow through dirt and stone up to your land Speed, leaving
no tunnels or signs of your passing. If you end your movement
inside solid stone, you are forcibly expelled into the nearest
open area, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet
between the end of your movement and the open area.
EARTHSIGHT BOX
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
SCRYING
Price 575 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This fine wooden box is inlaid with Dwarven runes,
with hinges and a clasp of forged iron.
The box contains a few handfuls of
fine sand.
Activate 1 minute (envision, Interact);
Frequency once per day; Effect
You hold the box closed and,
while
envisioning
the
earth
around you, turn the box clockwise three
times and then give it three slow shakes. When you
open the box, the sand has arranged itself to replicate, in
miniature, the stone terrain surrounding you, to a range of
60 feet. This shows details of paths; hills; embankments;
boulders; and even artificial structures like walls, ditches,
and tunnels, as long as they’re made of stone and earth.
If you’re underground, it reveals tunnels and voids in
the earth within 60 feet at your current depth. The sand
maintains its shape until you close the box.
ENVISIONING MASK
ITEM 11
DIVINATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Price 1,200 gp
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
These strange masks consist of a thin stone hood and a
shimmering purple veil reminiscent of the pleroma aeon who
first gifted them to mortals in the hope that sharing the
means of aeon communication would reduce the
misunderstandings and conflicts among
mortal civilizations. An envisioning mask
covers your entire face, though it doesn’t
hinder your vision or other senses.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per
day; Effect You lose the ability to produce
language and instead communicate wordlessly
through a series of psychic projections. This
acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet,
but it is understandable to all creatures
regardless of whether they have a language. When
communicating with non-aeons, however, your meaning is
often vague and mysterious. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.

reemerge from any of those fires, either within the fire
or adjacent to it. If you end your movement in the fire, it
affects you as normal.
