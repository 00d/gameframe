NOCTURNAL SENSE
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites Acute Scent, or precise or imprecise scent and
low-light vision
Your senses gain even greater clarity. While raging, you gain
darkvision if you don’t already have it, and the range of your
imprecise scent increases to 60 feet.
SCOURING RAGE [free-action]
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites an instinct that allows you to change your
additional damage from Rage to a different damage type
Trigger You Rage.
You emit a powerful surge of instinctual energy when you
unleash your potential. Each adjacent creature takes damage
equal to your level (basic Fortitude save against your class DC)
of the same type as your additional damage during that Rage.
8TH LEVEL
DISARMING ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
RAGE
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You attack with enough force to knock the weapon out of
your foe’s hands. Make a melee Strike; if you hit, you can
attempt an Athletics check to Disarm that foe.
FOLLOW-UP ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You used your previous action to make a
melee Strike that missed.
Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined
to succeed. Make a Strike with the same weapon, adding the
effects of the backswing and forceful weapon traits.
FRIENDLY TOSS [two-actions]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
MANIPULATE
RAGE
Requirements You are adjacent to an ally and have one or
more hands free.
You toss your friends around the battlefield. Pick up an
adjacent ally of your size or smaller and throw them to
an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Their
movement doesn’t trigger reactions. Your ally ends this
movement on their feet and doesn’t take damage from the
fall. If your ally ends this movement within melee reach of
at least one enemy, they can make a melee Strike against an
enemy within their reach as a reaction.
INSTINCTIVE STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
MANIPULATE
RAGE
Prerequisites Acute Scent or precise or imprecise scent
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all
of your senses to pinpoint your opponent’s location. Make a
melee Strike against an opponent that isn’t hiding its scent
with an effect like negate aroma. This attack ignores any flat
check required due to the target being concealed or hidden.
10TH LEVEL
DETERMINED DASH [two-actions]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Nothing can keep you from your enemy. Stride twice. During
this movement you ignore difficult terrain, greater difficult
terrain, and any effects that would impose a penalty to
Speed. You can attempt an Athletics check instead of an
Acrobatics check to Balance when moving across narrow
surfaces or uneven ground, using the same DC. This doesn’t
prevent you from being harmed by hazardous terrain. You
can increase the number of actions this activity takes to 3 to
Stride three times instead.
IMPRESSIVE LANDING [reaction]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
Trigger You fall at least 10 feet and land on a solid surface.
You slam into the ground, shattering it around you. Treat
the fall as 10 feet shorter. You land on your feet. All
adjacent spaces become difficult terrain, and creatures in
those spaces when you land take 5 bludgeoning damage
as the debris hits them and are flat-footed until the start
of their next turn.
OVERPOWERING CHARGE
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites Barreling Charge
You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you
use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a
creature’s space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage
equal to your Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the
creature takes twice this amount of damage and becomes
flat-footed until the end of your next turn.
RESOUNDING BLOW [two-actions]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
bludgeoning damage.
You strike your enemy in the head with such force that their
ears ring. Make a melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals
damage, the target is deafened until the start of your next
turn (or for 1 minute on a critical hit).
SILENCING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
INCAPACITATION
RAGE
A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent.
Make a melee Strike against a foe. The foe must succeed at a
Fortitude save against your class DC.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It’s
stunned 1 and its speech is raspy and hard to understand.
It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic
actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the
end of its next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is stunned 3
instead of stunned 1.
