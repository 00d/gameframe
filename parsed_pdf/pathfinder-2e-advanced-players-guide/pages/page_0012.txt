CATFOLK ADVENTURERS
Catfolk delight in venturing into
unexplored areas, whether untrammeled
wildernesses or ancient dungeons.
They like finding treasures and
baubles, but for most catfolk, the
experience of the journey itself is the
true reward.
Typical catfolk backgrounds include
acrobat, artist, gambler, hunter, nomad,
and scout from the Core Rulebook, plus
bandit, courier, insurgent, outrider, and
root worker from this book. Catfolk’s
inherent curiosity and agility mean they
excel as swashbucklers, bards, fighters,
and rogues. Their love of the natural
world and drive to puzzle out secrets
of all types leads many to become
investigators, druids, or sorcerers.
