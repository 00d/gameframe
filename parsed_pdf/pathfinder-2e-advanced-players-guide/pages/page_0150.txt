Great character concepts don’t always fit neatly into a single class. If you want
to build on what your character’s class allows them to do, using an archetype
is a simple way to adapt any class to fit your vision for your character.
Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats instead of
class feats. Start by finding the archetype that best fits your character concept,
and select the archetype’s dedication feat using one of your class feat choices.
Once you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype
in place of a class feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype
feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it
replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted you a
4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only
for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats
you gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill feat instead of a class feat.
These archetype feats have the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These aren’t archetype class
feats (for instance, to determine the number of Hit Points you gain from the
Fighter Resiliency archetype feat). Each archetype’s dedication feat represents
a certain portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you select a
dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy its requirements before
you can gain another dedication feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype
dedication feat by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s list.
You can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from
that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat grants another feat, such as the alchemist’s
Basic Concoction. You must still meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
ADDITIONAL FEATS
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are
typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles.
The list of additional feats includes the feat’s name, its level, and the page
number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that
level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype’s
dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait
doesn’t have that class trait.
MULTICLASS ARCHETYPES
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into
another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication
feat if you are a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
swashbuckler can’t select the Swashbuckler Dedication feat).
SPELLCASTING ARCHETYPES
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of spellcasting, albeit delayed
compared to a character from a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype
allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of
a spellcasting class can.
CHAPTER 3: ARCHETYPES
Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an
archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers from the sentinel archetype? Are
you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you’re a medic, tending to the
fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer.
