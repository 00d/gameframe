OVERSIZED THROW [two-actions]
FEAT 4
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You have one or more hands free.
With a great heave, you seize a piece of your surroundings,
such as a boulder, log, table, wagon, or chunk of earth, and
hurl it at your foes. The object must be your size or one size
smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk for
you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged Strike with the
object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same
amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a
simple ranged weapon that deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage,
has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon
trait. The damage increases to 2d10 if you have weapon
specialization in simple weapons, or 3d10 if you have greater
weapon specialization.

Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail, but don’t critically fail, a Perception check or
a skill check.
Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the
spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are
raging. Sometimes they’re even helpful. You can heed the
spirits’ guidance to reroll the triggering check, using the second
result even if it’s worse.

Prerequisites Acute Scent or precise or imprecise scent
Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always
rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your
vision is compromised. When you target a concealed or
hidden opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC
of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a
hidden one.
