Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but
you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In
your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield
between you and your enemies. You’ve focused your
training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself
and those around you.
Additional Feats: 6th Shielded Stride (Core Rulebook
146); 8th Reflexive Shield (Core Rulebook 148), Shield
Warden (Core Rulebook 149); 10th Quick Shield
Block (Core Rulebook 149); 12th Mirror Shield (Core
Rulebook 151)
BASTION DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Shield Block
You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You
gain the Reactive Shield fighter feat (Core Rulebook 145).
This fulfills any prerequisites requiring Reactive Shield
as normal.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the bastion archetype.
DISARMING BLOCK [free-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger You Shield Block a melee Strike made with
a held weapon.
You attempt to Disarm the creature whose
attack you blocked of the weapon they
attacked you with. You can do so even if
you don’t have a hand free.
NIMBLE SHIELD HAND
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You are so used to wielding a shield that you
can do so even while using the hand that’s holding
it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a
shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of
the Interact action. You can also hold another
object in this hand (but you still can’t use it to
wield a weapon). This benefit doesn’t apply to tower
shields, which are still too cumbersome.
DESTRUCTIVE BLOCK
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense
of your shield. When you Shield Block, you can reduce
the damage to yourself by double the shield’s Hardness,
but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount
of damage it would have taken (before applying its
Hardness). You can’t use Destructive Block if your shield
can’t be broken or destroyed, such as if you’re using an
indestructible shield.
SHIELD SALVATION
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after
a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to
damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains
intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened
until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from
using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your
next preparations.
