OPPORTUNE RIPOSTE [reaction]
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger A foe within your reach critically fails a Strike against you.
You take advantage of an opening from your enemy’s fumbled attack. You either make a
melee Strike against the triggering foe or attempt to Disarm it of the weapon it used for
the Strike.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this
either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or
to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master
in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.
STYLISH TRICKS
3RD
At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for
Acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler’s style.
VIVACIOUS SPEED
3RD
When you’ve made an impression, you move even faster than normal, darting about
the battlefield with incredible speed. Increase the status bonus to your Speeds when
you have panache to a +10-foot status bonus; this bonus increases by 5 feet at 7th,
11th, 15th, and 19th levels. When you don’t have panache, you still get half this status
bonus to your Speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.
You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting
an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out
below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th
level and every 4 levels thereafter.
WEAPON EXPERTISE
5TH
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your
proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons
for which you have expert proficiency.
EVASION
7TH
You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon’s breath, and worse.
Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
7TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You
deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4 if you’re legendary.
EXEMPLARY FINISHER
9TH
You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to
your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the
following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler’s style.
