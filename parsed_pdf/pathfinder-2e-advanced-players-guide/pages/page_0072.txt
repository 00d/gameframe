SIGNATURE SPELLS
3RD
Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of
that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn
heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a
signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when
you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower).
You can also retrain specifically to change a signature
spell to a different spell of that level without swapping
any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell
normally does.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
EXPERT SPELLCASTER
7TH
The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer
over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack
rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
RESOLVE
7TH
You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
MAGICAL FORTITUDE
9TH
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
ALERTNESS
11TH
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
MAJOR CURSE
11TH
You’ve learned to better balance the conflicting powers
wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after
completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are
affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses
to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This
effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to
its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under
the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by
your curse.
