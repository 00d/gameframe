Elf Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL LINGUISTICS
FEAT 1
ELF
Prerequisites at least 100 years old
Over your extensive lifespan, you’ve studied many
languages. During your daily preparations, you
can recede into old memories to become fluent in
one common language or one other language you
have access to. You know this language until you
prepare again. Since this knowledge is temporary,
you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a permanent
character option.
ELVEN ALOOFNESS
FEAT 1
ELF
As much as you might care for
them, you’ve come to terms with
the ephemeral nature of non-elves,
and it makes their threats feel less
troublesome. If a non-elf rolls a failure on
a check to Coerce you using Intimidation, it gets a critical
failure instead (and thus can’t try to Coerce you again for 1
week). When a non-elf attempts to Demoralize you, you
become temporarily immune for 1 day, instead of 10 minutes.
KNOW YOUR OWN
FEAT 1
ELF
You’ve spent countless hours studying the history of elves
on your world and beyond and are a studied expert in
your people’s ways. If you critically fail a check to Recall
Knowledge about elves, elven society, or elven history, you
get a failure instead.
5TH LEVEL
ANCESTRAL SUSPICION
FEAT 5
ELF
Long-lived elves have seen civilizations rise and fall, often at
the hands of outside forces. As a result, they have developed
a wariness of others who might seek to influence or control
them. You’ve been trained to resist such manipulation, gaining
a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects
that would make you controlled, such as dominate, and to
Perception checks to Sense Motive when trying to determine
if a creature is under the influence of such an effect. When
you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect,
you get a critical success instead.
MARTIAL EXPERIENCE
FEAT 5
ELF
You’ve crossed blades with a wide variety of foes wielding
a wide variety of weapons, and you’ve learned the basics
of fighting with nearly any of them. When wielding a
weapon you aren’t proficient with, treat your level as your
proficiency bonus.
At 11th level, you become trained in all weapons.
9TH LEVEL
OTHERWORLDLY ACUMEN
FEAT 9
ELF
Prerequisites at least one innate spell gained
from an elf ancestry feat
The arcane magic you possess grows in power
and complexity. Choose one common 2nd-level
spell from the same tradition as an innate
spell you previously gained from another
elf ancestry feat (from the arcane list if you
have Otherworldly Magic, for example).
You can cast that spell as an innate
spell once per day, using the same
tradition as the list you chose the
spell from.
Your magic is adaptable. By spending 1 day
of downtime, you can change the spell you chose to a
different common 2nd-level spell from the same tradition.
TREE CLIMBER
FEAT 9
ELF
You’ve spent much of your life among the treetops and have
become an expert at quickly and safely climbing them. You
gain a climb Speed of 10 feet.
13TH LEVEL
AVENGE ALLY [one-action]
FEAT 13
ELF
FORTUNE
Frequency once every 10 minutes
Requirements You are adjacent to an ally with the dying
condition.
Though you know that you will eventually outlive your
companions, seeing them at death's door brings clarity to your
attacks. Make a Strike. Roll twice on the attack roll and use
the higher result.
17TH LEVEL
MAGIC RIDER
FEAT 17
ELF
Your people used powerful magic to travel between
distant worlds, and the remnants of that magic make such
transportation easier for you. When you are the target of
a teleportation spell that transports more than one person,
it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit,
chosen by the caster. Additionally, when you’re the target of a
teleport spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than
1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.
