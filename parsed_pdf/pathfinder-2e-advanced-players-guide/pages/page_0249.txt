NEW WEAPON TRAITS
The weapons in this section use the following new traits,
in addition to those found on pages 282–283 of the
Core Rulebook.
Concealable: This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous
or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with
this trait.
Ranged Trip: The weapon can be used to Trip with
the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon’s first
range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. You can add the weapon’s item bonus to attack
rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee
weapon to Trip, a ranged trip weapon doesn’t deal any
damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears
only on a thrown weapon.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
Bola: This throwing weapon consists of weights tied to
the end of long cords, which can be used to bludgeon
foes or entangle their legs.
Claw Blade: The three parallel blades of this handheld
weapon extend between the fingers to resemble the natural
claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a
way for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to
share the fighting customs of their kin.
Daikyu: This asymmetrical bow, made of laminated
bamboo, wood, and leather, stands 6 feet or more in
height. Using a daikyu while mounted limits its firing
range to your left side.
Khakkara: This staff is topped by a pointed metal
circle from which hang several smaller rings that jingle
and clang noisily as the staff is moved, allowing you to
announce your presence and scare off wild animals as
you walk.
Sword Cane: This slender, rapier-like sword is
concealed within a wooden or metal cane that serves as
a sheath, making it an inconspicuous weapon easy to
slip past inspections or into high-society events. A sword
cane is typically 4 feet long when sheathed, and its hilt is
usually capped with a wooden or metal decoration.
Tengu Gale Blade: This fan-shaped sword, designed
by members of the tengu ancestry, has five broad blades
that join at its hilt. Tengu sailors also use gale blades as
makeshift weather vanes, as the sword spins to show the
wind’s direction when loosely held aloft.
Wakizashi: This short-bladed, single-edged sword is
typically carried as part of a pair alongside a katana.
