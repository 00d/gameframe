INTRODUCTION
Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. The Core
Rulebook provides classic options to play a countless variety of customizable characters.
This book expands those core options, giving you even more ways to play the character
you want!
More of Everything
The Advanced Player’s Guide expands upon the options
for player characters provided in the Pathfinder Core
Rulebook. Along with the new ancestries and classes
summarized on the following page, there are also expanded
rules for the existing ancestries and classes. Following
these new options is an entire chapter of new archetypes,
including multiclass archetypes for the four new classes as
well as a huge selection of archetypes suitable for any
character. New backgrounds, additional general feats
and skill feats, and a bevy of new spells, equipment, and
treasure round out your character’s adventuring kit.
How to Use This Book
The options in this book expand upon the rules
contained in the Core Rulebook, and that book is
required to use the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide.
Some rules of this book indicate other material found
in this book with page references. Other products
referencing the rules in this book may do so using the
superscript citation “APG.”
ACCESS ENTRIES
Sometimes, a stat block for an uncommon rules element
includes an Access entry that lists specific criteria. A
character who meets the criteria listed in the Access
entry, such as hailing from a particular locale or being
a member of a particular organization, gains access to
the rules element. For instance, a draconic bloodline
sorcerer gains access to the dragon disciple archetype
(page 168), even though the archetype is uncommon.
As always, the GM has the final say on who can
access uncommon or rarer options, or whether specific
options are allowed in the game at all. They may decide
that a character’s upbringing or abilities make sense for
a specific rules option and grant them access even if the
character doesn’t automatically qualify, or they may
decide that same option can’t be taken by anyone at all.
