Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Your body becomes fluid to better suit your surroundings.
When you Cast this Spell, choose whether to become air,
water, or mist. The spell gains the air trait if you choose air
or mist, and the water trait if you choose water or mist. You
become amorphous, as does your armor. You lose any item
bonus to AC and use your proficiency bonus for unarmored
defense to determine your AC. You also gain resistance 10 to
physical damage and become immune to precision damage.
You can slip through tiny cracks and don’t need to breathe.
You can’t cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have
the attack or manipulate trait. You also gain the following
effects based on your form.
• Air You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet and become invisible
while you are in the air. You can create the effects of a
gust of wind from your space as a 2-action activity, which
has the manipulate trait.
• Mist You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet, and it becomes hard
to see through you. Any creature on one side of your
space who is targeted by a creature on the opposite side
is concealed to the targeting creature.
• Water You gain a swim Speed of 20 feet and become
invisible while you are in the water. You can electrically
charge yourself by taking a single action, which has the
manipulate trait. If you do, you are no longer invisible
in the water due to electricity indicating your location,
but any creature that makes a melee attack against you
takes 1d6 electricity damage; if it touches you, this is
cumulative with the damage from your major curse.
Heightened (+2) Increase the resistance by 5 and the
electricity damage from the charged water form by 1.
