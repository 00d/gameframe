DARKVISION
You can see in darkness and dim light
just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is
in black and white.
DRACONIC EXEMPLAR
You draw minor powers from your
draconic exemplar. Choose a type
of chromatic or metallic dragon to
be your exemplar. This determines
your scale color and appearance,
and dragons sometimes look more
favorably upon those kobolds
who resemble them, at the GM’s
discretion. Your exemplar may also
determine details of other abilities
you have, using the Draconic
Exemplars table.
dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt
laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar’s personality.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and
rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful
neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.
Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity
assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar’s
order or Shelyn’s artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and
other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also
common subjects of worship (for more about these two deities, see Pathfinder
Lost Omens Gods and Magic page 130). Kobolds also often find themselves
drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.
NAMES
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as
they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables
to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have
surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they
typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.
Sample NameS
Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka,
Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz
Kobold Heritages
Proud, opportunistic, and crafty, kobolds manifest draconic power and
diminutive tenacity. Choose one of the following kobold heritages at 1st level.
CAVERN KOBOLD
You hatched into a warren among narrow tunnels and countless kin. Your
body is flexible. When Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone
features, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical
success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb).
This doesn’t affect you if you’re using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an
Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
DRAGONSCALED KOBOLD
Your scales are especially colorful, possessing some of the same resistance a
dragon possesses. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1)
to the damage type associated with your draconic exemplar (see Table 1–1).
Double this resistance against dragons’ Breath Weapons.
