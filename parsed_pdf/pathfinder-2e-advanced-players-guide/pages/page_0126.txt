regarding the spell at the time you cast it. Within the next 10
minutes, you can direct your sown spell to sprout and produce
the spell’s effects as a reaction, which is triggered when a
creature enters the sown spell’s space or a square adjacent to
it. You can have only one sown spell at a time, and if you don’t
trigger the spell within 10 minutes, it dissipates and the spell
is lost. A creature can notice the sown spell with a successful
