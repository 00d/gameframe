Human Ancestry Feats
5TH LEVEL
SENSE ALLIES
FEAT 5
HUMAN
Like many humans raised in a close-knit
community, you have always been strongly
attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies
that you are aware of within 60 feet that would
otherwise be undetected by you are instead
hidden from you. The flat check for you to target
willing allies within 60 feet that are hidden from
you is 5 instead of 11.
9TH LEVEL
GROUP AID
FEAT 9
HUMAN
Your
upbringing
emphasized
teamwork and helping your allies
comes naturally to you. After you
Aid an ally at a skill check that doesn’t have the
attack trait, you can also Aid any other ally who
attempts the same skill check for the same purpose that round.
You do so as a free action rather than a reaction.
The preparation you did to help must still apply to the other
allies, and you can Aid each ally only once. For example, if
you helped lift up an ally to Aid them on an Athletics check to
scale a wall, you could keep the same posture to give a boost
to other allies attempting to scale the wall in the same round.
HARDY TRAVELER
FEAT 9
HUMAN
There’s no journey too far or burden too heavy when your
friends are at your side. Increase your maximum and
encumbered Bulk limits by 1. In addition, you gain a +10-foot
circumstance bonus to your Speed during overland travel.
13TH LEVEL
ADVANCED GENERAL TRAINING
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Over the course of adventuring, your adaptability has let you
pick up numerous useful abilities. You gain a general feat of
7th level or lower. You must meet the feat’s prerequisites.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a
different feat each time.
BOUNCE BACK [free-action]
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Frequency once per day
Trigger You lose the dying condition.
You recover from near-death experiences with astounding
resilience. Don’t increase the value of your wounded condition
due to losing the dying condition.
STUBBORN PERSISTENCE
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Humans are renowned for their ability to persist through
the most grueling of trials. When you would
become fatigued, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On
a success, you aren’t fatigued. If the fatigued
condition has an underlying cause that
you don’t address, such as lack of rest, you
must attempt the check again at an interval
determined by the GM until you fail the flat
check or address the underlying cause.
17TH LEVEL
HEROIC PRESENCE [one-action]
FEAT 17
EMOTION
HUMAN
MENTAL
Frequency once per day
The blood of heroes courses through
your veins, and you inspire your allies
to dig deep and find a new level of
resolve. You grant up to 10 willing creatures within 30
feet the effects of a 6th-level zealous conviction, though
the effect automatically ends on a target if you give that
target a command they would normally find repugnant. This
action has the auditory trait or visual trait, depending on how
you inspire your allies.
Half-Elf Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
EARNED GLORY
FEAT 1
HALF-ELF
Elves are often skeptical of their half-elven kin, and you are
experienced at telling stories of your accomplishments to
gain their respect. You are trained in Performance. If you
would automatically become trained in Performance (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Impressive Performance feat (Core Rulebook 262).
When you attempt a Performance check to Make an Impression
on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
9TH LEVEL
PINCH TIME
FEAT 9
HALF-ELF
One of your parents has a human life span and another
an elven life span, with your own somewhere between. As
a result, you have an unusual perspective on time, which
you’ve learned to manifest to aid yourself in moments of
stress. You gain haste as a 3rd-level arcane innate spell,
though you can target only yourself. You can Cast this Spell
once per day.
