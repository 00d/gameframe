Hex CantripS
Hex cantrips are special hexes that don’t cost Focus Points,
so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still
cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition
to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and
aren’t counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex
cantrips are determined by your patron theme (page 99).
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
WITCH FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
witch class feat (page 100).
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
MAGICAL FORTITUDE
5TH
Your patron’s power boosts your physical resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
EXPERT SPELLCASTER
7TH
You’ve learned to better control the power your patron has
granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and
spell DCs for your witch spellcasting increase to expert.
LIGHTNING REFLEXES

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.
ALERTNESS

You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
WEAPON EXPERTISE

Through sheer experience, you’ve improved your
technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for
simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
