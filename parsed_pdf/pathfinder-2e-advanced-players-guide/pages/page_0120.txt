When you use your champion’s reaction against a celestial,
the extra damage you deal with Strikes increases by 1 (or by
2 at 9th level and by 3 at 16th level).
4TH LEVEL
ACCELERATING TOUCH
FEAT 4
CHAMPION
Prerequisites devotion spell (lay on hands)
Your healing energies are infused with bounding energy. A
creature that recovers Hit Points from your lay on hands
gains a +10-foot status bonus to its Speed until the end of
its next turn.
AURA OF DESPAIR
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites tenets of evil
Your presence as an avatar of evil makes your foes more
susceptible to terror and makes it almost impossible for
them to shake off fear when you are near. Enemies within
15 feet of you take a –1 circumstance penalty to saving
throws against fear. In addition, an enemy that ends its turn
within 15 feet of you can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1.
CRUELTY [one-action]
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites devotion spell (touch of corruption)
The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the
strength from your enemy’s body. If your next action is to
cast touch of corruption on a living creature, the target is
also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute if it fails its save (enfeebled 2
if it critically fails).
6TH LEVEL
CORRUPTED SHIELD
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
DIVINE
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Prerequisites divine ally (shield), tenets of evil
Your shield ally is more than just a spirit of protection—
it’s a conduit for deadly divine magic. When you use
your shield ally to Shield Block a melee unarmed attack
or a melee weapon Strike from an adjacent creature, the
attacker takes 1d6 evil or negative damage (your choice). If
the attack or Strike breaks or destroys your shield, double
this additional damage.
The damage the attacker takes increases to 2d6 at 11th
level and 3d6 at 16th level.
INVIGORATING MERCY
FEAT 6
CHAMPION
Prerequisites Mercy
Your divine touch rejuvenates the weak and tired. When you
use Mercy, you can instead attempt a counteract check
to remove the clumsy or enfeebled conditions, using
the source of that condition to determine the counteract
level and DC. If the condition was caused by an
ongoing effect and you don’t remove that effect,
the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
SMITE GOOD [one-action]
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites divine ally (blade), tenets of evil
Your blade ally shares your lust for the blood of
good creatures. Select one enemy you can see.
Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes
against that foe using the weapon your blade ally
inhabits deal an extra 4 evil damage, increasing
to 6 if you have master proficiency with
this weapon.
If the chosen enemy attacks you before
the start of your next turn, the duration
extends to the end of that enemy’s next turn.
