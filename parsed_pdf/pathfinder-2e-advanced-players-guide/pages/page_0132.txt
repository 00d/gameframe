Prerequisites Monastic Archer Stance, Stunning Fist
Requirements You are in Monastic Archer Stance and wielding
a bow usable with that stance.
You string three arrows to your bow and fire them all at once.
Make three ranged Strikes against a single target with the
required weapon, each using your current multiple attack
penalty, and you take an additional –2 penalty. This counts as
two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and
you combine the attacks’ damage for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses. Your Stunning Fist benefit applies to Triangle
Shot, even though it isn’t a Flurry of Blows. If all three Strikes
hit, the target takes 3d6 persistent bleed damage.
