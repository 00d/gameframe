with two common cantrips of your choice from your chosen
patron’s tradition, but aside from the tradition, you don’t gain
any other effects the patron would usually grant. Your familiar
has one less familiar ability than normal. You gain the Cast a
Spell activity. You can prepare one cantrip each day from your
familiar. You’re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs from
your patron’s tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for witch
archetype spells is Intelligence, and they are witch spells of your
patron’s tradition. You become trained in the skill associated
with the patron’s tradition; if you were already trained in it, you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
