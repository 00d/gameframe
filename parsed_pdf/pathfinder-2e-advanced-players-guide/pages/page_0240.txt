NUDGE FATE
CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
DIVINATION
HEX
WITCH
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You read slightly into the future and give fate a tiny push
to achieve the result you desire. Once during the duration,
when the target fails an attack roll, skill check, or saving
throw and a +1 status bonus would turn a critical failure
into a failure, or failure into a success, you grant the target
a +1 status bonus to the check retroactively, changing the
outcome appropriately. The spell then ends, and the target is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
If you cast nudge fate while a previous casting of this hex is
still in effect, the previous effect ends.

them some of the benefits of a day’s passage. The target
decreases the values of any doomed and drained conditions
it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw

less. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
