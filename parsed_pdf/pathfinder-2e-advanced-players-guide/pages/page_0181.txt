Marshal
Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals
can come from any class or background, though they
all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for
the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from
the front, sword and shield raised, while others may
call instructions and encouragements from the rear
while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support.
Regardless of their preferred method of combat,
marshals’ ability to bring the best out in every ally is a
valuable addition to any group.
