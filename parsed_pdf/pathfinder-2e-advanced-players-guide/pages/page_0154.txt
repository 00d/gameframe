Swashbuckler
You fight with flair and style, adding swashbuckling
tricks to your combat repertoire.
MULTICLASS SWASHBUCKLER CHARACTERS
The swashbuckler archetype is a great fit for martial
characters who want to be a bit flashier or for
Charisma-based spellcasters who want to add a bit of
dramatic flair to their routine. Multiclass swashbucklers
work especially well for characters who already wanted
to perform the actions associated with gaining panache,
such as a monk or barbarian with the gymnast style or
a braggart, battledancer, or wit-style bard.
