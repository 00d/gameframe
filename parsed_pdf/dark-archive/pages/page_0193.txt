Loop 2: As Loop 1, but the Diplomacy DC is only 22.
Loop 3: He begs the PCs to investigate immediately
and comes along with them.
Exploring Belowdecks
Starting from Loop 1, Rui begins to regain
his memories. While he resists letting them
explore, it becomes easier to convince
him to let them belowdecks. The
characters only have an hour before
the morrowkin returns, forcing
them to return in a subsequent
loop to continue investigating.
All
doors
belowdecks
are
unlocked unless stated otherwise.
Event 1: The Morrowkin

Extreme 10
After an hour has passed in any
time loop, read the following.
As the last glow of the setting sun
leaves the bay, it’s replaced by the
flash and bang of fireworks in the
sky, launched from the nearby
luxury Dragonhead district. Startled
by the sudden noise, a woman drops
a copper cup of baijiu, which clangs
against the table, then the ground. Suddenly, a strange
humanoid form with no distinct features appears on
the dining deck, bathed in scintillating purple light.
Images of haunted faces ripple slowly across its
body. Though it has no mouth, it speaks as it
raises its hands toward the guests.
“We’ve come for your futures,” it hisses.
If the PCs aren’t on the deck when the
event occurs, they hear the fireworks,
the crashing cup, and screaming as the
morrowkin swiftly dispatches those
in its way before chasing the PCs into
the belly of the Golden Fortune.

Disgusted by Food The morrowkin eats dreams and potential, not
food. A creature that spends an action to brandish food at the
morrowkin automatically makes the creature sickened 1 (or
increases its sickened value by 1, to a maximum of sickened 6),
decreasing the morrowkin’s AC, attack rolls, saves, skills, and
ability DCs accordingly, as normal for the sickened condition.
The morrowkin can’t retch to reduce its sickened condition.
Endless If reduced to 0 Hit Points or incapacitated for more
than a few rounds, the morrowkin vanishes. In 1 minute,
it reappears refreshed completely as if the previous battle
never happened, with full HP, with all effects on it cleared,
and with its Swallow Future ability ready to use again.
AC 34; Fort +28, Ref +25, Will +25
HP 320
Speed 35 feet
Melee [one-action] claw +29 (agile, finesse, reach 10), Damage
3d8+14 slashing plus drain potential
Drain Potential (misfortune, negative) The morrowkin
tries to drain the motivation from its target, who
must attempt a DC 31 Fortitude save. If the target
fails, it is doomed 1 (doomed 2 on a critical failure)
and must roll twice and use the worse result on
all checks for 1 minute. Creatures wearing a
hope talisman are unaffected.
Swallow
Future
[two-actions]
(mental,
necromancy, negative) The morrowkin
inhales and draws forth the future
deeds of all creatures
around it. All creatures
within a 30-foot
emanation of the
morrowkin take
6d8+18 mental
damage and must
attempt a DC 39 Will save. The morrowkin can’t
Swallow Future again for 1 minute. Creatures
wearing hope talismans can choose to let their
hope talisman break in order to ignore the effect
after seeing the result of their Will save.
Critical Success The creature takes no damage.
Success The creature takes half damage and is
doomed 1.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is doomed 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and
becomes doomed 4 (likely causing it to die immediately).
Tomorrow’s Fury [two-actions] The morrowkin makes claw attacks
against any number of targets within reach. The claw
attacks count against the morrowkin’s multiple attack
penalty, but don’t apply the penalty until after all attacks
have been made.
LOOPS
This adventure takes place in a small area that the
players pass through on multiple time loops. When
there are changes in an area during a loop, there will
be a “Loop” entry followed by a number to indicate
which loop the PCs are in. The PCs’ first time on the
ship is “Loop 0,” so “Loop 1” refers to the second time
they are on the ship. After Loop 3, if the PCs are
defeated again, they are ejected from the time loop
with their potential futures devoured; while this is
not fatal, they leave the ship listless and apathetic,
unable to continue their adventures.
