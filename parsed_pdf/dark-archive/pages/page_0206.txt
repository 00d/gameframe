MALLEABLE MOVEMENT [free-action]
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication, expert in Athletics
Trigger You Leap.
You shift the shape of your weapon to help you Leap farther
and faster. You shift your weapon into a long flexible pole,
climbing hook, or similar aid, adding an extra 5 feet to the
distance you’re able to Leap. As normal, this can’t increase the
distance of your Leap beyond your Speed.
GHOST BLADE [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You alter your weapon’s phase so it can more easily strike
incorporeal creatures. Your mind weapon gains the effects of a
ghost touch property rune for 1 minute.
JUST THE TOOL [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You temporarily change your weapon’s shape to assist you in
the field. You morph your weapon into a single simple tool,
such as a shovel or crowbar, to help with a mundane task. You
can’t replicate entire tool kits with this ability. You can use this
action again to change your mind weapon back to a weapon.
MENTAL FORGE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
Your experiences in combat shape your mind’s capability to
strengthen and shape your weapon to match the way you
move in combat. Choose two of the following weapon traits to
give your mind weapon: grapple, modular (B, P, S), nonlethal,
shove, or trip. Once chosen, these weapon traits can’t be
changed unless you spend 1 week retraining your fighting
style to swap one property for another from the list.
MIND SHARDS [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind
weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind.
You concentrate and unleash a 15-foot cone that deals 3d6
mental damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Will
save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After
the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you
can’t use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards’ damage
increases by 1d6 at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.
MALLEABLE MENTAL FORGE
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mental Forge
You open your mind to further weapon customization. During
your daily preparations, you can choose any two weapon
traits from the Mental Forge feat to place on your weapon
for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations (whichever
comes first), replacing the traits you chose from the Mental
Forge feat. Each day you can swap the choices with any other
options on the list.
MIND PROJECTILES
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You have learned to stretch your mind’s influence further,
releasing projectiles with a swing of your mind weapon. You
can make ranged mind weapon Strikes; these are ranged
Strikes with a maximum range of 30 feet that deal 1d6
damage of the same type as your mind weapon. Your ranged
mind weapon Strike gains all the benefits of your mind
weapon’s runes as long as they still apply to a ranged weapon.
For example, if your weapon had +1, striking, and spell storing
runes, you would get a +1 item bonus to hit with your ranged
mind weapon Strike, and it would deal the additional damage
from the striking rune, but it wouldn’t be able to unleash a
spell from the spell storing rune, as that rune can be etched
onto only melee weapons.
RUNIC MIND SMITHING
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You focus your mind on thoughtforms of fundamental magical
forces, shaping them into a property rune that you mentally
etch onto your mind weapon. During your daily preparations,
choose one rune from the following list of weapon property
runes: corrosive, disrupting, flaming, frost, shock, and
thundering. You enhance your weapon with the chosen rune
until your next daily preparations. This rune counts toward
your maximum limit of runes as normal.
METALLIC ENVISIONMENT
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You always account for every weakness, allowing your mind
to imagine just the right physical form to take advantage
of your opponents. Choose between cold iron or silver; all
your mind weapon Strikes are treated as the chosen type
of metal.
ADVANCED RUNIC MIND-SMITHING
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Runic Mind Smithing
Your mind can hold onto more complicated patterns than ever
before. You can etch the greater forms of any runes on the list
from the Runic Mind Smithing feat and add them to the list of
options you can choose during your daily preparations, as well
as the anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy runes.
In addition, once per day, you can spend 10 minutes of
uninterrupted focus to swap your daily prepared rune from
Runic Mind Smithing to another rune from the same list. Once
this swap is made, that second rune remains on the weapon
until your next daily preparations.
