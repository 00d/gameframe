Cryptids aren’t simply monsters, but rather beings that
chafe against our sense of what’s possible or right. Their
very nature refuses logic. They’re frayed threads of a
larger tapestry. Perhaps they made sense with the whole
once, but no longer, now simply disparate dead ends.
Cryptids occupy the minds of the general populace,
and from there they’re witnessed, or perhaps birthed.
For instance, the ever-popular “Mosquito Witch” of
Shimmerford. Our time there, just after the Archive
disbanded when a hoax involving the cryptid entered the
Chronicles, was largely spent accosted by locals peddling
merchandise or self-proclaimed “cryptozoologists”
chattering like summer cicadas. But it seemed clear to us
something deeper was going on. In fact, the Mosquito
Witch stories diverged into three different broad paths,
each internally consistent but contradictory to the
other two. Is this the case of three different cryptids, or
perhaps one cryptid whose storyline diverged at some
point in the past?
What determines popularity? Behavior? Appearance?
Look at too many cryptids and suddenly normal animals
appear strange. Study drawings of the Sandpoint Devil
and an ordinary horse seems threatening. The Melfesh
Monster’s plantlike features only serve to emphasize
the danger it represents. Perhaps it’s inevitable the most
famous of all are those cryptids, like the Sandpoint
Devil, that intentionally leave behind scarred survivors
to tell their tales. On the other end are cryptids that have
thus far gone unnoticed in the academic community.
Noted below are four cryptids that, to our knowledge,
haven’t been documented elsewhere.
THE IRONBOUND SIREN
I must admit few things unnerve me so much as open
waters. Sometimes it feels as though as far as the sky
stretches up to the stars, so mirrors the ocean down.
And while the prospect of discovering the unknown
excites me, I’m equally terrified of what lurks below.
EYES IN THE FOREST,
TRACKS IN THE MUD
On Cryptids and other Strange Creatures
Fear gnaws at the back of our minds always, taking shape in the corners of our vision
and rustling into the shapes we dare not envision. We’ve spent a great deal of time
investigating legend given form, born from nowhere and nursed by rumor, and each
time we think we’ve seen all the creatures our world has to offer, more crawl forth.
