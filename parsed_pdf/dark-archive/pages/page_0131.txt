Changes: When the painting’s magic activated, it did
more than suck in Liro and vanish. Each PC has been
affected by a strange change, which you should assign and
communicate to them privately. Choose from among
the following potential changes, though the first
is required. Make sure to tell the players to
keep their change a secret from the other
players. Choose the PC to replace with
Ogkrix carefully. The ideal candidate is a
player who would enjoy roleplaying as a
duplicate for a time and a character whose
absence wouldn’t wreck the party if they
discover Ogkrix early. If you choose a
character with daily resources, such as a
spellcaster, they’ll also get to feel awesome
when they return in the final fight with all
their spells. The player might also want to
fake a change similar to those the other
PCs go through to better fit in.
•	 A PC is sucked into the
painting and replaced by a
mirror double. This creature
is a disguised blood painter
named Ogkrix (page 128), drawn to
the manor by the cursed reputation of the
painting. Ogkrix hopes the PCs will take the
brunt of the effects from the curse and haunted house
while he steals the painting for his collection. The PC’s
stats don’t change when they’re replaced by the mirror
double. Ogkrix’s illusion magic is augmented by the
strange magic of the house itself to transform him fully
into an ideal copy of the PC. The double attempts to
remain undiscovered—the blood painter’s goal is to
follow the PCs until they manage to get their hands on
the painting, at which point he aims to kill the PCs and
steal it. If he’s uncovered or the impostor PC “dies,”
see the “Discovering the Double Early” sidebar on
page 132 for notes on discovering the double early.
•	 A PC who’s fluent in multiple languages loses their
ability to speak Common.
•	 A PC must speak only in questions.
•	 A PC loses the ability to say any creature’s name,
including the other party members.
•	 A PC loses the ability to tell the truth.
Painting: Though the players won’t be able to retrieve
the painting until they’ve examined the whole house, it
briefly appears and vanishes in various rooms. The PCs
should see the painting at least twice before they reach the
final encounter in area B7. If they haven’t succeeded at a
minimum of two Perception checks throughout the house
to notice the painting before it vanishes, and they’re about
to reach the end of the house, you can reveal a glimpse of
the painting to them without requiring that they attempt
a check. Once the players have each learned their secret
change, they can proceed to explore the House of Mirrors.
A4. WATER CLOSET
Clue: While there doesn’t seem to be anything of note
in this room at first glance, a PC who succeeds at a DC 23
Perception check notices a smear of blood on the corner
of the mirror.
A5. LIBRARY
MODERATE 7
The heavy smell of dust and moldering books
fills the air in this stuffy library. The wall-to-wall
bookshelves mean this room has no windows, and
the perpetual darkness and lack of circulation have
taken their toll on the furnishings and air quality. To
the northwest, a small reading nook, perhaps once
cozy, sits neglected. In the corners of the room stand
three-foot-tall marble pedestals, each topped with a
small marble statue, though one has been knocked over
and lies broken on the ground.
Creatures: Two
greater
shadows
have made this dark room their home.
One makes its lair in the once-cozy
reading nook, and the other blends into
the shadows on the shelves. The burst of
light from the PCs opening the door startles the
shadows, and they attack immediately.

A6. DINING ROOM
TRIVIAL 7
This grand dining room features a large bay window to the
northwest. On the south wall, long mirrors stretch across the
room on either side of the door. Heavy velvet curtains frame the
mirrors, a musty smell clinging to the windows and the fabric.
Painting: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception
check notices Lady of the Harvest hanging next to the bay
window, then the painting blinks out of existence.
Hazard: The strange powers of the house have warped
and distorted this room, creating a deadly trap.

A7. KITCHEN
LOW 7
The empty countertops of this kitchen, which was used
only a handful of times before the mansion was abandoned,
contrast with the well-stocked shelves. It appears the owner
never bothered to remove the fine porcelain dining ware
when the manor was abandoned, and it sits here on display in
deteriorating glass-doored cabinets.
