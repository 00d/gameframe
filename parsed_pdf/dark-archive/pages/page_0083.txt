FALSE-BOTTOMED MUG
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
Price 5 sp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Access Member of the Bellflower Network
This mug looks like any other; however, the
bottom part unscrews to reveal a velvet-
lined chamber. These are primarily used
by members of the Bellflower Network
to sneak messages and small objects to
other possible members. The Perception
DC to discover the false bottom is 15 if
someone specifically examines the mug.
FORGETFUL DROPS
ITEM 3

CONSUMABLE
INGESTED
POISON
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Activate [one-action] Interact
Access Member of a secret society
These innocuous, colorless drops can be poured directly into
a victim’s mouth, or slipped into their food or drink. They
initially haze a victim’s mind slightly, making them easier to
fool; in later stages, they can lead to the victim entering a
murderous confused state. Secret societies use these drops
to befuddle a target or to frame them for violence.
Saving Throw DC 18 Fortitude; Onset 5 minutes; Maximum
Duration 1 hour; Stage 1 stupefied 1 (10 minutes);
Stage 2 stupefied 1 and clumsy 1 (20
minutes); Stage 3 stupefied 1, clumsy 1, and
confused (30 minutes)
GLITTERING SCARAB
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 10 gp
Usage worn; Bulk —
Access Member of the Esoteric
Order of the Palatine Eye
This pin is a valuable copy of
a popular pin sold in markets throughout
Osirion. The original pin is a solid piece, often
purchased by tourists. The glittering scarab, though,
can be squeezed gently, causing the wings to part and reveal
an eye painted underneath them. This pin is used to gain
entrance to most meetings of the Esoteric Order of the
Palatine Eye. Someone who specifically examines the scarab
can find the hidden eye with a successful DC 20 Perception
check, though if they know about glittering scarabs, they
can simply squeeze it to check for the eye.
MEMBERSHIP CORDS
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
Price 5 gp
Usage worn; Bulk L
Access Member of a secret society
These braided wool cords are threaded with reflective
metal threads in patterns specified by the
purchaser. No two society’s patterns are the same,
and purchasers tend to return to the same weaver
each time to ensure new cords match previous
ones. In a room lit only by dim candlelight, the
reflective metal threads shimmer in a specific
pattern. Many societies use these cords to
prevent outsiders from infiltrating secret
meetings and often have someone at the
meeting area’s entrance checking cords
before allowing entry.
MOONLIT INK
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 5 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
Access Member of a secret society
This alchemical ink is applied to a stamping device, typically a
wooden seal or chop commissioned by the secret society and
costing 1 sp. When the seal is pressed to paper, the ink briefly
shows up before fading into invisibility. The stamp can be
revealed by exposing the stamped item to direct moonlight
for 1 minute. A character checking a good or document
marked by a moonlit ink stamp must succeed at a
DC 25 Perception check to spot the stamp without
exposure to moonlight. In addition to its use by
secret societies for their secret books, papers, and
messages, some smugglers use moonlit ink to mark
their goods.
PARCHMENT OF SECRETS ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
Price 8 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Access Member of a secret society
This parchment is crafted with illusion magic, allowing for
the transfer of secret messages. You can fill the parchment
with the usual amount of text, encoding your secret message
within the innocuous message.
Activate 1 minute (Interact); Effect You tap the letters of your
secret message one at a time, causing the letters to glow
momentarily before fading to their standard ink color, and
SECRET SOCIETY GEAR
Secret societies employ all sorts of tools to help their members and safe houses stay secret, but they’ve learned over time
that magic items themselves can sometimes attract attention rather than divert it, necessitating the use of even more
magic, in the form of wards or illusions, merely to prevent the item from alerting magically inclined investigators. Thus,
they’ve also taken to using non‑magical tools of the trade that are much more difficult to detect.
