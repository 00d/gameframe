CRYPTIC SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Requirements You’re in natural terrain.
You hide your magic in the croak of a frog, in the sway of the
trees, in the howl of the wind, and the flicker of the will-o’-wisp.
If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a Nature
check against all observers’ Perception DCs. If you succeed at
your check against an observer’s Perception DC, that observer
doesn’t notice that you’re Casting a Spell, even though verbal,
somatic, and material components are usually noticeable, and
spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make
spellcasting obvious to those nearby. All of these are instead
hidden in the natural sights and sounds of the environment.
This ability hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see you
transform into a giant bear.
WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING
FEAT 4
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Deception
With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can
create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter.
You can Impersonate creatures with the animal, beast, or
plant traits, so long as they are either the same size or one
size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at
least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid
could Impersonate a bear or an arboreal, but not a horse, giant
scorpion, or assassin vine). Impersonating a larger creature
doesn’t change your actual size.
CAN’T YOU SEE?
FEAT 8
DRUID
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Occultism, expert in Stealth
The eye rebels, the mind recoils—no matter how much those
who can see you try to explain what’s there, their friends’ gazes
just skitter over you, like a bird afraid to land. A character
who attempts to Point Out your location must attempt a DC
14 flat check. If they fail, their allies misunderstand them and
aren’t sure where you are. On a critical failure, their allies think
they pointed you out in a different location entirely, chosen by
the GM. Similarly, when a creature critically fails to Seek you
while you’re hidden to or undetected by it, it thinks you’re in a
different location chosen by the GM. In either case, you appear
to be hidden to a creature that thinks you’re in a different
location, though you’re actually undetected by it for targeting
and further uses of the Seek action.
CRYPTID CLASS FEATS
While most druids and rangers deal with typical animals, plants, and natural creatures, you feel the call of the unknown.
You’ve unlocked stranger techniques associated with mysterious cryptid beasts.
