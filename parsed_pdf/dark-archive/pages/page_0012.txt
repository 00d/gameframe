* Your conscious mind gives you three additional cantrips with amps. One cantrip is unique to your conscious mind.
† The infinite mind class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.
level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to
the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of
your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give
you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can’t
swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later
level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.
At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by
your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip
and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult
spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips.
You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress
in your career as a psychic.
