Choose your implements from the following nine

Amulets are items carried for good luck and protection.
Your amulet might be a magical diagram, a religious
symbol, a preserved body part such as a rabbit’s foot, or
a lucky coin. Amulet implements are associated with the
harrow suit of shields and the astrological signs of the
bridge and the ogre.
