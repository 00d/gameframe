Curse Maelstrom
(Archetype)
Some folks are ridden with bad luck: the rations they
were counting on turn out to be spoiled, the ship they
were hoping to catch sinks in the harbor, or the new
home they bought is destroyed by a rampaging golem.
Most know that they are cursed, feeling an emptiness
in their soul that weighs upon them, gnawing at their
confidence and shrouding their ambitions. Sometimes,
these curse maelstroms learn to control and channel
their curse; you are one such unfortunate soul.
You have a powerful curse living deep within you.
You might have been able to restrain your curse for the
most part, but it flares up occasionally and tempts you
with the power to curse your foes, should you allow
it to exert itself. Why should you be the only one who
has to endure a cursed life when others have so clearly
earned such woe?
Living with a curse every day, you become intimately
familiar with the workings of curses, getting a sense of
when bad luck is about to befall those around you. You
might try to avoid further bad fortune—which rarely
pans out as you’d like—or you could come to terms
with your lot in life and regard your curse as something
akin to an old friend. Either way, fate cares little.
Misery loves company, so your curse can even be a
beacon for more misfortune. You might have multiple
curses all tied to you, all fighting to make your life as
hellish as possible.
CURSE MAELSTROM DEDICATION
FEAT 2
RARE
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites You are cursed or have previously been cursed.
A horrible curse has left a lingering stain on your soul, and
its effects continue to plague you even if the curse’s other
effects have ended. You can choose to suppress it, but if you
instead let it manifest, you can channel its power in your
favor. During an encounter, when you succeed at a check, the
GM can offer to have you roll again, taking the second result.
This is a misfortune effect. If you do so, you enter a curse
maelstrom state. If the misfortune effect is somehow canceled
or negated (by a fortune effect, for example), you don’t enter
a curse maelstrom state.
In addition, the curse is jealous of its place within your
soul and gladly lashes out whenever others dare to usurp
that position, granting you its power without the usual price.
If a foe places a misfortune effect on your roll and the effect
applies to your roll, you enter a curse maelstrom state, and
if you fail a saving throw against a foe’s curse effect and are
affected by the curse, you also enter a curse maelstrom state.
No matter the source, you can only enter a curse maelstrom
state during an encounter, and if you don’t end the state on
your own, it ends at the end of the encounter. Once it ends,
you can’t enter a curse maelstrom state again for 1 minute.
While in a curse maelstrom state, you can’t benefit from
fortune effects, and they also don’t cancel misfortune effects
on you; they simply have no effect. While in this state, all
creatures other than you within a 10-foot emanation take a
–1 status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks due
to the storm of bad luck swirling out of your body. You gain
the Expel Maelstrom action, which you can use to focus the
brunt of your curses onto an unlucky target.
Expel Maelstrom [one-action] (curse, necromancy, occult)
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state;
Effect You expel the maelstrom from your
body, sending the energy to reside in one
unlucky creature within 60 feet. Your curse
maelstrom state ends. The result depends on the
creature’s Will save.
