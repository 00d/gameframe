Mutant Cryptids
Some strange creatures defy what’s expected from others
of their kind due to a peculiar mutation. A mutation can
come from a wide variety of sources: a quirk in their
lineage, effects from their environment, radiation from
bizarre crystals, or exposure to uncontrolled magic. A
mutant cryptid can defy the normal expectations of its
kind. A water elemental might have a planar disjunction
that changes its makeup moment to moment, or a
werewolf might detest music instead of silver.
MUTANT CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing, living creature into a mutant
cryptid by completing the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and
change its statistics as follows.
•	 Add the rare trait.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses,
DCs, Perception modifier, saving throws,
and skill modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of its Strikes and other
offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be
used only a small number of times (such
as a dragon’s Breath Weapon), increase
the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the
amount listed on the table.

Mutant Cryptid Abilities
A mutant cryptid should typically either have all four
the following abilities or just two abilities, not including
unusual bane.
You might decide to give a specific mutant cryptid a
unique mutant ability created just for that creature (or
copied from a different creature). Such an ability replaces
one of the three abilities that increases the monster’s
power, or replaces unusual bane if it’s detrimental.
Unusual Bane The mutant cryptid gains an unusual
weakness to a specific bane—such as aversion to saffron
or to the sound of children’s laughter. The first time each
round the creature comes within 15 feet of its bane or
interacts with its bane (such as stepping over a line of
saffron or hearing children laugh) it takes an amount of
mental damage equal to its level and must attempt a Will
save with a hard DC for its level. On a failure, it’s stunned
1 (stunned 3 on a critical failure).
Explosive End The mutant cryptid’s death reveals one last
surprise as it explodes into flame, acid, a pile of toxic goop, or
something stranger still. Choose a damage type appropriate
for the mutant cryptid. When it dies, it explodes, dealing
1d6 damage of the chosen type to each creature in a 10-foot
emanation, with a basic Reflex save against a standard DC
of the creature’s level. The damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd
level and every odd level thereafter.
Shifting Iridescence (abjuration, magical) Whenever the
mutant cryptid takes energy damage to which it isn’t
resistant or immune, after taking the damage normally, it
gains resistance 5 to that damage type. If it had a resistance
to a different damage type from shifting iridescence, it
replaces the old resistance with the new resistance. The
resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 17th level.
Marrowlance The mutant cryptid can make wicked spears
of bone erupt from its body. The creature can make
marrowlance ranged unarmed attacks. Use the highest
attack modifier from the creature’s highest ranged Strike,
as well as the damage from that Strike. If it has no ranged
attacks, use moderate accuracy and low damage for the
creature’s level. Marrowlance unarmed attacks have a range
of 60 feet and the versatile S trait.
