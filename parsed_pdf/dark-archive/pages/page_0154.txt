Ranged [one-action] dagger +18 (agile, magical, thrown, versatile
S), Damage 2d4+7 piercing plus 1d6 mental and 1d6
persistent bleed
Ascension is Near [one-action] (auditory, concentrate, emotion,
incapacitation, mental) Frequency once per ascension
ritual; Effect Mitera activates the moonflower link with her
followers. Any followers within 30 feet who failed their
saving throw against the moonflower tea become sickened 1.
Anyone who critically failed and did not receive an antidote
explodes (this is about half of Mitera’s congregation if the
PCs didn’t successfully administer the antidote). If anyone’s
body explodes, Mitera gains 30 temporary Hit Points and is
quickened for 3 rounds; she can use this additional action
each round only for Strike and Stride actions.
VERDURE’S MOONFLOWER
CREATURE 8
Pathfinder Bestiary 2 173
Spray Blossoms [two-actions] Effect The moonflower expels mind-
warping petals in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area
take 4d6 mental damage and 4d6 poison damage (DC 26
basic Will save). On a failure, they are stupefied 2 for 1
minute, and on a critical failure, they are also confused for 1
round. The moonflower can’t Spray Blossoms again for 1d4
rounds. This ability replaces a normal moonflower’s Light
Pulse ability.
QUARTZ-SPAWNED SHADOWS (3)
CREATURE 4
Pathfinder Bestiary 289
Crystal Siphon [two-actions] (death, divine, necromancy, negative)
Requirements The shadow and the target are both within 40
feet of the crystal that spawned the shadow, and the crystal
isn’t covered or obstructed; Effect Shadows in the shape
of tendrils curl around the target, drawing out a portion of
the target’s vitality and siphoning it into the crystal. The
target takes 4d6 negative damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude
save). On a failure, they are also enfeebled 1. This enfeebled
condition is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions
from quartz-spawned shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled
4. If Crystal Siphon increases the creature’s enfeebled value
to 3 or more, the target’s shadow is pulled entirely into the
shadow’s crystal. While the target’s shadow is trapped,
they feel an invisible tether linking them to the crystal, and
they become slowed 1 whenever they are more than 40
feet away from it. The enfeebled condition from Crystal
Siphon can’t be reduced until the crystal is broken; if
the crystal is broken, the effect immediately ends.
This ability replaces a normal shadow’s Shadow
Spawn and Steal Shadow abilities.
Conclusion
After the PCs defeat Mitera, the followers are too
disoriented from sleep deprivation and hallucinations to
fully understand what is happening. They readily follow
along with the PCs’ guidance. Depending on whether the
PCs provided an antidote, as well as whether they care to
bring the survivors along if they did, the PCs can either
escape the island with only Thalia or bring the surviving
followers with them. If the heroes burn all the moonflowers
on the island, they prevent anyone else from abusing their
power to take advantage of others, but defeating all the
moonflowers (which will certainly choose to fight together
in the face of extermination rather than lazing around on
the beach) is beyond the scope of the adventure.
As the PCs set sail back to the rest of Iblydos, they
see merfolk follow the boat, eyeing the passengers with
a morbid interest as if wondering how they managed
to escape the grasp of the island and the one they call
Mother. Wordless, they hold their position as the PCs sail
away until they are just dots on the dark horizon.
