battlefield, dealing 1 bludgeoning damage, 1d4
bludgeoning damage, and 1d6 bludgeoning
damage, respectively, to a random
character automatically each round
and ending their turn in that
character’s space. Much like the
magic spoon, they each have
1 Hit Point, AC 29, and +19
Reflex, and if they roll a success
on a Reflex save, they get a critical
success instead.
The three biggest matryoshkas (6 feet, 8 feet, and
10 feet tall) are a different matter altogether. They hop
around the battlefield, trying to swallow the nearest PCs.
They tend to use their Fan of Splinters ability whenever
they can get three or more characters in the blast.

Development: Once the PCs have reduced the
matryoshkas to kindling, Volkya reappears and gushes
enthusiastically, proclaiming them to be amazing heroes
and expressing a deep-rooted wish to be just like them.
Unless the PCs make some effort to detach him, he proceeds
to follow them for the rest of the adventure—which means
that he can lead the PCs straight to the Grandfathers.
Chances are the PCs have a few questions for
Volkya. Use the following examples to determine how
he responds.
Who are you? “My name’s Volkya! What’s your name?”
What happened? “I just said that I wished these dolls
weren’t so boring,” the boy says, nudging a piece of wood
with a foot. “That was amazing. Can you do it again?”
Do you know anything about what’s going on? “It’s the
cursed tree,” the boy says with somber assurance.
What cursed tree? “So, there’s this pond just outside
the village. Just a month ago, poof, there was a giant tree
there, this big old birch, that wasn’t there before. So it’s
a cursed tree!”
The Grandfathers
The PCs must be guided by or receive directions from
Volkya to get to the pond. If the PCs manage to get
Volkya killed or otherwise don’t have his help, they can
also find the pond by canvassing the countryside for the
source of the curse for 1 day and succeeding at a DC 31
Nature or Survival check to track the fey down, but this
is likely both difficult and time-consuming.
As the PCs arrive, read or paraphrase the following.
A glistening pool stands in the middle of a tiny
clearing, the crystal-clear waters rimmed by
ice and frost. A few trees grow along the edge
of the pond, chief among them a tall, white-
barked birch tree. The burble of a spring fills
the air, probably coming from the cluster of
mossy rocks on the far side of the pond.
“Your turn,” a high, whispering voice
says, sounding like the susurrus of the
tree’s branches.
“I’m thinking, I’m thinking,” a gurgling sort of voice
answers—it might almost be the spring speaking.
Then they become clear. It’s like one of those magic pictures
where the eye suddenly realizes that the cluster of rocks and
the birch tree are two old men hunched over a deck of cards—
one tall and thin and with a beard of leaves, one short and
squat, surrounded in a small cloud of algae.
Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza are playing a simple card
game called durak (also known as fool). The PCs can
introduce themselves without any trouble, and if they
thought to bring a gift of some kind or if they call
the spirits “grandfather” or “uncle,” they gain a +1
circumstance bonus to their first Diplomacy or Deception
check against the fey.
The two spirits merrily welcome the PCs, and cheerfully
admit to putting the spell on Krasnoprudny—Ded
Bereza asks if the villagers are enjoying their newfound
fortune, and Ded Bolota grumps about ingratitude if the
PCs hint that it might not have been well received. The
fey also explain the logic behind the curse’s creation if
asked, relating the backstory from the beginning of the
adventure. At this stage, the PCs’ course of action is fairly
clear—they need to get Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza to
lift the curse.
MAGICAL MATRYOSHKAS
The matryoshkas function as variant animated
furnaces (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 18), with the 6-foot
and 8-foot matryoshkas also having the weak
adjustment. All three matryoshkas have the following
adjustments as well.
•	 Add the fey trait.
•	 The door attack is instead a body attack, and the
use of Improved Grab and Swallow Whole means
the matryoshka popped open and either caught the
character partly or wholly inside itself, respectively.
•	 The 6-foot and 8-foot matryoshkas are Medium, not
Huge, although they can Swallow Whole characters of
up to Medium size (popping open and then engulfing
a character). The 10-foot matryoshka is Large and can
Swallow Whole characters of up to Large size.
•	 Replace all fire damage the furnace deals to piercing
damage dealt by wooden splinters. Fan the Flames
thus becomes Fan of Splinters.
