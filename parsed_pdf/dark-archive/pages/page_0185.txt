Time Mage (Archetype)
Magic leaves its brand on those who practice it. The
veteran pyromancer bears the scorch marks of lessons
learned. The archdruid grows to resemble plants or
animals in their domain or grove. The professional
reanimator can never quite cover up the stench of their
grim work.
The mark left by the practice of time magic is less
obvious but no less indelible. With other disciplines, the
marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned,
creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of
power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers
no such limitations of cause and effect. Distortions and
anachronistic thoughts echo back throughout a time
mage’s entire life, providing a nonlinear perspective that
others can find distracting or even alien. The threat of
creating a paradox is ever looming. Many a reckless time
mage has inadvertently erased themselves from existence,
glimpsed a future they now have no choice but to enact, or
attracted the attentions of temporal creatures, such as iriis
or siktemporas.
For these reasons, most mages merely dabble in time
magic, learning a spell or two here and there. Despite
the dangers, a brave few embrace the discipline, for it
offers the allure of changing what was and controlling
what will be.
Additional Feats: 10th Read Disaster (Advanced Player’s
Guide 80); 12th Quickened Casting (Core Rulebook 102);

Echoing Spell (Advanced Player’s Guide 141)
TIME MAGE DEDICATION
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites You have a spellcasting class feature.
You might be a novice in the temporal arts now, but in
the future, you’ll hold time in the palm of your hand.
As some of your future knowledge leaks back
to your present self, you gain the delay
consequence domain spell (Pathfinder Lost
Omens Gods & Magic 118). It costs 1 Focus Point
to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool
of 1 Focus Point that you can recover by using the
Refocus activity to revisit moments from your past and
contemplate futures yet to come. If you already knew
delay consequence from a feat or ability that allows you to
gain your choice of domain spell, such as Domain Initiate,
then when you take this feat, you can retrain that option
to gain a different domain spell instead as your personal
timeline rearranges itself. You also gain time sense (page
183) as an innate cantrip usable at will. This innate spell
and your focus spells from the time mage archetype are
of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the
archetype’s prerequisites.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the time mage archetype.
CHRONOCOGNIZANCE
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication, master in Perception
The flows and ebbs of time are obvious to you, as are the
tangles that form when it’s distorted. You’re automatically
aware if any creature that you observe is under the effects
of the slowed or quickened conditions. You have a general
idea when you’re in the vicinity of time-manipulating
phenomena, though this grants you no particular insight
into the specific effects of the anomaly. Particularly subtle
temporal anomalies might still escape your notice, requiring
a Perception check, as determined by the GM. If you’re
legendary in Arcana, Nature, or Occultism, or Religion,
