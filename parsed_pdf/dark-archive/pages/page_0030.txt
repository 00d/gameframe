Amp You or one target of the spell are surrounded by a spiral of
torn space. This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the
emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in
the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes 1d6 slashing
damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic
Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically
fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls prone.
The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You
can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.
16TH LEVEL
CONSTANT LEVITATION
FEAT 16
PSYCHIC
Your power has unbound you from the earth below. You’re
affected by a constant fly spell, and when your Psyche is
Unleashed, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed.
TARGET OF PSYCHIC IRE
FEAT 16
AMP
EVOCATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic
energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal
amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more
actions to cast and targets a creature.
Amp Choose one target of the spell. Psychic phenomena turn
themselves on the target—typically, objects fling themselves
at the creature. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns,
it takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each spell level of the
psi cantrip this amp was added to, with a basic Reflex save.
The target remains marked by psychic ire for 3 rounds. The
effect persists even if you fall unconscious or leave the area.
WANDERING THOUGHTS [free-action]
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
TELEPORTATION
Frequency once per round
Requirements You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell.
When your Psyche is Unleashed, each burst of magic you cast
also folds space around you, and you travel through one of
those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.
18TH LEVEL
ALL IN YOUR HEAD [reaction]
FEAT 18
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Trigger You’re about to attempt a Fortitude save or a
Reflex save.
Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your
veins—you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect
you if you don’t believe in it. You attempt a Will save against
the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You
don’t gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on
this save.
CRANIAL DETONATION [free-action]
FEAT 18
DEATH
MINDSHIFT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per round
Trigger You successfully reduce one or more non-mindless
enemies to 0 Hit Points with a spell.
As your overwhelming psyche fells a creature, you use its
flickering consciousness to detonate psychic energy from the
creature’s head. Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and
its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave
in a 15-foot emanation around that enemy. Each creature in any
of the emanations takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic
Reflex save. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points,
its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and
potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take
damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.
DEEPEST WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
PSYCHIC
You’ve glimpsed the furthest recesses of your mind. If you have
spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused,
you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus, even if you spent
your Focus Points on spells other than psychic abilities.
20TH LEVEL
BECOME THOUGHT
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
TRANSMUTATION
You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure
thought. This has the following effects.
•	 You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5
to mental damage and weakness 10 to any effect that deals
damage by targeting the spirit, such as spirit blast.
•	 You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes
a single action, which has the concentrate trait, has the
effects of illusory disguise, and lasts until you change your
appearance again.
•	 Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to
life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on
your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to
reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the
vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
MIND OVER MATTER
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
Your mind’s limits are only what you imagine them to be. You
gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
TWIN PSYCHE
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
You’ve segmented your psyche so it can operate in tandem.
When you Unleash your Psyche, you can double its duration.
UNLIMITED POTENTIAL [one-action]
FEAT 20
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per minute
The laws of magic can limit your mind only if you think you
need them, and you’ve grown past the need for such limits. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has
no duration, you don’t expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
