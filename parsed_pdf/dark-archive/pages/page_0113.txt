warded door is opened, but they don’t venture beyond
it, noting that they’re afraid of their new abilities and
don’t want to accidentally hurt the PCs.
Treasure: The monks here brought several books with
them to help perform their ritual, which remain open on
the table. One of the foci attuned to the ritual is also here.
The focus is in the form of a small, glowing piece of iron
in the shape of a diamond.
XIMENA AND ADABERO
CREATURE 5

Blasting Beams (Ximena only; page 100) The beams deal
cold damage.

A4. DORMITORY
This plain chamber contains multiple beds along the southern
wall. Two separate doors in the northern wall allow access to
the room beyond.
The monks use this room as a guest dormitory when
large groups come to visit the castle.
Creatures: A pair of monks were resting in this
room when the jawbone awakened the power of astral
projection in them; unfortunately, their ability was too
potent and their spirits are currently lost somewhere deep
in the Antarkos Ocean, safe but unable to find their way
back. While their bodies are alive, they are comatose and
will remain so as long as they have their ability.
Treasure: One of the ritual foci, a simple glass disc,
fell beneath one of the beds in here, forgotten in the
chaos of unleashed power. A character can locate the
disc with a successful DC 16 Perception check.
A5. FIRST HALL
MODERATE 6
This large hallway connects to other chambers in the
area. The eastern hall has collapsed and is blocked by
rubble. Two characters could work together to clear out
the rubble, but the work takes 4 hours and the exhausting
work leaves the characters fatigued.
Creatures: The bulette isn’t the only creature living in
the depths beneath the keep. A pair of stag beetles kept a
nest in a cave down here, but they were crushed to death
during the monks’ fight with the bulette. The power of
the jawbone has reanimated the beetles’ corpses, and
now they lie in wait to attack anyone who enters the
chamber. 1 round after the PCs enter this hall, one of the
beetles crawls out from the rubble in the eastern hall and
attacks. The second beetle crawls out 1 round later. The
two mindlessly attack the nearest creature.
BEETLE CARAPACES (2)
CREATURE 5
Pathfinder Book of the Dead 148
Initiative Perception +12
A6. CRYPT
This chamber contains several niches built into the
wall. Each niche holds a body, most of which are
fully decomposed.
Treasure: One of the bodies in the niche has a tin of
healer’s gel (Secrets of Magic 168) in one hand. Noticing
the tin requires a successful DC 18 Perception check.
A7. BURIAL CHAMBER
MODERATE 6
A number of bodies are lying in the various niches built
into the walls in this room.
Creatures: Several bodies were reanimated by the
power of the jawbone, transforming into sulfur zombies
in the process. The three zombies are obviously glowing
with a dull light, but they don’t begin moving until 1
round after a character enters the room. The zombies
fight until destroyed, chasing anyone beyond this room
if possible.
WEAK SULFUR ZOMBIES (3)
CREATURE 5
Pathfinder Bestiary 3 6, 303
Initiative Perception +10
A8. PRAYER ROOM
This chamber features a multitude of religious symbols
and other iconography carved into a wall. The room was
used as a simple room for prayer. The array of religious
symbols expanded over millennia as castle residents
added their deities’ symbols. The wall now contains
hundreds of different religious symbols.
Treasure: A strand of holy prayer beads lies on the
ground in the southwestern corner here. A worshipper of
Kazutal left the beads here several years ago, and they’ve
never been claimed since.
A9. SECOND HALL
MODERATE 6
This hall connects to the bulette’s den.
Creatures: The jawbone’s power manifests in different
ways. While it mostly creates the potential for destruction
in the form of abilities, the tone also has the means of
calling forth destruction in the form of planar creatures
like demons and sahkils. A pair of wihsaak sahkils were
called into this room around the same time that the PCs’
own abilities awakened. The sahkils have spent their time
here slowly investigating the area. Unfortunately for the
sahkils, they are somewhat trapped here. The bulette
forced the sahkils out of its den, but the multitude of
religious symbols in the prayer room also kept the sahkils
at bay, confining them to this space between.
The sahkils are frustrated with their situation and
immediately attack anyone that enters this room. They
don’t follow anyone into the prayer room but are happy
to keep fighting in the cavern beyond, using their flight to
keep away from their foes. The wihsaaks fight to the death.
