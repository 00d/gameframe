So it was with Archivist Irabie, after the Red Glove
Conspiracy. What looked like her wasn’t, but it was able
to fool us for some time. Her evil reflection burrowed
undetected into the Dark Archive like termites into
wood, until everything threatened to come crumbling
down. Fortunately, we had the resources to set things
right—we captured the creature, returned to Druma,
found the darkside mirror that stole Irabie, and
rescued our colleague. But was she the only one to be
changed? Or are there more out there? Doppelgangers,
reflections, clones. Anyone could be a victim. Worse,
anyone could be a false face, masquerading for
long enough to destroy the life they’ve assumed and
everything around them.
Irabie described her experience as being trapped in
a formless void, a vast, monochromatic emptiness with
no surface. Just silver fog extending in all directions.
Circles of light hung in nothingness, offering glimpses of
our reality. She said she could see us with her impostor
through one and cried out, but we heard nothing.
And she wasn’t alone there. She encountered silvery
humanoids and formless oozes glistening with prismatic
light that “echoed” as if each were seen a half-dozen
times, like a mirror reflecting itself over and over. Most
left her alone, she said, but some seemed threatening, so
she kept her distance. If they have a society, she saw no
sign of it.
This didn’t match descriptions we’d read from other
darkside mirror survivors. Their accounts hinted at
alternate realities that appeared like our own except for
eerie distinctions reversing some aspect of our reality.
Irabie’s experience suggested a new destination, which
we named the Echoing Pale. Thus, after her return, we
sought to enter the Echoing Pale ourselves, but despite
DOORS INTO THE
ECHOING PALE
On the nature of reflections,
mirrors, and what lies beyond
We should be able to trust what our eyes tell us, but we’ve seen enough in our
travels to know we can’t always do so. Our reflection in a mirror, for example:
it looks like our face, but it’s not really. It’s reversed—scars, tattoos, blemishes,
all on the wrong side. What else lies beyond the silver-and-glass frame? And what might come through?
