EMPTY PACK
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range touch; Target 1 container of 2 Bulk or less
Duration 1 hour
You render every item inside the container you touch invisible,
although the container itself remains visible. The items within
are undetected to all creatures, though a creature can attempt
to find an item by reaching into the bag, making an item
hidden to them instead if they succeed. Additionally, the spell
doesn’t prevent the items from making protrusions in the bag,
adding weight, making noise when jostling around, and so on.
However, the spell prevents anything within the container
from falling out if it’s upended. Any object removed from the
container becomes visible and remains visible even if returned
to the container.
Heightened (4th) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
ETHERIC SHARDS
SPELL 5
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration 1 minute
You reach out and sow glittering splinters of force throughout
the area, otherworldly caltrops of will and ectoplasm. The
area is difficult terrain, even to flying or incorporeal creatures.
Any creature that moves through the area takes 1d4 piercing
damage per square traversed, with a basic Reflex save made
at the end of each move action they take through the area.
Heightened (+2) The spell’s area increases by 5 feet, and the
piercing damage increases by 1.
FALLING SKY
SPELL 8
EVOCATION
INCAPACITATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 60-foot tall, 30-foot radius cylinder
Extraordinary telekinetic pressure smashes down through
the area, battering creatures within it to the ground. All flying
creatures in the area descend to the bottom of the spell’s area,
taking twice as much bludgeoning damage as if they had
fallen the distance moved, to a maximum of 60 falling damage
if they fall 60 feet. They take this falling damage even if the
spell’s area is entirely in the air and they don’t hit the ground,
as they concuss against the bottom of the spell’s area at great
speed. Creatures on the ground and within the spell’s area,
including flying creatures forced to the ground, must attempt
Fortitude saves.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and if it was
flying, it isn’t knocked prone even though it took falling
damage.
Success The creature is knocked prone.
Failure The creature is knocked prone and stunned 2.
Critical Failure The creature is knocked prone and stunned for
1 round.
FOCUSING HUM
SPELL 3
DIVINATION
ENCHANTMENT
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [one-action] somatic, verbal
Area 15-foot emanation centered on you
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that
allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any
flat check to Cast a Spell while stupefied for creatures within
the area is 2 lower. Confused creatures in the area don’t attack
anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to
speak coherently. You take a –2 penalty to Stealth checks to
Hide and Sneak.
IMPLEMENT OF DESTRUCTION
SPELL 4
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 enemy, and 1 weapon that is either
unattended or wielded by you or a willing ally
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death
to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the
target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy’s
mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The
effect is based on the target enemy’s Will save.
Critical Success The target enemy is unaffected.
Success The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental
damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the
end of the spell’s duration.
Failure The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 persistent
mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically
hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1 for as long as it
takes this persistent mental damage.
Critical Failure The target weapon deals an additional 4d6
persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy
is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1.
Heightened (+2) Increase the mental damage by 1d6 on a
success, and increase the persistent mental damage by 1d6
on a failure or by 2d6 on a critical failure.
KINETIC RAM
SPELL 1
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [one-action] to [three-actions] verbal
Range varies; Targets 1 or more creatures
Saving Throw Fortitude
Gathering kinetic energy, you either focus it in a straight line
or disperse it as an encircling ripple. Any creature targeted
by this spell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be
pushed 10 feet away from you (or 20 feet on a critical failure).
The spell’s area or range and how many creatures it affects is
based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.
