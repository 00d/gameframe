a symbol of your choice appears at the corner of the page.
The next time someone taps the symbol with a writing
instrument, the chosen letters glow again, revealing the secret
message, and then the power of the parchment is spent.
SELF-IMMOLATING NOTE
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
FIRE
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
Access Member of a secret society
This paper is crafted with an unusual formula, causing it to catch
fire and self-immolate 5 minutes after being exposed to the air.
The item activates automatically when the envelope is opened,
which typically takes an Interact action. Anyone holding the
note when it catches fire takes 1 fire damage. Often, these
notes are given as practical jokes or threats, but secret societies
find them quite useful when sharing information about
upcoming meetings or any other relevant news.
These letters must be written in haste and require
the use of their accompanying envelopes,
which prevent air from interacting with the
paper until the envelope’s seal is broken.
SIBLING’S COIN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Access Member of a secret society
Contrary to widespread belief, secret handshakes are not the
preferred method of confirmation between secret society
members, mostly because this would be obvious in the middle
of a crowded street or busy tavern. Instead, societies tend to
mark each other by carrying sibling’s coins. The name was
originally coined by a past secret society that has since fallen into
obscurity, but its ingenious coins remain. The coins are
innocuous, resembling common silver coins until
the owner twists the outer edge clockwise. At
this point, the face of the coin rotates to reveal
the symbol of the secret society of the owner.
Suspected compatriots often toy with their
coins as a half-recognized fidget, before
trying to subtly flash the inscription to
their fellow conversationalist.
While it’s possible to notice the coin’s
mechanism if you specifically check
the coin (DC 20 Perception), few people
individually inspect coins unless they have a
reason to be suspicious of them.
SILENT BELL
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
Price 600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Access Member of a secret society
This large handbell is made from cast bronze and has a
wooden handle. The outside of the bell is covered in fine
etchings, showing a group of varied people sitting around a
table with clouds obscuring anyone in the background. The
clapper is curiously absent from this bell and, when idly rung,
it produces no audible sound.
Activate [three-actions] envision, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect The silent bell creates an invisible wall surrounding
a cube, 20 feet to a side, that prevents sound from passing
into or from the cube for 10 minutes. The wall isn’t solid and
doesn’t prevent anything but sound from passing through.
Since the cube is invisible, creatures can still read lips and
body language through the wall.
SOCIETY PORTRAIT
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 210 gp
Bulk 1
Access Member of a secret society
These large portraits are commonly commissioned
by secret societies to display their current member
ranks, and to protect against members who would
break their vows to keep their secrets. Each member
being painted gives their consent to be traced by the
portrait, and they agree to keep their vows for as long
as their membership stands or until death, whichever
comes first. This consent can be transferred to a new
portrait if one is needed once the society expands,
without needing another confirmation.
Should a member betray the secrets of their society, their
image in the society portrait changes within 10 minutes, altering
the image of the member by spelling out “TRAITOR” across their
form. It provides no details on the specifics of the betrayal. The
traitor can attempt a DC 30 Will save or Deception check at the
time they betrayed a secret to avoid the portrait revealing their
treachery. The traitorous scrawl can be counteracted by dispel
magic targeted at the portrait (counteract DC
20, counteract level of 3).
TRAITOR’S RING
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
Price 15 sp
Usage worn; Bulk —
Access Member of a secret society
This ring has a thick band supporting a square‑cut
gem that can be customized to the buyer’s
preference. The thickness of the band allows it to be
taken to any jeweler or blacksmith to be adjusted
to different hands or fingers from the original
make. There is a tiny clasp at the side of the gem
that, when pressed, opens the gem, revealing a small, hinged
compartment. This compartment is designed to hold one dose
of poison, allowing wearers to slip the contents of the ring into
the food or drink of an intended target. The compartment can
be closed again by gently pressing the gem back into place.
Noticing the compartment requires a DC 15 Perception check
for anyone inspecting the ring.
