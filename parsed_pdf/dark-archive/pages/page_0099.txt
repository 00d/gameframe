DEVIANT ABILITIES
The frost struck in the time it took him to look. No waving fingers, no incantation, no circle of ancient runes hanging in
the air. Just ice covering everything he laid eyes on, his breath hanging white in the summer afternoon as chills wracked
his body.
Rarity: Rare
Though Golarion contains classically trained spellcasters,
descendants of magical creatures, and entire species who
can invoke ancestral patrons for supernatural aid, there
are always some who gain unique and unstable powers in
strange or unorthodox ways. GMs can use the rules here to
grant these so-called deviant abilities to their players and
incorporate them into their games. A deviant ability can
be the result of exposure to exotic energies, a boon from a
powerful entity, cutting-edge scientific experimentation, or
any other process that makes sense for your story.
Acquiring a Deviant
Ability
There are two main ways to approach deviant abilities
in your game: as an intentional and persistent part of
a player’s character that is intrinsic to them and grows
throughout their career, or as a more turbulent and
transient power they gain as part of an ongoing campaign,
intended to be acquired at a certain point in the story and
to eventually burn out or fade away when that chapter of
the story is told.
BACKGROUND DEVIANT ABILITIES
A background deviant ability is a core part of a character’s
concept—a character may simply have been born with the
power to light things on fire by whistling, or they may have
gained it as part of whatever incident set them down the
road to adventure.
When using background deviant abilities, the player
should get to decide what type of deviation they want and
build their power. As the player grows, they should be able
to improve their deviant ability, whether through special
training, seeking out objects of power, or self-improvement,
represented as taking additional deviant ability feats.
If everyone in your party wishes to make deviant abilities
a part of their character, or for a setting where these abilities
are more common, consider using a variant similar to the
free archetype variant rule (described on page 194 of the
Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide) to grant each character an
extra class feat at 2nd level and every even-numbered level
thereafter that they can use only to take deviant feats. In
most cases, they can gain every possible deviant ability feat
by 16th level in this fashion, so there’s no need to grant
extra feats after that.
