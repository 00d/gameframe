Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and the curse’s
energy dissipates harmlessly.
Success The creature comes to house the maelstrom’s
wrath within it. It takes a –1 status penalty to all saving
throws and skill checks for 1 minute.
Failure The maelstrom strikes deep into the creature’s
soul. It takes a –2 status penalty to all saving throws
and skill checks for 10 minutes.
Critical Failure The maelstrom pitches the creature into a
single fit of utter misfortune before burrowing into its
soul. As failure, but the creature also must roll twice
and take the lower result on its next saving throw or
skill check; this is a misfortune effect.
FAMILIAR ODDITIES
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication, trained in
Occultism or Curse Lore
Perhaps due to the curse within you, curses occasionally
perceive you as an extension of themselves and readily
reveal themselves to you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to checks to Identify Magic on a cursed item or a spell that
has the curse trait.
UNNERVING EXPANSION [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
You gather your curse around you and impel it to pour
outward, expanding your maelstrom. The radius of the
emanation of your curse maelstrom state increases by 5 feet
until the end of your curse maelstrom state. The outpouring
of the curse is unnerving. You attempt to Demoralize a
creature within the emanation of your curse maelstrom;
you don’t take penalties for not sharing a language with
that creature.
SHARE BURDEN [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Trigger An ally within 60 feet would be affected by a curse
or misfortune effect, and you wouldn’t be affected but you
are an eligible target for the effect.
You draw the misfortune or curse into yourself, potentially
enabling you to enter your curse maelstrom state. Instead of
affecting your ally, the triggering curse or misfortune effect
affects you.
ACCURSED MAGIC
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
When the curse within you spills out, you can lay curses on
others and claim them for yourself with ease. You can cast
claim curse (Secrets of Magic 95). At 10th level, you can also
cast seal fate (Advanced Player’s Guide 224), and at 12th
level, you can also cast inevitable disaster (Secrets of Magic
111). You can cast these spells once per day as occult innate
spells, but only while within your curse maelstrom state.
If you couldn’t already cast occult spells, these spells use
Wisdom as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained
in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
COUNTER CURSE [reaction]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state.
Trigger You or an ally within 30 feet is targeted by or in
the emanation of a curse or misfortune effect from an
opponent or object of which you are aware.
You gather the energy of your maelstrom and fling its
unleashed power into the enemy’s curse, attempting to
neutralize it. Attempt a counteract check against the
triggering effect, using half your level rounded up as your
counteract level and the higher of your class DC and spell DC
as the counteract modifier. On a success, you neutralize the
curse or misfortune effect. If the effect was constant, such as
a misfortune aura, it returns automatically at the beginning
of the creature or object’s next turn. Whether you succeed or
fail, your curse maelstrom state ends.
TORRENTIAL BACKLASH [two-actions]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state.
Calling upon forbidden practices, you release the curse from
within yourself, allowing it free rein to destroy everything
around you. All creatures within your curse maelstrom
emanation except you take 1d6 negative damage for each
level you have, with a basic Fortitude save. Your curse
maelstrom state then ends.
REVERSE CURSE
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Counter Curse
When you counter a curse or misfortune effect, you send it
back to destroy its originator. Whenever you succeed at the
counteract check to Counter Curse, the creature is affected
by its own curse or misfortune effect, attempting a saving
throw against its own DC if the effect allows a saving throw.
In the case of a constant ability, such as a misfortune aura,
the creature is affected only until the beginning of its next
turn, when the ability reasserts itself.
MANIFESTATIONS
Those at the center of a storm of curses often
have peculiar manifestations that mark them as
one of the unfortunate. Over time, even the places
that they inhabit will begin to show signs of their
presence: plants with bizarre growths, dust clouds
that form strange symbols in the light, and floors
that creak and groan even when no one is walking
across them.
