AURA SIGHT

UNCOMMON
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
GENERAL
SECRET
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Occultism
Frequency once per hour
You’ve learned how to read the natural auras of other living
creatures. To do this, you must focus on a single living target
without blinking for 1 minute. You can do this while performing
some other minor task—such as making conversation to
distract from your intentions—but you can’t blink or otherwise
lose your concentration. You can then perceive any or all of
the following information.
•	 The target’s current apparent attitude toward you
(friendly, indifferent, and so on).
•	 The target’s current apparent emotional state.
•	 A general assessment of the target’s physical health, such
as what conditions or afflictions it has. You might need
to succeed at an Occultism check against the affliction
or condition’s DC to detect the presence of a specifically
hidden or subtle condition or affliction.
In addition, the GM rolls a secret Occultism check for you
against the target’s Deception DC. If your result exceeds your
target’s, you can identify if they’re being deceptive in some
way (such as expressing a false attitude toward you or faking
an emotional state). This doesn’t allow you to automatically
identify the exact nature of that deception, only to tell the
outward appearance is false.

EXPLORATION
GENERAL
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Occultism
Frequency once per day
When confronted with the unknown, you can receive
knowledge beyond your own experience via written messages
delivered by your hand. You spend 10 minutes seated while
holding a writing utensil, using it to make small circular
motions as you open your mind to the forces around you. You
receive information as your hand writes on its own, guided
by spirits. At the end of these 10 minutes, Recall Knowledge
with any Lore skill in which you are not trained, using your
Occultism modifier instead of your modifier with that skill. The
strain of this spirit channeling leaves you stupefied 1 for the
next 10 minutes.
CHROMOTHERAPY [two-actions]
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
HEALING
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You firmly believe in the technique of strengthening one’s
life force, spiritual energies, and bodily fluids through the
application of colored light. When using a torch, lantern, or
other artificial light source to illuminate an area of dim light
or darker, you use a combination of alchemical reagents,
medicinal components, and colored lenses to turn that light
one of seven colors, allowing you to help an ally recover from
persistent damage. You give that target an assisted recovery,
but the target can be anywhere within the bright light of
the light source instead of needing to be adjacent to you.
Ambient bright light (like sunlight) drowns out your artificial
illumination and prevents you from using Chromotherapy.
The color of the light you choose determines the type of
persistent damage from which you help the target recover.
Color
Description
Red
You increase blood flow to heat the body,
attempting to end persistent cold damage.
Orange	 You cancel out electric charge, attempting to end
persistent electricity damage.
Yellow	 You reduce pain and mental stress, attempting to
end persistent mental damage.
Green
You promote blood flow in a way that helps clot
wounds, attempting to end persistent bleed
damage.
Blue
You cool the body, attempting to end persistent
fire damage.
Indigo
You render acids inert, attempting to end
persistent acid damage.
Violet
You purify the body, attempting to end persistent
poison damage.
CRYSTAL HEALING
FEAT 1
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
HEALING
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
You know how to stimulate a body’s natural healing abilities
through the application of resonant crystals. Doing so requires
you to use at least two semiprecious stones with a total value
of 5 gp or more in place of healer’s tools, which allows you to
attempt to Treat Disease or Treat Poison using Occultism rather
than Medicine. Examples and prices of semiprecious stones can
be found on page 114 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.
If you’re an expert in Occultism and you use gems whose
total value equals or exceeds 50 gp, you gain a +1 item bonus
to your Occultism check. If you’re a master and the gems’
value equals or exceeds 700 gp, the item bonus increases
to +2; if you’re legendary in Occultism and the gems’ value
equals or exceeds 15,000 gp, the item bonus increases to +3.
FOLK DOWSING
FEAT 3
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
You can find what you’re looking for using a dowsing rod or
pendulum. If you Search while wielding a dowsing rod or
pendulum, in addition to the normal checks for Searching, the
GM rolls a secret Survival check for you to detect the largest
source of water, oil, or another natural non-bodily fluid in
