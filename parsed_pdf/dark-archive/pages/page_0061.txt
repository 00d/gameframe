Primeval Cryptid
Scholars dream of discovering primeval creatures:
remnants of an older age, long thought extinct. Primeval
cryptids are resilient survivors of their kind or particularly
clever individuals.
PRIMEVAL CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing, living creature into a primeval
cryptid by completing the following steps. Increase the
creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase the creature’s rarity to uncommon if it was
common or rare if it was uncommon. If the creature
was an animal, it loses the animal trait and gains the
beast trait.
•	 Increase the creature’s size by one size. If this makes
the creature Huge or Gargantuan, increase the reach
of all its Strikes by 5 feet.
•	 If the creature’s Intelligence modifier is –4 or lower,
increase it to –3.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of the creature’s Strikes and
other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used
only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s
Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the amount listed on
the table.

Primeval Cryptid Abilities
Primeval cryptids gain two abilities from the list below.
You can add more than two abilities if you wish to make
an especially tough primeval cryptid, but you might need
to weaken it in some other way to avoid making it too
powerful.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the
emanation or starting its turn in the emanation must
succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC for
the creature’s level or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1
as long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). While within
the emanation, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance
penalty to saves against diseases and to recover from
the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at
its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Broken Arsenal Fragments of broken blades
and spears, the remnants of countless failed
attempts to fell the primeval cryptid, remain
lodged in its flesh. When an adjacent creature
hits the primeval cryptid with a melee attack
or otherwise touches it, that creature takes
piercing damage equal to half the primeval
cryptid’s level (minimum 1 damage).
Grasp for Life [free-action] (healing) Frequency once
per week; Trigger The primeval cryptid
would be reduced to 0 Hit Points; Effect The
cryptid’s will to live is second nature, and
its second wind has allowed it to survive
when others of its kind went extinct. The
creature shrugs off death. Instead of being
reduced to 0 Hit Points, its Hit Points become
equal to four times its level (or 4 Hit Points for
a level 0 creature).
Shockwave [two-actions] Effect The primeval cryptid
creates a shockwave by stomping on
the ground, beating its tail on the
ground, or making another similarly
violent, percussive slam. Creatures
on the ground within 30 feet of the
primeval cryptid take 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per level of the primeval cryptid
(minimum 2d6 damage), with a basic
Reflex save. On a critical failure, a creature is
also knocked prone.
