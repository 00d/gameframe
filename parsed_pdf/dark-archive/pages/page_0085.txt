CODED SIGNAL
Secret societies are notorious for their rituals and
symbolism, and for working those symbols into their
properties and belongings. The silent hunters of the Cat
and Mouse Society wear cat masks and brand their lodges
with the sign of the sphinx. Some of this is due to ego,
some due to what might be best understood as an exercise
in branding, but some is to convey messages to members.
Unlike other secret messages, coded signals make no
effort to direct themselves to a specific individual. Rather,
the message is clearly visible, but the actual meaning is
decipherable only to members of the secret society.
Recognizing the Signal: If one isn’t a member of the
relevant society, then identifying the presence of a coded
signal requires succeeding at a Society check, with a
critical success also conveying the general meaning. The
DC depends on how secretive and widespread the society
is—the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, widespread
and famous, might use a simple expert DC of 20, while
the paranoid Exarchate of the Infinite Clock might use a
simple master DC of 30, and an even more obscure society
might use the simple legendary DC of 40.
•	 Temporary signal examples include newspaper
advertisements or temporary illusions.
•	 Permanent signal examples include graffiti on a wall
or small carvings in building stones.
•	 Monument signal examples include occult symbolism
on a civic landmark or in a seal of an organization.
COUNTERFEIT GOODS
Many secret societies dabble in ancient lore and rare
antiquities. If one were to ask what their greatest challenge
is, instead of evading police attention or dealing with
the occasional mystic curse, most members would say
it’s separating counterfeit goods from real ones. Almost
anything can be counterfeited, and counterfeiting is a
major criminal enterprise with its own tricks, techniques,
and intricacies. Some counterfeiters specialize in the
production of adulterated coinage, while others produce
beautiful legal documents with forged signatures and
stolen stamps. Another class of forger produces artwork
in the style of some great master, while ancient relics can
be churned out by the dozen in subterranean workshops.
You can hire a counterfeiter to create low-grade,
medium-grade, or high-grade counterfeit goods. In all
cases, the goods can still act as mundane examples of
their type (a counterfeit copy of the queen’s longsword is
still a longsword), and if the original is enchanted, then
the counterfeiter attempts to fake the appropriate magical
auras. Counterfeit goods don’t have any other magical
powers, though—a counterfeit scroll can’t be used to Cast
a Spell, for example. A counterfeit good can’t be cheaper
than the base item. For example, the sword couldn’t be
cheaper than a longsword, nor the scroll cheaper than a
piece of parchment.
An item sold to a store goes through a rigorous vetting
process that is extremely likely to detect a counterfeit, so a
secret society member can’t simply create counterfeits and
then sell them at a profit. Counterfeits excel in situations
where the item’s hand-off is illicit or the item doesn’t need
to pass intense scrutiny from an appraiser.
Detecting Counterfeits: Determining something is
counterfeit requires inspecting the item and succeeding at a
relevant skill check against the counterfeit’s DC. Typically,
this is Crafting, but one might use Religion to detect a fake
reliquary or Medicine to realize a potion is mere snake oil.
Low-grade counterfeits typically have a very easy DC of
the item’s level, medium-grade counterfeits typically have a
standard DC of the item’s level, and high-grade counterfeits
typically have a hard DC of the item’s level.
FALSE WITNESS
There comes a time in every thief’s life when they need
a friend, an ally, a boon companion who will look a
judge straight in the eye and swear over a stack of holy
books that the two of them were out drinking—yes,
your honor, all night, never left my sight for more than
a minute, you have my solemn oath. Lucky thieves have
a friend who is willing to be an alibi; for everyone else,
SECRET SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP SERVICES
The following services are available to members of a secret society as long as they remain in the society’s good graces.
Other characters with underworld connections can attempt to leverage their connections to provide these services as
well, though this might require an exchange of favors determined by the GM.
