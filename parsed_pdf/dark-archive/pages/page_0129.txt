Adventure Background
In the outskirts of the town of Ravengro, Ustalav, lies a
once-luxurious estate built by Count Eigen Lorres after
he established the infamous Harrowstone Prison. At the
height of his power, Lorres had the grand mansion built
to demonstrate his new wealth. Its most famous feature
was a spectacular hall of mirrors, a sight never before
seen in Ustalav’s war-torn history, leading to the moniker
the mansion still keeps to this day: the House of Mirrors.
Lorres purchased a tremendous amount of art during the
construction of his new estate. Chief among these pieces
was Lady of the Harvest, a celebrated work by a master
of the mid-late Age of Enthronement period. However,
as soon as Lady of the Harvest arrived at the House of
Mirrors, strange phenomena began to plague the manor
and its construction crew. Rumors circulated of freak
accidents befalling the workers as well as a few unexplained
disappearances. The crew also swore the painting had a
habit of appearing in random rooms throughout the house,
regardless of where it was hanging when the workers left
the previous night. After Lorres was deposed, the mansion
remained uninhabited for over a century.
Ravengro has stabilized into a small but prosperous
agricultural town overshadowed at times by its gruesome
history. The city council decided to seize the opportunity
of Lady of the Harvest’s upcoming 500th anniversary
to bring some positive attention to the town. They hope
to turn the house into a museum with the painting as its
centerpiece—but first, someone must deal with the pesky
alleged curse, the PCs.
However, a blood painter (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 33)
named Ogkrix wants the painting too. When news spread
of the House of Mirrors’ planned reopening, and the
accompanying unveiling of the cursed Lady of the Harvest,
Ogkrix made his way to Ravengro to claim the painting
for himself. However, he was quickly thwarted by the
painting’s habit of disappearing whenever anyone gets too
close, and its tendency to suck trespassers inside it, only
to spit them out in another room some time later. So far,
Ogkrix has been unable to get his hands on the painting.
Assuming at least one PC will be sucked into the painting,
he intends to replace that PC using his illusion magic and
tag along until they can overcome whatever supernatural
obstacle the painting poses.
LADY OF THE HARVEST
Ustalav has been the source of a disproportionate number of our open cases. Large enough for strange phenomena to
be noticed, small enough for them to remain unsolved, at the fringes. Lorres Manor, in Ravengro, is a nexus of such
events—accidents befalling the workers who built it, objects moving, possibly some kind of haunting (or curse)?
whatever the case, the mansion’s relative obscurity is likely the only thing keeping the events contained. — K.H.W.
