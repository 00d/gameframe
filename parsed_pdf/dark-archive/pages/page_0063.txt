BALEBLOOD DRAFT
ITEM 10
RARE
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
ELIXIR
Price 155 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This vial of murky, acrid-smelling liquid is
derived from a blend of strange blood, typically
coming from aberrations and cryptids. It has
no special properties when used alone, but
if you drink one shortly before drinking
an alchemical elixir, you enhance
the elixir’s duration. Many tales of
mysterious cryptids are actually based
on encounters with people suffering
the aftereffects of such concoctions.
After drinking a baleblood draft,
the next elixir you drink within
1 minute that has a duration of
at least 1 minute and at most 1 hour has
its duration extended by 50% (so a lesser
cheetah’s elixir lasts for a minute and a half
instead of 1 minute).
However, after pairing baleblood draft with another elixir,
you suffer an eerie side effect for 1 week. This side effect
never causes serious harm, although it might be inconvenient
and is always ominous in appearance. All elixirs made in the
same batch cause the same side effect. Drinking another draft
with the same side effect extends the side effect’s duration by
another week, and drinking one with a different side effect
causes you to suffer both effects simultaneously.
CHAOS COLLAR
ITEM 5
COMPANION
INVESTED
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 125 gp
Usage worn collar; Bulk L
This unobtrusive collar is made to
hide beneath an animal’s fur or
blend in against scaled skin. It’s
most often used by unscrupulous
trophy hunters hoping to make a
name for themselves by defeating
threats they artificially created,
using hapless animals as pawns.
A chaos collar fuses to its
animal bearer the first time it’s clasped
around the creature’s neck. Three nights per
month, it transforms the animal into the form of a
terrifying monster. The appearance is the same size as the
original animal and doesn’t change the animal’s statistics,
but it’s always something new, horrifying, and unique to
that particular chaos collar. The transformation lasts from
dusk until dawn, and it occurs with complete randomness
throughout the month.
An animal slain while wearing a chaos collar remains in the
form it had at the time of its death. Once its bearer dies, the
collar transforms into a scrap of dirty string and falls off, where
the unscrupulous hunter can collect and use it again.
CHIMERA THREAD
ITEM 4
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 15 gp
Activate 10 minutes (Interact)
This multicolored skein is twisted together from
strands of many different materials. When used
to stitch together pieces from the carcasses
of two or more animals, it fuses them into a
single intact carcass of an outlandish‑looking
monster
with
characteristics
of
the
component species. The thread disappears,
leaving no obvious seams and smoothing the
transition between the parts of the creatures.
CLOAK OF THE FALSE FOE
ITEM 12
INVESTED
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,850 gp
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
Images of strange animals and distorted figures are woven
into this coarse, fur-lined cloak.
Activate
Interact
(polymorph,
primal,
transmutation);
Frequency once per day; Effect The cloak rises to envelop
your head and body, reshaping your appearance into that
of a locally feared cryptid. If there is no such figure in local
lore, the cloak of the false foe instead alters your appearance
into a form imagined by the crafter of the cloak. One choice
that occurs with disturbing frequency is a gaunt figure with
triple-jointed fingers; an eyeless, hairless
head with a lamprey mouth in the center
of its face; and stubby tentacles
waving down its neck. The
transformation
also
grants
the effects of either a 3rd-level
humanoid form spell that lasts for 1 hour
if you turn into a Medium cryptid, or a 5th-level
humanoid form spell that lasts for 10 minutes if
you turn into a Large cryptid.
While you’re in cryptid form, any wounds left by
your spells and Strikes appear to be the result of the
cryptid’s unarmed attacks and special abilities to a casual
inspection. This doesn’t alter the actual damage type inflicted
or the effects of such attack. Someone closely studying the
wounds can, with a successful DC 30 Medicine check, realize
that magic has altered the appearance of the injuries.
CRYPTID GEAR
Cryptid hunters make use of unusual gear to track down and uncover their hidden quarries, and those who find
ingredients salvaged from a cryptid’s corpse create new items that seem impossible to a normal crafter.
