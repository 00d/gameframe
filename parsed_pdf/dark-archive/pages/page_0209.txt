Adventure Background
When the Lone Archivist began to take special interest in
the casefiles he would later steal from the Archive, he knew
he’d need a private way to return to them, one that neither
the greater Dark Archive nor the Pathfinder Society would
know of. The PCs should know this network well by now:
the somnambulist’s bridge.
Not magically inclined himself, K.H.W. visited a friend of
his, a Magaambyan scholar named Elaro (LN male anadi
lore-speaker). The two first met during the Six Clouds
Incident, when K.H.W. was a young archivist stationed in
Nantambu. Elaro, many years his senior, would go on to
serve as a mentor and magical consultant for the archivist
on several cases of note, using his burgeoning research into
dreamscapes to help the archivist return to his memories
of past cases and examine them for new angles or details.
Upon hearing his friend needed a way to discreetly
return to the actual sites of certain unsolved cases, Elaro
found a way to modify his research to create a dream-based
transportation system. The bearer would dream a memory
so powerfully that they physically returned to the location
the memory was formed. However, the makeshift system
was unstable, degraded after a single use, and only enabled
a traveler to visit locations in a set order. Now that the PCs
have solved the other cases, clearing the somnambulist’s
bridge’s links to those regions, the bridge is empty,
returning to its default destination: the city where Elaro
created it. It stands ready for one last trip.
Getting Started
When the Dark Archive folio opens to the casefile for
this adventure, the PCs can easily note that a single flat,
turquoise bead is affixed to the page with a dab of adhesive,
matching the mask the Archivist’s note describes. The
bead glows slightly, visible through satchels or clothing,
as the PCs make their transit through the somnambulist’s
bridge. On the other side, they’re welcomed by the sounds
of a bustling market, burbling canals, and glass chimes
tinkling in the warm breeze of Nantambu.
The party can either explore the city or head straight
for the Magaambya to begin their search for the owner
of the armadillo mask. A PC can attempt a DC 25 Gather
THE LAST DREAM
For as many mysteries as there are covering our world, the spaces within the self can hold even stranger revelations. In
Nantambu, guided by the professor with the armadillo mask that matches this bead, I once had the opportunity to peer into
my own self. I saw something there, in that space within my memories... one day, I hope to return to it. —K.H.W.
