12TH LEVEL
ELABORATE SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Scroll Esoterica
You’ve picked up more scraps of magic texts, improving your makeshift scrolls. In addition
to your daily scrolls from Scroll Esoterica, add a scroll with a 3rd-level spell. At 14th level,
add a scroll with a 4th-level spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a 5th-level spell.
INTENSIFY INVESTITURE [free-action]
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Your bond to your invested items enables you to put more of yourself into them. If
you next action is to activate an invested item that has a saving throw DC, you can
use your thaumaturge class DC instead of the item’s DC if it is higher.
SHARED WARDING
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Esoteric Warden
You ward your allies from the attacks of your foes whenever you apply those
protections to yourself. When you gain a status bonus to AC and saves from Esoteric
Warden, you can choose to grant the same benefit to all allies within 30 feet.
THAUMATURGE’S DEMESNE
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
ARCANE
THAUMATURGE
You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to
ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more
than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area,
you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.
Once you’ve chosen your demesne, it’s automatically protected by an arcane
private sanctum spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your
level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a
spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three
unseen custodians, as a successful unseen custodian ritual (Advanced
Player’s Guide 245), and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel,
as a successful elemental sentinel ritual (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 150).
14TH LEVEL
ESOTERIC REFLEXES
FEAT 14
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites an implement that grants a reaction
Your bond to your implements is so strong that you can use their reactive abilities
almost by instinct. At the start of your turn, you gain an additional reaction, which
you can use for only the reactions granted by your implements.
GRAND TALISMAN ESOTERICA
FEAT 14
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Talisman Esoterica
You’ve completed your journey in studying esoteric talismans, gaining the ability to
place multiple talismans on an item. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an
item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a Talisman, you can
specially treat one item you’re working on, allowing it to have two active talismans
at once. This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item
with this ability.
