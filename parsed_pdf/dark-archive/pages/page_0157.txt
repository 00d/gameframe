The answer is that curses burrow deep. Most other spells
simply wash over their victim, coating them in flames
or befuddling them with enchantments. Curses embed
themselves in their victim’s very souls, feeding on the
energies within to ruin their lives. A typical spell is akin
to a wooden club, powerful, painful, but brief. A curse
is more like a splinter, smaller and subtler, but hard to
remove and capable of turning the limb gangrenous
and foul if left unaddressed.
The deep-rooted nature of a curse has a few
ramifications. To begin with, they tend to last for a very
long time. A bolt of wizard’s lightning is there and gone.
If not fatal, it doesn’t last the rest of the target’s life. A
curse of sickness or blight, on the other hand, can bedevil
a victim for years, even decades. Some famous curses have
lasted for centuries, troubling one generation of a family
after another or else turning an entire land into something
unholy. Curses are also extremely hard to remove; most
require a sophisticated bit of magic to excise, while others
can only be torn out by the will of the gods.
Penetrating deeply into a soul, however, is no easy task.
The most powerful curses usually manipulate the victim
into accepting them, throwing open the gates of their
metaphysical defenses and allowing the curse inside with
nary a challenge. This is usually achieved by having the
victim acquiesce to a pact, of which the curse is either an
inherent part or the penalty for a broken deal.
A classic example is the geas, a ritual in which the
subject swears a mighty oath and accepts to be cursed
if they should falter or turn aside. If the geas is willingly
accepted, the penalty curse can be inordinately powerful.
A more subtle example might be a tomb curse, where the
dead spirits of a tomb curse any intruders for violating
the implicit pacts of respecting the dead and their graves.
Though not as powerful as the curse of a broken oath,
these can still prove deadly.
A CHAIN OF CONSEQUENCES
TO BIND THE SOUL
Regarding curses, pacts, and the
consequences of ill-thought bargains
Let’s begin with the simplest question. What is a curse? Given that a suitably powerful
sorcerer can strip the flesh from your bones or turn you into their marionette, what
makes curses different? Why are they so feared compared to the myriad other ways in
which magic can harm you?
