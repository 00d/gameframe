Tempted Curse The insects multiply into a cascade. When you
activate the tempted curse, you must spend 2 actions to cast
a 5th-level vomit swarm to free the vermin inside you. For
1 minute after unleashing the swarm, you are not affected
by the curse, but afterward, the swarming worsens. For the
rest of the day, whenever you attempt to Cast a Spell with
a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has
the auditory trait, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check. On
a failure, the insects counteract your activity.
RAGE OF THE EXCOMMUNICANT
CURSE 10
RARE
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Placed upon heretics or those who broke faith, this curse
causes symbols of your former faith to burn you upon sight.
Saving Throw DC 27 Will; Effect This curse is always
associated with a specific deity, and is typically
experienced only by one of their former clerics or
champions. The sight of that deity’s religious symbol
burns you, dealing 1d6 damage every round you look
upon it. You can avert your eyes to avoid losing Hit
Points once you know where the symbol is located. In
addition, the curse hardens you against that god. You
gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC versus
divine spells cast by that deity’s clergy.
Tempted Curse The sight of the deity’s religious symbol
burns you with the god’s rage. You can activate the
tempted curse upon viewing the deity’s symbol. You are
quickened 1 for 1 minute and can use the extra action each
round only to Strike and Stride. For the rest of the day,
whenever you see the deity’s religious symbol, you lose
2d6 Hit Points.
FORBIDDING KNOWLEDGE
CURSE 11
RARE
ABJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
Information you never should have known lingers ever-
present in your mind.
Saving Throw DC 28 Will; Effect This curse
is
acquired
when
encountering
forbidden
knowledge. This curse is always associated with
a specific piece or topic of knowledge, such as a
demon lord’s plan to overtake a government or
the true name of a powerful wizard. Your tongue
trips when you try to tell another this knowledge,
and your hand stalls when you attempt to write
it. Any attempt at communicating it fails, even as
you can’t stop thinking about it.
Tempted Curse When you activate the tempted curse, you
must spend 2 actions to attempt to speak the triggering
knowledge. This allows you to redirect the curse’s energy
and cast silence heightened to 4th level, centered on
yourself. You are still unable to speak the knowledge
clearly, but you can convey a single word to an adjacent
creature. You gain the stupefied 2 condition for the
remainder of the day. This condition can’t be reduced until
the next time you perform your daily preparations, at
which point it ends.
ENFORCED HOSPITALITY
CURSE 13
RARE
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Cast upon the rude or inconsiderate, this curse compels you
to offer a genuine and warm greeting to each new creature
you meet.
Saving Throw DC 31 Will; Effect This curse compels you to
great those you meet as though they were old friends.
Whenever you come across a creature (or group of
creatures) for the first time, you must spend 1 action
greeting them or become slowed 1 for 1 minute, even if the
creature is obviously hostile. No matter your intention, your
greeting comes across as warm and genuine, and it grants
you a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to Make
an Impression.
Tempted Effect Your compulsion to greet newcomers
intensifies. You must greet every individual creature you
meet for the first time by spending 1 action greeting them
or become slowed 1 for 1 minute. If you meet more creatures
than you have actions, you can continue spending actions
greeting creatures across multiple turns. For example, if
you encountered six bandits, you could greet three bandits
on the first round and three bandits on the second round,
and you wouldn’t become slowed unless you took another
action before you finished greeting them. For 1 minute or
until you take a hostile action, you gain the effects of a
7th‑level sanctuary against creatures you’ve greeted in this
way (DC 31).
