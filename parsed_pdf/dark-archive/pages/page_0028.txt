Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target is frightened 1.
Failure The target is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target is frightened 3.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, your dark persona cares
only for destruction. You can Cast a Spell only if it can directly
damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental
condition or penalty on one.
MENTAL STATIC [reaction]
FEAT 8
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
NONLETHAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger You roll a critical success on a Will save against a
mental effect from a creature.
Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade
your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the
triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the
creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage,
such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.
REMOVE PRESENCE
FEAT 8
AMP
ILLUSION
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell reaches into the mind of a creature and removes you
from it. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more
targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a
saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip’s normal
amp entry.
Amp Choose one target of the spell or one creature in its area.
If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you become
undetected by that creature, disappearing from its senses for 1
minute or until you use a hostile action. This is similar to being
invisible, but effects like see invisibility don’t reveal you—you’re
affecting the target’s mind, not its vision. True seeing can still
see through this illusion if the counteract check succeeds.
THOUGHTSENSE
FEAT 8
DIVINATION
MENTAL
OCCULT
You can detect the flickers of mental activity let off by all
thinking creatures. You gain thoughtsense as a vague sense
that has a range of 30 feet—like all vague senses, it’s only
about as precise as an average human’s sense of smell, meaning
you generally can predict only if a creature is present. Your
thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature
that is unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects (such
as many constructs and oozes) can’t be perceived using your
thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, your thoughtsense upgrades
to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to Seek out creatures.
WHISPERING STEPS
FEAT 8
AMP
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a
creature—one through which you can nudge the creature’s
mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more
actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require
a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place
of the psi cantrip’s normal amp entry.
Amp Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that
enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the
creature’s mind, forcing it to Step in a direction of your
choosing; as this is forced movement, you can’t force the
creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or
the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily
immune to this amp for 24 hours.
10TH LEVEL
DREAM GUISE [one-action]
FEAT 10
ILLUSION
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements wandering reverie subconscious mind
You Stride into a willing ally’s space, at which point both of
your appearances shift into a shared third appearance, usually
one that looks like a mix of the two of you. Then, either you
or your ally Steps. You each maintain the merged appearance.
Creatures who are observing this know what happened,
but still must Seek or otherwise engage with the illusion to
attempt to disbelieve it and determine which of you is which.
Otherwise, they can’t tell the difference and have an equal
chance to target each of you (DC 11 flat check). This illusion
ends as soon as either you or the ally you’re merged with acts.
EMOTIONAL SURGE [one-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements emotional acceptance subconscious mind
Your heart soars, increasing your power for a moment. You
gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks until the
start of your next turn.
IMPOSE ORDER [one-action]
FEAT 10
FORTUNE
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements precise discipline subconscious mind
You bring discipline to your mind and magic, ensuring that you
don’t under-perform. Until the end of your turn, instead of rolling
dice for damage, count each damage die as average damage
rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, and 7 for d12).
SCOUR THE LIBRARY [one-action]
FEAT 10
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements gathered lore subconscious mind
Seeing an enemy’s attack, you quickly consult multiple scraps
of lore in your mind, synthesizing them into the perfect plan.
Make a check to Recall Knowledge (using an appropriate skill)
about one creature within 60 feet. On a success, in addition to
the normal benefits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your
next attack roll against that creature and to your AC against
the creature’s next attack. On a critical success, the bonuses
are +2.
SIGNATURE SPELL EXPANSION
FEAT 10
PSYCHIC
Your direct mental grasp of your power lets you cast more spells
with greater freedom. You gain two additional signature spells,
each of which must have a minimum level of 3rd or lower.
