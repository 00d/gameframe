A secret society wears its nature in its name; it is, first and
foremost, a secret. We hide our hearts from the outside
world because we know others won’t understand or
approve of our efforts. We hide from unkind rivals, from
the laws of nations or gods, and from the opprobrium of
society at large. Some secret societies are harmless bands
of well-meaning fools out to enjoy a pleasant evening,
but most are criminals in the eyes of their peers, delvers
into the taboo and the forbidden.
Second, it is a society. Unlike mere criminal gangs,
there’s ritual, there’s rule, there’s a way of order that
makes us more than just a loose collection of motley
allies. Most secret societies claim traditions and a long
history, and when such things are unavailable, they
invent them; it’s something of a tradition for a secret
society to claim ancestry dating to the Four Pharaohs
of Osirion, Choral the Conqueror, or Thassilon. These
claims are mostly lies. A few, we suppose, might be telling
the truth—I did encounter once in Senghor a gentleman
who admitted to being a librarian-assassin, and that his
order had been sanctioned since the days of the Azlanti.
I expressed skepticism, but he spoke seven words to me
then, and Archivist Onreni corroborated them later as a
formula used by Azlanti judges prior to sentencing one
to death. Perhaps the founder of the gentleman’s order
knew more Azlanti than most and used it to give their
society a sense of realism, but it’s not entirely impossible
the group truly was ancient.
THE NATURE OF CONSPIRACY
There are three ways, we’ve found, of organizing a
proper secret society. At the one extreme, there’s the cell:
small, isolated, secretive. At the other is the pyramid:
hierarchical, controlled, vulnerable. In between is the
Pathfinders’ structure, the humble chapter, independent
geographic structures, that are free enough to operate
as they see fit, but organized enough to take larger-scale
action as needed.
A WEB OF CONNECTIONS
Secret Societies, Underground
Organizations, Those Who Whisper
The irony of secret societies is that we’re just one more conspiracy. Our goals are
greater, our means more substantial, but when we look at these others, we see
fellow spiders, all of us weaving our webs of fact and fiction, lies and truth, until
we catch whatever prey we choose to hunt—or it catches us.
