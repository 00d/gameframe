through some sort of connection with a person known
only as the Grand Dam.
The Marlview Village Society
I have in front of me right now Archivist Krayne’s
report of a peculiar little society from the River
Kingdoms, in the village of Marlview. Presuming I can
decipher
Krayne’s
execrable
handwriting, she was initially
visiting a small village just
outside Brevoy to follow up a
rumor that something has been
buried there since the days of
Old Koloran. The villagers were
entirely helpful and friendly,
even when Archivist Krayne,
somewhat the worse for drink,
let slip what precisely she was
looking for.
That very evening, two of
the villagers came to her room
in the local inn and tried to
strangle her. Archivist Krayne,
being a remarkable agent even
when somewhat incapacitated with drink, was able
to disarm them and presented them to the proper
authorities the next morning, whereupon she was
arrested for attacking two of the local worthies and
was forced to escaped from the village jail (a root cellar
when not in use as a cell). She reports she eventually
found a tunnel beneath the mayor’s house, which led her
to a subterranean chamber containing, in her words, “a
great sarcophagus of gleaming, ebony metal, 40 paces
long and half as wide, undecorated.” Archivist Krayne
was forced to escape the village at that point, pursued
by hunters with hounds, until she eventually crossed a
river and was able to secure refuge in a major town. She
was most irritated.
We believe the secret society Archivist Krayne
uncovered was dedicated to watching over the
sarcophagus, either to protect it from any who might
wish it harm or to protect the rest of the world from
whatever lies within. The society clearly had penetrated
all levels of Marlview’s civic infrastructure and was able
to use it to force Archivist Krayne to retreat.
Marlview is not unique. For all that we focus on
the great conspiracies and webs of intrigue, there are
dozens, perhaps hundreds, of small groups hidden in the
back roads and dismal forests of Golarion, little spiders
hidden in cupboards, out of sight and out of mind.
The Exarchate of the Infinite Clock
If one is to believe Archivist Varien’s increasingly
unhinged missives, the Exarchate of the Infinite Clock
is a rather malignant cabal of surgeons, engineers, and
mages, dedicated to achieving an arcane apotheosis
through the replacement of portions of the brain with
precisely calibrated magical clockworks—unlikely to be
successful, but likely to have a high body count.
Archivist Varien suspects, and we think he’s likely
correct, they originated in Alkenstar, probably sometime
in the last half-century. Precise information is difficult
to come by, as the clockmakers are a highly secretive
organization
of
small
cells
largely uninterested in their
own history. We can say for
certain that clockmaker agents
have been found in much of
northern Garund and western
Casmaron—a cell was uncovered
in Katheer about a year ago.
Clockmakers derive from the
Nexian understanding of magic
as a tool of the world’s creation,
that spells are simply leftover
instructions from what came
before. They further believe that
with a sufficiently advanced
understanding of mathematics,
one can improve the power of
one’s spellcrafting to absurd heights. Reasonable. They
also theorize that by utilizing ancient Jistkan automaton
techniques, one can replace portions of the brain with
occult devices that make them more powerful mages,
with a theoretical “Infinite Clock” granting near‑deific
power. Riskier, but not the strangest thing we’ve
encountered.
The clockmakers prefer not to experiment on
themselves and instead kidnap unsuspecting victims,
ideally apprentice mages or hedge-witches, and use them
as a testing ground for their studies. Here is where they
cross the line from strange theory to sinister conspiracy.
Most victims die from such invasive brain surgery, and
the few survivors, who, in fairness, do show a great deal
of power, are killed lest they endanger the cell.
Assuming we can take the Katheer cell as typical,
the society’s clockmakers typically operate in cells of
a half dozen, with a single mage-engineer conducting
experiments while the rest of the cabal secures victims,
deals with authorities, and makes certain there’s a
suitable location in which to conduct arcane surgeries.
Someplace quiet, remote.
Through informants, we’ve gotten the impression
that the clockmakers are almost as concerned about
each other as they are about the authorities objecting
to their gruesome research. A conspiracy of scientist
serial killers is hardly a convivial bunch, and each
clockmaker cell is deeply paranoid a rival is going to
develop the Infinite Clock before it does. In fact, we
believe the Katheer cell was uncovered through the
actions of a rival cell in the form of anonymous tip‑offs
to the satrap’s agents.
