Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute or until discharged
You understand that holding a secret is in itself a kind of
power. Each target must attempt a Will save.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure A rune symbolizing a secret the target is keeping
(at the GM’s discretion) appears floating in front of you. If
that creature attempts a Strike or spell attack against you
while you hold their secret, you can discharge the rune as a
reaction to deal 7d6 mental damage to the creature.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target becomes convinced you
know their secret and takes 1d6 persistent mental damage
from worry. If the rune with the secret is discharged while
the creature is still taking the persistent mental damage, the
persistent mental damage immediately ends.
Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by
2d6, and the persistent mental damage on a
critical failure increases by 1.

Range 1 mile
You call forth numerous breezes in which you weave gossip,
whispering subtly into the ears of those around. Choose a
rumor or information you wish to spread, which may or may not
be true, about a single subject. Those within range of the spell
overhear the rumor at some point over the next hour, though
they’ll be unable to pin it down to a source. Attempt a check
with a modifier equal to your spell DC – 10 against a hard DC
for your level. The GM might modify the DC depending on how
plausible the rumor is. Repeated castings to
spread the same rumor or information
have no effect unless circumstances
have
substantially
changed,
as
determined by the GM.
Critical Success Your rumor spreads far
and wide, and it’s at the tip of people’s
tongues. For 1 week, anyone who
succeeds at a check to Gather Information
on the specific subject learns your rumor in
preference to other rumors about the subject.
Skill checks to convince people that the rumor is
true get a +2 circumstance bonus.
Success Enough people take note of the rumor that it
begins to spread, though those who heard the rumor aren’t
necessarily convinced. For 1 week, anyone who succeeds at
a check to Gather Information on the specific subject adds
your rumor to the list of rumors they could learn about the
subject, and skill checks to convince people that the rumor
is true get a +1 circumstance bonus.
Failure Most in the area dismiss the rumor as wild gossip and
pay it little mind, granting no effect.
Critical Failure The winds’ gossip is misinterpreted and
spreads information contradictory to the rumor you were
attempting to spread. A contradictory rumor spreads, and
skill checks to convince others that your original rumor is
true take a –2 circumstance penalty.

TRANSMUTATION
Domain knowledge (apocryphal)
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 document written by a single author
and comprised of written text in a single language
Duration until the next time you Refocus
You’re a devotee of knowledge with an unmatched
command of the language used to spread that knowledge,
and you can reshape the written word into a form more
understandable to your audience. The language of the
target’s written text shifts to a language you know. This
shift doesn’t change the text’s contents beyond minor
translation differences, nor does it grant the reader any
understanding of the original language.
