This forces us to question the very nature of time itself:
does it operate consistently with anomalous exceptions, or
does it instead have a variable multiplicity—and if so, what
determines the flow of time? Does time flow at all, or is it
simply an illusion created by our own inability to process
information nonlinearly? Every uniform theory of time has
proven to be lacking.
Magic interacts strangely with the timestream. With
considerable power, it’s possible to manipulate time
to a certain extent, but never enough to fully explain
the range of observed phenomena, nor the variability.
Unfortunately, we’re at a loss, as our ability to gather
data is limited to what we can find by interacting with
and investigating areas where time goes wrong, so-called
“anomalies.” As experiments go, they’re nearly impossible
to recreate. Is each phenomenon we’ve documented some
sort of unique cosmic glitch or micro-fracture?
Take, for instance, Crystilan. An arcane dome wrapped
around the city of Xin-Edasseril with its inhabitants
frozen in time for millennia, caused by malfunctions in the
process of creating a runewell. The Society takes issue with
any attempts to recreate this phenomenon, citing concerns
about the power of runewells, despite its foremost
potential to provide crucial insight into a fundamental
mystery surrounding the fabric of our reality. Typical.
Stranger still are the temporal phenomena in motion. To
stop time is one thing, difficult but not nearly impossible.
To see it move, repeat, and change is another. And how
does any of this interact with the poorly understood
Dimension of Time?
TWISTS IN THE
ENDLESS RIVER
Time loops, causal paradoxes,
and other temporal anomalies
Of all the phenomena we’ve studied over the years, none cause so much headache as
Golarion’s myriad temporal anomalies. Each operates under its own rules, forcing
us to discern the nature of each individually, and often under dangerous conditions.
The fact that temporal anomalies can manifest their effects before they’ve even occurred, in direct defiance of
our common understanding of causality, further cements their status as one of the Archive’s most troublesome
sources of incidents.
