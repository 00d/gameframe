circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the spell ends.
Starting the round after you Cast the Spell, the first time
each round you Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Shove
the creature again.
Amp Heightened (4th) You can attempt to Disarm the creature
instead of attempting to Shove it. If you knock an item out of
the creature’s grasp in this way, the mage hand immediately
grabs it. Any effect of the mage hand on the creature ends,
and the spell now carries the item, just like you had picked
it up with an unamped mage hand.
Telekinetic Projectile
Your telekinetic projectiles can fly much further away.
Increase the range of telekinetic projectile to 60 feet. It
also gains the following amp.
Amp You fling objects with even more force, driving your
opponents backwards in a hail of objects. On a success,
you push the target 5 feet away from you, and on a critical
success, you push the target 10 feet away from you in
addition to dealing double damage.
Amp Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6 instead of
by 1d6.

Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 2 non-overlapping 5-foot bursts
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space.
You deal your choice of 1d6 bludgeoning or 1d6 slashing
damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude
save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the
bursts takes damage only once.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
Amp Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts
deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage,
instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails
its save is also stunned 1.
Amp Heightened (+2) Both types of damage increase by 1d6
instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5-foot burst
to the area.

ABJURATION
CANTRIP
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area one 5-foot square
Duration until the start of your next turn
You set up a transparent, rippling screen of telekinetic
energy that seizes small, fast-moving projectiles. Creatures
can pass through the screen, but ammunition from physical
ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and
other objects of similar size—is automatically trapped in
the screen, clattering to the ground once the spell ends.
Attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take
a –2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths
pass through the screen. Massive ranged weapons and spell
effects that don’t create physical objects pass through the
screen with no penalty.
Heightened (5th) The screen is 10 feet wide.
Heightened (6th) The screen is 10 feet wide and can interfere
even with massless attacks, like magical blasts or gouts of
flame. The screen imposes a –2 circumstance penalty to the
attack rolls of spell effects even if they don’t create physical
objects. It also protects against area effects that pass
through the screen, granting standard cover to creatures
on the opposite side of the screen from the center or origin
point of an area.
Amp Your screen persists for longer, and you can detonate
it in an explosive counterattack. The duration of the spell
increases to 1 minute. You can Dismiss the spell. If there
are any projectiles trapped in the screen, you can cast
telekinetic projectile to fire them at one creature as part of
Dismissing the spell. Measure the range for the telekinetic
projectile from where the vector screen was, instead of
from you.
DANCING BLADE
CANTRIP 5

EVOCATION
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You telekinetically animate a weapon that’s unattended or on
your person. It brandishes itself at a foe of your choice as if
wielded by an invisible duelist. When you first Cast the Spell,
the weapon automatically flies to the target and Strikes. It
moves along with its target, always remaining within reach.
Each time you Sustain the Spell, the weapon either Changes
Partners or Strikes. The weapon’s attacks use and contribute
to your multiple attack penalty.
•	 Change Partners Change the weapon’s target to a
different creature within 30 feet. The weapon flies to its
new target.
•	 Strike (attack) The weapon attacks its target using your
spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals damage
equal to 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, of a
type determined by the weapon (if the weapon has the
versatile trait or can otherwise deal multiple types of
damage, you choose each time you attack).
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
Amp The weapon’s attacks increase in strength, and your
control is fine enough for advanced technique. The damage
dice for the weapon’s Strike change from d6s to d10s. When
you Cast or Sustain the spell, you can choose from the
following options in addition to the standard ones.
•	 Guard Rather than attacking, the weapon grants a +2
circumstance bonus to AC against melee attacks to the
creature it’s following. The bonus lasts until the start of
your next turn or until the weapon Changes Partners,
whichever comes first.
•	 Push (attack) The weapon attempts to Push its target,
using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check
to determine the results of the Push.
