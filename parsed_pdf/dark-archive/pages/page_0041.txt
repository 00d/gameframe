Paragon Benefit
17th
Your regalia grants you the true gravitas of rulership, tying together the
hearts and minds of your allies and making it impossible for you to leave a
bad impression. If you roll a critical failure on a check to Coerce, Make an
Impression, or Request, you get a failure instead. When others use Follow the
Expert to follow you, you grant them a +3 circumstance bonus if you are trained
or +4 if you are an expert or above.
Allies in your inspiring aura aren’t flat-footed from being flanked unless you
too are flanked. If one of your allies in the aura is clumsy, enfeebled, frightened,
sickened, or stupefied, the status penalty your ally takes from the condition is 1
lower than the condition’s value as long as the ally remains in the aura, unless
you too are affected by the same condition.
TOME
Tome implements embody lost knowledge and otherworldly insights. While a
weathered book is most common, tome implements can have as many different
form factors as there are ways to store knowledge, from carved clay tablets to
bundles of knotted cords. Tome implements are associated with the harrow suit
of books and the astrological signs of the stargazer and the underworld dragon.
Initiate Benefit
While you hold your tome, lines of text appear on the open pages, revealing
useful information. While you hold your tome, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to all skill checks to Recall Knowledge.
During your daily preparations, you can gain the trained proficiency rank in
two skills of your choice until you prepare again. You retain the benefit as long
as the tome is on your person, even if you aren’t holding it. At 3rd level, you’re
an expert in one of the skills and trained in the other, and at 5th level, you’re an
expert in both skills. Since these proficiencies are temporary, you can’t use them
as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
Adept Benefit
7th
In addition to the initiate benefits, your tome inscribes insights into creatures
that you can use to strike them down. While holding your tome, at the start of
your turn each round, attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature
of your choice that you’re observing. If this check succeeds, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature
before the start of your next turn.
When you gain temporary skill proficiencies during your
daily preparations, one is at expert proficiency and the
other at master proficiency. At 9th level, you have master
proficiency in both.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your tome’s power not only reads a creature’s present but even
records its future actions. When you use Intensify Vulnerability,
roll a d20 and set the result aside. At any time until the start
of your next turn, you can use the d20 result you set aside for an
attack roll to Strike the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, instead of
rolling a new d20; this is a fortune effect.
Paragon Benefit
17th
In addition to the other benefits, your tome’s information alerts you to
ambushes and attacks from your foes. While holding your tome, you can
always roll a skill check for initiative against creatures or haunts using Esoteric
Lore. If you do, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to your initiative roll.
