Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge created by the Dark Archive
folio deposits the PCs in Absalom. From there, the PCs
can ask around about Vir Zhees or draw upon their own
knowledge. They determine the following information
based on a DC 20 Diplomacy check to Gather Information,
or a DC 20 Society or DC 18 Absalom, Mercantile, or
Underworld Lore check to Recall Knowledge.
Critical Success As success, and the PC has also heard rumors
that Vir Zhees’ desire for curios sometimes drives her to
black market contacts. If she can discreetly procure products
that catch her interest, she doesn’t ask too many questions.
Success Vir Zhees is an elven merchant whose pride and joy
is her collection of curios. Her negotiation skills combined
with her lack of political ambition make her a sought-after
mediator in disputes. The PCs easily locate Vir Zhees’s manor
house in the Petal District.
Failure The PC has never heard of Vir Zhees.
Critical Failure The PCs hears that Vir
Zhees is affiliated with the Lion Blades,
spies based out of Taldor and loyal to
Grand Princess Eutropia. She engages
in clandestine missions to assist the Lion
Blades in tracking down agents that may
pose a threat to Taldor’s interests.
If all the PCs fail, they can
pay a local newsie 1 gp to
show them the way to Vir
Zhees’s estate.
When
the
PCs
arrive,
a
guard, Bahvan, greets them and takes
their measure, deciding they could act as
insurance for the Helping Hands’ plans. Bahvan
escorts them to the dining room to meet with Vir. Bahvan
assures a wary Vir that these guests are just the people to
help with their current predicament. Read or paraphrase
the following.
Bahvan leads the way into a lavish dining
room where a finely dressed elf woman
stands, lost in thought. Her eyes are fixed
on a glove that rests at the center of the
table. It’s hewed of black velvet, rimmed with
dried blood at its opening—the empty hand a
stark focal point against the white marble of the
large surface.
“Please, have a seat. I am Vir Zhees, and I
understand you are here to meet with me?
We can discuss business later, but for
the time being, there are more pressing
matters at hand. My guard Bahvan
assures me you are the type of people
who might be able to help?” Vir continues,
her voice grave. “This is the third time in recent
memory that someone has been meddling with my affairs and
those of my associates, and the first that someone has been
caught at my estate. I think I’m being watched.
“Bahvan managed to claim a hand before the miscreant got
away with a scroll. The glove bears a strange
mark: look close.” She gets up from her
chair and slides the glove toward the
edge of the table for inspection.
The PCs can observe the mark.
It looks like an infinity symbol
turned vertical, crossed with an
X at its middle and pointed on
its top arc. A PC who succeeds at
a DC 18 Society check or Absalom
Lore check to Recall Knowledge surmises
that the mark signifies membership in some sort of secret
society; with a critical success, the PC recalls that it’s
associated with an organization called the Helping Hand,
a group of people from the lower classes of Absalom who
work to expose corruption.
After showing the PCs the glove, Vir
continues.
“I’d hoped this was just a few scattered thieves looking
for a chance to loot my considerable treasures,
easily countered. But Bahvan caught
this intruder snooping through my
documents, specifically the ones
about a meeting I’ll be conducting at the
Fullbloom Opera House tomorrow. If my
documents were merely trade manifests,
that would certainly be concerning, but
as a public servant, I hold information
of a more sensitive nature. Absalom has
many factions, and it has been my honor and
pleasure over these past few decades to apply the
skills I’ve learned as a merchant to help government officials
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 5th-level
characters.
Shaking the Helping Hand takes place in the Petal
District of Absalom. On the request of a wealthy
patron who had been targeted by a mysterious
secret society, the PCs attend an opera. The patron
fears that this society will attempt to sabotage
a meeting that she is holding with proxies for
government officials. In fact, the secret society,
known as the Helping Hand, had come to the opera
to stop the patron and proxies from abducting
servants and trading them away to traffickers from
Shadow Absalom. If the PCs uncover the truth, they
can stop these abductions and assist the Helping
Hand with exposing these criminals from Absalom’s
high society.
