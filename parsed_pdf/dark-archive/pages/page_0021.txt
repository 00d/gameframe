Produce Flame
You can drastically increase the heat against adjacent
targets. When using produce flame as a melee attack,
increase the damage dice of the initial damage (but not the
persistent damage) from d4s to d6s. Your produce flame
also gains the following amp.
Amp You project pure heat that causes a target to combust.
The initial damage changes to 1d10 fire damage (not adding
your ability modifier) plus 1 fire splash damage. When
using amped produce flame as a melee attack, increase the
damage dice of the initial damage from d10s to d12s. You are
not harmed by splash damage from amped produce flame.
Amp Heightened (+1) Instead of using produce flame’s normal
heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10
(1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The
persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.
Ray of Frost
Your ray of frost reaches even further. The range increases
to 180 feet. Your ray of frost also gains the following amp.
Amp You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what you
plunder to replenish yourself. The ray deals 1d10 cold damage.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the
target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose
any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
Amp Heightened (+1) The initial damage increases by 1d10
instead of 1d4.
THERMAL STASIS

UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
CANTRIP
PSYCHIC
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the start of your next turn
The same abilities that let you raise or lower thermal energy
also let you keep it at a safe medium. The target gains
resistance 2 against fire damage and resistance 2 against
cold damage.
Heightened (+1) Each resistance increases by 2.
Amp The spell’s duration becomes 1 minute.
ENTROPIC WHEEL
CANTRIP 3
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
COLD
EVOCATION
FIRE
PSYCHIC
Cast [reaction] verbal; Trigger You deal cold or fire damage to an enemy.
Duration 1 minute
You stockpile thermal energy in a magical wheel-like construct
that lets you burn opponents with cold or freeze their bodies
with heat. When you Cast the Spell, the wheel has one mote
of thermal energy, and when you use a cold or fire effect or
deal cold or fire damage, the wheel spins, siphoning off a bit of
energy and gaining another mote. The wheel can’t gain motes
more than once on a given turn, and the maximum number of
motes is equal to entropic wheel’s level.
When you Cast a Spell that deals fire damage, the target
also takes cold damage equal to the number of motes in the
entropic wheel. When you Cast a Spell that deals cold damage,
the target also takes fire damage equal to the number of motes
in the entropic wheel. This applies only to the initial damage
of the spell, not to any persistent damage or ongoing effects.
Amp You gain two motes instead of one when you Cast the
Spell and each time the wheel gains another mote.
REDISTRIBUTE POTENTIAL
CANTRIP 5
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
COLD
EVOCATION
FIRE
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 2 adjacent 5-foot squares
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can
shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either
area take 4d4 damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one
of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other
to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature
that fails its save also becomes clumsy 1 from numbness if it’s
in the area of stolen heat or enfeebled 1 from heat stroke if it’s
in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the
start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both
squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its
save against; it’s unaffected by the other area.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
Amp You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander
scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10-foot
bursts. They still must be adjacent to one another and can
overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only
one of your choice. The spell’s damage increases to 6d6. The
conditions last for 1 minute.
Amp Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 2d6 instead of 1d4.
THE SILENT WHISPER
Every mind murmurs constantly, and the static from those
nearby reverberates in your head like wind through leaves.
What better focus for your magic then, than the very
thoughts of those around you? Your versatile telepathic
abilities let you soothe and communicate with your allies
or control your enemies.
Granted Spells 1st: mindlink; 2nd: touch of idiocy; 3rd: heroism;
4th: telepathy; 5th: synaptic pulse; 6th: sending; 7th: visions
of danger; 8th: uncontrollable dance; 9th: telepathic demand
Standard Psi Cantrips daze and message
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: forbidden thought; deeper:
shatter mind; deepest: contagious idea
Daze
You can daze from a great distance. The range increases to
120 feet. Your daze also gains the following amp.
Amp Your spell cracks the target’s mental defenses, leaving
it susceptible to further psychic attack. The spell’s damage
changes to 1d10. If the target fails its Will save, until the end
of its next turn, it gains weakness 1 to mental damage and
takes a –1 status penalty to Will saves. On a critical failure, the
weakness is 3 (in addition to the target being stunned 1). The
weakness applies before daze deals damage.
Amp Heightened (+2) The spell’s damage increases by 2d10, and
the weakness on a failure or critical failure increases by 1.
