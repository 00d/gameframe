the area. Even if the liquid is concealed from you—for example,
if it stems from an underground spring or is piped through a
wall—this technique points you in the right direction. The GM
determines the DC, which is usually the trained simple DC with
a hard or very hard adjustment if the source of water is small.
If you’re an expert in Survival, the GM also makes a Survival
check for you to detect sizable deposits of metal, minerals,
and nearby graves. The DC is usually the expert simple DC,
with DC adjustments for smaller deposits.
MORPHIC MANIPULATION
FEAT 7
UNCOMMON
EXPLORATION
GENERAL
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE PRIMAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Nature
You’ve attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing
it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a
small, natural non-creature plant—such as a lone flower, a
small bush, or a potted succulent—while you bring your aura
in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one
stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant,
plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn’t have
proper nutrients (if you’re sprouting a seed without soil or
water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you
complete the activity. Performing this activity more than
once per day renders you fatigued and unable to use Morphic
Manipulation until your next full night’s rest.

EMOTION EXPLORATION GENERAL

SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
With a touch, you can read the psychic impressions left on
objects by their previous owners. This exploration activity
functions similarly to Detect Magic in that you move at half
your travel speed or slower while looking for psychometric
resonance. You must brush your bare hands over any objects
you pass while you do this. This detects objects with significant
emotional resonance attached to them, such as the joy from
a child’s beloved teddy bear, the sorrow from a widower’s
wedding ring, or the fear from a victim’s murder weapon. If
you’re looking for a particular type of emotional resonance,
you can choose to ignore other emotions. If you find an item
with that resonance, you can explore that resonance with the
following action.
Psychometric Assessment (concentrate, divination, emotion,
exploration, mental, occult) Requirements Your bare hands
are touching an object in which you detected psychometric
resonance; Effect You spend 1 minute concentrating on
the object to get a vision of the face of the person who
imbued the item with such emotion in the first place. If the
associated emotion is painfully negative, you might take
1d6 psychic damage, as determined by the GM.
SKEPTIC’S DEFENSE [reaction]
FEAT 7
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Intimidation
Frequency once per day
Trigger You are targeted by or are in the area of a mental spell
or effect.
You don’t believe in any mental twaddle, and you’re certainly
not afraid of it. You scoff and verbally refute the triggering
effect, attempting a counteract check using your Intimidation
modifier with a counteract level of half your level rounded up. If
you succeed, you ignore the triggering effect, though any other
creatures that were also targeted or in the area are still affected.
If the source of the effect you successfully counteracted
understands your language and has an Intelligence modifier of
–3 or higher, that creature becomes stupefied for 1 round.
