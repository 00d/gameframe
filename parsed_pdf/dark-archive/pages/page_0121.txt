REFLECTION (RARE HERITAGE)
You were created as a duplicate of another creature,
intentionally or accidentally, though you might not know
of your origins. Other than a minor mark or two, you
look just like your progenitor. You gain the reflection
trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You
don’t need to attempt Deception checks to Impersonate
your progenitor unless you’re interacting with people who
know them personally or you do something known to be
out of character for them. The GM might require you to
roll a Deception check in other circumstances, such as if
you’re mirror-risen and interacting with someone who has
seen an accurate likeness of your progenitor and might
notice a distinguishing feature on the reverse side. You can
choose from reflection feats and feats from your ancestry
whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Reflection Feats
The following feats are available to reflection characters.
1ST LEVEL
CLONE-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were formed from a clone ritual or alchemical experiment.
Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress
your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to
alter. You gain the Empty Vessel reaction.
Empty Vessel [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per day;
Trigger You would take mental damage or be affected by
a mental effect; Effect You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to Will saves and resistance to mental damage equal to
your level against the triggering effect. This applies only
to the initial effect, not successive saves, persistent mental
damage, or other repeated effects.
MIRROR-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were created from magic
involving mirrors and still retain
some ability to seek refuge in
reflected illusions. You gain the
Mirror’s Trickery reaction.
Mirror’s Trickery [reaction] (concentrate,
illusion, occult, visual) Frequency
once per day; Trigger You would be hit
by a Strike; Effect You create an illusory duplicate at the
last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it
instead of you. The attacker attempts a DC 11 flat check; on
a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result
from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
MORPH-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were once a shapeshifter or spellcaster using polymorph
magic, but something went wrong, and you became trapped
in the form of the creature you were imitating. This accident
might have drained your power, or you might have retained
some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further
forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to saving throws against transmutation effects, and if you
roll a success on a saving throw against a hostile morph or
polymorph effect, you get a critical success instead.
PROGENITOR LORE
FEAT 1
REFLECTION
You didn’t just inherit your physical form from your progenitor;
you also retained some of their knowledge. You’re trained in
Deception and Occultism. If you would automatically become
trained in one of those skills (from your background or class,
for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice. You also become trained in a Lore corresponding to
your ancestry (e. g., Elf Lore if your progenitor is an elf).
WARPED REFLECTION [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
FEAR
MENTAL
REFLECTION
VISUAL
Frequency once per minute
Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most.
You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within
30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though
this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the
target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a Will
save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or
become frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical failure) and
be stupefied 1 as long as the frightened condition lasts.
Once you’ve used Warped Reflection against a creature, it’s
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
5TH LEVEL
MISTAKEN IDENTITY [reaction]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
MENTAL
REFLECTION
Frequency once per minute
Trigger You’re about to attempt a
saving throw against a mental effect.
You feel a strong connection with
your progenitor and can convince
yourself an effect targeting your
mind was meant for theirs instead,
allowing you to shrug off harmful
effects. Roll the saving throw twice, and
take the higher result. However, subsuming your
identity is disturbing, and you’re frightened 1.
REFLECTIVE POCKET
FEAT 5
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Mirror-Risen
You’ve formed a connection with a small hand mirror, allowing
you to use it as an extradimensional storage space. You can
store one item of light Bulk in your mirror at a time. Storing or
retrieving an item requires an Interact action and any creature
can do so. While an item is stored within the mirror, the mirror
