SIXTH SENSE
FEAT 6
DIVINATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your psychic abilities also allow you to detect the lingering thoughts of spirits and
similar entities. While you’re exploring but not Searching, the GM rolls a secret check
for you to find haunts that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on
the Ethereal Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence, such as celestials,
fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits inside solid objects,
provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, Seeking, and
on the automatic secret check from Sixth Sense. You can still notice spirits only on a
successful check, and you can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object.
When you notice a creature with your Sixth Sense, you also learn its location,
making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.
STEADY SPELLCASTING
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your concentration when you Cast
a Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat
check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
STRAIN MIND [free-action]
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You cast a psi cantrip.
Requirements You have 0 Focus Points.
You strain your body beyond its limits to use an amp even when your mental power
is depleted. You add an amp that costs 1 Focus Point to the spell. Instead of
paying the normal Focus Point cost, you lose Hit Points equal to four
times the spell level of the amped psi cantrip as you bleed from your
nose or suffer some other visible sign of strain.
8TH LEVEL
BRAIN DRAIN [two-actions]
FEAT 8
DIVINATION
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature’s mental energy to replenish
your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a Will save
against your spell DC.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to
your normal maximum. You can’t use Brain Drain again until after the next time
you make your daily preparations.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is stupefied 2.
DARK PERSONA’S PRESENCE [free-action]
FEAT 8
AURA
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Trigger You Unleash your Psyche.
When you Unleash your Psyche, all your rage and pain—the portion of your psyche
dedicated to cruel retribution—come along with it.
The force of your dark persona’s negativity batters constantly against all creatures
in a 30-foot emanation when you Unleash your Psyche and for as long as your
Psyche is Unleashed. A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC
the first time it enters the emanation, or if it’s in the emanation when you take this
action; it doesn’t need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and
returns. A creature frightened by your Dark Persona’s Presence can’t decrease its
frightened value below 1 while within the emanation.
