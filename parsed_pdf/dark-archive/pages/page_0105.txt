DEVIANT SPELLS
While the supernatural magic of deviant powers exist outside the frame of spellwork, the Dark Archive has been able to
develop several new spells for its field agents, especially psychics, by studying the abilities of various unique individuals.
A selection is presented below. A list of all the spells in this book by level and tradition can be found on page 216.
Spell Descriptions
BILOCATION
SPELL 9
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You exist in two places at once. When you Cast the Spell,
another copy of yourself appears in an adjacent square.
During bilocation’s duration, whenever you act, you can
choose which of your selves does so, and whenever one
of you uses a move action, you can both move. Your two
selves share Hit Points, and any condition or effect on one
affects both. If both of your selves are in the area of the
same effect, or targeted by the same multitarget effect,
you are only affected once. Even if you are reduced to 0
Hit Points or killed, both selves remain until the duration
expires. Your link continues at any distance, even across
planar boundaries. You can Dismiss the Spell, and if you
do so, you choose which of the selves vanishes and which
becomes you, allowing you to extricate one of your selves
from a dangerous situation.
BRACING TENDRILS
SPELL 3
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
Visible tendrils of force anchor your body to the ground,
preventing unwanted movement. Whenever you’re on the
ground and a creature or effect attempts to forcibly move
you from your space, you can use your spell DC in place of
your Fortitude DC as the DC of the check to move you. If
a creature wouldn’t normally need a check to move you, it
must succeed at an appropriate check (usually an Athletics
check for physical movement) against your spell DC or you
are unmoved; if an effect wouldn’t normally need a check
to move you, it must counteract bracing tendrils or you are
unmoved. When a creature fails to move you in this way, you
can choose to have the tendrils lash back and push them 5
feet away from you.
While the tendrils anchor you in place when you come
to a stop, they uproot easily to cooperate with your own
voluntary movement, so you can still move freely while
under the effect of the spell.
