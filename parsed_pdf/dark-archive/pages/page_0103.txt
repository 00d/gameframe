Backlash: Strained Metabolism
Your body’s overclocked physiology requires larger-than-
usual amounts of nourishment, leaving you weakened
when it kicks in mid-combat.
Mild Backlash Your metabolism immediately burns through
your body’s energy stores, making you enfeebled 1 and clumsy
1 until you take a bite of food (which usually requires 2 Interact
actions: one to retrieve the food and another to consume it).
Moderate Backlash Ravenous hunger wracks your body.
You are enfeebled 1, clumsy 1, and fatigued until you can eat a
full meal, which requires at least 10 minutes.
Severe Backlash The strain on your body is truly
incapacitating. You become sickened 2 as nausea wracks you,
and you are also enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 until you can eat a
full meal (which requires you to no longer be sickened). You
are fatigued until you can get a full night’s rest.
WRAITH
Wraith-type deviations often result from contact with
otherworldly presences or artifacts, comprising a strange
assortment of abilities that involve realms beyond our own.
EERIE FLICKER [reaction]
FEAT 2
RARE
CONJURATION
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
Trigger A enemy’s Strike would hit you and you weren’t
already concealed, hidden, or undetected by that enemy.
Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane.
You become concealed for 1 round, and the flat check for
concealment applies to the Strike that would have hit you. If
the flat check fails, the Strike misses you.
Awakening When your body flickers, you momentarily
assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against
concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes frightened 1,
and it doesn’t reduce the frightened condition from this effect
at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.
Awakening You can choose to compress your flickering
movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to
avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived
effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment
against the triggering attack increases to DC 9, but the
concealment affects only the triggering Strike.
GHOSTLY GRASP [one-action]
FEAT 2
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
An invisible arm extends from you to grab and manipulate
objects. The arm reaches up to 15 feet, grabs an unattended
object of 1 Bulk or less, and immediately deposits it in one of
your free hands or at your feet. Alternatively, it reaches up
to 15 feet and performs a simple Interact action like pushing
o p e n a window, though it can’t perform actions that
require significant mechanical dexterity. For every
5 levels you have, the amount the hand can lift
increases by 1 Bulk, and the arm’s range increases
by 15 feet. Being ghostly, the arm can affect ghosts,
spirits, and other incorporeal entities, though
in most cases, you need an awakening for this
to be useful.
Awakening Your invisible arm can grab on to an unsuspecting
target. You can modify the power’s target to be 1 creature within
range. You make an attack roll against the creature’s Fortitude
DC and add the attack trait to the action. On a success, the
target is grabbed by the arm (or restrained on a critical success).
This lasts for 1 round or until the creature Escapes.
Awakening You summon additional ghostly arms that
entwine together to push targets. You can modify the power’s
target to be 1 creature within range. You make an attack roll
against the creature’s Fortitude DC and add the attack trait to
the action. On a success, you can move the target 5 feet in any
direction (10 feet on a critical success).
ENERVATING WAIL [two-actions]
FEAT 6
RARE
AUDITORY
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby.
All living creatures in a 20-foot emanation take negative
damage with a basic Fortitude save. The damage is 4d6, plus
1d6 for every level you have beyond 6th.
Awakening Your scream echoes in the mind. You can
choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes
