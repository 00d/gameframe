Adventure Background
Vir Zhees (NE female elf collector) is a longtime contact of
the Dark Archive, though a dubious one. An eccentric and
dilettante, the elf merchant has taken her last two centuries
residing in Absalom to weave together a complex web of
social influence across the city. Vir has been working with
an organization in Shadow Absalom recently that takes
payment in captives. She’s hired a group of mercenaries
to abduct servants from an upcoming opera, with the aim
of carting them off to a rendezvous point in the opera’s
basement where they can be whisked away through a
portal to Shadow Absalom. She has convinced two proxies
of members of Absalom’s Low Council, Mechna Vellerine
(LE female human representative) and Erat Orzell (NE
male tiefling human representative), to assist her by
bringing mercenaries disguised as their own servants.
To allow them to converse freely, the proxies fabricated
a dispute between the two of them that Vir is ostensibly
helping to resolve.
Word of Vir’s unsavory dealings reached the ears of
the Helping Hand, a secret organization of commoners
in Absalom who check the excesses of the aristocracy.
Two members of the Helping Hand, Bahvan (N male
human spy) and Jaynt (CN female tiefling human spy)
infiltrated Vir’s household. While snooping through Vir’s
files, Jaynt learned of Vir’s plan, but she was caught by a
loyal servant of the house. Bahvan rushed to the scene,
drawing his blade and sending the loyal servant away. In
an attempt to prove his devotion to Vir, he severed Jaynt’s
hand before helping her escape.
With Bahvan openly accompanying Vir and Jaynt
hiding among the opera guests, they plan to stop Vir’s
mercenaries from carrying out the abductions and frighten
Vir into confessing her crimes to escape the wrath of the
slighted agents of Shadow Absalom. With so many secret
plots swirling about the opera, however, it’s anyone’s guess
which group will come out on top.
Who claims victory will ultimately hinge upon the actions
of new player in Absalom that none expected—a group of
adventurers following notes from the now-defunct Dark
Archive. Following rumors about the treasures in Vir’s
collection, as well as suggestions that the collector may
have gotten in over her head, these adventurers arrive at
Vir’s manor hours before the opera is set to begin.
SHAKING THE HELPING HAND
Even the Dark Archive can’t keep tabs on every single club or society, which is why it’s so vital to cultivate connections
with those who can. Vir Zhees has long helped us keep tabs on the various societies in Absalom high society, her shrewd
interpersonal skills, social position, and long elven lifespan making her uniquely suited for the task. Yet, we should
always be wary, for those who deal in secrets know how to keep them, even from us. — K.H.W.
