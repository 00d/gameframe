RIGHTEOUS SECRETS
As mentioned, determination of a cult is ultimately a
matter of acceptance. It should therefore come as no
surprise that devotees of even the most widely accepted
good and lawful gods can be forced underground in
places where the evil and malevolence hold social sway.
Heralds of the Herald
By direct edict of Queen Abrogail II, worship of
non‑Asmodean gods isn’t forbidden in Cheliax... yet.
The unspoken truth, of course, is that such permission
lasts only so long as the followers of other deities make
no trouble for the lawful tyranny of diabolic rule. Thus,
members of the small Iomedaean cult calling themselves
Heralds of the Herald strive to keep their heads low and
their plans of holy rebellion a secret until they can gather
the strength and support to stage an uprising.
It’s likely to be a long wait, as most Chelaxian citizens
are still somewhat sword-shy after the death of Aroden,
civil war, and a succession crisis came in such close
sequence. Others openly resent the failed promise of
the Age of Glory and willingly ally with devils to spite
the divine.
Still, the Heralds hope to keep the dream of rebellion
and freedom from diabolic rule alive, alongside the
worship of their exemplar, Iomedae. In addition to
recruitment, they train paladins in secret, passing down
tactics from the order of Azlanti-born Aroden knights
PRAYERS UTTERED
IN DARKNESS
Cults, fringe religions, apocryphal beliefs,
and underground faith
“Cult” is a small word with outsized baggage. At its most pedantic, any religion
can be called a cult, but this tends to be frowned upon outside of Rahadoum or
Touvette, as the term is widely considered disparaging or dismissive, implying
illegitimacy, corruption, or malevolent falsehood. As if no “true” religion has ever had those problems. Yet,
a rational mind need not be so sensitive, as it’s ultimately a popularity contest: if your faith falls in line
with the surrounding culture, you observe a religion. Otherwise, you’re in a cult.
From an archivist’s standpoint, this is a pity; the lesser-known faiths are often among the most fascinating.
