SECRET SOCIETY MEMBER ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into a secret society
member by completing the following steps. This
adjustment is best applied to NPCs and other humanoid
creatures rather than beasts or other monsters.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics
as follows.
• 	 Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, the Perception
modifier, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.
• 	 Increase Deception and Society to be primary skills
for the creature’s new level.
•	 Increase either Diplomacy or Intimidation to be a
primary skill for the creature’s new level, and the
other to be a secondary skill.
•	 Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small
number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase HP by the amount listed on the table.

Secret Society Member Special Abilities
All secret society members gain the following abilities.
Connected The secret society member has numerous
connections, especially within the broad band of social
class from which the society recruits, but stretching further
through friendships, extortion, and other forms of influence.
Whenever encountering a character from a settlement
where the secret society has influence, the secret society
member can attempt a Society check with an easy DC for
the level of the encountered character if that character is a
member of the demographic from which the secret society
recruits, and a DC of hard or higher for other characters.
On a success, the secret society member has a connection
with that character they can use to ingratiate themself or
push that character into acting the way the secret society
member wants. This grants the secret society member
a +2 circumstance bonus to Make an Impression, Coerce,
Demoralize, or Request. On a critical success, the connection
is especially strong or powerful and might even include a
direct connection with the secret society. The circumstance
bonus increases to +4. A secret society member can use this
ability on a PC, though beyond Demoralize, the connection
is more of a roleplay note informing their interactions with
the PC.
Shibboleth Secret society members can communicate
with other members of their secret society using coded
language that seems innocuous enough to go unnoticed
SECRET SOCIETY MEMBER
A secret society member is an NPC or creature that belongs to a covert organization with influence and connections
throughout its local setting and perhaps beyond. Characters with this adjustment have been elevated from the outer
periphery of the secret society and possess some leverage in its halls of power, able to command the loyalty of other
members and use their connections to their advantage. Secret society members have received advanced training from
their organization, which makes them slightly more of a threat in combat than they would be otherwise, but much of
their power is expressed in social situations.
