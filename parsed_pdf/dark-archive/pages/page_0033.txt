Class Features
You gain these abilities as a thaumaturge. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
ESOTERIC LORE
Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales
you’ve exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught
you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become
trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be
used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and
creatures of any type, but that can’t be used to Recall
Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you
use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks.
You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at
7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at
15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.
FIRST IMPLEMENT AND ESOTERICA
Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance:
your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a
powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement
from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell,
chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon).
You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and
you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an
implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold.
If you acquire a new object of the same general implement
type, you can switch your implement to the new object
by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As
you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to
three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored
within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to
suit your situation.
While your implements are your primary tools in your
dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of
always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry
various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with
paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices:
your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps
of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly
from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your
esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and
are well practiced in brandishing your implement and
esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with
the same hand you’re using to wield an implement.
Exploit Vulnerability
You know that every creature, no matter how obscure, has a
weakness. By identifying and empowering the right object,
you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters.
You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.
EXPLOIT VULNERABILITY [one-action]
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Frequency once per round
Requirements You are holding your implement.
You scour your experiences and learning to identify something
that might repel your foe. You retrieve an object from your
esoterica with the appropriate supernatural qualities, then
use your implement to stoke the remnants of its power into a
blaze. Select a creature you can see and attempt an Esoteric
Lore check against a standard DC for its level, as you retrieve
the right object from your esoterica and use your implement
to empower it. You gain the following effects until you Exploit
Vulnerabilities again.
