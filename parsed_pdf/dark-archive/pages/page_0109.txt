Adventure Background
As the meteorite that contained the Starstone fell upon
Golarion, pieces of the meteorite rained down across
the lands. Countless pieces fell on Arcadia, and while
many pieces housed skymetals, others held even greater
treasures. Some of these fragments held a power not
unlike the Starstone, having become magically irradiated
by to the Starstone’s power. These magical fragments led
to the rise of powerful, nigh deific individuals, particularly
among central Arcadia. The hero-gods of Xopatl helped
shape the land and lead the young nation to a time of
prosperity, using their powerful abilities to defend the
region from threats of all kinds.
One of these hero-gods was Yllaldo the Manifester.
Yllaldo was among the oldest and most powerful of
Xopatl’s hero-gods and would regularly leave the nation
to face dangers that other hero-gods couldn’t. While this
typically included armies and mighty beasts in other
regions of Arcadia, Yllaldo’s greatest victory took place
somewhere beyond even Golarion itself.
Yllaldo’s abilities allowed him to sense dangers from
other planes that threatened Xopatl. The most notable of
these dangers was the demon lord Nolimarthos, Keeper
of the Unmaking Song. Yllaldo traveled to the Abyss
and faced Nolimarthos, slaying the demon lord after a
legendary battle. As Nolimarthos perished, he bellowed
a note of his destructive melody, a note that continued
to ring from his now dead body. Yllaldo sensed that the
demon’s lord power lived on and the note would continue
to reverberate throughout the Great Beyond, causing
great destruction if left unchecked. Rather than allow the
malevolent tone to continue unabated, Yllaldo took it
upon himself to silence this evil sound forever.
Yllaldo took the demon lord’s jawbone, which
contained the malign resonance, and brought it with
him to Xopatl. Once there, he worked with his fellow
hero-gods to destroy the jawbone. Unfortunately, even
together, the hero-gods were unable to destroy the bone.
They found that the power of the note made it impossible
to destroy the jawbone in its current state. The hero-gods
would have to wait for the note to ring for some time and
lose some of its power before the jawbone was susceptible
to destruction. The best the hero-gods could do was seal
away the jawbone and wait until a later time to destroy it.
A SONG OF MAKING AND UNMAKING
Xopatl has always struck me with a sense of wonder, its ancient, long-lost magic casually defying what we thought
possible. The area around Yllaldo Castle has, for several years now, seen an unusually large number of people, or even
nonsapient creatures, gaining spontaneous deviant powers—at first one every few years, then yearly, and then more
frequent. Accelerating. There must be a cause. Powerful things dwell there, and nothing so powerful is ever lost. —K.H.W.
