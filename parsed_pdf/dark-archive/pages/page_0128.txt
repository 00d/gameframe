FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
When you take on a role, you become more capable with
all sorts of tasks involving that role. When you Assume a
Role, choose two skills associated with the role in some
way; if you’re untrained, you can use your level as your
proficiency bonus for those skills, and you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to skill checks with those skills as long
as you remain in that role. You and the GM determine which
skills you assume.
IN PLAIN SIGHT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
People often only see what they want to see, a weakness
you know how to take full advantage of. While you’ve
Assumed a Role, you can use Deception in place of Stealth
when using the Avoid Notice exploration activity in an area
where someone with your role wouldn’t be unusual, such
as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating
the docks.
SOUND MIRROR
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well,
allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor
noises as distractions—perfect for misdirection and
infiltration. You can cast silence on yourself as a 2nd-level
innate occult spell and ventriloquism as a 1st-level innate
occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast ghost
sound as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained
in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key
spellcasting ability is Charisma.
MUSCLE MIMICRY [reaction]
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication; trained in Athletics,
master in Deception
Trigger An enemy makes a successful Disarm, Escape,
Grapple, Shove, or Trip attempt.
Your study of another allows you to mirror their movements
subtly, even in the heat of combat. You study the successful
maneuver of an enemy and instinctively learn to do it. The
next time you take the same action they did, you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to your Athletics check, or a +2
circumstance bonus if the enemy critically succeeded on
their triggering action. You lose this benefit if you don’t use
it before the end of your next turn.
SWAP REFLECTIONS [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
INCAPACITATION
OCCULT
TELEPORTATION
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You’ve learned how to use even your reflection to your
advantage. You send your own reflection to forcibly swap
places with the reflection of an enemy, pulling each of you
through opposite ends and switching places. The enemy
must be within 120 feet, you must both be adjacent to
reflective surfaces (such as glass, mirrors, or calm water),
and you must be able to see the target’s reflection and have
line of effect to it. The target attempts a Will save against
your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher.
Critical Success The spell has no effect.
Success You swap positions with your target or arrive
adjacent to your target, whichever your target prefers.
Failure You swap positions with your target or arrive
adjacent to your target, whichever you prefer.
Critical Failure You instantaneously swap positions with
your target, and the target becomes trapped in its own
reflection for 1 minute. Once on each of its turns, the
target can spend 1 action to attempt another Will save to
escape. If the save succeeds, the effect ends early.
BORROW MEMORIES
FEAT 14
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
Knowing how someone thinks makes it much easier to know
where they’ll be, or even replace them altogether. You can
cast mind probe as an innate occult spell once per day, using
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
If you cast mind probe on a target you’re studying for the
purpose of Assuming their Role, and the target fails their
save, you can delay the spell from coming into effect until
you Assume their Role. When you use the spell this way,
you can Sustain it up to 10 times during its duration, asking
a question each time. The spell lasts until you ask all 10
questions or are no longer Assuming the Role, whichever
comes first. You don’t need to Sustain the Spell to extend its
duration—only when asking a question—nor do you need to
be in range or have line of effect to Sustain it.
ALTER EGOS IN GOLARION
While some alter egos work independently as
freelancers, they’re especially popular in all sorts
of espionage and intelligence agencies throughout
the Inner Sea and beyond. The Lion Blades of
Taldor, Twilight Talons of Andoran, Silver Ravens
of Ravounel, and various Chelaxian secret police
use alter egos to keep abreast of situations
throughout the Shining Kingdoms and Old Cheliax.
Meanwhile, powerful mercantile groups, like the
Golden League in Tian Xia or the Aspis Consortium,
employ alter egos for corporate espionage,
making sure they always stay one step ahead of
the competition. In Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse,
the rebels known as the Bright Lions often seek
the aid of alter egos to escape the notice of the
mummified child god Walkena.
