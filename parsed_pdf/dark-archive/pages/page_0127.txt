Alter Ego (Archetype)
A highly guarded castle in the middle of an extravagant
ball, the headquarters of a city’s infamous thieves’ guild,
the locked room in the back of a cultist hideout—all
perfect targets for you to use your expertise at blending
in. Rather than skulking through the shadows, you
use your training and latent supernatural abilities to
become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others
and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out
of your destination before anyone has a chance to think
something is amiss.
Performing an alter ego means going unregarded.
Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades
come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your
clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd.
This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in
a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly
past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent
up, until you can’t resist a dramatic reveal or a signature
calling card that shows you were there. One final word
before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message
left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually
too late for your victims to do anything about it.
ALTER EGO DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Deception and Stealth
You make yourself into a living mirror, becoming a double
of someone unremarkable, and you slip into exactly the role
that can get you past security or into a sensitive facility.
You become an expert in Deception. You gain the Assume
a Role activity.
Assume a Role (concentrate) Requirements You’ve spent at
least 1 hour studying a creature whose role you intend to
copy and have done so within the last 3 days. This could
include meeting and learning from someone in that role,
tailing and spying on someone, using magic to observe
them at work, or some other method, as long as you have
a visual source of information; Effect You quickly and
accurately learn how to do mundane jobs or at least copy
the movements enough to appear as if you do. A chosen
role can take many forms—from cook, cleaner, or librarian
to cult member, priest, or duke—but it’s always a role and
never a specific individual.
You perform the Impersonate activity to pass as
a member of the role you observed and gain a +1
circumstance bonus to any Deception checks you attempt
in your impersonation. This takes the normal amount of
time it takes you to Impersonate. You also choose one
Lore skill relevant to that role (such as Farming Lore for
a farmer). While in your role, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to checks for that Lore skill, and if you’re untrained
in it, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus.
You stop assuming the role after 24 hours, if you start
studying for a new role, or if you choose to.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the alter ego archetype.
CHANGE OF FACE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires
not only the right skills but also the right look—luckily you
can copy both using special magical techniques. When you
Impersonate, you don’t need a disguise kit; instead, simple
illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your
body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit
ordinarily would. When you Impersonate in this way, your
Impersonate activity gains the occult trait.
