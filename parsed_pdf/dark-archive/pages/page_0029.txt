PSYCHIC
Frequency once per day
Trigger A spell you cast has no effect because you critically failed all your spell
attack rolls or because all targets critically succeeded at their saving throws.
You see your spell fail to take hold to disastrous end, then snap back to reality—it was
all a precognition, and you know to try a different spell. Your spell is expended, but
you can Cast a Spell that requires the same number of actions as the triggering spell
or fewer to cast. The second spell must be a different spell than the first.
NO!!! [reaction]
FEAT 12
PSYCHIC
Trigger A non-minion ally within 60 feet is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
The shock of seeing your ally near death breaks whatever limits exist in your mind,
sending your power spilling forth. If your psyche is currently unleashed, you can
immediately use a psyche action that takes 1 action or less to use. If your psyche is
not currently unleashed, you Unleash your Psyche, which remains unleashed until
the end of your next turn. You can ignore Unleash Psyche’s requirement of needing
to have Cast a Spell on your previous turn, but you still can’t Unleash your Psyche if
you’re stupefied or for 2 rounds after your psyche subsides.

PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
You stop holding your power back, unleashing it all in a catastrophic blast. All
creatures in a 20-foot emanation take 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per level with a basic Reflex save. Your
psyche subsides as your power is expended.
14TH LEVEL
CONSCIOUS SPELL SPECIALIZATION
FEAT 14
PSYCHIC
You become more adept with the spells that are always in your mind.
You gain an additional spell slot of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels. You can
use these spell slots to cast only a spell granted by your conscious mind.
At 18th level, you also gain an additional 5th-level spell slot, with the
same restrictions.
DEEP ROOTS
FEAT 14
PSYCHIC
Your mind-control spells send burrowing mental roots that tear at your
target’s mind when they’re removed or run their course. When you Cast
a Spell that imposes the controlled condition or otherwise forces the
target to take certain actions (such as command), you can choose one
target that critically failed its save. When that target finishes fulfilling
any commands issued by your spell, or when the spell is dispelled or
counteracted, the target takes 1d6 mental damage per level of the spell.
SHATTER SPACE
FEAT 14
AMP
PSYCHIC
The sheer power of your magic fractures reality. Use this
amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry. The
cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more actions to cast.
