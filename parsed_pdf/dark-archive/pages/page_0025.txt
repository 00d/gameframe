Psychic Feats
At every level that you gain a psychic feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL MIND
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
By unraveling memories and connections passed down from
your progenitors and buried within your unconscious mind,
you learn to convert your inherent magic into psychic power.
You can cast any innate spells you know from an ancestry feat
or heritage using your psychic spellcasting components. When
you do so, the spell’s tradition becomes occult, if it wasn’t
already, and you can use your psychic spellcasting ability
modifier instead of Charisma to determine your spell attack
roll and spell DC.
COUNTER THOUGHT [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell with the mental trait.
Requirements You have an unexpended spell slot you could
use to Cast a Spell with the mental trait.
When a foe Casts a Spell that has the mental trait and you can
see its manifestations, you can use your own mental magic to
disrupt it. You expend one of your spell slots to counter the
triggering creature’s casting of a spell with the mental trait.
You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell;
this spell slot must be one for which you could Cast a Spell
with the mental trait. You then attempt to counteract the
triggering spell.
MENTAL BUFFER
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
Your mind deflects some amount of harm from attacks that
induce pain or manipulate your mind directly. You gain
resistance to mental damage equal to half your level (minimum
1). This resistance increases to equal to your level while your
Psyche is Unleashed.
PSYCHIC RAPPORT
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
Your telepathic sensitivity intensifies when you’re affected
by mental magic, making it easier for you to link to other
creatures. After you Cast a Spell with the mental trait, until
the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks, and to
Perception checks to Sense Motive.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
PSYCHIC
You expand what your mind can accomplish. Add two
additional occult cantrips to your repertoire.
MENTAL BALM
FEAT 2
AMP
EMOTION
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Your spells release soothing mental waves. Use this amp in
place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry. You can use this amp
only on a psi cantrip that targets or affects you or one or more
of your allies and doesn’t target or affect any enemies.
Amp You or one ally within 30 feet gains a +2 status bonus to
Will saves against emotion effects for 1 minute. You can also
have the amped psi cantrip attempt to counteract one effect
imposing the frightened condition on yourself or the chosen
ally, or an effect imposing the stupefied condition that has
a duration of 1 hour or less. If you successfully counteract
the effect, you remove only the frightened and stupefied
conditions, not any other part of the effect.
PSI BURST [one-action]
FEAT 2
CONCENTRATE
EVOCATION
MINDSHIFT
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per round
With a passing thought, you direct violent psychic energies at
a nearby creature. Target one creature within 30 feet. It takes
1d4 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. At 3rd level
and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
WARP SPACE
FEAT 2
AMP
PSYCHIC
You use your magic to bend space, causing your spell to strike
from a strange vector. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s
normal amp entry. The amped psi cantrip must have a range.
Amp Choose a square within 30 feet to which you have line of
effect and line of sight. Determine your spell’s line of effect
and line of sight from there, as well as whether creatures
have cover against the spell. The spell can exceed its normal
range as measured from you, as long as it’s within its normal
range from the square you chose.
4TH LEVEL
ASTRAL TETHER [one-action]
FEAT 4
ABJURATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
You spin out a thread of psychic energy that connects you to
an ally, using it as a conduit for your abilities. Choose a willing
creature within 60 feet and connect to it. Whenever you would
gain a benefit from a psychic amp, you can have the amp affect
the tethered creature instead. You can do so only if the amp
grants a distinct benefit, not if it alters the amped spell.
The tether can’t be severed physically but breaks if the
distance between you and the tethered ally ever exceeds 60 feet,
if you become unconscious, or if you use Astral Tether again.
HOMING BEACON
FEAT 4
AMP
PSYCHIC
As your spell strikes a target, you plant a beacon in the target’s
mind that announces its presence to those nearby. Use this
amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry. The amped
cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must
either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.
