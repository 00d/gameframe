Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your weapon is drawn to your enemy’s vital spots, almost
of its own accord. You gain a +2 status bonus to attack
rolls against the target of your Exploit Vulnerability.
Paragon Benefit
17th
The way your implement connects to your foe makes its
interruptions incredibly disruptive. You now disrupt the
triggering action on a hit with Implement’s Interruption,
rather than needing a critical hit.
Thaumaturge Feats
At every level that you gain a thaumaturge feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
AMMUNITION THAUMATURGY
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
You’re so used to handling your implement, weapon, and
esoterica in the heat of combat that adding a few bullets or
arrows to the mix is no extra burden. You can Interact to reload
a weapon using the hand holding your implement.
DIVERSE LORE
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Your wandering studies mean you’ve heard rumors or theories
about almost every topic... though admittedly, your sources aren’t
always the most reliable. You can take a –2 penalty to your check
to Recall Knowledge with Esoteric Lore to Recall Knowledge
about any topic, not just the usual topics available for Esoteric
Lore. Additionally, when you succeed at your check to Exploit
a Vulnerability, compare the result of your Esoteric Lore check
to the DC to Recall Knowledge for that creature; if that number
would be a success or a critical success, you gain information as if
you had succeeded at the Recall Knowledge check.
DIVINE DISHARMONY [one-action]
FEAT 1
DIVINE
ENCHANTMENT
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
From your collection of religious trinkets, you pull out opposing
divine objects—such as the religious symbols of two deities
that are hated enemies—and combine them in a display that
causes discordant clashes of divine energy that are especially
distracting to the faithful. Roll your choice of a Deception or
Intimidation check against the Will DC of a creature you can
see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature
is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a cleric, celestial,
monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might
determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an
alghollthu, is unaffected.
Critical Success The creature is flat-footed to your attacks until
the end of your next turn.
Success The creature is flat-footed against your attacks until
the end of your current turn.
FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Whether by following occult rituals, piecing together scraps
of arcane theory, or some other method, you’ve called forth a
creature that now serves as your constant companion in your
studies of the supernatural. You gain a familiar.
HAUNT INGENUITY
FEAT 1
DIVINATION
DIVINE
THAUMATURGE
Your cunning knowledge grants you the ability to notice the
emotional echo of a soul that passed on, leaving a haunt in
its wake. Even when you aren’t Searching while in exploration
mode, the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts that
usually require you to be Searching.
You can disable haunts that require master proficiency in a
skill as long as you’re at least trained in the skill. If you have
master proficiency in the skill, you can disable haunts that
require a proficiency rank of legendary instead.
ROOT TO LIFE [one-action] OR [two-actions]
FEAT 1
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
NECROMANCY
PRIMAL
THAUMATURGE
Marigold, spider lily, pennyroyal—many primal traditions connect
flowers and plants with the boundary between life and death, and
you can leverage this association to keep an ally on this side of
the line. You place a small plant or similar symbol on an adjacent
dying creature, immediately stabilizing them; the creature is no
longer dying and is instead unconscious at 0 Hit Points.
If you spend 2 actions instead of 1, you empower the act
further by uttering a quick folk blessing to chase away ongoing
pain, adding the auditory trait to the action. When you do
so, attempt flat checks to remove each source of persistent
damage affecting the target; due to the particularly effective
assistance, the DC is 10 instead of the usual 15.
SCROLL THAUMATURGY
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Your multidisciplinary study of magic means you know how to
activate the magic in scrolls with ease. You can activate scrolls
of any magical tradition, using your thaumaturge class DC for
the scroll’s DC, rather than a particular spell DC. If a spell is on
the spell list for multiple traditions, you choose which tradition
to use at the time you activate the scroll. You can draw and
activate scrolls with the same hand holding an implement,
much like you can for esoterica.
2ND LEVEL
CALL IMPLEMENT [one-action]
FEAT 2
ARCANE
CONJURATION
MANIPULATE
TELEPORTATION
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You have a free hand.
You can tug on the bonds of ownership between yourself and
your implement, causing it to find its way back to you. You
look down and find that your implement has mysteriously
appeared in your free hand, as long as the implement was
within 1 mile and on the same plane of existence. If your
implement is attended by another creature, that creature can
