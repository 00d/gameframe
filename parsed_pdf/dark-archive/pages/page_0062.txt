Rumored Cryptid
As stories spread about a rumored cryptid, the weight
of collective belief transforms the creature to match the
tales. The limits of its physical body no longer confine it.
RUMORED CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into a rumored cryptid
by completing the following steps. Increase the creature’s
level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Add the rare trait. If the creature was an animal, it
loses the animal trait and gains the beast trait.
•	 If the creature’s Intelligence modifier is –4 or lower,
increase it to –3.
•	 Add Stealth with a modifier equal to its highest skill
modifier.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of the creature’s Strikes and
other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used
only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s
Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the amount listed on
the table.

Rumored Cryptid Abilities
All rumored cryptids gain the following abilities,
unless they conflict with the theme of the creature.
Burning Eyes The cryptid’s eyes are distinctive; perhaps
they burn bright red in the dark night. The rumored
cryptid gains darkvision. If the base creature already
has darkvision, it gains greater darkvision.
Creature Obscura The cryptid appears in so many
urban legends, it can be identified using Society
or a Lore skill connected to a nearby settlement,
in addition to the normal skills. However, much of
the information known about it is dubious. The DC
to identify a rumored cryptid is incredibly hard
(rather than very hard for most rare creatures),
but all failures to identify a rumored cryptid gain
the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
Shifting Form The cryptid is sustained by localized
tales or reports from witnesses. As a result, its
appearance morphs between different appearances.
If all records of the rumored cryptid are destroyed or
all witnesses die, the rumored cryptid ceases to exist.
Obscura Vulnerability The cryptid is weakened by those
who seek its truth. Whenever a creature succeeds at a
Recall Knowledge check to identify the rumored cryptid,
the rumored cryptid becomes drained 1 (or drained 2 if the
Recall Knowledge check was a critical success).
Stalk [one-action] Requirements The rumored cryptid is undetected;
Effect The rumored cryptid swiftly stalks prey from hiding.
It Strides, then Strikes.
Vanishing Escape [one-action] The rumored cryptid breaks away and
fades into the background. It Strides, then Hides.
Optional Abilities
The rumored cryptid might have one or both of the
following optional abilities.
Hybrid Form The cryptid’s form morphs to be like a specific
animal as the tales get longer. The rumored cryptid gains
either a burrow, climb, or swim Speed equal to its land Speed.
Howl [two-actions] (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The rumored
cryptid calls out with a wretched sound no living creature
should make. Each creature in a 30-foot emanation must
attempt a Will save. A creature that fails is frightened 1 (or
frightened 2 on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds
is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The DC is the high DC
for a creature of the rumored cryptid’s level.
