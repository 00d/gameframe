You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However,
unlike other spellcasters, you don’t gain focus spells that
cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points
to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps—
specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your
psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp
heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it
by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can
also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to
substitute a psi cantrip’s normal amp effect for another
one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use
any, each time you cast a psi cantrip. Unless otherwise
noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip.
You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations,
and you can regain Focus Points by spending 10 minutes
using the Refocus activity to explore your mind, whether
via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you
the mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your
thoughts and feelings with yourself or another. If you’ve
spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic
abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2
Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of
2. If you’ve spent Focus Points on focus spells or abilities
other than those from the psychic class (for instance, to cast
a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain
only 1 Focus Point.
UNLEASH PSYCHE
When one thins the barrier between their inner mind and
the outer world, one can unleash true psychic power.
However, the mind wasn’t meant to tap its full strength for
long, leading to backlash once your unleashed psyche ends.
UNLEASH PSYCHE [free-action]
PSYCHIC
Trigger Your turn begins.
Requirements You’re in an encounter, you Cast
a Spell on your previous turn, and you aren’t
stupefied.
You call on the depths of your mind and let
psychic power flood through. Your Psyche
remains Unleashed for 2 rounds or until your
fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You
can’t voluntarily quell your unleashed psyche.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, the following
effects occur.
• You’re constantly surrounded by the visual
manifestation of your psychic magic.
•	 When you cast a damaging spell, you gain a status
bonus to its damage equal to double the spell’s level.
This applies only to spells that don’t have a duration
and that you cast using psychic spellcasting.
•	 You can use actions that have the psyche trait.
After your unleashed psyche subsides, your mind must
recover from the strain of channeling its full power. You
can’t use Unleash Psyche again for 2 rounds, and
you’re stupefied 1 for 2 rounds.
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
A psychic’s power is born in the depths of their
psyche, far from the surface. Your subconscious
mind might represent the way your power comes to you
naturally, or it may be a framework you use to safely
access the infinite potential of your mind. Either way,
your subconscious mind fundamentally shapes how you
access and wield psychic magic. Choose a subconscious
mind from the options starting on page 15, or options
from other sources to which you have access. This choice
will determine your key ability, special spellcasting
components you use, and an action you can take while
you have Unleashed your Psyche. The following options
are presented in this book.
