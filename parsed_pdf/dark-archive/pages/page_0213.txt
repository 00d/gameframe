This tree is a memory of one that K.H.W. loved when he
was growing up in Goka. Any PCs who speak Tien can
decipher the virtues listed as: loyalty, patience, honesty,
frugality, and humility. If a creature speaks these virtues
in Tien to the tree, all creatures adjacent to it recover Hit
Points as if they had a full night’s rest as magic accelerates
their natural healing. The tree’s power is then spent for
1 day.
C2. THE CLOCK
MODERATE 12
Light shines from a large, heavy grandfather clock that ticks
steadily as it hovers in midair. The clock’s hands seem to spin
faster and faster as you stare at it, yet they never seem to
reach midnight. The longer the hands spin, the stronger a
strange worry within you grows: time ceaselessly marches on.
This clock represents K.H.W.’s fear of lacking the time
needed to uncover truth. Within the clock is a source of light:
a lantern. However, the clock also has a deadly surprise.
Hazard: Bladed cogs and clock hands attempt to slice any
creature that opens the clock to shreds.

HAZARD 12
Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide 81
Treasure: The lantern, the anchor for this section, can
be extracted from the clock once the hazards are disabled.
When a PC takes possession of the lantern, it fuses into
their body, granting them the ability to Reshape the
Mindscape on section C of the map.
D. THE FATHOMLESS DEPTHS
MODERATE 12
A rectangular space has seemingly been cut out of the floor
here, creating a pool of water so deep the bottom is beyond
sight. A tightrope connects the shore to a platform in the
center, where a chalice pours forth water endlessly.
Creature: To help it lure creatures into its depths, the
pool conjures a rusalka—a creature K.H.W. has been
scared of since he first moved to Avistan as a child.

Hazard: As a manifestation of the Archivist’s fear of the
unknown (as well as his more literal fear of the ocean), the
pool seeks to tempt creatures into the pond and trap them.
