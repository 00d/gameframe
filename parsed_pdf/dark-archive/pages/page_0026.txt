Amp Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a
spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if
the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the
creature’s location, making it easier to notice the creature
as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to
it. For 1 minute, if the target would be invisible, it’s instead
merely concealed, and if it would be concealed, it’s no
longer concealed.
PSI STRIKES [free-action]
FEAT 4
MINDSHIFT
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to Cast a Spell or to
Unleash your Psyche.
You siphon residual psychic energies from your spell into one
weapon you’re wielding or one of your unarmed attacks and
when you unleash your mind, the energies flare to match. The
attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage until the end of the
current turn. If your Psyche is Unleashed, this benefit instead
lasts until your psyche subsides.
THOUGHTFORM SUMMONING
FEAT 4
PSYCHIC
You can create a prototypical creature from the depths of your
imagination instead of calling one from elsewhere. Whenever
you summon a creature, you can choose to instead create a
psychic construct of that creature. This grants it resistance to
physical damage equal to half its level, weakness 5 to force
and mental damage, and the ability to pass through enemies’
spaces without needing to Tumble Through (though it can’t
end its turn in an occupied space).
VIOLENT UNLEASH [free-action]
FEAT 4
EVOCATION
MINDSHIFT
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger You Unleash your Psyche.
The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies
with a violent shockwave. You deal 2d6 force damage to all
creatures in a 20-foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This
explosion is taxing, making you stunned 1.
At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage
increases by 1d6.
6TH LEVEL
INERTIAL BARRIER
FEAT 6
ABJURATION
AMP
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell leaves behind barriers that reduce shock and motion.
Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry.
Amp You or one target of the spell gains resistance to physical
damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level until the start of your
next turn.
PARALLEL BREAKTHROUGH
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
You expand your mind beyond your area of psychic specialty.
You gain a 1st-level psi cantrip for a conscious mind other
than your own; this can be either the unique surface cantrip
or one of the common cantrips and the accompanying amp.
If you choose a common cantrip, you also gain the special
benefit granted by that conscious mind when casting the
cantrip without an amp. You don’t gain any other benefits of
that conscious mind, such as additional spells known.
