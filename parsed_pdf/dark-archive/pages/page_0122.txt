reflects the item’s image. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks to Conceal the Object unless someone checks
the mirror’s reflection.
REPLICATE
FEAT 5
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Clone-Risen
You’ve learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast
illusory disguise once per day as an innate occult spell. This
is a transmutation and morph effect, as your body physically
transforms, rather than an illusion effect.
WARP LIKENESS [one-action]
FEAT 5
MORPH
OCCULT
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Morph-Risen
Frequency once per minute
Requirements You hit a creature with a melee Strike on your
last action.
You channel some of your own nature through your blow,
temporarily warping your target’s form to resemble your own.
The creature you hit must attempt a Fortitude save against the
higher of your class DC or spell DC.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target resists the effect but its form twists in the
process. It’s clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn.
Failure The target’s body briefly warps to resemble yours. It’s
clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn and sickened 1.
Critical Failure The target’s body warps to resemble yours for
a significant time. It’s clumsy 1 for 1 minute and sickened 2.
9TH LEVEL
MIRROR REFUGE [two-actions]
FEAT 9
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
OCCULT
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Mirror-Risen
Frequency once per day
Requirements You’re within 5 feet of a mirrored surface.
Your origin in the space behind mirrors enables you to use a
mirror as a hideaway, like the spell meld into stone. You meld
into an adjacent mirror. You can hear but not see outside this
space, and creatures outside can’t see or hear you. You can
cast spells while within the mirror, but no effects can cross
the mirror. Your Mirror Refuge lasts for 10 minutes unless the
mirror is broken, which expels you and deals 10d6 damage to
you. You can Dismiss the effect. You appear in a space adjacent
to the mirror when the effect ends.
TWO TRUTHS [one-action]
FEAT 9
REFLECTION
Prerequisites master in Deception
Your ability to imitate your progenitor is so strong, you can even
convince yourself. When you use this action, you alter your
thought processes to your progenitor or from your progenitor
back to yourself. As long as what you say is true from the point
of view of your current identity, you can say it even under
effects like zone of truth that force you to speak truly.
UNYIELDING DISGUISE
FEAT 9
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites ability to cast humanoid form or illusory disguise
When you cast humanoid form or illusory disguise to alter your
appearance, the spell’s duration is 2 hours. At the end of the
duration, you can extend the spell’s duration for another hour,
but doing so is taxing, making you drained 1. You can keep
extending it in this way, increasing your drained condition by
1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
13TH LEVEL
MALLEABLE FORM [one-action]
FEAT 13
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites ability to cast at least one polymorph spell
Requirements You’re polymorphed by a spell that has multiple
choices of battle form.
You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance.
Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting
you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This
destabilizes the spell’s magic, reducing its duration by 1 round.
Use the level of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
REDIRECT ATTENTION
FEAT 13
REFLECTION
Through your strong connection with your progenitor, you’re
able to redirect those attempting to spy on you. Whenever
you would be directly targeted with a scrying effect, the effect
must attempt a counteract check against the higher of your
spell DC or class DC. If the check fails, the effect targets your
progenitor instead of you.
17TH LEVEL
REFLECT FOE
FEAT 17
REFLECTION
You create a copy of a foe by calling them forth from a nearby
reflection, clonally growing them in an instant from one of
your hairs or otherwise creating them in a way that matches
your own nature as a reflection. You can cast duplicate foe
once per day as an innate occult spell. At 20th level, your
innate duplicate foe is heightened to 8th level.
FINAL USURPATION
If your progenitor is deceased, you might be able to
take over their life. It might require a special ritual
and other activities taking 1 week, as you take over
your progenitor’s lodgings, activities, relationships,
and so on. Once you finish, provided no creature
has successfully identified you as an impostor, the
memories of everyone who knew or interacted with
your progenitor are altered, so they forget your
progenitor’s usual personality and behavior in favor
of yours, and you no longer risk discovery for acting
out of character for them. You belong now.
