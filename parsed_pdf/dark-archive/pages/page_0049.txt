PSYCHIC (ARCHETYPE)
You’ve awoken the latent abilities of your mind, taking your first steps into wielding psychic magic.
MULTICLASS PSYCHIC CHARACTERS
Psychic is a good fit for characters who want a touch of occult
power. Intelligence-based characters like investigators and
alchemists, as well as Charisma-based characters like bards,
can choose the path that best suits their inherent abilities.

FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
MULTICLASS
Prerequisites Intelligence 14 or Charisma 14
You feel something awaken within your mind. You become
trained in Occultism; if you were already trained in Occultism,
you become trained in a skill of your choice. You cast spells
like a psychic and gain the Cast a Spell activity; as you don’t
have a subconscious mind, your thought components are
simple intentions. Choose a conscious mind. You gain a spell
repertoire with one standard psi cantrip of your choice from
your conscious mind, which you cast as a psi cantrip. You gain
the normal benefits and the amp for this psi cantrip, but not
any other benefits from the conscious mind. If you don’t have
one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can use
to amp your psi cantrips, and you can Refocus by meditating on
your new powers. If you already have a focus pool, increase the
number of points in your pool by 1. You’re trained in occult spell
attack rolls and occult spell DCs. Your key spellcasting ability for
psychic archetype spells is the ability you used to qualify for the
archetype, and they are occult psychic spells.

gained two other feats from the psychic archetype.
