Success You can ask and receive your seven answers
normally. The crowd is excited by the entity’s words and
believes them to be true. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to Diplomacy checks made to influence the crowd and
to any Deception checks to Lie to the crowd by directly
incorporating the entity’s answers.
Failure The vines reach out in a weighted gasp before dying.
The crowd is likely disappointed, especially if you made
them wait, but they don’t necessarily change their attitude
toward you.
Critical Failure The vines wrap around you in desperation,
trying to squeeze out your life force to survive. You take
10d6 bludgeoning damage and become drained 3, and you
can’t reduce the drained condition for 1 week. The attitude
of the most members of the crowd toward you become
one step worse, though individual members of the crowd
might have different reactions.
VITAL SINGULARITY
RITUAL 9
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Cost crushed rubies worth 2,000 gp; Secondary
Casters 3
Primary Check Occultism or Religion (legendary); Secondary
Checks Fortitude, Society, Will
Duration 3 hours
When several companions or followers have reached a point
of undying love and trust in you, they might be willing
to die to save your life. You can grant them that wish.
The secondary casters must be living creatures willing to
sacrifice their energy to you, by allowing their life essence
to drain out of them to protect you whenever you’re in
danger. If you’re undead, the secondary casters must be
undead instead, and if you’re neither living nor undead,
you can’t cast vital singularity. Whenever you take damage,
after calculating the total amount of damage, including
immunities, resistances, weaknesses, and any other
increases or mitigation, divide the amount by 4, rounding
down. You and each of the secondary casters lose that many
Hit Points. If a secondary caster doesn’t have enough Hit
Points to give before dropping to 0 Hit Points, you take
any remaining damage for them as well. When a secondary
caster reaches 0 Hit Points in this way, their skin dries out
like leather as the last of their life leaves their bodies; this
is a death effect.
Critical Success The light from your secondary casters
envelops you in a warm radiance. In addition to the effects
described above, you’re healed to full Hit Points upon
completion of the ritual.
Success The secondary casters channel their energies to
you, protecting you as described above.
Failure The secondary casters cry out in sorrow, reaching out
to you to feel your embrace, then they grow sad that they
couldn’t live up to your expectations. Nothing else happens.
Critical Failure The secondary casters’ attempts to unite
with you become desperate, but ultimately, the only
function of the link was to disorient all of you, making
your bodies feel like they aren’t your own. You and all
secondary casters become clumsy 3 for 3 days.
