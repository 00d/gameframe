30-foot cone. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your
breath weapon is a 60-foot line. If they had a burst-shaped
breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 10-foot burst within
60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals 1d6 damage per level,
of the same damage type as the dragon’s Breath Weapon,
with a basic Reflex save, using the higher of your class DC
or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath
weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.
PACT OF INFERNAL PROWESS
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
DIVINE
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life
in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when
you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free
action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose
to automatically succeed at checks to Earn Income for tasks
below your level, without rolling.
However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You
can’t be returned to life except by powerful magic such as
miracle, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract
can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the
effects of a discern location spell. They can also use 10th-level
scrying on you at will, and you automatically critically fail
your saving throw.
Special You can’t retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess
without journeying to Hell and destroying the
devil’s written contract spelling out the
terms of your pact.
PACT OF THE FINAL BREATH FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINE
NECROMANCY
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with a powerful
psychopomp—typically an olethros advocate
or yamaraj judge—granting you a reprieve
before your soul will be collected in exchange
for respect for the dead and assistance against the undead.
As long as you keep your end of the bargain, you live twice
as long as you normally would before dying of natural
causes. Additionally, the first time each day that you would
be reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition, you
instead regain a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level
(starting from 0 HP), remain conscious, and gain fast healing
equal to your level for 3 rounds.
In exchange, you swear to treat the dead you come across
with respect, performing last rites and final dispositions
to ensure their spirits rest in peace and are less likely to
rise as undead. Furthermore, you swear to destroy undead
you come across, so long as it’s within your power to do so
without inordinate risk to yourself. Violating your part of
the pact causes its protections to immediately end. If at that
point you had already lived beyond your natural lifespan, the
psychopomps typically give you a few moments to make any
last farewells, and then you simply breathe your final breath
and pass on.
PACT OF ELDRITCH EYES
FEAT 14
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
OCCULT
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with an entity beyond mortal comprehension,
granting you distant visions and insights. You can cast prying
eye as an occult innate spell once per hour, using the higher of
your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.
In exchange, you allow the entity to peer through you
at your world. The entity’s touch creates strange dreams,
typically nightmares. Every morning, you awaken trained in an
unexpected Lore skill determined by the GM, which you retain
until the next time you rest for the night. While the entity
contacts you most often while you sleep, it occasionally peers
at you during the day, leading to disorientation and visions. You
can generally determine what’s going on during these visions,
so normally this occurrence imparts no mechanical penalty.
However, in the unlikely event that an encounter begins while
you’re experiencing visions from the entity, you might take a
circumstance penalty to your initiative roll.
Special The entity isn’t particularly attached to its pact with
you. If you want it gone, you can retrain out of Pact of Eldritch
Eyes, after which the entity withdraws its eyes to the void.
