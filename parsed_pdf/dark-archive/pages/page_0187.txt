Chronoskimmer
(Archetype)
The flow of time is an unstoppable force. Most are
carried downstream inexorably, like a leaf floating on a
river. You, however, somehow fell out of the flow of time,
if only for an instant, but in doing so gained a perspective
that few others have.
Now you stand on the banks of the river, watching
the flow, choosing where to dive in, or even defying the
current, at least for a short while, as you skim its surface
and skip from moment to moment. As a chronoskimmer,
time is yours to exploit.
You have the means to see the timelines of all creatures,
including your own. You can use this insight to manipulate
the flow of time for creatures, much like you can pluck the
leaf from the river and place it elsewhere. Manipulating
timelines can be dangerous, however, and the Dimension
of Time isn’t wont to allow these transgressions against
time to stand forever. The threat always looms of time
dimensionals coming to correct your actions or of you
becoming removed from time forever.
CHRONOSKIMMER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
RARE
ARCHETYPE
You became partially unstuck from time and have learned
how to manipulate your place in flow of time. When you
roll initiative, you can choose one of three options: either do
nothing and roll initiative normally, stabilize your timestream,
or destabilize your timestream and send it into intense
fluctuations. If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you
don’t roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10
+ your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your
timestream, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a success, your
initiative is equal to 19 + your initiative modifier, and on a
failure, your initiative is equal to 1 + your initiative modifier.
Both stabilizing and destabilizing your timestream are
fortune effects.
Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with an
opponent’s initiative roll, you go first. Your manipulation of
time grants you access to a number of abilities, some of which
require a saving throw. The DC for these abilities is either your
class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, and is called your
chronoskimmer DC.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the chronoskimmer archetype.
TURN BACK THE CLOCK [reaction]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail a skill check or saving throw.
After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal
timeline so you can try again. You reroll the triggering check
with a +1 circumstance bonus as you apply your experience
from your last attempt. You must use the new result, even if
it’s worse than your first roll.
GUIDE THE TIMELINE [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline
to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you
choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally
makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take
the higher result; this is a fortune effect. If you choose a foe,
the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack
roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result
unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer
DC; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of your choice, the
target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
REVERSING CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety.
Stride up to your Speed. If you end your movement within
melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee
Strike against that enemy. You then teleport back to the
square from which you began your Snapback Charge. You can
use Reversing Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or
Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.
SUPERIMPOSE TIME DUPLICATES [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You call alternate versions of yourself, either from a different
timeline or perhaps yourself from a different point in your
current timeline, to aid you in combat. Until the start of your
next turn, these alternate selves flicker in and out in your
vicinity, providing flanking for you against all enemies within
your reach. Flanking with your time duplicates is the same as
flanking with an ally and so is subject to effects like all-around
vision or the deny advantage class feature.
BORROW TIME [free-action]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per minute
Trigger Your turn begins.
You reach ahead and make use of time that’s yet to be. You
become quickened and can use the extra action to Step, Stride,
or Strike. You gain this extra action immediately and can use
it this turn. At the end of your turn, you become stunned 1.
STEAL TIME [two-actions]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You reach into another creature’s timeline and attempt to alter
their flow of time. Select a creature within 30 feet. That creature
