situation changes oddly (perhaps the creature is forcibly
teleported away and has no idea which direction is “toward
Valeros” any longer), the GM determines what happens.
Failure As success, but the creature must commit at least
two of its actions for the next turn—“I will Stride toward
Valeros and then Strike with my claws.” All of these
actions are similarly locked in and can’t be changed, but
the creature can take them in any order.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature must commit all
of its actions for the next turn.
Heightened (7th) Instead of affecting a single target, the
spell affects all enemies within a 30-foot emanation.
LOOSE TIME’S ARROW
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 6 creatures
Duration until the end of your next turn
You pluck the time stream like a bow—pull one string back,
release, and watch a creature fly. All affected targets are
quickened. They can use the extra action only to Step or Stride.
MORASS OF AGES
SPELL 4
AURA
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 5-foot emanation
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You surround yourself in temporal eddies that draw out time
for those around you, making every step feel like an eternity
endured. A creature in the emanation, or that later enters
the emanation, must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature
makes this save only once and uses the same effect for the
duration of the spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you
can choose to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet, to a
maximum of 60 feet.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the
creature.
Failure Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the
creature, and the creature is slowed 1 when it starts its
turn in the emanation.
Critical Failure As failure, plus the creature also becomes
restrained. The creature can attempt to Escape against
your spell DC to remove the restrained condition.
QUICKEN TIME
SPELL 5
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You speed up the time stream in an area, stretching and
pulling it until time flows swift and wild. Any creature that
begins its turn in the area is quickened and can use the extra
action each round to Stride or Strike. Unfortunately, speeding
up time is much more difficult than slowing it down, and the
effect is uneven and jittery, making accuracy between times
painfully difficult; creatures inside the area are concealed to
those outside it, and vice versa.
STAGNATE TIME
SPELL 5
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You examine the time stream in a particular area, then
proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening
and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like
a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the
area must attempt a Will save.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is slowed 1 this turn.
Critical Failure The creature is slowed 2 this turn.
SUMMON IRII
SPELL 8
RARE
CONJURATION
INCARNATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 100 feet
Duration until the end of your next turn
You cast your spell, whisper your words of power, and find
that an irii is already here—indeed, they have always been
here, and always were, and always will be. The temporal being
occupies the space of a Medium creature and has a Speed of
60 feet and a fly Speed of 60 feet. When you Cast this Spell,
choose whether it summons a fate irii or a fortune irii.
•	 Fate The fate stands before you with its stained-glass
wings and animal-headed gaze, floating eyes circling
about it; Arrive (divination, fortune, lawful, prediction)
Decree the Immutability of Time While within 30 feet of
the fate, you and your allies who roll below 10 on a d20
for an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill
check get a 10 instead; Depart (divination, misfortune,
prediction) Observe the Inevitability of Destiny Each
enemy within a 30-foot emanation must attempt a Will
save. If a creature fails its save, until the end of its next
turn, any time it rolls above 10 on a d20 for an attack
IRIIS
These denizens of the Dimension of Time are
powerful guardians who ward the timeline against
outside meddling, even as they war with each
other over their divergent philosophies of time. An
irii can be either a fate, with the view that time is
immutable, or a fortune, with the opinion that time
is fluid. Among practitioners of temporal magic,
iriis are famed for their ability to see consequences
before they occur, sidestepping them at their leisure.
