Adventure Background
After an unusually harsh winter, people across the
archipelago of Iblydos welcome the coming of spring.
As flowers finally blossom once again, preparations are
underway for numerous festivals to celebrate the changing
of the seasons. The celebrants include the spiritual group
Verdure, which also goes by the name the Womb of the
World among followers. Having recently relocated to an
isolated island, the group spends their days helping those in
need, sharing the bounties of their lush fruit and vegetable
gardens with those in nearby areas, such as the refugees
who seek safe harbor at the port of Aelyosos. The group is
inspired by the written teachings of the elusive cyclopean
hero-god Ludovica and are motivated to spread love and
light where they can. Ludovica herself has no interest in
the group, believing herself to be merely a humble poet
unworthy of such veneration, and has gone into seclusion
away from Verdure and the rest of Iblydos, leaving her
followers to their own devices.
Rumors have begun to spread of an unwelcome change
in Verdure since the appointment of its new leader several
months ago. Some members of the group have become
insular, cutting off communication with their loved ones.
In light of these changes, a concerned and influential citizen
of Iblydos has asked the group’s new leader, Mitera, to
allow a group of local heroes the privilege of participating
in this year’s ritual. In response, Mitera has invited several
visitors to help with Verdure’s annual celebration of spring,
including a representative from the Dark Archive by way of
magical communication left by previous Archive contacts.
Getting Started
The cries of seagulls mingle with the conversations of sleepy
anglers, who methodically organize their fishing gear and load
large nets onto their sturdy boats. Dockworkers prepare more
luxurious vessels, loading them with provisions and placing
plush cushions upon their seats. The sun has just begun to rise
over the ocean, and the briny breeze brings with it the chill of
a bitter winter that has not yet loosed its grasp upon the sea.
The adventure begins with the PCs at the docks of
Aelyosos, which they can easily reach through the
somnambulist’s bridge, where they can eventually
THE VERDURE OF IBLYDOS
Iblydos’s unique association with gods and myth means it should come at no surprise that cults are as common in the
archipelago as islands. The nature cult of Verdure, devoted to the hero-god Ludovica, conducts its sacred mysteries as
covertly as any other, though its public activities have always focused on charitable services. A welcome influence, and
the reason for the Archive’s occasional contact over the years, though a group we should keep our attention on. — K.H.W.
