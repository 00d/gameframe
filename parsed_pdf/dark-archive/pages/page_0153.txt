Critical Failure As failure, except the penalty increases to –4.
The crystals and seeds in the tea take hold in the drinker,
making them targets for Ascension is Near (page 153).
In the cabin, the PCs have an opportunity to examine
and tamper with the tea. A PC who inspects the tea and
succeeds at a DC 24 Crafting, Medicine, or Nature check
deduces its properties. While it’s too late to prevent the
followers from partaking of the brew, it’s clear that they
plan to drink many additional cups. With the knowledge
of the tea’s effects together with other herbs growing
naturally on the island, the PCs have a chance to lace
the tea with an antidote. Creating the antidote requires
two successful DC 24 checks (selected from Crafting,
Medicine, Nature, or a relevant Lore skill) and fresh
sap from a moonflower. Once the antidote is produced,
the PCs can sneak it into the tea or otherwise trick the
followers into consuming it with a DC 22 Deception,
Stealth, or Thievery check. If successful, the tea’s effects
are weakened; see Disrupting the Ritual, below.
B. THE ASCENSION
SEVERE 8
At nightfall, the followers gather at the ritual site, a
cyclopean ruin at the top of the island. The ones who
drank the tea, still coming down from their hallucinations,
crawl their way to the site, their mouths curled in delight.
Looking for her partner, Thalia finds her way to the rest
of the PCs and asks if any of them has seen Denes. He was
exploring the area with one of the followers when she
found herself without him for almost an hour. She asks if
she can stay by the PCs’ side as the ritual begins, feeling
out of place, now sober and awkward.
The darkness subsides as followers simultaneously light
lanterns, encircling everyone. Three crystals are situated
around the ritual site, each glowing faintly with violet
light. In the center, three followers lay with their arms
crossed on elevated marble beds. They’ve been gutted,
their organs replaced with fuchsia crystals and closed
moonflower blossoms that spill over the stone platforms.
Thalia, realizing that one of the sacrifices is Denes, lets out
a cry and tries to rush toward him, only to be held down
by uprooted moonflower vines. The other sacrifices were
Corella and Rose, their faces twisted in perpetual fear.
Creatures: Mitera approaches a pedestal that stands at
the center of the ritual, her eyes glowing the same purple
as the blossoms. She raises her arms, a silver dagger in
one hand, and begins her speech.
“I cherish you. I cherish every one of you and all your potential.
You are more than your physical bodies. And today, I will make
sure you ascend, like the beautiful people here, inlaid with
flowers. Let your ascended forms reveal themselves.”
As she finishes, shadows in the shape of Corella, Denes,
and Rose twist out of the crystals while a moonflower
bursts from the ground. Mitera opens the first round with
her Ascension is Near ability; what happens depends on
whether the PCs gave the followers the antidote. If they
did, the followers vomit seeds and crystals, and Mitera’s
face contorts in rage as the ascension fails. If they didn’t,
however, a few crystals trickle out of about half the
followers’ mouths before their bodies split open, revealing
blooming flowers and glowing crystals. Thalia succeeded
at her saving throw, so she is unaffected either way.
Disrupting the Ritual: Even if the PCs succeed in lacing
the tea with antidote, Mitera’s crystal vitality link with
her followers persists, meaning if the PCs hurt her, the
innocent cultists bear the same injuries (as well as the PCs,
if they participated in the service in area A1). To disrupt
the link so they can engage Mitera, the PCs must break
the three quartz formations in the ritual site. Each crystal
has 10 Hardness and 40 Hit Points. If the PCs destroy a
crystal, its connected shadow is instantly destroyed.
Endless Shadows: If a quartz formation’s shadow
creature is destroyed but the crystal itself remains intact
and unobstructed, it spends 1 round coalescing a new
shadow, after which the shadow appears adjacent to
the crystal on its initiative in the following round. The
PCs can cover a crystal to hamper its link to the shadow,
preventing the shadow from reforming or using its Crystal
Siphon ability. Covering a crystal should generally require
2 actions, or 1 action with a skill check (for example,
it might take two actions to remove a bedroll from a
backpack and wrap it around a crystal, or one action to
use Athletics to push a bunch of rubble over the crystal).
Allow creative solutions, and use 24 as a baseline DC for
checks to cover a crystal in a single action.
