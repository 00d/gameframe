esoterica (trait) The esoterica trait is present in many
thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the
various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects
you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait
require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them.
Normally, you’re assumed to always have your esoterica with
you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not
have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you. 33
Ethereal Plane A transitive plane that overlaps with the planes of
the Inner Sphere. It allows for travel within the Inner Planes.
evil (trait) Evil effects often manipulate energy from
evil-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to good divine
servants or divine servants of good deities. A creature with
this trait is evil in alignment. An ability with this trait can be
selected or used only by evil creatures.
evocation (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the evocation school of magic, typically
involving energy and elemental forces.
expert spellcasting benefits These benefits are granted by
spellcasting archetypes. CR 219
exploration (trait) An activity with this trait takes more than a
turn to use and can usually be used only during exploration
mode. CR 234
fear (trait) Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with
this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.
fetchling (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the fetchling
ancestry. Fetchlings were once human, but generations of life
on the Shadow Plane have transformed them.
fey (trait) Creatures of the First World are called fey.
finite (trait) Planes with this trait consist of a limited amount
of space.
fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either
conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no
effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist
primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element.
First World A plane that overlaps the Material Plane and is
said to be a “rough draft” of existence. It is home to vibrant
landscapes and fey.
force (trait) Effects with this trait deal force damage or create
objects made of pure magical force.
fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you
roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune
effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would
apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and
a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two
cancel each other out, and you roll normally. CR 449
gargantuan (size) CR 473–475
Garund One of Golarion’s continents. Its northern portion
makes up the southern half of the Inner Sea region.
general (trait) CR 255

good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil divine
servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature with
this trait is good in alignment. An ability with this trait can
be selected or used only by good creatures.
haunt (trait) CR 520–529
hazard Hazards are non-creature dangers that adventurers
encounter on their journeys, including environmental hazards,
haunts, and traps. Simple hazards have a one-time effect, but
negotiating a complex hazard takes place in encounter mode,
wherein the hazard has a specific routine. CR 498
	 hazards of perception 122–125
healing (trait) A healing effect restores a creature’s body,
typically by restoring Hit Points but sometimes by removing

defined by its hero-gods and cyclopean sages.
illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the illusion school of magic, typically
involving false sensory stimuli. CR 298
incapacitation (trait) CR 301
incarnate (trait) A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in
theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn’t conjure
a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned,
the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish
Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate
creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another
movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then
takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of
specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the
word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits.
A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your
interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies
as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but
ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates
that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines
what the incarnate does. It might become more inclined to
do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings.
The incarnate isn’t fully a creature. It can’t take any
other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes,
spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target
or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for
the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it
doesn’t block movement. If applicable, its effects use your
spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.
Inner Sea Region The collective name for the continent of Avistan
and the northern portion of Garund, surrounding the Inner Sea.
