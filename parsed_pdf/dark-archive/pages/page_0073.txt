Swirls in the Sand
Incident Location: Beachcomber, Shackles, Garund
Incident Type: Unknown. (Presumed Lure or Threshold?)
Reporting Archivist: Wendur Cricklee (unfinished report,
later filed by Kosha Mistparter)
Journal found in Archivist Cricklee’s
suitcase recovered from Port Peril auction:
Day 1
Day 1
I’ve arrived in the Shackles, sent by the Archive to follow
up on a strange rumor. Many build sandcastles in their
youth, but the tales from Beachcomber are different. It’s
not just children but a whole neighborhood building a
tower in the sand. The structure is said to possess strange
properties. I hope this isn’t another wild cauthooj chase,
but if it is, at least I’ll enjoy a pleasant stay at the beach
among fellow halflings.
Day 3
Day 3
The rumors are true. At first, all I found were children on
the beach building the same tiny, swirling tower. I took
it for local custom. Only after I traveled north along the
coast did I discover the truth. Hidden within a grove of
palm trees is a cove where ocean waves gently lap against
the sand. In the center of the cove lies the helical tower.
A gust of wind blew sand in my face as I drew close.
Though it was overcast, the grains felt warm to the touch,
as if under the hot sun for days. I brushed away the
sand, feeling its coarseness against my skin.
Young or old, regardless of ancestry, the people
seemed content with their work. They might’ve been on
an outing save for their utmost devotion to
the swirling sand spire. When I asked why
they were doing it they answered with a
calm smile. “We’re making things ready.
The swirls draw their eye and let
them know it’s safe.”
The work required to maintain
the structure never ceases. The people
work in shifts at different hours of the
day and continuously during rough
weather or a storm.
My spells confirmed the triple helix
tower is magical in nature, though
what type of magic eludes me. The image of the place does
stick in the mind, however...
Day 5
Day 5
Further tests yield no information. I need better equipment
if I’m to ascertain what kind of powers this thing
possesses. The people are unusually placid. They don’t care
if I cast spells on their creation—they don’t even mind if I
take samples. In fact, they encouraged me to do so.
Day 9
Day 9
Bad dreams. I woke to find my sheets tossed on the
ground in a familiar pattern. At breakfast, I spilled
coffee and noticed my finger tracing the brown liquid in
a helix. I see the tower everywhere now—just a natural
side effect from spending so many days studying the
phenomena, that’s all. My will is strong, my mental and
spiritual defenses are impenetrable. I’m a thaumaturge
of the Dark Archive and it will take more than some silly
sandcastle to get in my head. Only... why did I find myself
turning widdershins while waiting in line to pay my bill?
Widdershins, the same direction as the spire, the beautiful
edifice of swirling sand...
Later Note:
Later Note: Wendur Cricklee was last seen
leaving Beachcomber, heading north along
the coast.

Swirling sand carries a faint trace of strange
compulsions from the helical sand spire
near Beachcomber. Adding this catalyst
to a suggestion spell implants a strange
compulsion in one target of the spell. The target
creature must spin counterclockwise at the end
of its turn if it didn’t take a move action that
turn. This spin is a free action that has the
move trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on
a success, failure, or critical failure against
suggestion (even if the target completes its
suggestion in fewer rounds); a target that
critically succeeds against suggestion is
unaffected by the swirling sand.
