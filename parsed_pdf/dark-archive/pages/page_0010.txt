PSYCHIC
The mind can perceive truths hidden to fine-tuned instruments, house more
secrets than any tome, and move objects and hearts more deftly than any lever. By
delving into both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your inner self, you
have awoken to the might of psychic magic, allowing you to cast spells not through
incantations or gestures but by the power of your will alone. While the thin line between
your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for
yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it.

KEY ABILITY
INTELLIGENCE OR CHARISMA
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Intelligence or
Charisma, as determined by your
choice of subconscious mind.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You rely on your collection of psychic cantrips as a mainstay, choosing
where and when to amplify them for maximum effect. You weave your
more conventional spells into the fray where more complex magic is needed,
unleashing your mind’s full potential in a blaze of power when the time is right.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You navigate situations guided by the source of your subconscious power. If
your power springs from your personality, you might maneuver with empathy
and sociability; if it’s more cerebral, you might provide a steady logical front.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You keep your mind’s eye open for the many paranormal threats that those
who are less sensitive might not detect. Typically, you either scan for magic
or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits.
IN DOWNTIME...
You strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells
and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding
of yourself, you can access more of the power within. You test the limits of your
adaptability by retraining to fit your evolving understanding of your potential.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Show a preference for learning, meditation, dreams, or other intangible
manifestations of thought over the immediacy of the physical world.
•	 Learn new things about yourself, just when you thought you knew it all.
•	 Think of your psychic magic as so much a part of you that you use it even
when normal methods suffice, perhaps preferring to communicate via mental
messages or levitating an object to a companion at the opposite end of a table.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Are awed by your mental abilities, especially when your psyche is unleashed.
•	 Have difficulty understanding that the magic you perform with your mind
comes from the same source as more conventional spellcasting.
•	 Wonder if you might be a monster in disguise, possessed by spirits, chosen
by the gods, or have some other unusual reason for your strange powers.
