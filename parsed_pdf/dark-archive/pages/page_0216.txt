from, taking falling damage as normal (usually 50 bludgeoning
damage). The call of the void then rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The call targets all creatures adjacent to a
ledge or on one of the red ropes and tugs at their minds. A
creature who has already fallen this round is immune.
Reset The call of the void persists as long as the Echo exists,
though it doesn’t activate until the Echo has rolled initiative.
The hazard resets each day.
Conclusion
As the final blow is struck, the Echo
collapses in a storm of white moths
that scatter in every direction, leaving
cracks in the fabric of the mindscape itself.
Soon, the PCs are ejected, landing wherever it
was that they first opened the somnambulist’s bridge
to travel to Nantambu. When the air clears, all that’s left
is the crumpled paper the Echo refused to hand over: the
Lone Archivist’s last secret.
If a PC unfolds the paper, they find an iron key in
the shape of the Dark Archive’s symbol that turns,
ever so slightly, in their hand, pointing someplace
distant like the needle of a compass tugging north.
The paper bears the following note.
I know there’s a chance no one ever reads this. Even so:
If you hold this page, you are first among the successors to
the Dark Archive. You’ve passed the test I set here—but more
vitally, before that, you untangled the threads I couldn’t. As I
can’t share this astonishing success with you in person, please
let me say well done, and that you have my eternal gratitude.
As I wrote in my first letter, there’s no true substitute for
experience. Your path here has provided plenty of that, but
I hope it also brought you the joys this work can hold: the
comfort of camaraderie, the satisfaction of success.
I have one final gift for you: the key to my vault, where I’ve
stored enough secrets to fill a thousand casefiles. Follow it, and
it will show you the way—to Absalom, to the vault, and to me.
I said I wouldn’t be the last archivist. Thank you for
proving me right. The unknown beckons.
Until we meet, my fellow Dark Archivists,
—K.H.W.
Continuing the
Adventure
After completing the final adventure, the PCs will have
crossed Golarion and uncovered many of its mysteries—
but each new impossible discovery expands the potential
that your party of 12th-level archivists can explore!
Unsolved Cases: While the PCs have explored the eight
main mysteries of the stolen files, there remain many
other incident reports to explore. Consider using one as
the lead-in to your party’s next adventure!
Finding the Archive: The PCs now have a key that
opens K.H.W.’s last vault, which they know is somewhere
in or around Absalom. The vault is the perfect jumping-off
point for further investigations into the unknown,
whether it’s a creature or artifact getting loose, another
open file to explore, or even the adventure of finding the
vault, and its last secrets, in the first place.
Rival Archivists: The PCs’ adventures across Golarion,
or their new possession of the vault key, might attract
the attention of secret societies, cults, or stranger groups.
Agents of these factions might approach—or hunt—the
PCs during their next adventure for digging too deep!
