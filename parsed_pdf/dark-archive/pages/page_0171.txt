Adventure Background
In the land of Irrisen, where the riders of bright morning,
red noon, and dark midnight serve Baba Yaga, and where
the princess Anastasia rules from a palace of ice, there is
a village called Krasnoprudny. Next to that village is a
lovely little pond, from which the village takes its name
(for Krasnoprudny means “beside the beautiful pond”).
And in that pond, there lived a vodyanoy and his seven
rusalka daughters.
For many years they lived happily enough, but then
came word of a new queen in Whitethrone, and the
rusalkas decided to venture to the capital and seek
service as handmaidens to Anastasia, because a palace
is better than a pond, even a very nice pond with a
little ledge perfect for sitting. And the old vodyanoy,
Ded Bolota (“Grandpa Bog”) by name, gave them his
blessing and waved them goodbye as they left.
But it’s lonely living in a pond all by yourself, and Ded
Bolota started to mope, and to sulk, and to drink too
much. Until an old friend of his came to visit, the elder
leshy Ded Bereza (“Grandpa Birch”). The leshy grew
worried about the vodyanoy’s state of mind. “Bolota,”
the birch tree said, “You need to get out more, you need
a hobby. There are all these mortals living by your banks,
why don’t you do something nice for them?”
And so the two put their heads together and set out
to make Krasnoprudny the most fortunate village in all
of Irrisen, a place where wishes come true. And since
neither had the faintest idea of how mortals thought, it
all promptly went to pieces.
Getting Started
Unlike several previous adventures, the journey through
the somnambulist bridge is noticeably turbulent, like a
falling nightmare. The portal unceremoniously spits the
PCs out into the air about 5 feet above a snowbank by
the side of a road, a few hours away from their intended
destination. (Unbeknownst to the PCs, at least for now,
is that someone in town made an ill-considered wish to
be left alone, and the ensuing fey magic was enough to
interfere with the transportation ritual.)
A PC who succeeds at a DC 26 Nature check to Recall
Knowledge is familiar with the main sources of the curses
in Irrisen.

WISHES IN KRASNOPRUDNY
With its particular confluence of witches and ancient spirits, Irrisen is always a region of interest when discussing
curses and pacts. The matter concerning the village of Krasnoprudny in particular is just the latest in a long string
of such files, but one that’s managed to catch my eye—while many villages have borne the curse of a winter witch for
a slight real or imagined, something feels different about this village. Curse? Enchantment? Geas? — K.H.W.
