GLOSSARY & INDEX
This appendix contains page references for key terms appearing in this book, partial definitions for many rules and
concepts, and full definitions for most traits appearing in this book. Many entries refer to the Core Rulebook and
Advanced Player’s Guide using the abbreviations “CR” and “APG.”
acid (trait) Effects with this trait deal acid damage. Creatures
with this trait have a magical connection to acid.
aftermath (trait) This trait describes feats that represent special
abilities gained after exposure to the weird and deadly. 55–57
agile (weapon trait) The multiple attack penalty you take with this
weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5,
and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in
the turn. CR 282
air (trait) Effects with the air trait either manipulate or conjure
air. Those that manipulate air have no effect in a vacuum or
an area without air. Creatures with this trait consist primarily
of air or have a magical connection to that element.
alchemical (trait) Alchemical items are powered by reactions
of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren’t magical and
don’t radiate a magical aura. CR 543–554, APG 252–255
amp (trait) An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the
properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their
own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps
you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps. 13

Each player character chooses an ancestry as the first step
of character creation. CR 32–59, APG 6–47
