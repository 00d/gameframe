Read or paraphrase the following as the PCs approach
the Lake of Mists and Veils.
Just past the tree line, the elevation drops substantially.
From the eroded ground, tree roots emerge like tendrils. A
well‑marked trail slopes down to the rocky shore below. Past
the curve of the trail, haze burns off the lake. The fog still
clings to the day, softening the shape of the natural features
until they disappear into the milky distance. Bird calls, croaking
frogs, and the rustle of trees cut through this muffled world.
The sounds occasionally turn sharper, like a branch snapping
under something’s weight.
The drop-off between the tree line and the shore is
20 feet. The steep slope of the trail descends 5 feet per
square. The shoreline is rocky and solid beneath the PCs
feet, though occasional large rock formations jut out of the
sand and can be used for cover. The thick brush beneath
the tree provides cover for any creature within it. The
lake’s eponymous misty fog obscures vision past 100 feet.
STAKEOUT
The Birchfrost Beast’s patrols are irregular, so finding the
Beast requires patience on the part of the PCs. If they
choose to follow the hunters’ advice, the PCs can
choose to set up a stakeout in the area where the Beast
was last seen. The PCs have two rounds of preparation
available, with each round lasting approximately 1 hour.
However, the PCs aren’t aware of how much time they
have available; as far as they know, the beast could
arrive after any number of rounds.
Below are some common plans that PCs might try.
The DC for all skill checks is 16, though an appropriate
Lore skill might be DC 14. On a successful check, the
PC earns 1 Stakeout Point. On a critical success, the
PC earns 2 Stakeout Points. On a critical failure,
the PC loses 1 Stakeout Point. If the PCs present
a plan other than the ones below, do your best
to determine the appropriate skills, either using
DC 16 if the plan seems reasonable, or a higher
or lower DC if the plan is especially clever or
implausible. Spending an hour on a stakeout plan
is an exploration activity. Different PCs can attempt
different plans at the same time, and each contributes
to the others. For instance, if one PC is acting like a
careless hunter while another searches for tracks to
find the best approach and the remaining PCs prepare a
counter ambush, these all contribute to the stakeout.
Coax It Out: By mimicking the stories they heard
about the creature, a PC can attempt to coax the creature
out. This requires the PC to purposefully mimic the
behavior that summons it, such as setting traps or
attempting to cast nets into the lake. A Deception
or Society check is required to accurately
remember the stories and reenact the
actions in a believable manner.
Counter Ambush: The lakeside has ample cover, allowing
a PC to set up blinds to hide behind and prepare camouflage
in the hopes of spotting the beast as it moves through. PCs
using this option use the Avoid Notice exploration activity.
Preparing a hideaway requires a Stealth check.
Find Tracks: By assessing the area for natural game
trails or tracks with a Survival check, a PC can identify the
most likely approach that the Birchfrost Beast will take.
THE BEAST APPROACHES
MODERATE 3
After 2 hours of preparations, the Birchfrost Beast enters
the area during its patrol of the forest. The creature’s exact
approach and awareness of the PCs depends on how many
Stakeout Points the PCs earned.
3 or Fewer Points: The Birchfrost Beast notices the
subtle changes to the local area. It’s aware of the PCs as
it approaches the area and takes precautions. It Avoids
Notice as it approaches by burrowing from the east.
4–6 Points: The Birchfrost Beast approaches from the
west, unaware of the PCs’ current position.
7 or More Points: The PCs’ preparations hide them
expertly from the Beast until it’s almost upon them. It
approaches from the west and has the flat-footed condition
for the entirety of the first round.
