Many powerful curses are by some measure
self‑inflicted by the victim. Which is absolutely not to say
that they’re deserved. Curses rarely know proportion or
appropriate consequences. A child who steals an apple
from a fey witch might deserve a stern reprimand, but not
to vomit toads for the rest of their life.
FORMS OF CURSES
There are a great many types of curses out there. What
follows is a non-exhaustive list.
Spell Curses: The most straightforward curses,
these are produced by mortal
sorcerers, magi, witches, and
more in much the same way
all other spells are produced.
These are the curses most likely
to be temporary in nature,
though some, like the outcast’s
curse, can infect the target and
become permanent in the same
way as more famous curses.
Cursed Objects: One way to
empower a curse is to bind it
to an object. Infinitely variable,
such cursed objects do tend
to be relatively rare—it takes
a great deal of effort to make
such a thing. The most famous
example is the monkey’s paw,
which twists the wishes of its
owner into horrific reality, but
other examples include burden
stones, tiny pebbles that weigh
as much as boulders, and
necklaces
of
strangulation,
enchanted
necklaces
which,
when worn, choose a moment of stress to murder their
wearer. Such objects are also easily transferred—a cursed
ring or knife can trace a path across continents as it finds
its way to new victims.
Pacts: Another subset of powerful “curses” are those
that come about from pacts, both fulfilled and broken.
While not, strictly speaking, a curse, the function is much
the same, where the willing acceptance of terms by all
parties allows magic to burrow deeper than it otherwise
could. If a fey pact requires you to give up your voice in
exchange for three full moon’s worth of wealth, the magic
that binds the voice and provides the ensuing wealth
shares many qualities with a curse. Pacts themselves
differ from curses in that they’re usually easy to break,
though the act of breaking them swiftly and irrevocably
brings consequences—at the simplest level, a reversion
to the previous status quo as whatever wealth, ability, or
status was bargained for disappears, but it’s possible for
labyrinthine penalty clauses to cause all sorts of trouble
for the pact breaker.
Different sorts of entities might create these pacts.
Mortal wizards can do so with the appropriate rituals,
but more commonly they’re made with spirits, hags, or
stranger forces. Devils are notorious for their pacts, but the
most famous and prolific pact-makers are fey, who make
such deals as easily as they breathe and have no sense of
balance where it comes to punishing a pact breaker.
Tomb Curses and Temple Curses: Everyone’s heard the
classic tale. A group of scholars break into the tomb of
some Osiriani pharaoh, ignoring the curse inscribed on
the lintel. All are dead inside of a year. The truth is that
the act of breaking a religious or
societal taboo does seem to leave
victims vulnerable to certain
forms of curses, and sorcerers
and hierophants know how to
take advantage of such things for
defense—most commonly, these
curses descend on those who
violate the sanctity of the tomb.
Familial Curses: A particularly
heinous subset of curses are ones
that target entire families, or
that travel from one generation
to another. These curses, usually
the ones cast by capricious fey
or angry gods, might work in
several ways. They might latch
onto a single member of the
family, hounding them to death
before moving onto the next.
They might come into effect only
once a generation. Or they might
affect all members of the family
constantly, ceaselessly.
Contagious
Curses:
Some
beings have a curse within them waiting to be spread.
Werewolves and other creatures of a similar kind
famously possess a curse received from their parents—a
familiar curse at its base­—but transmissible with their
bites. These werecreatures do suffer from their own curse,
but all kind of creatures from outside this world merely
deal out curses to others. The easy spread of contagious
curses makes them dangerous, potentially at a large scale.
No ritual need be invoked, no pact made. Only fangs
piercing flesh.
Oracular Curses: One last form of curse is that
of oracles and others touched by the divine. These
individuals receive boons from gods or spirits, but they
always come with a price, some insidious curse that
drains them even as they grow ever more powerful. My
personal suspicion, though I can’t confirm it, is that these
things are a form of pact, though not one formed with
a fey or devil but with a god or the universe beyond,
subconsciously perhaps. There is power, and as always,
there is a price to pay for it.
