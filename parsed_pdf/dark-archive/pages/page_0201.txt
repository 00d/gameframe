Taking place entirely in a mindscape, psychic duels can
occur when foes come into conflict in an area rife with
mental magic, through the magic of a bizarre artifact, when
two creatures’ minds connect within a dream, or when a
psychic duelist instigates a duel (page 203). Psychic duels
play out much like the duels described on pages 166–167
of the Gamemastery Guide. The main differences are the
participants conduct their duel in mental space and their
mental state and emotions determine the outcome. (A duel
taking place in the physical world with occult spells uses
the rules for spellcasting duels, not psychic duels.) While
engaged in a psychic duel, the participants are paralyzed
in the real world and can mentally act only in the psychic
duel mindscape.
Though other kinds of duels have a judge, a psychic duel
is governed by the workings of the mind. This means most
psychic duels last until a participant yields or is knocked
out (or all participants on one side in the case of a group
duel). However, the duel can also end if the participants
share an event they would consider a satisfying end to
the duel. For instance, they might decide the goal of the
duel is to demonstrate mastery of illusion spells, with the
first to fully fall for an illusion losing the duel. Because
the duel takes place on a mental battlefield, a creature that
is mindless or immune to mental effects is incapable of
joining a psychic duel.
Terms of the Duel
Because of the entirely mental nature of a psychic duel,
participants can easily establish more ground rules for
their duel through simple consensus, such as the following
example options.
•	 All psychic manifestations are nonlethal.
•	 Participants can cast no spells but battle form spells.
•	 A participant can escape the duel by attaining a certain
goal, ending it early as a draw. This is especially
common in a duel between a powerful psychic and
someone with weak psychic capabilities.
•	 Participants can leave the duel immediately if their
physical body is disturbed or harmed.
PSYCHIC DUELS
Two challengers flood their minds with a vision of a psychic battlefield. Imagination explodes into psychic attacks.
Fireballs bloom into explosions of color, imaginary swords open wounds bleeding iridescent butterflies, unreal
monstrosities escape from nightmares to lash out with their thousand fangs. A defender’s shield of psychic glass shatters
into fractal shrapnel and the combatant faints, overwhelmed. The victor’s mind snaps back to the ordinary world as
their foe crumples to the ground.
