Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and
doesn’t take hostile actions against you and your allies, you
take a –1 status penalty to Deception checks to Lie to them.
If they refuse and take a hostile action against you or an ally,
they must attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and
then take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must
attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category
worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack
and damage rolls against you and your allies.
Critical Failure The target takes a –2 status penalty to
attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.

WITCH
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You accuse the target of breaking its word to you and invoke
the wrath of your patron to claim what’s due, demanding the
target pay you in currency, fulfill an order, or stand down. The
demand can’t be obviously self-destructive, or the spell fails. If
the target resists, you take your payment from its life force. The
target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of its
save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and is immune to
your pact broker cantrips for 1 day.
Success If the target doesn’t comply with your request by the
end of its next turn, it takes 3d8 persistent negative damage.
If it later complies, the spell automatically ends.
Failure As success, but if the target doesn’t comply, it is drained
1 and takes 6d8 persistent negative damage.
Critical Failure As success, but if the target doesn’t comply, it
is drained 2, doomed 1, and takes 6d8 persistent negative
damage. Even if the target completes your commands later,
the spell doesn’t end until all the conditions end.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to two creatures.
