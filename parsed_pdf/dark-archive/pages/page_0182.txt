AWAKEN ENTROPY
SPELL 6
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1
minute
All things age, all things die, and at the end of days even the
universe will grow quiet and still. You awaken the cosmic
principle of entropy, accelerating time in an area—flesh
falters, plants shrivel, and even stone begins to crumble.
Any creature that enters or begins its turn in the area must
succeed at a basic Fortitude save or take 8d6 negative
damage, or 8d6 force damage if the creature normally
doesn’t take negative damage, such as if the creature is
a construct or undead. Even beings such as fiends with
unlimited lifespans can be worn away by entropy.
The first time you Sustain the Spell on each subsequent
turn, the entropic zone grows stronger in addition to having
its duration increased. The radius of the burst increases by
10 feet (to a maximum of 40 feet), and the size of the damage
dice increases by one step (from d6 to d8, then to d10, and
finally to d12).
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.

SPELL 3
DIVINATION
INCAPACITATION
PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 round
You behold the many timelines that weave around a creature,
and in so doing, you make one more likely to occur. The
target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success You can make neither heads nor tails of the
target’s timeline, and the target is unaffected.
Success The target must commit to a single action that it
will take at some point during its next turn: “Stride toward
Valeros,” “Cast shield,” “Strike at Amiri with my jaws.” That
action is now locked in, and the creature must attempt it,
even if the situation has changed—if the creature stated
that it would Strike at Amiri with its jaws, it must try to do
so. If the creature is entirely unable to fulfill the action it
committed to—for instance, if it had only 1 action left and
Amiri was out of the range of its jaws Strike—it loses the
last action of its turn as it reels in a temporal paradox. The
creature can choose to lock in a 2- or 3-action activity if
it prefers to do so, but if it does, it loses all the associated
actions if it can’t perform the activity on its turn. If the

The Archive’s encounters with temporal phenomena have yielded a number of magical techniques to turn back the
clock or otherwise meddle with time. For a list of all spells in this book, see page 216.
