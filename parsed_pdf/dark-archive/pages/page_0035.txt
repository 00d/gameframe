SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
SECOND IMPLEMENT
5TH
You’ve added another implement of power to your toolkit.
You choose a second implement, which must be a different
type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate
benefit of your new implement.
While you’re holding an implement in one hand, you can
quickly switch it with another implement you’re wearing to
use an action from the implement you’re switching to. To
do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before
executing the implement’s action. This allows you to meet
requirements of having an implement in hand to use its
action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in
one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement
you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your
chalice to use its reaction.

5TH
You’ve learned the secret ways your weapons work
most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.

your implements, unlocking its adept power.
Choose one of your implements and gain
the adept benefit for that implement.

Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to master. When you roll
a success on a Will save, you
get a critical success instead.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
7TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater
injuries with the weapons you know
best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks
in which you are an expert. This
damage increases to 3 if you’re a
master, and 4 if you’re legendary.
INTENSIFY VULNERABILITY
9TH
You’ve learned to use your implement to further assault
a creature whose vulnerabilities you’re exploiting. You
