In reality, we are all woodlice squatting in a rotten
log, telling ourselves that as we understand the log we
understand the world, for that is all there is. And so
we happily feast until the odd ray of sunlight breaks
in, and all the learned woodlice stroke their chins and
proclaim themselves baffled. Pray our log is never
overturned entirely.
Over the years, my fellow archivists have stumbled
across a considerable number of individuals with
potencies that stubbornly fails to align with traditional
understandings of the supernatural, which we’ve taken
to calling “deviant abilities” for convenience. Their
powers are not the codified spellwork that we think
of most often as magic. Instead, they represent strange
anomalies, twists of circumstance, or other alien codes
that result in logic-defying abilities. They obey no
harmony we understand; if we think we comprehend
these things, then we delude ourselves.
I’ve gathered together here a few of the more
noteworthy casefiles from the Archives.
POPPY
Let’s begin with a relatively mundane example, insofar
as that word has any meaning at all in our line of work.
Poppy is a halfling girl born, we think, in 4697 ar, in
what was apparently a rather abusive familial situation in
a farming village out on the edges of Nirmathas. Archivist
Feries was unable to get much detail—one “does not
SPONTANEOUS IGNITION OF
SUPERNATURAL MIGHT
On so-called “deviant abilities”
and other anomalous powers
The wise and learned scholars at the Arcanamirium or the Egorian Academy of
Magical Arts would have you believe that they understand magic. While they indeed
note the great unknowns, the sublime mystery of thrumming power on the whole, I
get the sense that they feel they know every way by which a mortal can wield magic.
That everything has been deciphered and decoded, classified and categorized and calculated, with just a few little
loose ends awaiting tidying. But there’s always more to wonder at.
