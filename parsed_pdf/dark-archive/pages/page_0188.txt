attempts a Fortitude saving throw against your chronoskimmer
DC. The creature takes the effects of slow based on the result
of its saving throw.
COMBAT PREMONITION
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that
of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or
destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a
flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies
roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is
a fortune effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the
worse result; this is a misfortune effect. The two effects are
tied together: if you would avoid the misfortune effect
for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate
their fortune effect, your Combat Premonition
does nothing.
ESCAPE TIMELINE [free-action]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
Trigger Your turn begins.
You step outside of the flow of time
momentarily,
allowing
you
to
avoid
dangers. Your physical form stops existing
momentarily, and you can’t be targeted or
affected until the start of your next turn—
you simply don’t exist at that moment in
time. Your turn ends immediately, advancing
1 round for all timed durations and effects,
such as conditions and afflictions. You still attempt
saving throws, flat checks, or any other checks at
the end of your turn as normal, but you don’t take
any damage due to these checks (though you take
any non-damaging effects as normal). At the start
of your next turn, you reenter the flow of time and
reappear in the same space where you left time
last round. If the space isn’t clear, you arrive in the
nearest open space.
SPACE-TIME SHIFT [free-action]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger Your turn begins.
You travel just a few moments into the future to
immediately arrive at your destination. Your Strides
are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing
you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach
with your Stride instead of traversing normally to
the location. Your augmented Strides have the
teleport trait and don’t trigger reactions
that can be triggered by move actions or
upon leaving or entering a square. You also
augment your Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim actions in this way
if you have the corresponding movement type.
RESET THE PAST [free-action]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Frequency once per day
You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal
techniques—by revising your past so you never used it in the
first place. Select one of your chronoskimmer feats that has
a frequency of once per day (or more frequent) that you’ve
already used. You can use the feat again, as if you hadn’t used
it already.
