THAUMATURGE
The world is full of the unexplainable: ancient magic, dead gods, and even stranger
things. In response, you’ve scavenged the best parts of every magical tradition and
built up a collection of esoterica—a broken holy relic here, a sprig of mistletoe
there—that you can use to best any creature by exploiting their weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. The mystic implement you carry is both badge and weapon, its symbolic
weight helping you bargain with and subdue the supernatural. Every path to power has its restrictions
and costs, but you turn them all to your advantage. You’re a thaumaturge, and you work wonders.

KEY ABILITY
CHARISMA
At 1st level, your class gives you an
ability boost to Charisma.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You use your implements and diverse arsenal of mystic tools and tricks to assist
in combat, always presenting the right bane to exploit enemies’ weaknesses or
shield your allies against the supernatural.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You understand and nudge the social connections between people, much as
you strive to understand the larger ties between mysteries and concepts. This
helps you to find common ground when negotiating between the mundane
and supernatural or even to play one side against the other.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You investigate unexplainable phenomena around you, taking appropriate
precautions to ward yourself and your allies against paranormal threats.
Where necessary, you create your own path through the unknown.
IN DOWNTIME...
You research deeper into the supernatural mysteries you discovered on your
last adventure to see how they can be applied in the future. You dust off
relics, cultivate herbs, or forge trinkets, updating your collection of scavenged
supernatural tools after each new threat you encounter. You return or call in
favors with other people, strange creatures, and mystical forces.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Prepare for the worst while improvising as necessary, impressing your allies
when you’re able to handle anything that fate throws at you.
•	 Assume everything is connected on a deeper level, rather than be content
with what you find on the surface.
•	 Obsess over a certain supernatural phenomenon, attempting to tie
everything back to it.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Look to you to learn the weaknesses of a supernatural threat when one
rears its head. Even when your explanations are invented on the fly, they
just seem to work.
•	 Rely on you to come up with a solution when the situation seems hopeless.
•	 Mistake you for a common wizard or magician.
