THAUMATURGE (ARCHETYPE)
Scraps of knowledge have taught you how to exploit the vulnerabilities of creatures and the powers of mystical objects.
MULTICLASS THAUMATURGE CHARACTERS
Thaumaturge suits characters who want to glean strange
knowledge. It’s especially useful for those who tend to fight
with one-handed weapons, like swashbucklers or rogues,
since they have their other hand free for an implement.
