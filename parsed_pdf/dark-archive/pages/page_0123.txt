SHUFFLING HALL
HAZARD –1
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 15
Description Four pressure plates along this mirrored hall
rotate vertically when stepped on, sending a creature on
the pressure plate tipping into an adjacent featureless room
while simultaneously replacing the pressure plate and
walls in the hall. Each pressure plate dumps creatures into
a different room.
Disable DC 12 Thievery to deactivate one pressure plate
AC 18; Fort +2, Ref +5
Hardness 4; HP 12 (BT 6); Immunities object immunities
Flip [reaction] Trigger A creature steps on a pressure plate; Effect The
floor and adjoining wall rotate up and over on a central axle,
tipping the triggering creature into an adjacent featureless
room and simultaneously replacing the pressure plate and
wall with another set on the same axle. The triggering
creature is pushed into an adjoining room, takes 1d8
bludgeoning damage, and lands prone. A creature who
succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save takes no damage and rolls
out of the way of the trap, returning to the space they were
in before stepping on the pressure plate.

CONFOUNDING PORTAL
HAZARD 0
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
MENTAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 16
Description Tiny runes carved around a doorframe or on
a hall’s walls surreptitiously confound creatures into
circling the room or hallway they
attempted to exit or pass through.
Disable DC 17 Thievery to scratch
out the runes, or DC 16 Arcana to
destroy the runes
Confounding
Misdirection
[reaction]
(arcane, illusion, mental) Trigger
A creature passes through the
rune-carved doorway or hallway;
Effect The creature is confused by
the illusions and directed back into
the room they attempted to exit
through another doorway or back
to the hallway’s beginning. This
feels no different to the triggering
creature than walking through the
doorway or hallway, and onlookers
are similarly befuddled. A creature
who succeeds at a DC 19 Will save resists this illusion
and exits the room or proceeds down the hall without
being misdirected.

DISORIENTING ILLUSIONS
HAZARD 1
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
TRAP
VISUAL
Stealth DC 20
Description Illusions cloaking this chamber cause it to appear
distorted and constantly shifting, with the room and all its
contents appearing tilted, irregular, and in motion.
Disable DC 17 Crafting (trained) to calculate the room’s
dimensions despite the illusions, or dispel magic (1st level;
counteract DC 17) to counteract the illusions
Disorient [reaction] (arcane, illusion, mental, visual) Trigger A creature
enters the room; Effect Illusions cause the appearance of
the room and the objects inside it to constantly warp, shift,
bend, and distort for 1 minute. Each creature in the room
while it’s distorting must attempt a DC 17 Perception check.
Critical Success The creature disbelieves the illusions and
is unaffected.
Success The creature disbelieves the illusions but still sees
them. It treats the room as difficult terrain.
Failure The creature is fooled by the illusions. It treats the
room as difficult terrain and becomes sickened 1. As long
as it remains in the room, it can’t reduce its sickened
value below 1.
HAZARDS OF PERCEPTION
Hazards are traps and obstacles that can enhance exploration or be the focus of encounters entirely. Many of the
hazards in this section involve bending perception, creating duplicates, or otherwise creating a spooky and unsettling
atmosphere, perfect for haunted houses and similar locations.
