EERIE ENVIRONS
FEAT 8
DRUID
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation, trained in Stealth
The natural world can be scary to those not used to it—and you
make it scarier still. If you’re hidden from a creature, you can
attempt to Demoralize it without losing your hidden condition—
imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to
rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don’t take a penalty to
your check if the target doesn’t understand your language.
EERIE TRACES
FEAT 8
CONCENTRATE
DRUID
EXPLORATION
MOVE
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation, trained in Survival
The tracks you leave behind are strange, somehow disconcerting
and unnerving—they might travel backward, or through places
no one would think to pass through. You change your tracks
into eerie traces, moving up to half your travel speed as you
do so. You don’t need to attempt a Survival check to change
your tracks, but anyone tracking you must attempt a Will save
against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
Success The tracker is unaffected.
Failure The tracker becomes frightened 1 for as long as it
follows your tracks. This condition doesn’t decrease until
the tracker stops following you, and it comes back if the
tracker resumes following your tracks. If the tracker enters
into an encounter with you after following your tracks, it
begins the encounter frightened 1.
Critical Failure As failure, but your disturbing traces cause the
tracker to be frightened 2 instead.
FORGOTTEN PRESENCE
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
DRUID
The world conspires to keep you forgotten and unnoticed—
memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits
of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to
Recall Knowledge about you take a –2 circumstance penalty.
Add modify memory to your spell list as a primal spell.

PRIMAL
RANGER
Prerequisites expert in Occultism, expert in Survival
Frequency once per hour
Requirements You must be in either natural terrain or in
abandoned or relatively unused artificial terrain (such as a
darkened alley or haunted house).
You know there are places in the world that are just wrong—
places where the birds don’t sing and where you always feel like
you’re being watched. You can spot these places, and you can
awaken them. To do so, you must gesture toward a 10-foot by 10-
foot square you can see and make an ominous proclamation of
some manner (i.e. “This is cursed ground,” “That is an ill-omened
place.”). The next creature that enters the marked territory must
attempt a Will save against your spell DC (if you’re a druid) or
class DC (if you’re a ranger).
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure Something goes horribly awry for the victim in the
cursed ground. The details are up to the GM—it can be a
purely “natural” accident (they step into an old bear trap,
perhaps) or something stranger and more spectral. The target
gains a condition for 2 rounds. Roll 1d4 on the table and use
the failure column to determine which condition.
Critical Failure As failure, but the effect is astonishingly
gruesome. Use the critical failure column, and the condition
lasts for 1 minute.

OBSCURED EMERGENCE
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You are, by nature, a thing of gloomy woods and barren wilds,
and when you choose show yourself, a bit of this gloom clings
to you, obscuring your form with strange distortions or mist.
When you stop being hidden due to your own actions (not due
to someone successfully finding you), you gain concealment until
the start of your next turn as people’s eyes find it oddly hard to
focus on you. As usual for concealment involving an obvious
visual manifestation, you can’t use this concealment to Hide.
BIZARRE TRANSFORMATION [one-action]
FEAT 14
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Wild Shape
The forms you take on defy belief—chimerical sights of twisted
antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast wild shape,
you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack
granted by the wild shape form to one of the following: acid,
bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing.
The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.
UNSEEN ANIMAL COMPANIONS (UNCOMMON)
Cryptid animal companions look a touch peculiar,
often with uncanny features or ones that seem to
come from a different animal. If you take a feat
that would normally allow you to choose to have
your companion become a savage or nimble animal
companion, you can choose to make it an unseen
animal companion instead. An unseen companion
increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals
3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks
and deals an extra 1d4 precision damage against
flat‑footed targets (if the animal companion already
deals precision damage, such as a cat, combine the
precision damage). Increase its proficiency rank
in Stealth to expert. It also learns the advanced
maneuver for its type.
