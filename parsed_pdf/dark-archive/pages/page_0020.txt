gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status
bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.
Success As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if
it forgoes the reaction is +1.
Failure The spell has no effect.
Amp The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success
(but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you Sustain
the Spell, you can choose an additional ally to target,
granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.
THE OSCILLATING WAVE
At the heart of all things is energy. Though it may change
its form or resting place, it is eternal, fundamental, the
purest of building blocks. Your powers let you shift
energy—either concentrating it in a single point to
explosive end or freezing objects by plundering it away—
in an endless oscillation of temperature.
Granted Spells 1st: burning hands; 2nd: heat metal (Advanced
Player’s Guide 220); 3rd: fireball; 4th: fire shield; 5th: cone
of cold; 6th: flame vortex (Secrets of Magic 106); 7th: fiery
body; 8th: polar ray; 9th: meteor swarm
Standard Psi Cantrips produce flame and ray of frost
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: thermal stasis; deeper: entropic
wheel; deepest: redistribute potential
Conservation of Energy
Energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or
changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove
energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force.
The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell
from your conscious mind or a psi cantrip, decide whether
you’re adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy,
you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these
spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral
state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you
add or remove energy on your next spell.
Adding Energy: The ability gains the fire trait, any
damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants
is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage
types it no longer deals.
Removing Energy: The ability gains the cold trait, any
damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants
is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types
it no longer deals. Fiery body grants ray of frost instead of
produce flame when cast this way.
Mindshift: When you use an action that has the mindshift
trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of
making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing
energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.
