in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You
must usually target darkness magic with your light magic
directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells

magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A
magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant
school of magic.
Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition
of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine,
occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of
these traits indicate that the item is magical. CR 535

this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this

mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any
save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits
matching damage types it no longer deals. 13
misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters
how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one
misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune
effects would apply, the GM decides which is worst and
applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would
apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and
you roll normally. CR 449

space to another. CR 473–475

or manipulate negative energy. Creatures with this trait are
natives of the Negative Energy Plane. They can survive the
basic environmental effects of the Negative Energy Plane.
