INSTRUCTIVE STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 4
THAUMATURGE
You attack your foe and analyze how it reacts. Make a Strike. On a hit, you can
immediately attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about the target. On a critical hit,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check to Recall Knowledge.
PAIRED LINK
FEAT 4
DIVINATION
ESOTERICA FORTUNE
OCCULT
THAUMATURGE
You break a trinket such as a lodestone or jade pendant in two, creating a sympathetic
link between the halves that bridges distance. During your daily preparations, you
perform a short ceremony where you gift one of the two halves to a willing ally.
On that ally, you can cast spells and use thaumaturge abilities that have a range of
touch at a range of 30 feet instead, and the ally can cast spells that have a range of
touch on you from a range of 30 feet. These effects last as long as you and the ally
have their half; if either half leaves either of your possession for even a moment,
or if you establish a link with a new ally during your next daily preparations, the
link breaks.
THAUMATURGIC RITUALIST
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
THAUMATURGE
Your studies into the supernatural have resulted in an especially strong knowledge
of rituals. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to perform a ritual.
You learn two uncommon rituals with a level no higher than half your level; you must
meet all prerequisites for casting the ritual to choose it. You can cast these as the
primary caster, but you can’t teach them to anyone else or allow someone else to
serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.
At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual
with a level no higher than half your level and for which you meet the prerequisites.
6TH LEVEL
ONE MORE ACTIVATION
FEAT 6
THAUMATURGE
You’ve forged a deeper bond to your invested items, allowing you to activate them
more than usual. Once each day, you can Activate an Item you’ve invested even
after you’ve used that activation the maximum number of times for its frequency.
You can do so only if the item’s level is half your level or lower, the activation has
a frequency of once per day or more frequent, and you haven’t already used the
activation this round.
SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 6
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Scroll Thaumaturgy
Your esoterica includes scraps of scriptures, magic tomes, druidic markings, and the
like, which you can use to create temporary scrolls. Each day during your daily
preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell
of any tradition. The spell must be common, or you must otherwise have access to
it. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you
make your daily preparations if you haven’t used it by then. It can’t be used to Learn
the Spell.
At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-level spell.
