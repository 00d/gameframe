Enter the Paranormal!
From the fringes the unknown beckons, and the eight lost files of the
Dark Archive arm you to explore, understand, and confront it. Unleash
the untold power of your mind as the new psychic class or leverage
supernatural secrets and mystic implements as the thaumaturge! As
you pore over each casefile, you’ll find paranormal player options
like divine magic wielded by secret cults, eldritch pacts with powerful
entities, and archetypes to skip through time. If you’re a GM, you’ll
find options to turn your creatures into rumored cryptids, new rules for
unexplained powers and mental battles, and more. Each file concludes
with a short adventure to immerse players in the unknown, spanning
every corner of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting!
