TRESPASS TELEPORTATION [reaction]
FEAT 14
CONJURATION
OCCULT
TELEPORTATION
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
Requirements You are benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability.
Trigger The target of your Exploit Vulnerability is within 120
feet and uses a teleportation effect.
You can hunt your foe to the ends of creation. You teleport along
with the enemy, appearing the same direction and distance from
it as you were before it teleported (or the nearest unoccupied
space if your destination is occupied). Any allies affected by
Share Weakness or Ubiquitous Weakness, if you have those
abilities, can spend their reaction to teleport along with the
enemy if they’re within 120 of the enemy and choose to do so.
16TH LEVEL
IMPLEMENT’S FLIGHT
FEAT 16
PRIMAL
THAUMATURGE
TRANSMUTATION
By weakening your relation to the ground and strengthening
your relation to the sky, you’ve learned to soar through the
air, your implement carrying you as surely as any broomstick
or pestle. As long as you’re holding a thaumaturge implement,
you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.
SEVEN-PART LINK
FEAT 16
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Paired Link
Many traditions hold the number seven as significant. By
exchanging pieces of a seven-part set of esoterica, you create
a magical web by which your allies can affect each other at a
distance. When you use Paired Link during your daily preparations,
you can exchange linking esoterica with up to six willing allies,
keeping one piece for yourself. In addition to the normal effects of
Paired Link, if a linked ally casts a spell with a range of touch, they
can target linked allies within 30 feet with that spell.
SEVER MAGIC [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ABJURATION
ARCANE
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You’re holding an implement.
You apply a frayed thread, a pinch of fulu ash, or a similar undone
charm to your weapon, and swing to break a spell. Make a Strike
against an enemy. If you hit and deal damage, you attempt to
counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your
counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and
your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC – 10.
18TH LEVEL
GRAND SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 18
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Elaborate Scroll Esoterica
You’ve completed the third and final step in your assimilation
of scroll esoterica, granting you daily scrolls of incredible
power. In addition to your daily scrolls from Scroll Esoterica
and Elaborate Scroll Esoterica, add a single scroll with a
6th-level spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-level spell.
IMPLEMENT’S ASSAULT [three-actions]
FEAT 18
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You’re holding an implement.
Your implement supercharges your weapon to shoot an impossible
volley or carve through your foes. Make a Strike with your weapon
against each enemy within 30 feet of you. You don’t increase your
multiple attack penalty until after making all the attacks. If your
weapon is a melee weapon and any of the attacks are outside
your reach, you Release the weapon before the Strikes, and it
returns to your grasp after all of them. If your hands are full when
the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
INTENSE IMPLEMENT
FEAT 18
THAUMATURGE
You have an exceptional link to your third implement. You gain
the adept benefit for your third implement.
20TH LEVEL
UBIQUITOUS WEAKNESS
FEAT 20
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Share Weakness
You’ve nurtured your bonds with your comrades, allowing you
to share the benefits of your esoterica. When you use Exploit
Vulnerability and choose mortal weakness, select any number
of allies within 30 feet of you. Their Strikes apply the weakness
from mortal weakness the same way your Strikes do. This benefit
ends when you stop benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability. Since
this effect depends on magically strengthening your bond to
your allies, only allies with whom you’ve developed a rapport
over the course of one or more days gain the benefit.
UNLIMITED DEMESNE
FEAT 20
ARCANE
CONJURATION
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Thaumaturge’s Demesne
You can move your demesne here and there, bringing it wherever
your journey takes you. Your demesne expands to a maximum of
10,000 square feet. Once per day, you can call your demesne forth,
which takes 1 minute. This has the effects of resplendent mansion,
except that it conjures your demesne from its previous location,
with all the benefits of Thaumaturge’s Demesne in addition to the
those of the spell. You must be able to claim the new area, with
the same restrictions as Thaumaturge’s Demesne.
WONDER WORKER
FEAT 20
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites legendary in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
The thaumaturge’s path culminates with the working of wonders.
Once per day, you can align your esoterica to cast a spell of 8th
level or lower that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions to cast. The spell must
be common or one to which you have access. You can choose a
spell of any tradition for which you’re legendary in the associated
skill (Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occultism for occult, or
Religion for divine). Use your thaumaturge class DC in place of any
necessary spell DC and your thaumaturge class DC – 10 in place of
any necessary counteract modifier or spell attack modifier.
