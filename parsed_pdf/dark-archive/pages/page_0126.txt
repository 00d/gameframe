difficult terrain, and each creature in the hall is knocked
prone unless they succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save. The
trap then rolls initiative.
Routine (4 actions) This trap loses 1 action each round for
each wall that has been disabled. Each wall uses 1 action
to slam back and forth rapidly, pummeling one creature in
the hall with a wall Strike. On a hit, the target is additionally
knocked prone. The walls distribute the attacks as evenly
as possible among creatures
in the hall, and the Strikes
don’t apply the trap’s multiple
attack penalty.

EXHALING PORTALHAZARD 9
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 33
Description Magic runes carved
into a doorframe connect a
door to the Plane of Air when
opened, blowing creatures
down the connecting hall.
Disable DC 30 Thievery (expert)
twice to scratch out the runes,
or dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 30) to counteract
the planar runes; DC 32 Athletics to shut the door if it’s
open (using Athletics only stops the trap, it doesn’t fully
disable it)
Gust [reaction] (air, conjuration) Trigger A creature opens the door;
Effect The hall is buffeted by powerful winds for as long
as the door remains open. A creature must succeed at
a DC 32 Athletics check to move toward the door. A
creature who fails at this check is pushed back 5 feet and
falls prone.
Additionally, the triggering creature is blasted by a
powerful gust of wind and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude
save. The trap then rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
Failure The creature is pushed back 10 feet.
Critical Failure The creature is pushed back 10 feet and
knocked prone.
Routine (1 action) The trap uses 1 action to blow powerful
winds down the hall. Each creature in the hall must attempt
a DC 32 Fortitude save with the same results as Gust. If
this forced movement would cause a creature to collide
with a solid object or fall downstairs or out a window, that
creature takes an additional 2d10+11 bludgeoning damage
(or 20 damage due to a fall).
Reset Automatic after the door is shut

Effect The hounds manifest and
bay loudly, dealing 3d10+16
sonic damage to all creatures
within 30 feet of the hounds
(DC 33 basic Fortitude save).
On a failed check, a creature is
additionally frightened 2. The
trap then rolls initiative.
Routine (9 actions) The trap loses
3 actions each round for each
hound disabled. Each hound
uses three actions to Stride
40 feet after creatures in the
room, passing through corporeal
creatures during this movement
if possible. Each creature the
hound moves through during its
movement takes 2d8+7 negative
damage (DC 37 Reflex negates). A creature can only be
damaged by each hound once each round, no matter how
many times the hound moves through their space.
