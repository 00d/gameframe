you were trying to control them and may not recognize your
presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target’s
subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of
carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they
may not remember doing it unless later reminded.
WARD SLUMBER
FEAT 12
ABJURATION
ARCHETYPE
OCCULT
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
Just before going to sleep, you can perform a 10-minute ward
to protect the slumber of up to eight creatures within 30 feet
of you. All creatures affected by the ritual gain a +4 status
bonus on saving throws against nightmare, a night hag’s dream
haunting, or other effects influencing dreams (such as those
provided by this archetype) until your next daily preparations.
They heal double the usual amount of Hit Points from resting.
DREAM LOGIC
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
OCCULT
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
You can transmit a sense of dreamy nonchalance. If you do
something especially strange or dangerous while you’re in
your Daydream Trance, such as entering a restricted area
or fighting someone in the street, any creature that isn’t one
of your allies must attempt a Perception check against your
class or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a success, it realizes
something is amiss, and on a failure, it believes nothing is out
of the ordinary. The creature can attempt a new check if you
start doing something else strange, but not if you continue
on the same course of action it already failed to notice
was peculiar.
Any hostile action by you or your allies against an
affected creature automatically ends the effect for that
creature. The GM might allow the creature a new check if
someone else brings your actions to its attention, such as if
someone you’re attacking calls out for help. When your trance
ends, affected creatures retain their memories of events
but likely still view them as unremarkable; unless they are
prompted to relate the events, they might not report them.
SHARED DREAM
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
You’ve learned to create a shared dreamscape to communicate
with others. You can cast dream council as an innate occult spell.
EVER DREAMING
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
You draw no distinction between the sleeping and waking worlds.
Your Daydream Trance has an unlimited duration, and you no
longer need to take an action to enter it. If you’re unconscious
due to sleep, you don’t take the –4 penalty to AC, Perception,
and Reflex saves, and don’t have the flat-footed condition. You’re
still blinded while asleep. You can act on your turn while asleep,
though you’re slowed 2 until you fully awaken.
SLEEPWALKER FOCUS SPELL
WAKING DREAM
FOCUS 4
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You cloud the target’s mind with vivid, dreamlike imagery, so they
have difficulty distinguishing real threats from imagined ones.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is distracted by the visions and treats all
other creatures as concealed for 1 round, and you can’t
Sustain the Spell to increase the duration.
Failure The target is confused. In addition to the creatures
present, the target might also attack wildly at thin air,
attempting to fend off the dreams. It can attempt a new
save at the end of each of its turns to end the confusion.
Even if the confused effect ends early, the target treats all
other creatures as concealed for 1 round.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target gets no save to end
the effect early.
