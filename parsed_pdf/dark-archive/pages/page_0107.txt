MOMENTARY RECOVERY
SPELL 7
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet
You instantly teleport yourself and any items you’re wearing
or holding from your current space to a clear space within
range that you can see. If this teleportation would bring
another creature with you—even if you’re carrying it in an
extradimensional container—the spell is lost. After you vanish
but before you arrive, you can take up to 2 actions (or the
number of actions you spent to cast momentary recovery,
if it was fewer than 2 actions). You can’t target any other
creatures or objects with anything during these actions and
any effect with a duration that you create during these actions
ends immediately when you arrive. After you arrive, you are
slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.
MOTH’S SUPPER
SPELL 3
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black‑winged
butterflies and huge death’s-head hawkmoths. They flutter
about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance—
fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering
plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then
return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their
secrets into your ears. This has three effects.
•	 You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.
•	 The first time during the duration when someone
successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an
additional 4d4 Hit Points.
•	 You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses
only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.
Heightened (+1) The amount of Hit Points healed every 10
minutes increases by 1d4 and the amount of Hit Points
regained from the first Treat Wounds increases by 2d4.
PHASE BOLT
CANTRIP 1
ATTACK
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that
stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a
ranged spell attack roll against your target’s AC; if the target
has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or
cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success,
you deal 1d4 piercing damage plus your spellcasting ability
modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.
Heightened (+1) The bolt’s damage increases by 1d4.
POLTERGEIST’S FURY
SPELL 6
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Area 20-foot emanation
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Your fury spills over in a telekinetic storm of terrifying
proportions. Any loose, unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less
within range are picked up and begin to orbit you at breathtaking
speeds. All creatures in the area take 6d4 piercing damage with
a basic Reflex save. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
increase the radius of the storm by 10 feet, to a maximum of
100 feet. The storm moves with you and provides you with
lesser cover, though you can’t use this cover to Hide or Sneak.
Allies within the storm who roll a success on their Reflex save
against your poltergeist’s fury get a critical success instead, as
you attempt to avoid hitting them.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
RALLY POINT
SPELL 3
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range touch; Area one 5-foot square
Duration 1 minute
You mark the area touched as a rally point. During the
spell’s duration, you can take a single action, which has the
concentrate trait, to teleport to the rally point along with
items you are wearing or holding. This teleportation fails if the
area is occupied, if the rally point is more than 120 feet away,
or if you try to bring along any other creature, even if it’s in
an extradimensional container. Once you teleport to the rally
point, the spell’s duration ends.
Heightened (7th) You can target up to four other creatures
within 30 feet, in addition to yourself. Each of you can
teleport to the rally point once during the spell’s duration,
by taking a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
The duration no longer ends once you teleport to the rally
point, though you still can’t teleport to the rally point again.
SEA OF THOUGHT
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 15-foot burst
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified
thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult
terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature
starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save
against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a
