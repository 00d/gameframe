Simultaneously blessed and cursed, oracles have
extraordinary power to control their mystery, but the
effort is too much for their bodies—mortals weren’t
meant to hold such power. Thus, using their powers also
curses them, wracking their body with pain, rotting them
from within, or even aging them well beyond their years.
To an oracle, learning to balance the use of their powers
against the strain of using them is integral to their survival
and their well-being. Power always comes at a price.
The following new mystery is available to oracles and
follows the standard rules for oracle mysteries on page 72
of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
TIME
Whether by accident, fate, or purposeful meddling, you
exist slightly outside of time. While initially unmoored by
moments, the countless march of milliseconds builds up to
drift you further and further out of sync with your natural
timeline, often in contradictory directions. You might
view this as a blessing, perhaps as a sign you’re somehow
beyond mortality or you can’t be contained within reality’s
limitations, or you might view it as a cruel curse that causes
your own life to slip by adrift even as you gain power over
time. Many oracles of time are without faith and either
come to rely upon their own instincts to survive or else
turn to strange rituals and forbidden magic in an attempt
to break free of time’s grasp. Those oracles who worship
deities most often worship Pharasma, goddess of fate who
sees all possible futures for all who ever lived, or Alseta,
goddess of transitions and the passage through time.
Mystery Benefit Time passes more swiftly for you than it does
for those around you, enabling you to cover more distance
in what others perceive as the same amount of time. You
gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. At 6th level,
this increases to a +15-foot status bonus; at 10th level, this
increases to a +20-foot status bonus; at 14th level, this
increases to a +25-foot status bonus; and at 18th level,
it increases to a +30-foot status bonus. Your disjointed
movement makes it harder for creatures to hit you as you
move. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks
made against you from reactions or free actions while
you’re moving.
TIME (ORACLE MYSTERY)
Oracles are gifted spellcasters as mysterious as the powers they harness. Although they wield divine magic, their powers
aren’t achieved through worship, but by tapping into a power greater than any one deity. Nothing is more mysterious
than causality, no river stranger than time, so it’s no surprise that some oracles come to access the incomprehensible,
absolute power that keeps all of creation moving from undeniable beginning to inevitable end.
