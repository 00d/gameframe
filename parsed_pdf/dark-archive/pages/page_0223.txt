skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill.

a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill

subjective gravity (trait) On planes with this trait, all bodies
of mass can be centers of gravity with the same amount of

summoned (trait) A creature called by a spell or effect gains the
summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other
creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a
cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or
higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the
summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon
spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the
standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks
your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate
with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines
the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the
summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn
or other creature generated from a summoned creature
returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of
spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear
what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned
creatures can be banished by various spells and effects.
They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points
or if the spell that called them ends.
