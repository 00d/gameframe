ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with,
you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4
levels thereafter.
CLARITY OF FOCUS

Your deepening connection to your mind grants you
more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of
Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn’t
change the number of Focus Points you regain when you
Refocus. As normal, this ability can’t increase the size of
your focus pool above 3 points.

slightly before they occur. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
EXPERT SPELLCASTER

yourself and, with it, psychic power. Your proficiency ranks
for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.

image of yourself. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to expert.

danger is near. Your proficiency rank for Perception
increases to expert.
