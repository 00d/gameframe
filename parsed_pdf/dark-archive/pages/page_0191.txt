Adventure Background
In the city-state of Goka, a restaurant boat named the
Golden Fortune has exhibited strange behavior. People
who visit the restaurant leave and can’t remember what
happened. Those same people seem robbed of their
ambitions and hopes afterward.
This is the restaurant’s third relaunch, and owner Rui
Longlai was getting desperate, so he incorporated some
unconventional and risky elements to the standard business
opening rituals hoping to draw influential customers who
would spread word of his business. Right before opening,
Rui cast a ritual to summon a morrowkin, which he thought
would nudge potential customers’ futures to lead them to
the Golden Fortune. Unfortunately, the creature drains
the potential future from his customers instead. The other
ritual he performed was a unique ceremony to summon an
artifact called the Knife of Trouble Elimination. The knife
was meant to let a person repeat a moment from their past
until they could find the source of their problems and cut
it out of their life.
The knife activated on its own when the morrowkin
first appeared, creating a loop of time in which someone
could figure out how to stop the morrowkin. The knife
can only give any group of people a limited number of
tries, however. The PCs investigating will need to fight the
morrowkin several times as they gather clues about how to
finally beat it and return time to normal.
Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge created by the Dark Archive
folio deposits the PCs on a riverside dock near the Balance
Bridge in Goka, the greatest metropolis in Tian Xia.
Goka’s docks buzz with busy energy as the sun sets. People load
and unburden their ships with haste in preparation of trade.
Eventually, the anomaly becomes clear. An extravagant
restaurant boat, the words Golden Fortune inscribed on its
red‑lacquered hull between two carved windows in the shape of
peonies, flickers erratically within a strange field of abjuration
magic, likely an Archive containment protocol of some kind to
ward off passers-by. Though fishers and dockworkers pass by
the Golden Fortune, not seeming to even notice the ship, some
people are disembarking, clearly unsteady and disoriented as
they cross through back onto the dock.
TOMORROW’S FEAST
The Golden Fortune
Golden Fortune case reported in Goka is one that’s caught my eye for some time, though I confess not for the most
unbiased of reasons—it’s been far too long since I visited my father’s hometown, and I’m sure my uncles would appreciate a
visit. Nevertheless, our archivists detected signs of a strange anomaly around one of its many restaurant boats: a stuttering
region that swallows people and spits them out later, stumbling and disoriented. — K.H.W.
