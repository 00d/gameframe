ILLUSION
Domain darkness (apocryphal)
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 3 rounds
You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak
the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in
darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes invisible, but only to its allies.
Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally.
Effects such as see invisibility enable an ally to see the
target. The target’s allies still know the target is present and
can still see all the effects of the target’s actions.
Failure As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to
its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
INEVITABLE DESTINATION

CONJURATION
Domain travel (apocryphal)
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets you and 1 enemy
Duration 2 rounds
You twist the paths of the target, ensuring that each one leads
to you. The target attempts a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The spell has no effect.
Success Your pull hampers the target’s footsteps. It takes a
–10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end
of its next turn.
Failure The target can’t move any farther from you than it
was when you Cast the Spell, though it can move in such a
way that it maintains an equal distance. If you move farther
away from the target than the initial distance, the spell
ends. The targeted foe can attempt to Escape against your
spell DC. If it succeeds, the spell ends.
Critical Success As failure, plus the target is pulled 10 feet closer
to you and falls prone, tripping in its haste to move toward you.
PURIFYING VEIL
FOCUS 4

CLERIC
EVOCATION
GOOD
WATER
Domain water (apocryphal)
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 Large or smaller creature
Duration 1 minute
Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a
veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil
surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is
concealed from creatures on the opposite side, but the water
doesn’t impede attacks or movement across the veil. If the
target moves through the veil, it takes 4d6 good damage with
a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.
Heightened (+1) The good damage increases by 1d6.

MISFORTUNE
Domain confidence (apocryphal)
Cast [reaction] verbal
Trigger An enemy within 30 feet of you critically fails an
attack roll, Perception check, or skill check.
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You mock the target for all its failings, twisting its self-
confidence into doubt. The enemy attempts a Will saving throw.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target is briefly shaken and unsure of its abilities.
It must roll twice and take the worse result on the next
roll of the same type as the critical failure that triggered
the spell (such as the target’s next Acrobatics check if the
spell’s trigger was a critical failure on an Acrobatics check).
If the target doesn’t attempt any qualifying checks, the
spell ends at the end of the target’s next turn.

FORTUNE
Domain fate (apocryphal)
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range 60 feet; Targets you and 1 ally
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You bond yourself to a cherished friend, vowing to share their
fate for good or for ill. Whenever an effect would require both
you and the target to attempt a saving throw, if one of you
succeeds at your saving throw and the other critically fails,
you can choose to both fail instead. You and the ally must
agree to fail; otherwise, use your normal save results instead.
VICTORY CRY
FOCUS 1
RARE
CLERIC
EVOCATION
SONIC
Domain might (apocryphal)
Cast [reaction] verbal; Trigger An ally within range critically succeeds
at a melee Strike.
Range 30 feet; Targets the triggering ally
Your true might comes from your bonds with your allies, and
you glory in their achievements. The weapon used to make
the Strike deals an additional 1d6 sonic damage (not doubled
due to the critical hit), and the ally can immediately attempt
to Shove the creature struck, even if the ally’s hands are full.
Your ally can use its item bonus to the triggering attack roll on
the Athletics check, if any, and it gains a +1 status bonus to the
Athletics check if the triggering Strike was with a weapon that
has the trip trait or an unarmed attack that has the trip trait.
Heightened (+2) The sonic damage increases by 1d6.
