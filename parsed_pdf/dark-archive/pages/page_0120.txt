Methods of their creation vary, but all reflections are
duplicates of someone else existing in the world. Some are
drawn out from literal mirrors, developing a life of their
own once set free from the Echoing Pale. Mirror-focused
rituals or spells can create independent reflections,
whether deliberately or accidentally, as can the magical
hazard known as a darkside mirror, which replaces those
looking into it with malicious duplicates. Some reflections
are created as magical clones by spellcasters, only to turn
on their creators or be left adrift, while others arise from
polymorph magic gone wrong.
If you want a character who seeks to forge their own
identity in the face of their duplicate nature, with a strong
tie to another character somewhere out there in the world,
you should play a reflection.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Feel as though you’re just an out-of-place imitation.
•	 Want to keep your nature a secret from everyone
except trusted companions.
•	 Be extremely dedicated to your friends or anyone
who gives you a sense of community.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Don’t realize your true nature as a copy.
•	 Expect you to be plotting a nefarious fate for your
progenitor.
•	 Are wary of or intrigued by your unusual abilities.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
A reflection’s physical appearance almost exactly matches
their progenitor’s. In mirror-risen reflections, their
appearance is reversed, so details such as scars are on
the opposite side. Other reflections often have a swirled
mark somewhere on their bodies, appearing as a tattoo or
birthmark. Reflections are typically indistinguishable from
a regular member of that ancestry.
SOCIETY
As duplicates of others, and ones that appear only in rare
circumstances, reflections have no inherent society of
their own. Many reflections have a degree of existential
angst, struggling to find somewhere they feel they belong
and won’t be identified as a “fake.” A reflection’s greatest
(though not necessarily best) bond is usually to their
progenitor. Progenitors and their reflections are sometimes
aware of each other, with some progenitors taking their
reflection under their wing, which often grants the
reflection a greater sense of community.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Despite the tales, not all reflections are malevolent.
Reflections formed from darkside mirrors are always evil, but
others usually have either the alignment of their progenitor
or the exact opposite one—many good-aligned reflections
arise from the nefarious experiments of an evil alchemist or
spellcaster. Most reflections are wary of religion, but those
who adhere to a faith are typically extremely devout.
REFLECTION (VERSATILE HERITAGE)
Stories of malevolent duplicates are commonly told around campfires to frighten companions. In these tales, the
duplicate forms after a botched ritual or exposure to a mysterious artifact, and is bent on replacing the creature they’ve
replicated. Most believe such stories to be only that, but such reflection duplicates are real. While some wish to replace
their progenitors, others merely want to forge a new life for themselves where no one knows of their origins.
