Adventure Background
Due east of Port Ice and off the shrouded shore of the
Lake of Mists and Veils, the town of Birchfrost weathers
the gales of late autumn and the seasons of political favor.
As a settlement that thrives off furs the trappers bring in
and the wealth of local fishers, Birchfrost’s independence
is hardened against outside influence. However, this
bounty depends on managing the local ecosystem.
Without beavers to skin or whitefish to eat, Birchfrost
would fall to the demands of Brevoy’s unsteady rule.
While generational knowledge provides a guide on how
many snares to put out or nets to place, the land also
supplies a protector.
The Birchfrost Beast, as this protector is known, guards
against greed. Local legend says the Birchfrost Beast
appeared a few decades ago when a man came to town
seeking fortune. He ignored the warnings of the town’s
residents to limit his fishing only to what he needed for
subsistence, instead casting out dozens of nets. In a single
season, he brought in a catch equivalent to what an entire
family would bring in over a decade. As he enriched his
purse by packing the catch in caravans and selling it far
away from the shore, the rest of the town grew angry. The
town knew he would leave with his boats once the lake
was empty and the forests bare. Those remaining in town
after his departure would be left destitute and starving.
As the town prepared to ensure they wouldn’t be starved
of a future, he disappeared. Rumors abounded: one of the
trappers killed the man and hid his body in the woods, the
man fled in fear of such a plot, or he fell victim to a hex
brought about by his own heedless greed. Seasons passed
and the man’s story faded to a cautionary tale, until the day
his campsite was found a hundred paces off a well‑known
path, torn apart by some clawed creature. Not long after
the discovery, an unknown beast tore the snares from a
poacher’s trap. The matching claw marks at both sites led
to a rumor spreading that the town’s “guardian beast” was
responsible for the incidents.
Those who live in the town have mixed feelings about
the creature, some fearful and some grateful. The stories
of the Birchfrost Beast seem to keep the creature living,
as the power of years of belief transformed it from
a territorial giant boar into legend itself. As the tales
grow taller with each telling, so does the actual beast.
THE BEAST OF BIRCHFROST
Strange creatures seem to come up most often at the fringes of society, where they can easily fade into the background.
The town of Birchfrost, off the Lake of Mists and Veils, has a legend of a local creature, once responsible for protecting the
town. If there is anything more to this so-called “Beast of Birchfrost,” I am sure that the slightest change in circumstance
might herald a dangerous change in the Beast, one the Archive would do well to mind. — K.H.W.
