Studies into the metaphysical nature of mindscapes suggest
they nearly always grow in the Astral Plane. Account 87
from Archivist Kanvarati details sightings witnessed
during a ritual of astral projection: blob-like structures
with hazy edges coursing within the Silver Sea, seemingly
at their own speed. Details are light, due to distance, the
altered state imposed by the ritual, and the fact that they
are sensed partially with the mind rather than the eyes.
Kanvarati likens them to bubbles rushing past in a stream,
bursting when they expire.
You’ll notice obvious comparisons to the dreamscapes
that crop up within the Dreamlands; indeed, Archivists
Ralt and Harachi are forever bickering about whether
mundane dreams can be called a form of “naturally
occurring mindscapes.” The primary differences appear
to be the far smaller number of mindscapes and the
more deliberate nature of their creation. (Though as the
Tenemor event demonstrated, they can spring up without
conscious effort from an architect possessed of sufficient
psychic power and emotional conflict.) Anyone can dream,
but few can form mindscapes, much like anyone can bang
out a beat on a table, but few can write a symphony.
INSIDE THE MINDSCAPE
External structures tell a small part of the story—the true
experience of a mindscape is within it.
LANDS OF THOUGHT
AND IMAGINATION
Mindscapes, Mental Realms,
and the World of Dreams
It’s with some unease we plumb the powers of the mind. The common senses have
served us over years of observing and cataloging the external world, but accessing
the internal senses doesn’t come as naturally. They’re subjective, inconsistent. It’s
clear the potential of mentalism is vast—possibly limitless—though we can’t say for sure. Mindscapes, as
the name suggests, mimic an environment but spring from the power of a mind rather than the machines
of nature. They can seem as vast as a house, a town, even a forest. They can have incredible fidelity or be
as plain as a plank of wood.
