Experimental Cryptids
An experimental cryptid has been purposefully altered
through alchemy, engineering, magic, or ritual to
contain some degree of construct components. Although
powerful, the process is volatile and imperfect.
EXPERIMENTAL CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into an experimental
cryptid by completing the following steps. Increase the
creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small
number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the amount listed on
the table.

Experimental Cryptid Abilities
An experimental cryptid gains the experiment trait
and, depending on the type of construct parts, might
gain the alchemical trait, clockwork trait, or another
construct‑related trait as appropriate. An experimental
cryptid gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Augmented An experimental cryptid is partially artificial and
designed in a way to specifically prevent biological afflictions
and instant death. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saving
throws against death effects, disease, and poison.
Operational Flaw An experimental cryptid has a flaw in its
construction that can be identified with a successful
Perception check to Seek against the hard DC of the
creature’s level. An experimental cryptid has weakness
equal to its level to the attacks of any creature that has
successfully located the experiment’s operational flaw.
Clobber [two-actions] The experimental cryptid Strikes a creature. On a
hit, the creature is pushed 5 feet (10 feet on a critical hit) and
knocked prone. If this causes the creature to collide with a
solid object, the creature takes an additional 1d10 damage. If
the experimental cryptid is at least 5th level, this Strike deals
one additional weapon damage die of damage, and if the
experimental cryptid is at least 15th level, this Strike deals
two additional weapon damage dice of damage.
Energy Wave [two-actions] The experimental cryptid unleashes a
30‑foot line of energy of a type specific to the experimental
cryptid (typically electricity or fire). Creatures in the area
take 1d6 damage per level of the cryptid with a basic Reflex
save. The experimental cryptid can use this ability once
every 1d4 rounds. This action has the damage type’s
trait. If the experiments that reshaped the
creature were magical, this action also has
the evocation trait and the trait matching
the magical tradition of the experiments
(arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
Power Surge [one-action] The experimental
cryptid draws on its augmentations
to empower its attacks. It attempts
a DC 5 flat check. On a success,
the experimental cryptid deals 1d6
additional damage with its Strikes
until the end of its turn. On a failure,
the experimental cryptid takes that much
damage instead. The damage and traits for
Power Surge are the same as those of Energy Wave.
This additional damage increases to 2d6 if the
experimental cryptid is 9th level or higher, 3d6
if the experimental cryptid is 15th level or
higher, and 4d6 if the experimental cryptid is
18th level or higher.
CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
They resemble the familiar creatures common to the world, but are always just a bit off. The following sets of adjustments
can make ordinary creatures suited to be cryptids.
