bathroom to retrieve their weapons and arms, at which
point they run into Bahvan and—a beat later—Jaynt.
“The Helping Hand has no wish to harm any of
you,” Bahvan says. We only want your help—
Vir is not the kind of person you think she is!
Give us two minutes to explain, and we could
end up saving a life tonight, and many more
tomorrow.” Kevel the bartender and two valets
creep in from the sides, looking apprehensive
about the possibility of a skirmish.
Proceed to the Helping Plot below.
THE HELPING PLOT
If the PCs earn the trust of the Helping Hand
or confront them, Bahvan explains they are
members of a network of Absalom servants
and workers that protect each other from
the aristocracy. They’ve been investigating
people going missing at gatherings. Jaynt
found a seamstress friend named Paroma in a
basement with no memory of the past fortnight. Others
never returned, so they’ve planned a rescue. Jaynt takes out
a note, which says, “At performance’s peak, pass through
curtains behind curtains behind curtains when you wish to
meet.” The PCs might be able deduce what this means; if
not, give them a DC 22 Perception or DC 16 Performance
check to realize it refers to a curtain backstage, behind
the curtains that divide the main stage from the hall and
those from backstage. The NPCs can also come to the same
conclusion. If the PCs have questions, use the information
from the Adventure Background to fill in details.
Joining the Helping Hand: Assuming this convinces the
PCs, Bahvan tells them to prepare for a fight. Jaynt inverts
her gloves, exposing the symbol, and taps the back of her
hand to PCs who accept the solidarity gesture. “Tonight,
you’re one of us!” she says. Continue to Act III.
Opposing the Helping Hand: Alternatively, the PCs
might insist on fighting. Kevel, Jaynt, and Bahvan would
rather save their strength, but if believe the PCs intend to
sell them out to Vir, they attack.

This ends the adventure. Vir offers each PC 50 gp. The
city arrests the Helping Hand. Vir is alone, and simply says
a deal was made. Mechna and Erat are gone.
ACT III
SEVERE 5
By this point, the group has likely realized what they are
looking for is behind the stage, accessible by the hallways
leading to the staircases down into the back of the
house. A guard sympathetic to the Helping Hand
provides the group with a key to the
backstage area.
On entering, the PCs see shadows
that are unnaturally long. On the east
wall, a spare curtain reflects no light
and flutters despite lack of wind. A
PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Arcana,
Nature, Occultism, or Religion check to
Identify Magic realizes the curtain functions
as a portal. If the PCs pass through the portal,
they are met with a mysterious fetchling agent.
Read or paraphrase the following.
A woman wearing a shadowy mask and a
dark cloak flecked with starlight slinks from
the darkness. Despite being barely louder than
a whisper, her voice echoes. “Where is Vir Zhees?
Don’t tell me you’re sent to tell me that she’s not planning to
hand over the merchandise? Or perhaps…” The woman grins
viciously, revealing rows of too-sharp teeth. “Perhaps you are
the merchandise? A bit heartier than my usual fare, but you’ll
do. Come quietly, and my servants will allow you to live.”
Unless the PCs surrender immediately, the fetchling
agent chuckles. “Pity. We’ll make use of their corpses then.
Kill them all.” She vanishes into shadow, and at the same
time, the portal vanishes, leaving the PCs trapped in a
shadowy version of the Fullbloom Opera House’s main
stage. Seven fetchling agents in dark robes, each wearing
masks evoking trees made of twisting shadows, drop down
from above the stage, silent as twilight.

Conclusion
With the agents defeated, the PCs can search for a way
home. A PC can re-open the portal from this side in 10
minutes with a successful trained DC 20 Arcana or
Religion check. Otherwise, after an hour, Jaynt manages to
reactivate the portal from the opera-house side.
Jaynt pens a missive to both Jostlin Ferqyr and Brythen
Blood about their representatives’ scheme and exposes
Vir’s meeting during the Encore. Vir, Mechna and Erat are
arrested by the authorities. Jaynt leaves the PCs with her
opera glove, itself embroidered with the Helping Hand
sigil, with a note written in ink up the arm that says,
“Reach out if you require a Helping Hand.”
