Amp You create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses. The
duration increases to sustained up to 1 minute. The shield still lowers at the start
of each of your turns, but you can raise it again when you Sustain the Spell.
When you Shield Block with this spell, one of the three layers breaks and you
cease to gain the bonus to AC, but the spell doesn’t end. You can keep using the spell
until the final layer breaks; once it does, the spell ends and you can’t cast shield or
amped shield again for 10 minutes. You can choose to break additional layers when
you Shield Block with this spell to improve your defenses. If you break two layers
instead of one, increase the Hardness to 1-1/2 × the normal amount (7 at 1st level, 15
at 3rd level, 22 at 5th level, 30 at 7th level, and 37 at 9th level). If you break all three
layers, increase the Hardness to double the normal amount.

Range 60 feet; Area 1 cube 20 feet on each side
Duration 1 minute
You weave light into a cube of vivid and fantastic patterns. The walls shed bright light
for 10 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and completely block line of sight;
creatures within the cage can’t be seen by creatures outside of it, though they can
see each other, and creatures outside of it can’t see into it. You can Dismiss
the spell, and if you Cast the Spell again, your previous hologram cage ends.
Heightened (7th) The range of the spell increases to 80 feet, and you can
expand the cube to be 25 feet on each side.
Amp Force walls make the cage’s barrier physical as well as visual. Each
10-foot-by-10-foot section of the cage’s wall has AC 10, Hardness
equal to double the spell’s level, and HP equal to quadruple the
spell’s level. The spell is disrupted if any of its walls would pass
through a creature when you cast it.
