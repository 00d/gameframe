SPELL AND ITEM LISTS
As spells and items are located throughout the various sections of this book, the following pages present a list of spells
and items in the book, organized by level. The spell or item’s rarity is also listed, as is its page number.
Spell Lists
A superscript “H” indicates a spell has extra effects
when heightened, and a spell with a rarity greater than
common has a superscript with the first letter of that
rarity. An abbreviation in parentheses indicates the spell’s
school. Each spell is followed by the page number where
