Message
Your message is not so easily bound by obstacles. The
spell can travel up to 120 feet to reach the target, bending
around walls and obstacles; this means you don’t need
a straight line of effect or line of sight to cast message
as long as you know the target’s space and there is an
unblocked path of 120 feet or less that can reach them. It
also gains the following amp.
Amp Your telepathic message allows you to coordinate your
actions while you pass on information. The target of the
message can immediately spend its reaction to Step or Stride.
Amp Heightened (4th) The target of the message can choose to
Shove, Strike, or Trip with its reaction instead.
FORBIDDEN THOUGHT
CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will
You place a psychic lock in a foe’s mind that prevents it from a
specific action. Choose “Strike,” “Stride,” “Cast a Spell,” or a specific
action you know the creature to have (such as “Breath Weapon”
against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next
turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 1d6
mental damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier (with a basic
Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
Amp Your telepathic push is particularly shocking to those who
resist it. If the target fails its save, it’s also stunned 1.
SHATTER MIND
CANTRIP 3
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 15-foot cone
Saving Throw basic Will
You telepathically assail the minds of your foes. You deal
mental damage equal to 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier to all enemies in the area, with a basic Will save.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
Amp You increase the area of the spell to your choice of a
30-foot cone or 60-foot cone, and the damage dice for the
spell change to d10s. Creatures that fail are stupefied 1 until
the start of your next turn (or stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
CONTAGIOUS IDEA
CANTRIP 5
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet (see text); Targets 1 or 2 creatures other than
yourself (see text)
Nothing is so contagious as a thought. You place either a
pleasant thought or a terrifying one in a creature’s mind. You
can then plant the same thought in a second creature’s mind.
You can’t choose a creature that’s already been a target of this
casting of contagious idea, nor can you choose yourself. The
second target can be beyond the range of the spell, but it must
be within 30 feet of the first target.
•	 Pleasant Thought The target is soothed, gaining 5
temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute.
•	 Terrifying Thought The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and is temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is frightened 1 and is then temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Failure The target becomes frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target becomes frightened 3.
Heightened (+1) The temporary Hit Points for a pleasant thought
increase by 1.
Amp You can choose to spread the thought from the second
target to a third target, in the same manner as spreading
it from the first target to the second. A pleasant thought
grants twice as many temporary Hit Points (10, plus an
additional 2 for each level heightened).
THE TANGIBLE DREAM
You pull colors and shapes from the depth of your
mind, projecting impossible creations into the world as
tapestries of astral thread or sculptures of force and light.
Granted Spells 1st: color spray; 2nd: mirror image; 3rd: sea
of thought (page 106); 4th: resilient sphere; 5th: etheric
shards (page 105); 6th: blade barrier; 7th: project image; 8th:
scintillating pattern; 9th: prismatic sphere
Standard Psi Cantrips dancing lights and shield
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: imaginary weapon; deeper: astral
rain; deepest: hologram cage
Dancing Lights
Your dancing lights can float wherever you like. After
creating the lights, they can move more than 10 feet from the
other lights, and more than 120 feet from you. Your dancing
lights also gain the following amp.
Amp Your lights whirl together, dazzlingly and hypnotically.
When you amp the spell, you create a flashing display
comprised of all four lights in an unoccupied 5-foot square.
If you move the lights when you Sustain the Spell, the lights
must remain together. The spell gains the visual trait. Each
creature in a 5-foot emanation around the lights when you
Cast the Spell must attempt a Fortitude save.
Success The creature is dazzled until the start of your next
turn and then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Failure The creature is dazzled until the start of your next
turn and must attempt a new save against the spell
whenever it starts its turn adjacent to the lights.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is also fascinated
by the lights until the start of your next turn.
Shield
Your shield spell can be deployed on behalf of others.
When you cast shield, you can choose a target ally within
30 feet to gain the benefits of the spell instead of you. The
option to Shield Block with the spell is up to you and uses
your reaction, not the target’s. Your shield also gains the
following amp.
