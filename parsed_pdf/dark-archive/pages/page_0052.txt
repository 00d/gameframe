Campaign Background­—
for GMs only
The casefiles in this section each introduce setting
information on a different paranormal topic, then present
a variety of player and GM options to bring that
topic to life at the table, whether it’s an
archetype that lets players command
temporal magic or new space-bending
hazards for GMs to use in spooky
mansions. Each casefile concludes
with a short mini-adventure that will
make your players directly confront the
paranormal topic discussed in that file,
from a mysterious beast stalking the forests
to the aftereffects of a strange demonic
artifact. Each mini-adventure can
be completed in one or two
sessions, and they proceed from
lower-level adventures to higher-level ones.
TABLE 4: STOLEN CASEFILE ADVENTURES
The adventures and the player level they are designed for

A number of single-page incident reports are also
interspersed between the main casefiles, each describing
a paranormal event logged by a different member of the
Dark Archive, as well as a rules option to bring it to life at
your game table.
USING THE CASEFILES IN YOUR CAMPAIGN
If your group is interested in playing through the
adventure contained in this book, then ensure your PCs
come across the Dark Archive folio—a small, unassuming
bound book of notes and reports—within the game world,
sometime before they reach 4th level to ensure they’ve
been introduced to the story before the first adventure.
THE STOLEN CASEFILES
The Last Mysteries of the Lone Archivist
Cryptids. Secret societies. Deviant abilities. Mirror duplicates. Cults. Curses and pacts.
Temporal anomalies. Mindscapes. Each topic presenting enough questions to fill a library,
and each a mystery I was unable to solve. I know there must be something more behind them.

—K.H.W.
How your PCs initially come into possession of the Dark
Archive folio is up to you. Perhaps it’s buried in the back
of the local tavern, left behind by a mysterious traveler
who passed through. Maybe your PCs find it in their
adventures through a lost library or Pathfinder
warehouse, collecting dust but calling out.
The eight mysteries span the entire planet of
Golarion. While the Dark Archive’s agents
were no strangers to global transit, the Lone
Archivist took this a step further, creating
a secret system to enable later agents to
return to the site of his open casefiles,
using a form of teleportation known
as the somnambulist’s bridge. When
the bridge becomes active, usually due
to an alarm, beacon, or similar signal
being triggered from the site of the casefile, the
Dark Archive folio will flip open to the relevant
location and the pages will glow with a hypnotic light.
Viewers who gaze at the open book will find themselves
growing drowsier and drowsier before finally falling asleep,
during which they feel the sensation of floating gently
through a dark void. When they awaken, they are at the
adventure’s location and can begin their daily preparation as
if they had slept a full night, then proceed on the adventure.
The somnambulist’s bridge can be traversed only once to
the destination and once back, after which point the folio
closes the casefile, the mystery resolved.
Because these mini-adventures span only a single, short
incident each, they intentionally do not reward players
all of the Experience Points or treasure that they would
normally receive in a full level of play. You can intersperse
these casefiles between the main campaign of your players,
with the folio opening to the next casefile at any point
when the players are an appropriate level to take it on,
or you can use the content of the casefile (or the content
of an incident report) as a springboard to come up with
your own paranormal home campaign. For instance, after
finishing the cryptid-themed Beast of Birchfrost adventure,
the PCs might find other cryptids in nearby towns and
continue cataloging them until they are of the appropriate
level to take on the next adventure, Shaking the Helping
Hand. If you prefer to play through the adventure as a
single campaign, you can also simply level your PCs up
to the appropriate level whenever they clear a casefile—
whatever approach best fits your group!
