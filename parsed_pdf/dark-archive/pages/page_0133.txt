Painting: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception
check notices Lady of the Harvest hanging next to the
mirror, then the painting blinks out of existence.
Creatures: A number of workers died during the
construction of the House of Mirrors, their tragic fate
fueled by the dark forces at work in the manor. A number
of poor souls never escaped the Material Plane, doomed
to haunt the house that killed them. One of these former
workers is now a fearsome undead called a bodak, which
arise from souls lost to harrowing supernatural evils—
for a PC who can identify the bodak, this is an ill omen
indeed about the nature of the manor and the curse within.
The other poor soul has risen as a particularly strong
poltergeist, unable to leave the place they died, filled with
rage at the living. Ending the curse upon the mansion frees
the poltergeist, but the bodak is too far gone.

Clue: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception check
notices a smear of blood across the edge of the tub.
Hazard: During the construction, workers were killed
in a freak accident involving a scaffolding collapse as they
were painting the high ceiling. These workers have since
risen as a ghostly choir that haunts this room.

B4. GUEST BEDROOM
MODERATE 7
This room’s furnishings aren’t as elegant as those in the
master bedroom, and the water closet (area B4b) contains
only a tub and sink, with no lavatory.
Creatures: In the early days of the manor’s abandonment,
the rumors of the curse were just that, unconfirmed
and under some doubt by the more brash of the town’s
inhabitants. Three young adults broke into the mansion
shortly after Lorres left it to rot—and they never left.
Doomed to haunt the house they entered as a dare, the
three have risen as poltergeists, their powers bolstered by
the manor’s dark energies. They’re set free if the curse upon
the mansion is ended.

B5. STUDY
This mildewed study features a gorgeous mahogany desk with
a few sparse furnishings. Heavy maroon curtains block out
most light from the lone window.
Painting: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception
check notices Lady of the Harvest hanging next to the
desk, and the painting blinks out of existence.
Keys: The keys to the servant access staircases lie on
the corner of the mahogany desk, which provide a less
hazardous way for the PCs to get back down to the ground
floor. The keys open all four doors from either side.
B6. SOLARIUM
MODERATE 7
The wall-to-wall windows, panes separated by delicate lines of
lead, mark this wide room as a solarium. Numerous gardening
pots fill this room, though they now contain only dry, cracked
dirt. A writing desk sits in one corner while a few chairs and
small tables are arranged in the room’s center. Despite the layer
of weathering on the glass, the room still glows in the daylight.
Creatures: This bright, abandoned space has drawn the
attention of three powerful lurkers in light, fey creatures
that lair here during the day and wreak mischief at night.
The fey work cooperatively, using tactics such as flanking
to bring down the PCs together and to best take advantage
of their sneak attacks.

SEVERE 7
Though Lorres Manor appears much grander than the standard
style in Ravengro, this room puts the rest of the house to
DISCOVERING THE DOUBLE EARLY
If your players are perceptive, or if the player who
has been replaced by the double is unsubtle, the
party might discover early that they’re traveling with
an impostor. In this case, Ogkrix drops his disguise
and attacks the party. This also occurs if the impostor
PC “dies,” causing the illusion to shatter and Ogkrix to
appear in his true form at full HP, as described in area
B7. Since the painting won’t have yet spat out the PC
it consumed and whose place Ogkrix took, provide
the PC who was replaced with the statistics for a
blood painter with the weak adjustment (Bestiary
6), and have them play as Ogkrix, weakened from
his obsession with finding the painting and his
devastation at being discovered. This also balances
the encounter so the PCs aren’t punished for finding
the blood painter with a difficult encounter when
they’re already down one member.
