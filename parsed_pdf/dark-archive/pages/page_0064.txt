HOAX-HUNTER’S KIT
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
Price 50 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wooden box unfolds into a stack of hinged trays holding
calipers, magnifying lenses, acids and reagents, comparison
sketches of species commonly mistaken for one another, and
glass slides for specimen testing. When you use this kit to
study accounts of a creature or what it left behind (such as
spoor, tracks, or fur samples), you gain a +1 item bonus to
Recall Knowledge about the creature or to Track the creature.
In addition, if you fail to Recall Knowledge about the creature
(but don’t critically fail), you’re able to eliminate at least one
possibility of a common type of animal. For instance, you
might be able to verify the creature isn’t an owlbear, even if
you get no further information.
OLD TILLIMAQUIN
ITEM 12
UNIQUE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Price 2,000 gp
Bulk 3
This beloved tavern mascot is a shabby old stuffed beast
mounted on an immense slab of ironwood. The beast is
roughly the size and shape of a wolverine but with a broader
snout, blue stripes along its upper legs and bristled back,
and a club of spiked bone at the end of its long tail. No one
can recall where Old Tillimaquin originally came from, how
the taxidermic beast came to stand in its tavern, or even
whether it’s a genuine article. The tradition of rubbing its
bronzed claws for good luck has been observed for so long
that the front claws are worn to stubs. Local belief holds that
as long as Old Tillimaquin stands, neither fire nor flood will
claim its town.
Activate Interact (divination, fortune, occult); Frequency once
per month; Effect You rub Old Tillimaquin’s bronzed claws
for good luck before setting out on a task that might benefit
the town. You can reroll a single failed saving throw within
the next 24 hours, but you must take the second result,
even if it’s worse than your original result. Each person
who rubs the claws can benefit only once per month,
but there’s no limit to how many people can draw on Old
Tillimaquin’s luck.
SAMPLING AMMUNITION
ITEM 5
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Price 22 gp
Ammunition arrow, bolt
The head of this arrow or bolt is a pointed glass cylinder with
a hollow core. Upon hitting a corporeal creature, sampling
ammunition captures a small portion of the target’s skin, blood,
and flesh. The sample falls to the ground below wherever the
creature was hit. This sample is sealed and magically preserved
inside its chamber, although it deteriorates normally once
the cylinder is opened. Sampling ammunition can’t
collect samples from creatures made entirely of
metal, stone, or other hard substances.
CRYPTID SIDE EFFECTS
The following side effects are appropriate for a
baleblood draft or other items made from cryptids.
•	 Your shadow appears to be that of a monstrous,
winged fiend. It sometimes claws and clutches at
nearby creatures, even when you don’t move.
•	 Light breezes die in your presence, and weather vanes
within 50 feet turn slowly to point in your direction,
creaking gloomily as they twist.
•	 Every time you cross the threshold of a sanctified
place, you hear a phantom crash of thunder and are
struck by a visible web of ghostly electricity, which
causes no real damage but forces you to flinch.
•	 Your reflection appears as a pallid, skeletal version
of yourself with distended fangs and sunken eyes.
Any drawing or depiction of you made during this
time transforms, over the course of an hour, into the
same appearance.
•	 From dusk till dawn, wet blood wells up from the
ground to fill your footsteps. Attempts to track you
during this period gain a +4 circumstance bonus.
•	 Food and drink lose all their color after 24 hours in
your possession, becoming monochrome black and
white. This doesn’t affect the edibility of your supplies.
•	 Your voice rises to a high, vibrating chorus of whispers
that seems to contain at least five different voices
speaking in unison. Your breath reeks of sulfur, and
in cold air, the clouds you exhale are yellow rather
than white.
•	 Your skin becomes disconcertingly clammy and anyone
who touches you feels a brief, tingling numbness as
though they had encountered a mild contact poison.
You leave behind distinct fingerprints on every surface
you touch, even those that shouldn’t normally hold
fingerprints—but the prints aren’t your own.
