The Echo opens with his Spindle’s Web ability, which
he uses as often as he can. He prefers to attack at middle
range with his rope dart, using his Astral Thread Control
to attack vulnerable pairs of PCs. Once he has fewer than
half his Hit Points, he relocates frequently; as the call of the
void doesn’t target him, he often moves across the red ropes
or teleports to other islands to gain a tactical advantage
against the PCs and ensure the island he’s on still has mental
essence if he needs to heal himself. He knows his existence
will unravel as soon as he surrenders the crumpled folio
page to the PCs, and so fights until destroyed.

HP 280; destabilized form
Destabilized Form When the Echo has fewer than 140 Hit
Points, his form destabilizes, large chunks disintegrating
from his face, limbs, and torso. White moths constantly
stream from the missing spaces, creating a 10-foot emanation
that deals 6d6 mental damage with a DC 34 basic Will save.
As long as the aura persists, he can dissolve into moths and
re-form at another location within 15 feet as a free action
at the beginning of each of his turns; this has the occult,
conjuration, and teleportation traits.
Attack of Opportunity [reaction] The Echo has reach 15 for the purpose
of determining when Attack of Opportunity triggers and
when making Attacks of Opportunity.
Speed 25 feet
Melee [one-action] rope dart +29 (disarm, finesse, magical, sweep,
tethered, trip), Damage 4d4+13 piercing plus 2d6 mental
Ranged [one-action] rope dart +29 (disarm, finesse, magical, sweep,
tethered, thrown 80 feet, trip), Damage 4d4+13 piercing plus
2d6 mental
Astral Spindle Implement The Echo carries a drop spindle
that constantly spins red astral thread, which is both his
thaumaturgic implement and weapon. If his rope dart is
lost or broken, he can re-form it with an Interact action. If
he critically succeeds at a rope dart Strike, overwhelming
thoughts and figments flow down the thread into the target’s
mind. The target becomes confused for 1 round.
Astral Thread Control [one-action] Frequency once per round;
Requirements The Echo’s previous action was a successful
thrown rope dart Strike; Effect The Echo flicks his wrist and
makes a follow-up thrown rope dart Strike at a different
target within 30 feet of the first target, using the same
multiple attack penalty as his previous Strike. Regardless of
whether his attack hits, he then retrieves the weapon.
Contingency Oathday-Nine-Rova [free-action] Frequency once per day;
Trigger The Echo’s turn begins and he’s stunned, slowed,
confused, controlled, immobilized, grabbed, paralyzed,
restrained, or otherwise can’t act; Effect The Echo has set
up numerous contingencies in the event he’s compromised.
Talismans on his body shatter, counteracting the triggering
effect. The Echo can use this free action even if he can’t act.
Reconstitute from Thought
[one-action]
(necromancy,
healing)
Requirements The Echo is standing on one of the eight large
islands of the map, and the island hasn’t darkened; Effect The
Echo throws his rope dart into the island and uses it to absorb
mental essence from the mindscape, repairing himself. He
regains 45 Hit Points and the island turns a desaturated gray
for 1 day, preventing future absorption and disabling the call
of the void hazard on that island (see below).
Spindle’s Web [two-actions] The Echo’s spindle revolves faster and faster
until it’s a blur, lashing red threads in every direction. The
threads deal 7d6 slashing damage and 7d6 mental damage
to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation, with a DC 34 basic
Reflex save. If a creature fails its save, the threads awaken
the mindscape anchor within it, affecting it differently based
on which anchor that creature used to gain access to the
center of the mindscape. (If there is a PC who didn’t absorb a
mindscape anchor, for instance because there are more than
four PCs in the party, then use the anchor of the PC closest to
them.) The Echo then can’t use Spindle’s Web for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Lantern The lantern outlines the creature with searing
faerie fire that deals 2d6 persistent fire damage.
•	 Mirror The mirror reflects the creature to another location,
teleporting them to a clear space within 25 feet of their
current location.
•	 Chalice The chalice drains life force, granting the Echo
temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt.
•	 Tome The tome floods the creature’s mind with information;
the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Hazard: A manifestation of K.H.W.’s curiosity, now
turned to malevolent ends, lures those who approach the
void below the islands ceaselessly into its depths.
CALL OF THE VOID
HAZARD 12
UNIQUE
COMPLEX
ENVIRONMENTAL
MAGICAL
Stealth DC 25 (expert) to notice a slight tugging feeling
Description A supernatural compulsion to leap into the
unknown exerts itself on anyone who approaches the ledge.
Disable DC 34 Occultism or DC 36 Arcana to expel the magical
compulsion from the current island and from any of the red
ropes directly attached to it, darkening the rope in color. The
Echo also automatically disables the hazard from any island
he’s standing on, and any of the red ropes directly attached to
it, when he Reconstitutes from Thought on that island.
Leap into the Unknown [reaction] (enchantment, mental); Trigger A
creature enters a square adjacent to the ledge of an island
or steps onto one of the red ropes; Effect The call of the
void tugs at the mind of intruders, compelling them to leap off
the ledge. The creature must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or
DC 32 Acrobatics check to Balance or else drop off the ledge.
If the creature falls off, it drops 100 feet, loops through the
closed space of the mindscape, and lands in the square it fell
