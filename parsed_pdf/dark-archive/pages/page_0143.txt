The GM might allow a character who comes from a strange
sect or worships an underground aspect of a deity to select
an apocryphal domain spell in place of the standard initial
or advanced spell for that domain. These characters are
typically clerics with Domain Initiate but can include other
characters with domain spells, like champions with Deity’s
Domain or oracles with Domain Acumen.

FOCUS 1
RARE
CLERIC
DIVINATION
PREDICTION
Domain fire (apocryphal)
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
You’ve learned to read the future in the
patterns of flames and smoke. Though
inexact and often symbolic, these
readings help prepare you for upcoming
events. When Casting this Spell, you must
be near a fire (of any size) for the duration.
Upon completion, roll 1d4 for your
prediction. The benefit lasts for
10 minutes or until expended,
whichever comes first. After casting cinder
gaze, you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes.
1.	Terrible Danger You gain a +2 status
bonus to your next initiative roll.
2.	New Life The next time you take damage, just
before taking the damage, you gain temporary Hit Points
equal to 1 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
3.	Vivid Insight (fortune) The next time you attempt a check
to Recall Knowledge, roll twice and take the higher result.
4.	Good Fortune (fortune) The next time you attempt a
saving throw, roll twice and take the better result.
Heightened (+1) The number of temporary Hit Points from
new life increases by 2.

condition and then regain consciousness while under the
effect of euphoric renewal, you gain three benefits.
•	 You’re quickened on your next turn. You can use the
extra action only to Stand.

infectious frenzy, dancing and howling wildly to encourage
your companions to join in. You and your allies gain a +1
status bonus to saving throws against mental effects
while in the area. Whenever someone benefiting from
this bonus critically succeeds at a saving throw
against an enemy’s mental effect, its
revelry increases, granting it a +1
status bonus to attack rolls and damage
rolls for 1 round.
Heightened (4th) The emanation’s radius is 10

be trusted. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

APOCRYPHAL DOMAIN SPELLS
Not all clerical traditions are taught among the orthodoxy. Some are whispered in secret, passed down from a priest to
trusted acolytes or scribed in tomes left behind by splinter factions. Some apocryphal spells are considered heretical and
suppressed, but others have fallen out of use or are specific to a region or sect. These apocryphal spells usually rely on
more abstract associations between divine power and a certain effect than those seen in orthodox ones.
