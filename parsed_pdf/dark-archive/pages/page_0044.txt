prevent the implement from teleporting away if it succeeds at
a Will save against your class DC. If the creature succeeds, you
can’t attempt to Call that Implement again; you must track the
creature down to get the implement back.
ENHANCED FAMILIAR
FEAT 2
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites a familiar
By applying the best of multiple traditions of magic, you’ve
found a more efficient way for your familiar to store its energy.
You can select four familiar or master abilities each day,
instead of two.
ESOTERIC WARDEN
FEAT 2
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
When you apply antithetical material against a creature
successfully, you also ward yourself against its next attacks.
When you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability,
you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC against the creature’s
next attack and a +1 status bonus to your next saving throw
against the creature; if you critically succeed, these bonuses
are +2 instead. You can gain these bonuses only once per
day against a particular creature, and the benefit ends if you
Exploit Vulnerability again.
TALISMAN ESOTERICA
FEAT 2
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
You know how to assemble the supernatural objects in your
esoterica into a number of temporary talismans. Each day
during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans
with an item level no higher than half your level. You must
know each talisman’s formula. A talisman created this way is
a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make
your daily preparations.
You know the formulas for all common talismans in the Core
Rulebook of your level or lower. You remember your talisman
formulas through oral tradition or mnemonics, so you don’t
need a formula book for them.
TURN AWAY MISFORTUNE [reaction]
FEAT 2
ABJURATION
ESOTERICA
FORTUNE
MANIPULATE
OCCULT
THAUMATURGE
Trigger You would attempt a roll affected by a misfortune effect.
You perform a superstition, such as casting salt over your
shoulder to ward off bad luck. Turn Away Misfortune’s fortune
trait cancels out the misfortune effect, causing you to roll
normally. As normal, you can apply only one fortune ability
to a roll, so if you Turned Away Misfortune on an attack roll,
you couldn’t also use an ability like Halfling Luck to alter the
roll further.
4TH LEVEL
BREACHED DEFENSES
FEAT 4
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
You can find the one weak point in a creature’s scales, wards,
or armor to get past its resistances. When you succeed at
Exploit Vulnerability, you learn about the highest of the
creature’s resistances that can be bypassed (for example, if
the creature has resistance to physical damage except silver),
if the creature has one. If you prefer, you can choose the
following benefit instead of one of the usual two benefits from
Exploit Vulnerability.
