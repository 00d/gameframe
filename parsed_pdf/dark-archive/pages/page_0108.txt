–10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the
area, and on a critical failure, it is also knocked prone.
Heightened (+1) The radius of the spell’s area increases by 5 feet.
SHADOW SPY
SPELL 3
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult, primal
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 120 feet
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You mix blood, soil, and shadow together to form a half-real
homunculus in the shape of a crow, sparrow, or other bird.
You then command the bird to fly to a location within range
and observe all around it. The bird has the statistics of a
homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares
your Perception modifier. Once the spell’s duration elapses or
upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simple—“at dusk”
or “when the judge leaves”), the bird flies to your location.
If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn
all that it saw since its creation.
SOFT LANDING
SPELL 4
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 1 mile; Area 20-foot tall, 60-foot radius
cylinder with the ground at the bottom
Duration 1 minute
You create a magical field that buoys any creature or object
falling into the area, providing a harmless landing from any
height. As you generally fall 1,500 feet per round, you can cast
this spell while you are falling to ensure a
safe landing, provided you can see your
landing point and it’s within range.
TELEKINETIC BOMBARDMENT
SPELL 7
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Area 10-foot burst or 30-foot line
Saving Throw Reflex
You grasp a piece of the landscape—such as a tree, carriage, or
piece of masonry—and lob it in your foe’s direction. Your missile
crashes down in either a 10-foot burst (for most missiles) or a
30-foot line (for something long and tall, like a tree or a ship’s
mast), dealing 14d6 bludgeoning damage and turning its area
into difficult terrain as it breaks into rubble. All creatures in the
area must attempt a Reflex save. If the area is a line, it doesn’t
have to start from your square but can instead start anywhere
in range, as long as the entire area remains within range.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is knocked prone.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is knocked
prone, and is stunned 1.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
WARP STEP
CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
When you walk, the earth warps beneath your feet—your
steps extend, distance contracts, and everything is just a little
bit closer. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed until
the end of your turn. You then Stride twice. You can use warp
step to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you
have the corresponding movement type.
