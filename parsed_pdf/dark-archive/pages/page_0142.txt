EXUDE ABYSSAL CORRUPTION [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
MANIPULATE
POISON
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication, your entity is a demon
Most of the changes from the demon within you have
harmed you so far, but you’ve found a way to expel some
of the corruption within you to poison others. Until the
beginning of your next turn, you and your weapons are
covered in toxic sludge or another similar manifestation
of the demonic corruption; your melee Strikes deal an
additional 1d6 poison damage, and each time a creature hits
you with a melee unarmed attack or otherwise touches you,
it takes 1d6 poison damage.
At 14th level, the poison damage increases to 2d6, and at
20th level, the poison damage increases to 3d6.
FEY’S TRICKERY [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
ILLUSION
PRIMAL
VISUAL
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication, your entity
is a fey
Frequency once per hour
You connect with the fey trickster within
yourself to create whimsical illusory
duplicates that distract your foes. This has
the effects of mirror image.
WARPED CONSTRICTION [one-action] FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication,
your entity is an aberration or outer
entity
Requirements You have a foe grabbed or restrained.
The entity inhabiting your body is an aberrant being with
unfathomable motivations, and when you hold a foe close,
tendrils and tentacles unfurl from your body to crush your
foe and pollute it with alien wrongness. Your grabbed or
restrained foe takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level
and mental damage equal to your highest mental ability
modifier. The creature attempts a basic Will save that applies
to both types of damage and uses the higher of your class
DC or spell DC.
VESSEL’S FORM [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication
Frequency once per day
You symbiotically combine your form with that of the entity
within you, taking a powerful hybrid form to temporarily
boost your abilities in combat while maintaining control. For 1
minute, you gain the following effects.
•	 If you were Medium or smaller, you become Large, and
your reach increases to 10 feet.
•	 You gain a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls
and a +1 status bonus on saving throws against spells. If
you use Entity’s Resurgence, the status bonuses to
attack and damage rolls increase to +3 during
the time that the two effects overlap.
•	 If you have the Entity’s Strike feat, the unarmed attack
you gained from that feat increases its damage die from
1d6 to 1d8.
•	 You gain 40 temporary Hit Points.
•	 You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed.
Special This action has the tradition trait appropriate
to your entity, typically divine for a demon, occult for an
aberration or outer entity, or primal for a fey.
