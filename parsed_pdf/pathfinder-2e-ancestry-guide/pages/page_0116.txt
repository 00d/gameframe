Family Relations
Djinn, air genies native to the Plane of
Air, are the most common elemental
ancestor for sylphs, but they are not
the only possibility. Invisible stalkers
look down on corporeal creatures, but
occasionally they take mortal lovers,
especially illusionists who share
their appreciation for the unseen.
Cloud dragons sometimes have sylph
descendants, born with draconic
features like tails or horns.
