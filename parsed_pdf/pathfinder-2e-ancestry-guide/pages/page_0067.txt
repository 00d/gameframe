Overview
66
Golarion is a world filled with unique people and strange
magic, resulting in an incredible diversity of heritages
across the Inner Sea. The new ancestries and versatile
heritages (which can be applied to any ancestry) in
the following pages represent a small portion of these
unique and incredible peoples. Many of these ancestries
have deep, historical ties to specific locales, making
them less likely to be found outside of those regions.
Several of the ancestries presented in this section are
therefore uncommon for adventurers. This rarity trait
applies specifically to the rules for playing a member of
this ancestry, and it’s separate from the rarity trait that
determines how obscure information about a creature is.
In addition, some ancestries and heritages have
incredibly small populations, their existence the result of
brief meetings between disparate realms. These ancestries
are only rarely spotted anywhere on Golarion, and thus
are rare for adventurers. As with uncommon ancestries,
this rarity trait applies specifically to the rules for playing
a member of this ancestry, and it’s separate from the rarity
trait that determines how obscure information about a
creature is.
While these ancestries are uncommon or rare in the
same way as a magic item, a feat, or a spell, you choose
an ancestry at the beginning of the campaign. Specific
campaigns might grant access to a set of uncommon or
even rare ancestries that are particularly appropriate
for that setting, such as androids in a campaign set in
Numeria or an all-sprite party for a campaign in the First
World. In other games, these ancestries can be as available
as your group desires and the GM deems appropriate.
SPECIAL RULES
Some of the new ancestries and heritages presented in
this book require unique rules to fully represent their
capabilities. Most of these rules are described in the
applicable ancestry sections but are also collected here
for reference.
Flying PCs: Certain ancestries, such as strix or sprites,
have wings. The presented ancestry rules intend to
provide a good combination of story and game balance
for most groups. However, some players might have
character concepts that don’t fit this assumption and
might wish to fly from initial character creation. At the
GM’s discretion, the GM can grant these PCs a 15-foot
fly Speed, replacing any other abilities that involve flying,
such as the strix’s Wings ancestral trait. In this case, any
feat that upgrades the PC’s flying capabilities, such as
the strix’s Fledgling Flight and Juvenile Flight feats,
might instead upgrade this Speed by an additional 5 feet.
However, GMs who allow this option should be aware
that a PC who can constantly fly can trivialize many
low- and mid-level challenges, consistently outshining or
leaving other characters behind; the GM should consider
this option very carefully before allowing it and adjust
the game accordingly.
Riding PCs: A Tiny PC weighs so little and takes up
so little Bulk that it wouldn’t be a space issue to hitch a
ride in a sack, on a shoulder, or otherwise be carried by a
fellow PC. However, this requires a tremendous amount of
coordination to ensure the Tiny PC doesn’t get in the way,
or the two PCs don’t jostle each other into losing actions.
As a result, for most parties, this tactic is less favorable
than the Tiny PC just using their own mount. If a Tiny
PC rides along with another PC or similar non-minion
intelligent creature, roll both their initiatives and use the
lower of the two results. The two PCs act in either order
on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way,
the PCs each gain two actions at the start of their turns,
instead of three, since the larger PC spends one action
keeping the smaller one balanced on their back, and the
Tiny PC spends one action maintaining their grip.
Tiny PCs: PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but
some ancestries, such as most sprites, are Tiny instead!
Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space
and reach. A Tiny PC can enter another creature’s space,
which is important because their melee Strikes typically
have no reach, meaning the PC must enter a creature’s
space to attack it. Like other Tiny creatures, the PC
doesn’t automatically receive lesser cover from being in
a larger creature’s space, but circumstances might allow
them to Take Cover in this instance. They can purchase
weapons, armor, and other items for their size with the
same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons
have a reach of 0 for them (or a reach 5 feet shorter than
normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust
the Bulk of items and the PC’s Bulk limit for Tiny size
(Core Rulebook 295).
Android (rAre Ancestry)
Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land
of Numeria, androids are half-organic, half-machine
lifeforms produced by alien technology. Though often
looked upon with fear by superstitious communities
surrounding the crash site, changing politics and the rise
of the android goddess Casandalee have led to androids
expanding their influence in nearby regions.
Aphorite (Uncommon heritAge)
Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the
pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis.
Originally designed to form a diplomatic bridge between
the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant
contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability
to choose has seen them grow beyond their original intent
and into their own people.
