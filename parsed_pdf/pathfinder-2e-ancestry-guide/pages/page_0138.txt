Rokoas
Strix tribes are led by a spiritual, social,
and military leader called a rokoa.
Rokoas are elder female leaders who
consult a council of other warriors and
spiritualists to make decisions for the
entirety of the community. Young female
strix are selected early as potential
successors to the tribe’s current rokoa.
Often the rokoa herself
chooses her favorite
protégé to pass along her
storytelling recitations,
battle stratagems, and
spiritual understanding.
