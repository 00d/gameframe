Once perfectly identical beings who bridged the gap between Axis’s perfect order and
mortals’ unrestricted existence, aphorites are now lit more by the spark of free will than
the beacon of cosmic law.
Aphorite
74
Aphorites were first forged by axiomites, the primary
inhabitants of the Eternal City of Axis, the plane of pure
law. The original aphorites served as liaisons between
their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable
mortal allies. Marrying the logical thought processes of
conformity to law and the gift of self-determination,
early aphorites spread across the Material Plane to serve
as Axis’s proxies and enact its will. Over time, their
appearances and personalities grew to resemble
their mortal comrades as they were increasingly
born among mortals. Aphorites still exhibit Axis’s
touch in their metallic skin coated in crystalline dust,
aptitude for logic, strength in artisanship, and
propensity for order and cooperation. But
despite these links to their purpose-built
origins, contemporary aphorites are
undoubtedly their own masters.
If you want to play a character
intrinsically tied to the underlying
order of the universe, walking
the thin line between calculated
predestination and free will,
you should play an aphorite.

physicAl description
The first aphorites appeared as
perfectly
identical
humanoids
with
metallic
complexions;
modern aphorites are far removed
from such rigid biological structures. Their size, shape,
and features now vary, but they still visibly bear the
influence of Axis. Eyes, hair, and complexions with
a metallic sheen are almost universal. These tones
usually vary between copper, gold, and silver, though
cobalt, viridian, and carmine aren’t unheard of. Other
manifestations include skin infused with shimmering
crystalline motes or glowing symbols appearing
across the body in a consistent rhythm.
society
While still relatively rare, aphorites are increasingly
born into families with no direct aphorite
ancestors, and have thus spread across
the Material Plane. They acculturate
like any other mortal, picking up
local customs and mannerisms
over time. Most aphorites intuit
an underlying sense of order
or pattern that supersedes
mortal law or custom. Some
pursue this through cultural
norms, while others balk at
what they see as poorly
constructed systems.
Alignment And
religion
The gift of free will means
aphorite
alignment
is
frequently shaped through
experience rather than
Axis directives. Good
and
evil
hold
no
particular sway over
aphorites’
souls,
but
most do bend toward a
lawful worldview.
Many aphorites revere Abadar,
Asmodeus,
Erastil,
or
Torag,
whose faiths recognize the benefits
of a stable society. Desna appeals to
some aphorites’ desire to break from
tradition. For aphorite artisans, Shelyn’s
aesthetic and Brigh’s precision prove
attractive; the Bronze Lady’s views
on awakened constructs also appeal
to axiomite-forged aphorites.
