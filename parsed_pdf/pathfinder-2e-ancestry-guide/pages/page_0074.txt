Thoughts on Androids
Other people view androids through a
lens of magic and superstition. Most
consider androids eccentric spellcasters,
often confusing them with tattooed
Thassilonian wizards. Others see an
android’s glowing circuitry and assume
they’re planar scions. In the River
Kingdoms, androids are often thought to
be fey that imperfectly took on human
form and thus can’t stand the touch of
cold iron. Peoples in Ustalav frequently
confuse androids for spirits, believing
they can be held back by salt circles or
banished through pious prayers.
