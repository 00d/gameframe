Children of chaos, ganzis are born of the roiling effervescence of the untamable Maelstrom,
the primal sea of all creation. Their blood crackles with the promise of change and the
raw power of creation unshackled.

While some ganzis have links to other creatures of chaos,
like valkyries or einherji, and some to no known beings,
a narrow majority manifest as “proteankin” ganzis.
Whether actually related to proteans or not, these ganzis
possess serpentine tails with colorful scales and feathers,
as well as patches of feather and scale in other
places. Bilateral symmetry of such features is
ubiquitous, despite their chaotic origins.
Given their dramatic physical features,
most ganzis are accustomed to drawing
attention. Some lean into this, dressing in
daring outfits and developing exuberant
personalities, while the more introverted
use
concealing
clothing
to
hide
their heritage. Regardless of social
preferences, many ganzis share
a passion for works of craft or
artistry; ganzis often seek out
craftworks as fashion statements,

bracelets
to
necklaces
to brooches.
society
As a highly individualistic and
geographically scattered heritage,
ganzis
have
few
widespread
traditions. The most common,
though, is the heart-name. While
ganzis are no more likely than
others to take issue with their
gift-name (as ganzis call given
names), the vast majority of ganzis
choose names for themselves,
selecting
or
inventing
names
that better describe their true
selves. Some use their gift- and
heart-names interchangeably; some
share a name only with close friends
While some ganzis are born of mortals who mingled
with the inchoate beings of the Maelstrom, and some
are descended from those who sailed that cerulean void,
many others are born in places where the Material Plane
frays toward chaos. Whatever their roots, all ganzis
share the same potent essence.
More than any other planar scions, ganzis are prone
to appearing in otherwise stolid and unremarkable
bloodlines. While this is sometimes cause for scandal
in less open-minded communities, most ganzi
children grow up as happy and loved as any
other child. Ganzi children often exhibit
irrepressible energy and good-natured
mischief. A few even grow out of these
tendencies eventually.
If you want a character that channels
the spontaneous and the unpredictable,
that defies categorization while still

nonconformists,
you

a ganzi.

fashion and other personal choices.

• Expect you to behave unpredictably
or impulsively.
• Fear that you possess magic beyond
your control.
• Assume you’re related to

Physical
DescriPtion
While ganzis resemble
other members of their
ancestry, it’s rare for
chaos to manifest with
any degree of subtlety.
No two ganzis are wholly
alike and there are no
universal traits, yet there is more
commonality among ganzis than a layperson might expect.
