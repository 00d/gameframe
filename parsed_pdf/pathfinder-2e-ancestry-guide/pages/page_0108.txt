Family Relations
Most oreads are descended from
shaitans, genies native to the Plane
of Earth, but other planar creatures,
especially other earth elementals,
can also have oread descendants. The
children of earth and mud mephits
are typically born smaller than their
mortal parent, with modest vestigial
wigs or nubs in their backs where
a mephit’s wings would have been.
When a crystal dragon bears oread
offspring, they almost always have
the gemsoul lineage in addition to
draconic features like wings or a
tail. Xorns are the least common
elemental ancestors for an oread,
as they seldom have relationships
with mortals.
