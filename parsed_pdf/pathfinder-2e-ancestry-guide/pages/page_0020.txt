TEN LIVES

Prerequisites Evade Doom
When your character would die, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success,
you’re instead reduced to 0 HP and a dying value 1 less than would normally kill
you (typically dying 3). This doesn’t change the result for any other creature affected.
Murraseth
Murraseth is the largest of several
remote catfolk-majority city-states in
central Garund. Even distant catfolk
take pride in its guilds and its Houses
of Names—labyrinthine, live-in galleries
for artists and performers who retell
catfolk discoveries and tales. Many
catfolk consider visiting a House of
Names an important life milestone.
Guilds dominate Murraseth. Perhaps
the most distinctive of these groups is
the Circle of Lifeshapers, comprised of
polymorph specialists and healers.
