carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast
calm emotions twice per day as a 2nd-level divine innate spell.
MORRIGNA’S SPIDER AFFINITY
FEAT 9
DUSKWALKER
Much like morrignas, you feel an affinity for spiders. You can cast animal messenger
(spiders only), speak with animals (spiders only), and spider climb each once per day
as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
13TH LEVEL
CALACA’S SHOWSTOPPER [two-actions]
FEAT 13
AUDITORY
DIVINE
DUSKWALKER
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
Prerequisites expert in Performance
Frequency once per day
You’ve spent many an evening learning songs and tales
featuring calacas, death’s wandering minstrels. You
dramatically unleash a stunning blast of sound by
smashing an instrument you hold or belting out a
discordant note. This has the effects of synaptic pulse, but
the effect is auditory rather than mental. The DC is either
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
VANTH’S WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
DUSKWALKER
Prerequisites Vanth’s Weapon Familiarity
Vanths themselves recognize you as an honorary reaper.
Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert
or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you
also gain that proficiency in bo staves, longbows, composite
longbows, scythes, and staves.
17TH LEVEL
OLETHROS’S DECREE [one-action]
FEAT 17
DEATH
DIVINE
DUSKWALKER
NECROMANCY
Frequency once per day
You have a connection to olethroses, the enigmatic psychopomps
who successfully swayed the yamaraj to permit the creation of the
first duskwalkers. You place a finger on fate’s scales by wrapping
silk around your bow. The first time this turn that you hit a creature
with a Strike using a weapon in the bow group you’ve modified in this
way, that creature takes an additional 60 damage (basic Fortitude save
using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) as the arrow works
to cut short their very destiny. This additional damage is of the same
type as the initial attack dealt. If you hit more than one creature at
the same time, choose one to suffer the effect of your decree.
YAMARAJ’S GRANDEUR [two-actions]
FEAT 17
DUSKWALKER
Frequency once per day
You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the
magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist
at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This
is a 30-foot cone that deals 14d6 slashing damage and 4d6
persistent slashing damage (basic Reflex save using your class
DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also
become sickened 2.
Duskwalker Origins
Duskwalkers’ past lives were often
adventurers, but other origins might
include a doctor who fought an undead
plague or a gravedigger who encouraged
a healthy attitude towards death.
