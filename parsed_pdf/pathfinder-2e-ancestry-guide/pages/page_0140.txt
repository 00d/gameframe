Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait
is designed to be shaken, cast outward, or whipped
about to control space on
the battlefield. You can use
an Interact action to thrash the
weapon in a square within the weapon’s
reach. That square becomes difficult terrain
until you attack with the weapon, move, or
would otherwise stop intentionally thrashing it.
Kobold: Kobolds craft and use these weapons.
Modular: The weapon has multiple configurations
that you can switch between using an Interact action.
Typically, switching between the configurations of a
modular weapon allows it to deal different types of
damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or
S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s
description to list more complicated configurations.
Resonant: This weapon can channel energy
damage. You gain the Conduct Energy free action
while wielding a resonant weapon.
CONDUCT ENERGY [free-action]
ENERGY
Requirements Your last action or spell this turn had the acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic trait.
You channel energy into your weapon. The weapon deals 1
additional damage per weapon damage die until the start of
your next turn. This damage type matches the trait of the
triggering action or spell. If your triggering action or spell had
multiple eligible traits, you select one of those traits.
ANCESTRAL RUNES
The following runes are popular among some of the
ancestries found in the Inner Sea region. Soaring armor
is common among flying ancestries like sprites, strix,
and tengu.
CONDUCTING
RUNE 7
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Price 300 gp
Usage etched onto a weapon
A conducting weapon can channel energy through
it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon
trait, except that when you Conduct Energy,
the weapon deals an additional 1d8
damage of the selected type instead of 1
additional damage per die; if the weapon
already had the resonant weapon trait, it
deals 1d8 damage plus 1 damage per die
instead. On a critical hit, the weapon
deals 1d8 persistent damage of the
same type.
SOARING
RUNE 14
ABJURATION
MAGICAL
Price 3,750 gp
Usage etched onto armor
A set of soaring armor helps you fly faster and protects you
and nearby allies from falling. While wearing soaring armor,
you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your fly Speed, if you have
one. As normal, if your fly Speed is based on your land Speed
and you already have an item bonus to your land Speed, these
bonuses aren’t cumulative.
Activate [reaction] command; Trigger You or a creature within
60 feet of you is falling; Effect You cast feather fall on the
triggering creature.
