The Storm God’s People
While Hei Feng’s tempestuous
blessings mean that some tengu prefer
to pay the god lip service rather than
follow his guidance, most tengu share
the Duke of Thunder’s love of loud
and colorful celebrations—holidays
dedicated to Hei Feng are nearly
universal, in even the most far-flung
communities. Likewise, many tengu
enclaves put little faith in the stability
of society. In situations where the
future seems uncertain, Hei Feng’s
presence provides an outlet for
feelings of helplessness.
