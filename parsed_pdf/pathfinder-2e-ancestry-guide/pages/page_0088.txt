HEFTING SHADOW
FEAT 9
CONJURATION
FETCHLING
OCCULT
SHADOW
Prerequisites Clever Shadow
Your shadow can contain objects. You can Interact with your shadow to store or retrieve
objects, just like you would a mundane container (meaning you spend two Interact
actions total to store and then retrieve the object, for example). Your shadow can contain
2 Bulk of objects, which don’t count toward the Bulk you’re carrying. The items remain
solid but take on a shadowy patina while stored this way. Though the items are in your
shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth
checks to Conceal the Objects unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.
SCULPT SHADOWS [three-actions]
FEAT 9
CONJURATION
FETCHLING
OCCULT
SHADOW
You coax nearby shadows into the shape of a simple weapon or a simple tool or item,
using a tiny piece of your shadow to make it solid; in doing so, you lose 1 Hit Point. You
can create only level-0 common, non-consumable weapons, or adventuring
gear with no intricate parts, written text, or other complicated components.
The item lasts until used for a single activity, until you Sculpt Shadows again,
or for 1 minute, whichever comes first. Once the duration expires, the object
dissipates, and you regain the lost Hit Point unless the item was Broken or
Destroyed. As the object holds a tiny sliver of your shadow, you can’t recover
the lost Hit Point until after the object dissipates.
SHADOW SIGHT [one-action]
FEAT 9
FETCHLING
OCCULT
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per hour

deepest darkness. You gain greater darkvision for 1 minute.

SHADOW’S ASSAULT

innate spell once per day. At 17th level, your shadow blast is heightened to 6th level.

PIERCE THE LIGHT
FEAT 17

FETCHLING
You tear the veil between the Material Plane and its shadow. You can cast plane shift
twice per week as an occult innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel
only to the Material or Shadow Planes, and your body serves as the focus component.
The Widow
The Widow was one of the Forsaken—
sinister demigods who once watched
over the Shadow Plane. It heard
an Azlanti call for rescue, lifted its
shivering sickle, and tore a passage
into darkness; those it ushered into
the Shadow Plane became the first
fetchlings. Few remember anything
beyond the Widow’s name, and fewer
still offer it prayers. It grants power to
no fetchling priests.
