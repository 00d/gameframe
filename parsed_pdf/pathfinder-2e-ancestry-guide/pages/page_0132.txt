FEY DISGUISE
FEAT 5
SPRITE
You can disguise yourself with magical illusions. You can cast illusory disguise once
per day as a 1st-level primal innate spell. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd
level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.
9TH LEVEL
ENERGIZE WINGS [one-action]
FEAT 9
CONCENTRATE
MORPH
PRIMAL
SPRITE
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Evanescent Wings
Frequency once per hour
You stoke your magic to energize your wings, temporarily transforming them into
glowing, majestic forms. For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed of 30 feet.
FEY MAGIC
FEAT 9
SPRITE
You can use faerie magic to hide yourself and expose hidden foes. You can cast
faerie fire and invisibility each once per day as primal innate spells.
13TH LEVEL
FEY SKIN
FEAT 13
SPRITE
While you are more susceptible to cold iron than most
of the Wingless, you also have an incredible resilience
and a deeper connection to the healing energies of
the First World. Increase your maximum Hit Points
by an amount equal to your level. If you rest for
10 minutes, brilliant light from the First World
seeps into your form from your wings (or the spot
where your wings would be), causing you to regain
a number of Hit Points equal to your level; this is
cumulative with any Hit Points you regain from Treat
Wounds. However, you gain weakness 5 to cold iron.
INVISIBLE TRICKSTER
FEAT 13
SPRITE
You have learned how to become invisible and
remain so. You can cast 4th-level invisibility as a
primal innate spell once per hour.
17TH LEVEL
HERO’S WINGS
FEAT 17
SPRITE
Prerequisites Energize Wings
You have begun the final steps to reaching your full
potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form
without you needing to use Energize Wings, granting
you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize
you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately
impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation
checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the Glad-Hand skill feat against
other sprites, without taking a  –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.
Sprites in Society
Sprites who mingle openly among
mortals find that mortal superstitions
about fey regularly color their
interactions with sprites, for both
good and ill. Mortals often believe half-
remembered tales, frequently about
a different sort of fey altogether;
most sprites find this hilarious and
play along. Mortals uninterested in
sprites’ pranks tend to view them as
nuisances and treat them accordingly.
Additionally, sprites’ small stature and
excitable natures sometimes cause
mortals to treat them like children.
Sprites vary in their reactions to this
sort of treatment from annoyance to
good humor, and sometimes even a
realization that they can get away
with more this way.
