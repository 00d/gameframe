WATER STRIDER [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AZARKETI
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
Water cradles your every step, allowing you to walk on its surface. Stride up to your
Speed. During your movement, you can move across liquids that don’t support your
weight. If you end your movement on a surface that can’t support you, you fall into
the liquid at the end of your movement. You can increase the number of actions to 3
to Stride up to three times your Speed.
13TH LEVEL
AQUATIC ADAPTATION
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
CONCENTRATE
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
Frequency once per day
If you and up to four other creatures are in contact with a body of water
deep enough for you to fully submerge, you can spend 10 minutes
adapting the creatures to that specific body of water. This allows them
to breathe normally while within that body of water and protects
them from deep ocean pressure. These effects last until the
creatures are no longer in contact with that body of water or until
you use this ability again, whichever comes first for each creature.
AQUATIC CAMOUFLAGE
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
You blend into the waves. While fully submerged in water, as long
as an observer is at least 20 feet away from you, you don’t need
cover from that observer to Hide or Sneak.
HYDRAULIC MANEUVERS [one-action]
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your
surroundings. If the next action you take is an Athletics check to Disarm,
Shove, or Trip, that action has a range of 15 feet. You don’t receive any item
bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body,
but if you roll a critical failure on that Athletics check, you get a failure instead.
MIST STRIDER
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
Prerequisites Water Strider
You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight.
When you use Water Strider, you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at
a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you
don’t end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
REHYDRATION
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
Frequency once per day
You surround your body with a thin layer of water drawn from the moisture in the
air. You can spend one hour resting to rehydrate your gills and skin, which counts
as submerging your body in water. At the GM’s discretion, incredibly dry areas, such
as deserts, might not have enough moisture in the air for your Rehydration to work.
17TH LEVEL
UNDERWATER VOLCANO
 FEAT 17
AZARKETI
You can cast volcanic eruption as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day, except
that you can only evoke the volcano on the floor of a body of water, and the effects
that normally happen to flying creatures happen to swimming creatures instead.
Alghollthus
Azarketis have a complex relationship
with alghollthus, who saved but then
enslaved their people. Alvadnas have the
greatest chance of meeting an alghollthu
face to face. Azarketi sentiments toward
these creatures vary: some fight fiercely
against their ancient enemies; others
bargain for power or safety, or even
serve through compulsion.
