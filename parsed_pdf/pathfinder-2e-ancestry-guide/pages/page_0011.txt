Tianjing
Due to the nature of their births,
aasimar have few dominions they
can claim as their own. The aasimar
nation of Tianjing in Tian Xia is
a major exception, populated by
the descendants of celestials who
fought off a qlippoth invasion and
known now for its skilled diplomats.
Tianjing’s aasimar crafters also
display masterful skill in their chosen
professions, and their finely made
goods are coveted across Golarion.
