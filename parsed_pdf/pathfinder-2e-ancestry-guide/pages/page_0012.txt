EXPLORATION
FIRE
MANIPULATE
TELEPORTATION
Prerequisites Emberkin
Frequency once per day
Your peri lineage has opened your mind to fire’s raw, purging essence. You can
spend 1 minute in focused preparation, then enter a fire your size or larger to
instantly teleport to any fire that is your size or larger up to 5 miles away. You
take no damage from entering or exiting fires when using this ability. Once
you enter the fire, you instantly know the rough locations of other large fires
within range and can exit from the original fire, if you prefer. You can’t carry
extradimensional spaces with you when you teleport; if you attempt to do so,
the activity fails.

You call on your celestial forebears to rid your body of all toxins and
impurities. For each disease or poison currently affecting you, attempt
a Religion check to counteract that disease or poison. As normal, your
counteract level is equal to half your level, rounded up.

UNCOMMON
AASIMAR
Prerequisites Angelkin APG
It is paramount that you are understood and you understand others;
language need not impede your message. You can cast tongues as
a 5th-level divine innate spell once per day on yourself only. You
gain a +1 status bonus to Diplomacy checks for the duration
of the spell when speaking to creatures with whom you
already shared a language before casting.
17TH LEVEL
RADIATE GLORY [one-action]
FEAT 17
AASIMAR
DIVINE
EVOCATION
LIGHT
VISUAL
Your inherent glory radiates into the world with all
the divine power of the celestial planes for 1 minute.
Any creature that can see you while you Radiate Glory
must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC
or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creature then becomes
temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success You are concealed to the creature for 1 round by the shining light, but
can’t use this concealment to Hide, as normal for when your location is obvious.
Failure As success, except you are concealed to the creature while your glory
radiates.
Critical Failure You are hidden to the creature while your glory radiates, lost
amid the radiant corona of your presence. Your general position is still
obvious, so you can’t use this to Sneak.
Divine Pressure
Societies expect great destinies from
aasimars, and the pull of their celestial
tether guides them towards noble
pursuits. Most aasimars embrace
these impulses, looking to prove
themselves by answering the call. But
this intense pressure from their peers
and the celestials above may cause
an aasimar to shirk their birthright
and flee their homes, overwhelmed.
There are also aasimars who resist the
celestial call entirely, acting as a force
for evil to spite their heritage.
