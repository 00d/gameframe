The most common elemental ancestors
for ifrits are efreet, the fire genies
native to the Plane of Fire, but they
have many possible otherworldly
progenitors. Salamander-descended
ifrits are usually born with tails and
forked tongues. When magma dragons
mate with mortals, their children are
sometimes born as ifrits with draconic
tails and vestigial wings.
