If an effect forces you to move, you move only half the normal distance, as
some of the effort goes to tearing out the roots. At the GM’s discretion, this
ability might not work on ground that’s more resilient than stone, such as
metal flooring or magically-reinforced masonry.

Life without Form
Leshy spirits are beings of pure vital
essence without any of the otherworldly
quintessence known as spiritual
essence. Existing without physical
form allows them closer contact with
memories from their distant past, but
this broader perspective gradually
erodes memories of their experiences in
their most recent body.
