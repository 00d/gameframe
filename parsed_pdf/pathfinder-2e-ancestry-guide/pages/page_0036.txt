International Relations
Oprak holds a powerful magical tool
that has contributed to its economic
boom: the Onyx Key. Through this
powerful artifact, the nation creates
planar tunnels that facilitate easy,
seamless travel across Golarion. Using
the artifact, General Azaersi contacted
her fellow hobgoblin nations of Kaoling
and, later, Rakh Lo, establishing
trade agreements between the three
powers. These pacts have faced
their share of difficulties, however.
Oprak and Rakh Lo quickly grew
into close allies, but Kaoling’s harsh
traditionalism, even among hobgoblins,
has complicated diplomatic progress.
