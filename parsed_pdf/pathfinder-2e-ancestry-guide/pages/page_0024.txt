FAVORABLE WINDS [one-action]
FEAT 5
AIR
CHANGELING
CONCENTRATE
OCCULT
Prerequisites Virga May
You wrap a shell of favorable wind around a weapon you wield. On your next Strike
with a ranged weapon before the start of your next turn, you don’t take circumstance
penalties on the attack roll due to wind. In addition, if that weapon has a range
increment of 10 feet or less, increase its range increment by 10 feet for that Strike.
9TH LEVEL
INVOKE THE ELEMENTS [two-actions]
FEAT 9
CHANGELING
EVOCATION
PRIMAL
Prerequisites Brine May APG, Snow May, Veil May, or Virga May
Frequency once per day
You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow,
crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning. For
1 minute, you gain concealment against creatures
more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its
turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 damage (basic
Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever
is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases
by 1d12. A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow
may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling
deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the water
trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.
MOTHER’S MINDFULNESS [reaction]
FEAT 9
CHANGELING
Frequency once per minute
Trigger An adjacent ally is hit by an attack.
You have the protective instinct your own mother lacks and will gladly suffer in
another’s place. You interpose yourself in the attack’s path. You become the target of
the triggering attack and are automatically hit by the attack (or critically hit if the
ally was critically hit), suffering the full effects in your ally’s place.
13TH LEVEL
SPITEFUL RAKE [two-actions]
FEAT 13
CHANGELING
Prerequisites claw unarmed attack
Requirements You have both hands free.
Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you’ve learned a devastating trick:
go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is
dazzled for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead blinded for 1 round and
dazzled until restored to maximum hit points.
17TH LEVEL
CRONE’S CRUELTY
FEAT 17
CHANGELING
Filled with rancor and hate, you rend the minds of those who displease you. You can
cast warp mind once per day as an occult innate spell.
STORMY HEART
FEAT 17
CHANGELING
Prerequisites Invoke the Elements
The elemental power in your blood is a raging storm. You can Invoke the Elements
with a frequency of once per 10 minutes, rather than once per day.
Changeling Origins
Changelings’ rarity typically prevents
them from gathering in numbers.
While changelings can be found
anywhere hags lurk, they’re most
common by far in Ustalav, Irrisen, and
neighboring regions. The daughters
of night hags and moon hags can
arise far from any known hag activity
thanks to their mothers’ extraplanar
origins, as can the spontaneously
arising sorrow may.
