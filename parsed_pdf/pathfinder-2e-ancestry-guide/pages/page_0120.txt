Family Relations
Most undines descend from marids—
the water genies native to the Plane
of Water—and the mortals they take
for lovers. These mercurial genies
usually show their favor to musicians,
dancers, and other artists, inviting
mortals of exceptional talents to live
with them. Other planar creatures
occasionally have undine progeny as
well. The children of water, ice, and
salt mephits are often born with small
statures, nub-like horns, hooked or
beak-like faces, or vestigial wings and
tails. Those related to brine dragons
are sometimes born with draconic
wings and tails and almost always
have the brinesoul lineage.
5TH LEVEL
FLUID CONTORTIONIST
FEAT 5
UNDINE
You can ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren’t tight
enough to force you to Squeeze. When you roll a critical failure on a check to Squeeze,
you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
STEAM SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
UNDINE
You transform your fire spells into steam, making them more effective underwater. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell with the fire trait, you can cast it underwater. When
you do so, it takes the form of scalding steam. Underwater creatures do not gain the
normal fire resistance for being underwater against this spell, but they don’t light things
on fire or cause persistent fire damage, nor do they add other effects that would apply
to fire but not steam (at the GM’s discretion).
9TH LEVEL
MARID MAGIC
FEAT 9
UNDINE
You channel the magic of marids. You can cast hydraulic push and obscuring mist each
once per day as 2nd-level arcane innate spells.
STRONG SWIMMER
FEAT 9
UNDINE
Your swim Speed increases to match your land Speed.
13TH LEVEL
SUMMON WATER ELEMENTAL
FEAT 13
UNDINE
You can summon an elemental ally. Once per day, you can
cast summon elemental as a 5th-level primal innate spell,
but the elemental summoned must be a water elemental.
TRANSLUCENT SKIN
FEAT 13
UNDINE
Your body is translucent while underwater. Whenever you are fully
submerged in water, you can Hide from other creatures even if you
don’t have cover against them and aren’t concealed from them.
17TH LEVEL
TIDAL SHIELD [two-actions]
FEAT 17
ABJURATION
CONCENTRATE
PRIMAL
UNDINE
WATER
Frequency once per day
You conjure the force of the tides to gain a +4
circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your
next turn. Any allies adjacent to you during the
duration gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
as long as they remain adjacent to you. You
can Sustain the effect to a maximum duration
of 5 rounds. When a creature receiving a
circumstance bonus to AC from Tidal Shield
would take damage from an attack, as a
reaction, you can reduce the damage to that
creature by 40; after you do so, Tidal Shield ends.
