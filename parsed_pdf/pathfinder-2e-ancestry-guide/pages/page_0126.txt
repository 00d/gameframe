The Lady of Foxes
Though usually referred to with she/her
pronouns, the goddess Daikitsu’s nature
is fluid; her gender, age, and appearance
change at her whim. Kitsune’s legends
state that they were created when
Daikitsu granted her original attendants,
fox spirits known as the Nine Bright
Grains, one of her own abilities: the
power to dance between shapes.
