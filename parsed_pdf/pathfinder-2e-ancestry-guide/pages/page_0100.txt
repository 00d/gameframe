Common Terminology
The term geniekin came into common
parlance mostly thanks to tales from
Casmaron and, in particular, the
Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Many
of these folk stories, songs, and
other common tales include great
figures who have genie parentage.
The prominence and legacy of these
stories, along with the fact that the
most common geniekin are those
with genie ancestors, have cemented
“geniekin” as a common term for any
individual who manifests elemental
traits. This is true even when genies
are not part of a person’s lineage,
such as individuals descended from
elementals or sorcerers with the
elemental bloodline. Scholars have
pushed to use the more accurate
descriptor of “elemental scion,” but
the term has yet to permeate the
common lexicon.
Elemental Permutations
While other planar scions have
lineages that reflect the specific
fiends, celestials, or monitors from
which their families descend, geniekin
lineages are better described as
permutations of elemental expression.
Elements sometimes manifest in
unique and unusual ways within a
line of geniekin, regardless of the
elemental they descend from. These
permutations and their lineages are
as follows.
Air: fumesoul (miasma sylph),
smokesoul (haze sylph), stormsoul
(lightning sylph)
Earth: dustsoul (soil oread), gemsoul
(crystal oread), miresoul (mud oread)
Fire: brightsoul (radiant ifrit),
cindersoul (ash ifrit), lavasoul
(magma ifrit)
Water: brinesoul (saltwater undine),
mistsoul (vapor undine), rimesoul
(frost undine)
unDine
Undines, the water elemental geniekin, are descended from planar creatures
like brine dragons and marids. If you want a character who embodies the
adaptability, mystery, and power of elemental water, you should play an undine.
