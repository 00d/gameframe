Three Innovations
While many of the items here contain their own unique
blend of engineering, science, and, sometimes, magic, three
major types of technology appear in several sections.
CLOCKWORK TECHNOLOGY
Clockwork technology is the least rare technology in
this book, though it’s still quite uncommon. Clockwork
represents, if not a majority of the new inventions, then
at least a plurality, spurred by cutting-edge research at
the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom and the return
of New Thassilon, which surfaced some of the secrets
of clockwork discovered by the ancient empire’s first
emperor, Xin. Most clockwork items need to be wound in
order to work, but aside from a few extraordinary devices,
the time and effort needed to wind up a clockwork item
are far less than the duration and magnitude of its effects.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
Stasian technology is the rarest of the three types, channeling
electricity from a limited supply of Stasian coils smuggled
out of Irrisen, the land of eternal winter, which owns few
Stasian coils to begin with. However, enough smuggled coils
have spread to the mist-haunted principality of Ustalav to
GEARS EQUIPMENT
Stories about gear and technology don’t just focus on the innovative genius of inventors
who toil and tinker until inspiration strikes and they discover something new. The
inventions themselves are often what capture the imagination, sparking stories about
these complex and unusual items. This chapter includes everything you need to add
items of weird science to your fantasy game. While the equipment presented here tends
toward clockwork and steampunk instead of science fiction, in a world that contains
both magic and technology, that line can blur in multitudinous, marvelous ways.
