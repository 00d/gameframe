VEHICLES
It’s unsurprising that the advances in clockwork technology and the introduction of rare
Stasian and steam technology have led to the creation of many new and revolutionary
vehicles across the world. Some, like the apparatus of the octopus, have existed for
millennia but only recently rose to more wide-spread prevalence.
Vehicles
Included in this section are an array of new vehicles for
use in your game, each of which uses the new technology
described in this chapter, especially clockwork, steam,
and Stasian technology. The full rules for vehicles can
be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide starting
on page 174.
