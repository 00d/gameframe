the ballista and its mount slide down and are concealed within
the device. Although a backpack ballista packs a punch, the
device is a challenge to operate. Reloading it takes 1 minute
and can’t be done while worn. As normal, you can’t wear a
backpack ballista with another backpack.
BACKPACK CATAPULT
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
This wooden device is worn on the back and contains a
miniature catapult mounted on a retractable frame. As an
Interact action, you can pull a lever to deploy or retract the
catapult. As long as it remains deployed, you must hold the
catapult using that hand or some of the components spill out
onto the ground, just like dropping any other weapon. While
deployed, the device opens and raises the catapult up over
your shoulder. While retracted, the catapult and its mount
slide down and are concealed within the device. A backpack
catapult fires specialized stone spheres that are loaded into the
bucket while unworn and retracted, through a sliding hatch;
the reloading process takes 1 minute. To prevent misfires and
accidental injury, the bucket fully encloses the stone while
deployed, only opening when fired. As normal, you can’t wear
a backpack catapult with another backpack.
DART UMBRELLA
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This umbrella fires tiny blowgun darts from its ferrule with a
twist of the handle. The darts are loaded into the shaft, and
though the damage they deal is minimal, the dart umbrella is
an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections.
INJECTION SPEAR
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A hollow receptacle inside this spear’s head can store a single
dose of poison. A sliding trigger along the spear’s shaft can
inject the loaded poison into a damaged target.
PANTOGRAPH GAUNTLET
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A pantograph gauntlet is a heavy, fist-like weight, mounted on
an extendable frame and attached to your outer arm with a
series of leather straps. The frame’s set of mechanical linkages
connected at various hinges allow movements to propagate
across the frame based on reshaping parallelograms, further
controlled by a crossbar grasped in your hand. A pantograph
gauntlet is driven by your own motion and mirrors your
arm’s movements—a punch thrown with your fist moves
the pantograph, extending the weight out at a rapid speed
to land blows up to 10 feet away. In some regions, such as
Alkenstar and Ustalav, pantograph gauntlets are occasionally
constructed entirely of metal and fashioned in the likeness
of oversized arms, incorporating a complex system of
gears or a miniature steam engine in place of the simpler
pantograph mechanism.
