GUNS AND RIFLES
While small projectiles and pellets appeared in black
powder weapons such as fire lances and bombs, the guns
and rifles currently in Tian Xia are extremely rare and
aren’t local inventions. In Tian Xia, firearms such as
pistols originate mostly from distant Alkenstar. Due to
their rarity and the imperial ban, firearms are more often
seen as works of art and put on display. A small few are
used as hunting or sporting weapons among the most
powerful and rich aristocrats, whose private hunting
grounds and shooting ranges have the privilege to escape
the scrutiny of the authorities.
Of course, some nations are secretly creating their own
firearms while enforcing a complete ban. After intercepting
and stealing rifles and design diagrams meant
for Hongal, Minkai reportedly created their
first prototype of a new type of firearm, the
hinawaju, in 4721 AR. It’s
unclear as of yet whether the
prototype was a success, or
whether they’ll be able to
mass-produce hinawaju
usable by anyone other
than the inventor.
Hongal’s
military
is evaluating whether
firearms will be a good
defense
against
the
oni
incursion. Meanwhile, there
are rumors that nations in
the south such as Nagajor, Xa
Hoi, and Dtang Ma have also
started
training
with
what
small number of firearms they
could get their hands on, hiding
these activities in the depths
of the rainforests within their
borders. The most widespread
rumors in central parts of Tian
Xia claim that a small group of
gunsmiths and gunslingers have
gathered in Quain, where they
are seeking to become the first
firearms guild on the continent—
provided they can convince King Wen
that their firearms can be an asset rather
than a liability.
Vudra
Positioned near to Tian Xia’s trade
metropolis Goka, Vudra became aware
of the existence of black powder
quite early on in history. However,
the mining company’s secrecy
over the formula meant only small
amounts reached them at first. Even once the
technology became more widespread, attempts to export
barrels encountered several setbacks; many kegs arrived
too damp to be of use, if the ship even managed to arrive
in port. Mid-voyage explosions were an unfortunately
commonplace occurrence. The rarity of black powder
and associated technology made it a subject of fascination
in early Vudran history as a result. Most commonly,
spellcasting entertainers used small amounts to produce
amazing effects during their performance.
After the establishment of the Shu empire, many of the
kingdoms in Vudra received fireworks formulas and a
book of designs as a diplomatic gesture of goodwill from
the newly formed empire. From there, the Impossible
Kingdoms were able to formulate their own version of
black powder in order to create more. Firearms, however,
came much more recently, dating back to the recent
formation of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which lies
west of the peninsula across the ocean.
FIREWORKS
The firework formulas given to Vudra—
breaking a precedent at the time—were
extremely limited in scale, strength, and
design when compared to existing Tian
counterparts. This meant that historical
Vudran fireworks were small and simple, but the
weakened version of black powder did come with
an unexpected boon: Vudra’s domestic black
powder was much safer than Tian Xia’s, meaning
non-experts could handle it in close proximity.
The first creations that reflected this paradigm
were handheld sparklers. The shape, color, and
speed the sparks emitted gave rise to a myriad of
designs with names like the bloom, the storm, and
the prismatic ribbon. As suggested by those
names, Vudran sparklers are capable of
changing colors while burning, and these
items are still used at celebratory events
and parties.
Today, the sparklers are popular
enough worldwide that some Vudran
fireworks companies have factories
on other continents dedicated to their
production and distribution, including
in the island nation of Jalmeray, Vudra’s
foothold in the Inner Sea. In addition to
sparklers, they also produce fireworks that
focus on producing geometric shapes
and patterns. This is quite
a difficult feat to obtain,
and the fact that Vudran
fireworks engineers appear
to
have
perfected
the
techniques necessary to do
so is an astounding feat of
engineering and design.
