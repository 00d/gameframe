Combination Weapons
With the advent of firearms, there have been a number of
gunslingers, inventors, and alchemists who have created a
variety of combination weapons using black powder. The
explosive dogslicer, gnome amalgam musket, and three
peaked tree all have traits corresponding to an ancestry.
However, feats such as Elven Weapon Familiarity, which
normally grants access to all uncommon weapons with the
elf trait, do not grant access to firearms with the given trait
unless the character separately has access to firearms. You
can find more information on this and other firearm access
details on page 148.
