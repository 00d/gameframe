This alchemical black powder
hybrid siege weapon uses
a blast of black powder
to spray alchemical fire
from a long metal nozzle, often
sculpted or painted with designs resembling a
dragon’s neck and head. The nozzle turns on a
ratcheted, rotating disc with a reservoir in the
center to hold a barrel full of combustible alchemical liquid,
using black powder to propel the fire. This main structure is
atop a wheeled cart to allow it to be easily moved. Unlike
most mounted siege weapons, a firedrake is intended to be
wheeled out into the thick of a skirmish rather than shooting
from a distance.

Named for Brondar Steelheart, one of the most important
historical dwarven pioneers in the use of black powder, this
remarkable piece of new Dongun artillery uses metallurgy
and alchemy to negate nearly all of the immense amount
of recoil a shot from a siege weapon usually produces.
The barrel of the Steelheart 21 is suspended in a mix of
alchemical fluids that first compress to dampen the recoil
when fired, then expand to push the barrel back into place
afterwards. The result reduces the amount of time needed
to reset the aim of the siege weapon. The crew member who
launches the Steelheart 21 can use the Quick Aim reaction
(below), allowing them to adjust the weapon’s aim on the
fly as they fire to adapt to a faulty initial target, changing
battlefield conditions, the use of illusions by the enemy, or
any of a variety of other factors that lead to the need to alter
the siege weapon’s course.

A heavy bombard looks like little more than a large metal
cylinder, resembling the barrel of a firearm so large that it’s
immobile. The sheer size of the weapon allows it to strike
far and hard.
