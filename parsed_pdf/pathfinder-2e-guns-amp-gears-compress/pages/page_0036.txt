Golarion is a world of fantasy, one that is incredibly
vast and diverse. This means that numerous reflections
of the genre, in all its permutations, can be found
somewhere the world, as long as you know where to
look. The Shining Kingdoms are a land of knights and
chivalry similar to those imagined in the legends of King
Arthur, the Saga Lands remain home to fierce vikings and
time-displaced wizards, and the High Seas embody the
spirit of exploration and the fearsome naval combat of
the age of piracy.
Fantasy has more to offer than just knights in shining
armor and wizards in tall towers. Ingenious goblins and
ratfolk cobbling together technology from half a dozen
different disciplines and schematics, industrious dwarves
smithing intricate technological marvels, and humans
meticulously assembling clockwork creatures and
weapons piece by painstaking piece all have their places
within the genre of fantasy and in the world of Golarion.
For the automatons of the Jistka Imperium, their place
in the world remains complicated. They represent the last
remnants of an ancient society that mastered magic and
machines in equal measure, then left them behind after
the society fell as a relic of their lost nation’s greatest
achievement. For trick drivers and their trusty vehicle
mechanics, their place might be almost anywhere, though
they’re unlikely to learn their craft outside of port cities
like Absalom, or countries where technology grew at a
steady pace alongside magic, like the continent of Arcadia
or the nation of New Thassilon. Meanwhile, trapsmiths
and their cogwheel snares find a home in Absalom, with
its Clockwork Cathedral; in the gritty Grand Duchy of
Alkenstar or their dwarven allies in Dongun Hold; or in
Arcadia or New Thassilon as well.
Even characters whose classes typically represent the
embodiments of classic fantasy and high magic might
have a spark of technology hidden away somewhere,
perhaps waiting for just the right moment to reveal the
ace up their sleeves. The old wizard, his body failing
but his magic strong, might choose to replace a failing
heart with a clockwork organ rather than succumb
to the temptation of undeath. A construct might
successfully seek out a soul and life as a living
creature to start anew and attain a different
perspective about the world. Even an elven archer
in a forest far away from any center of technology
might create devices that are entirely new to their
culture, such as scopes and eyewear that use the
scientific power of crystals and lenses to see hidden
targets and enable otherwise impossible shots. In all
these cases, players should work together with their
GMs to build context and story behind these ideas and
ground the character in the world.
Fantasy is as broad and deep as human imagination.
Let the ancestry, backgrounds, and archetypes that
follow take your imagination even farther down the road
of what a such a world can be!
VARIATIONS ON A THEME
The
inventor
class,
automaton
ancestry,
new
backgrounds, and other elements located in this book
give players ways to embody different aesthetics
that infuse mechanical concepts or fantastic science
into their character designs. The degree to which you
combine these elements is something that can help you
impact the development of your character and the tone
and feel of your game in a variety of ways.
An automaton character with a Pathfinder Core
Rulebook class like fighter or monk can be an interesting
twist on a classic idea. An automaton inventor with the
Disciple of the Gear background who multiclasses as a
cleric of Brigh, goddess of invention, can be the focal
point of an entire campaign arc themed around the spread
of technology and the search to understand the mortal
soul. A gnome vehicle mechanic who maintains and
makes improvements upon a single vehicle can serve as
an unusual character whose existence begs the question
of the prevalence of technology throughout the world, or
as an established member of a robust mechanics’ guild
that creates and maintains a small fleet of vehicles used
for a particular purpose by a city or civilization.
The way that you combine the elements presented in
this section can enable you to tell a vast array of different
stories. The extent to which magic and technology coexist
in your fantasy setting is up to you. Players and GMs
should work together to discover how their respective
ideas can influence each other as they explore how much
influence technology has on the world, as well as discuss
methods they might employ as the campaign unfolds to
demonstrate its importance, or lack thereof.
