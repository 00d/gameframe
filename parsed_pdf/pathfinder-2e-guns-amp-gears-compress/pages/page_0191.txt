DONGUN HOLD AND ALKENSTAR
When you appeared on our doorstep, Ancil Alkenstar, many insisted I would bring doom
to us all by granting you an audience. Instead, you became one of my dearest friends and a
life-long ally to our people, an alliance that has only grown stronger since your death, as the
city that bears your name has become inextricably bound to us through blood and battle.
You knew that would happen, didn’t you? You were barely more than a vagabond who’d
worn holes through the soles of your shoes, but your plans for the future inspired me right
from the beginning. You always saw friends and opportunities with an eye keen enough
to put any sniper to shame. You saw a future no one else could see and left it to me to
safeguard while you set out on your next grand adventure. How I miss and envy you!
There are still dwarves who say we should never have allied with you, graybeards who
respond to any evidence of the good the alliance has done us with doubtful nods and dire
warnings to “give it time.” Fools, I say! I have watched four generations of humanity grow
from children into adults of great renown and unimpeachable character, and in that time,
I have seen no more villains or criminals spring from their ranks than from our own. The
world you helped create is stronger than the one I inherited. Your children break bread and
sing songs with our own. If Geb and Nex should dare to bring their war to our doorstep once
more, humans and dwarves shall stand united, wielding weapons that can defend us from
any threat. If only you were alive to see what we have wrought, my friend!
