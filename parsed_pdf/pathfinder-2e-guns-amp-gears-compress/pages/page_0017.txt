Class Features
You gain these abilities as an inventor. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you gain from your chosen class at
1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
OVERDRIVE
You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention,
from muscle stimulants to concussive pistons. When it’s
necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you
in combat.
OVERDRIVE [one-action]
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Frequency once per round
Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive,
you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a
Crafting check that has a standard DC for your level.
Critical Success Your gizmos go into a state of incredible
efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to
your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to
your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive
ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or
reset, and you can’t use Overdrive for 1 minute.
Success Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your
attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is
equal to half your Intelligence modifier.
Failure You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.
Critical Failure Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire
damage equal to your level, and you can’t use Overdrive
again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset.
Special When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still
use the Overdrive action. You can’t extend your Overdrive’s
duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a
critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has
no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your
Overdrive on a critical failure.
INNOVATION
While you’re always creating inventions, there’s one that
represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope—
with refinement—might change the world. Choose one of
the below innovations. Your innovation’s level is equal to
your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend
1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a
high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An
innovation only works due to your constant maintenance
and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.
The innovations you can choose from in this book are
as follows.
Armor
Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor
with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one
of the sets of statistics on Table 2–2: Innovation Armor
Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set
of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).
