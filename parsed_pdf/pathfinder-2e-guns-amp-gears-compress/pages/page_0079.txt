SNARES AND HAZARDS
New innovations bring about progress, but not all
progress makes the world a better place. While some
innovators are focused on lessening toil and providing
free time to pursue passions and pleasures, others are
less altruistic. Creators of a more devious bent often
channel their imagination toward the invention of
deadlier, more cunning traps. Below are just some of the
latest advances in their perilous craft.
Snares
The following snares take advantage of various
technological advances to terrifying and lethal effects.
They otherwise work like any other snares.
