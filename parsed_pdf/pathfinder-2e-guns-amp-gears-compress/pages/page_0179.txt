A hero lives and dies by the tools of their trade. While
weapons, armor, staves, and other fancy items get a lot
of the spotlight, the ability to get the drop on the enemy
can make the difference between a glorious victory and
a humiliating defeat, so experienced combatants know
the value of a protective poncho that gives them an
advantage in a fight. Wise adventurers stock up on tools
and accessories to improve their chances of survival.
Foolish adventurers are lucky if they get a second chance
to learn from their mistakes.

Camouflage Suit: This lightweight mesh fits easily over
light armor. The suit is designed to incorporate local
flora and ground clutter into the mesh to help you blend
in seamlessly with the environment. Due to the abrasive
nature of the materials used, this item is unsuitable for
use by unarmored characters. You can prepare the suit
for use within your current environment by using an
exploration activity that takes at least 10 minutes, but
sometimes longer if the materials are hard to find or the
environment is unusual enough to warrant additional
difficulty in preparing camouflage that can blend with
it consistently.
A suit prepared in this manner grants you a +1 item
bonus to Stealth checks while you attempt to Hide or
Sneak in the specific environment it has been prepared for.
