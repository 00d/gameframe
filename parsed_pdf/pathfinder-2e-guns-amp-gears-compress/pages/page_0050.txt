Inventor
You revel in the creation of clever inventions, deploying
your brilliance to defeat your foes. Explosives, gadgets,
and innovative technologies? You have ideas for all of
them, and you’re eager to test your theories.
MULTICLASS INVENTOR CHARACTERS
Inventor is a great fit for intelligent characters
looking to branch out and learn new tricks, especially
alchemists, who are already good at Crafting and may
appreciate unstable options as an alternative to daily
alchemical resources. If they meet the Intelligence
requirements, clerics of deities who encourage invention
and experimentation like Brigh are an amazing fit,
both because it makes narrative sense and because
such characters can usually Refocus while fixing their
innovation after using an unstable ability.
