Cannons are perhaps the most well known of all black powder
siege weapons, and that’s because they represent a good
midpoint between power and expense. Keeps and fortresses
in Alkenstar prefer to fortify their forces with cannons, as
they’re relatively easy to construct and their ammunition is
cheap enough to build up great supplies.

Fiend’s mouth cannons are large-scale cannons designed to
blast a target at great distance, from a stationary location.
They get their name from the fiendish features usually
adorning their barrels and frames. Compared to a standard
field cannon, a fiend’s mouth cannon can be aimed more
easily, but flexibility comes at the cost of mobility. The barrel
rests on a platform which can be rotated 360 degrees to
allow for precise aiming.
