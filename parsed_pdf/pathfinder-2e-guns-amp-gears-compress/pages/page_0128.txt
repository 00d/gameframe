Gunslinger
You like a weapon that makes an impression almost as
much as you like making an impression.
MULTICLASS GUNSLINGER CHARACTERS
Gunslinger is a great fit for dexterous characters who
want a weapon that hits hard from a distance, especially
rangers and rogues who already have abilities that
can make their first hit count. Spellcasters with true
strike might favor firearms with the fatal property and
gunslinger abilities that improve options for supporting
their allies.
