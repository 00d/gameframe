GEARS CHARACTER OPTIONS
Examining the knuckles on my gauntlets, I despaired. While they had done as I had hoped
and battered through the dragon’s adamantine scales, their once pristine surfaces were
now heavily dented. Worse, I’d blown out a capacitator when I activated them a second
time for that final attack. As the paladin made her rounds, applying bandages and laying
on hands, I pulled my tools out of my pack and set about repairing the damage.
My diligence was well rewarded, as a strange metal door hidden by the dragon’s body
slowly spiraled open from the floor. A metallic lift rose up. Upon it stood a pair of statues,
their bodies made of a bright, gleaming silver. First adamantine, now mithral as well?
As soon as I realized that, I called for our wizard to ready his spells of cold and water.
Whoever once called this place home possessed unimaginable resources! Not one, but
three guardians, each forged from enough precious metal to beggar a kingdom’s treasury.
Fortunately, I had more at my disposal than electrified gauntlets and heat-resistant
armor. As the wizard’s cold washed over the first golem, I opened the release valve for the
nozzle attached to my right gauntlet. A stream of pressurized, cold fluid surged forth and
engulfed our foes. As the golems’ bodies congealed and cracked, I couldn’t help but smile.
These constructs proved that even more lay hidden beneath our feet. I remained all too
eager to discover the truth, but little did I realize the magnitude of what was next in store.
