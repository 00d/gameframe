While a firefly is more box-like than insect-shaped, it gets
its name from the constant glow of the light and electricity
magic that power it, as well as from the stabilizing magnets
that protrude from its sides in roughly the same position as
wings would be.

A clockwork hopper is similar in form to a large rabbit,
making hop-like strides that avoid terrain impediments,
though the lurching hops can be bumpy and cause motion
sickness in some riders.

and greater difficult terrain caused by those features is
normal difficult terrain to the clockwork hopper.
