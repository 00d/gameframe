fuse, you can make all of the arrows fire in rapid succession.

actions to load 30 hwacha arrows, but you can continue
to Load more arrows to increase the effect of the next
Launch action, as detailed below.

piercing, 20-foot burst, DC 18 Reflex. If you loaded at least
70 hwacha arrows, the area increases to a 25-foot burst.

A mortar fires its shells at a high angle, allowing it to bypass
obstacles and strike from above. A crew typically sets up
such a weapon behind a wall or in another hard-to-access
area to protect themselves while retaining full functionality.
Due to the steep angle of its arc, such mortars are especially
useful when opposing barricaded targets.
Aim [two-actions] 40 feet, minimum distance 50 feet
Load [two-actions] (manipulate) 3 times
Launch [two-actions] (manipulate, range increment 100 feet) 5d10
slashing, 20-foot burst, DC 21. Because a mortar launches
its round at a high angle, the mortar round descends on
the center of the burst from above, not in a straight line
from the mortar. This affects whether creatures have
cover from the mortar launch.
