EXPLOSIVE MINE
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the
ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode
when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in
advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground
before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth
to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you
don’t Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance.
Once activated, the mine is primed to explode when
enough pressure is placed on the square where it’s located.
Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves
onto the square, though it could happen if a creature
intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance
to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes,
dealing the listed fire damage to any creatures in a 5-foot
emanation with a basic Reflex save.

Type greater; Level 12; Price 400 gp

Type major; Level 18; Price 4,000 gp
