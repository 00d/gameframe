Massive Jump [three-actions] (move, reckless) The pilot engages a
spring‑driven mechanism that rockets the clockwork
hopper into the air, in a grand leap. The vehicle jumps in a
straight line in the direction of its current heading without
touching the ground, landing in a space of solid ground up
to 70 feet forward and up to 30 feet up. Creatures adjacent
to the spaces a hopper lands in take 4d10 bludgeoning
damage with a DC 22 basic Reflex
save, and are knocked prone on
a critical failure. The clockwork
hopper can’t use Massive Jump
again for 1 minute. Massive Jump
stops working if the clockwork
hopper is broken.

SNAIL COACH
VEHICLE 7
UNCOMMON
HUGE
Price 1,000 gp
Shaped like its animal namesake, a
snail coach is a trolley powered by a combination of magic
and alchemical adhesives, with a hard outer shell to protect
itself from attacks. The adhesive trail both allows it to climb
and leaves a hindrance for pursuing foes.

Adhesive Secretions This vehicle secretes an alchemical
adhesive that allows it to stick to and climb up solid
surfaces. Spaces the snail coach moves through become
difficult terrain for 1 round.
Any creature that ends
their turn on the adhesive
must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex
save or take a –10-foot status
penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
On a critical failure, the creature
is also immobilized for 1 round
(Escape DC 23).
MOBILE INN

RARE
HUGE
Price 1,500 gp
A mobile inn is the next step up
from an armored carriage, bringing the limited comforts
of a simple (and cramped) inn stay to make long distance
journeys more bearable for wealthy travelers. Essentially a
tiny inn on wheels, powered by alchemical catalysts and a
steam engine, the vehicle is equipped with a stove, storage
cupboard, washbasin, table, two benches, and a compact
sleeping loft large enough to accommodate four. It can be
modified to accommodate a single passenger in significantly
more comfort or to easily hold 5 passengers by stripping the
accommodations.

CLOCKWORK BORER
VEHICLE 9
RARE
HUGE
Price 2,100 gp
A clockwork borer is essentially a huge
adamantine drill attached to a large
wheeled carriage. The clockwork
gears within move the borer itself
and spin the drill, allowing it to
burrow through loose material quickly and even through solid
stone at a slower rate.

Adamantine Drill While most burrow Speeds only allow a
creature or vehicle to move through loose dirt or earth,
this vehicle is equipped with
an adamantine drill and can
burrow through bedrock and
stone at a rate of 5 feet per
minute.
Pivoting
Seats
This
vehicle’s seats are mounted
on a weighted platform that pivots
as the vehicle moves, automatically
adjusting position with gravity. Seated
creatures remain upright no matter the
position or angle of the vehicle.
Sluggish Because it is sluggish, this vehicle
must move twice its length for each
90-degree turn it makes.
