GUNS CHARACTERS
I never liked hurting people. As a shield marshal, I knew my duty and kept my arquebus,
Alessandra, in top condition. But if I had the choice, I would have been a spotter. I tried
not to think too much about all the monsters we put down.
When I retired, I took my pension, gun, and family away from it all. Bought a farm. Buried
Alessandra in a sealed box under an old tree. This far from Alkenstar, few even know what a
gun is. The ones who do aren’t the kind of people you want knowing you have one. At least,
that’s what I told myself. Believed it too, right up until the bandits took everything from me.
I don’t know how long I laid in that pool of blood. All I remember is the sounds of
screaming, the snarling faces, and the smell of smoke. When I woke up, the farm and my
family were gone. So I crawled. I crawled to that old tree and dug in the dirt with my
bare hands until I uncovered the chest. I fumbled open the clasp and found Alessandra,
wrapped in leather and treated with oil, my shield marshal uniform folded neatly
underneath. Didn’t fit my battered body as well as Alessandra fit my hands, but it’d do.
The last thing out of the chest was my bandolier, loaded with a dozen cartridges. Fired
the first one, just to make sure the powder hadn’t spoiled. Eleven shots left, but that was
fine. There were only nine bandits. I’d faced monsters, desperadoes, and even a mutant
dragon. Nine murderous fools weren’t going to stand a chance against me and Alessandra.
