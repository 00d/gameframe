STASIAN TECH
Stasian technology uses electricity to produce strange
and unpredictable effects, sometimes, but not always, in
conjunction with magic. The Stasian coils necessary to
power such technology are limited and hard to acquire,
making Stasian technological items extremely rare.
However, slow imports and smuggling into Ustalav have
led to development of items based upon the technology,
making these items easier to acquire than other rare
items, if one knows the right places to look. You can find
more information on Ustalavic innovations using Stasian
technology on page 225.
Technological Items
The following items utilize Stasian technology alongside
or in place of magical components.
GALVANIC MORTAL COIL
ITEM 10
RARE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Price 970 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx,
supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres
with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body
comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze
electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic
energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge
that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create
a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse’s
final memories. Galvanic mortal coils are even rarer than other
galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Effect You
drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while
attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage
their heart and possibly siphon their life force. The galvanic
mortal coil casts death knell on the creature (DC 27).
Activate (10 minutes) Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect
You implant the coil into a corpse. The coil casts talking
corpse on the body.
