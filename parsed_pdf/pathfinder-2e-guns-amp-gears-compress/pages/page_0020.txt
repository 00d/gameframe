have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains
the grapple and trip traits.
•	 Hampering Spikes (Melee Only): You’ve added long,
snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use
to impede your foes’ movement. Your innovation
gains the hampering and versatile P traits.
•	 Hefty Composition (Melee Only): Blunt surfaces
and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty
and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and
versatile B traits.
•	 Modular Head: You’ve constructed a multi-purpose,
adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or
you’ve made special ammunition you can swiftly
alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing (page 234).
When you Interact to use the modular trait, you
can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal
trait if it doesn’t currently have it, or to remove that
trait if it’s currently nonlethal.
• Pacification Tools (Melee Only): Softer materials
make your weapon suited to knock out
instead of kill, and special protrusions
let you catch weapons and disarm your
foes. Your innovation gains the disarm
and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to
apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with
your innovation.
•	 Razor Prongs (Melee Only): You can knock
down and slash your foes with sharp,
curved blades added to your weapon. Your
innovation gains the trip and versatile
S traits.
•	 Segmented
Frame:
Hinges,
clamps,
and telescoping parts make your
innovation
collapsible
and
adjustable. It gains the modular
trait for bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing (page 234). You
can Interact to collapse the
item down to light Bulk or to
return it to your normal form. When it’s collapsed to
light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants
you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and
DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.
EXPLODE
Your innovation is a creation barely held together by
your own engineering, always on the edge of completely
falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you
can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications
using special unstable actions. See the sidebar on page 17
for the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects
your innovation.
While inventors can learn various unstable actions
over their career, all at least know how to make their
innovation Explode.
EXPLODE [two-actions]
FIRE
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety
limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures
without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion
deals 2d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save to all creatures
in a 5-foot emanation around you (if you’re wearing or holding
the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation
is a minion).
At 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your
explosion’s damage by 1d6.
