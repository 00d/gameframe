The City at the Center of the World draws merchants
from across Golarion and points beyond, making it an
ideal place to seek out specialized items and services.
Clockworks can be found among the rare items for sale
in Absalom’s bazaars, and the city boasts several skilled
inventors and tinkers able to handle all sorts of different
custom commissions.
The Flow of Innovation
Absalom has long been a haven for innovation and the
development of new ideas and inventions alike. While
its immense size and crowded streets appeal to urbanites
more than to those who prefer the countryside, the city
consistently draws many inventors. Three key reasons
for the longstanding appeal to this diverse and eager
group are Absalom’s ready market for buyers, its
concentration of specialists, and the wide availability of
a variety of components.
Absalom’s size and prominent location make it a
buyer’s market for ordinary goods, as competition in the
city is extremely high. Eggs, plain furniture, or tools that
might command a reasonable price in tiny communities
such as Otari or Abberton sell at low prices here, or
don’t get purchased at all. The same isn’t true for
specialized items. Absalom remains arguably among
the best places in the Inner Sea region to sell specialized
goods. A cunning wind-up toy might not sell for any
price in a small community, where people don’t have
the time or coin for such luxuries. Inventors who live
far from a bustling city might plan to sell a specialized
device to a wealthy patron, but if the patron changes
their mind or lowers the price, there’s often not much
the seller can do. This isn’t the case in Absalom; no
matter how unusual or customized something is, there’s
guaranteed to be someone in the city willing to buy it.
Finding that buyer, of course, poses its own challenges.
The city’s market for specialized goods draws
specialists from far distances. If you’re in the business of
creating custom constructs or labor-saving devices, you
soon learn that living and working near your ultimate
market is more efficient. Proximity to specialists with
similar
interests—frequenting
the
same
vendors,
consulting the same reference libraries, and so on—
means you’re much more likely to find another specialist
