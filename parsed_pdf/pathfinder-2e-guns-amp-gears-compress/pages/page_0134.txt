Demolitionist
As rippling explosions bring a castle’s walls tumbling
down, you grin and wipe the stone dust of your
handiwork from your face. Brute force might work for
others, but applying science to place the right explosives
in just the right spot is essential to your craft.
Additional Feats: 4th Demolition Charge (Advanced
Player’s Guide 106); 6th Calculated Splash (Core
Rulebook 77); 8th Directional Bombs (Core Rulebook
78); 12th Expanded Splash (Core Rulebook 79)
DEMOLITIONIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
DEDICATION
DEDICATION
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You know how to set explosives to cause the maximum possible
damage to buildings and other structures. You become trained
in Engineering Lore or become an expert in it if you were
already trained. You gain the Set Explosives action.
Set Explosives [two-actions] (concentrate) Requirements You have 1 or 2
bombs in hand; Effect You attach the bombs to an inanimate
object within your reach, such as a door, wall, or column,
and rig them to detonate at a set time. The bombs
explode at a specific time you determine (such as after
your next action or at the start of your next turn, to
a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and
splash damage to the inanimate object. Combine
this damage for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses, and this damage ignores
an amount of the object’s Hardness equal
to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the
hazard take the bombs’ splash damage, also
combined for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses. As a reminder, since you
didn’t throw the bombs, Calculated
Splash and similar effects don’t
apply. Making sure your timing
is correct requires concentration,
so you can’t Set Explosives again
while you’re waiting for a previously
set bomb to detonate.
Special You can’t select another
dedication feat until you’ve gained two
other feats from the demolitionist
archetype.
SAFETY MEASURES
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
You’re often careful to be sure you’re not
hoisted on your own petard, or anyone
else’s, for that matter. When you have cover
from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage
caused by that bomb equal to half your level,
plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to
AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits
against your own bombs regardless of whether
you have cover.
EXPLOSIVE ENTRY [two-actions]
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites
Demolitionist
Dedication,
master
in
Engineering Lore
You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by
detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of
course! You Set Explosives on a door, window, container,
or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can
attempt an Engineering Lore check to Force Open the
target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls,
add that item bonus to your Engineering Lore check. Since
you’re blasting your way in, you can’t avoid breaking the
object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a
success instead.
CONTROLLED BLAST
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication; Calculated Splash,
Directional Bombs, or Expanded Splash
You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives
by controlling every possible parameter of the
blast meticulously. If you have the Directional
Bombs feats, you can use it with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge, even though you didn’t throw
the bombs. If you have the Calculated Splash
or Expanded Splash feats, you can apply the
additional splash damage to one of the bombs
when you Set Explosives or use Demolition
Charge, and you can apply the increased
splash area from Expanded Splash to all
the bombs.
COLLAPSE WALL [reaction]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
Trigger A creature moves into the bombs’
splash area.
Requirements You’re within 30 feet of an area
where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or
similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge.
You detonate the required bombs in order
to bring a wall down on a creature. If
your bombs deal enough damage to
reduce the wall’s Hit Points below its
Broken Threshold, the wall partially
collapses on the creature. The creature
takes bludgeoning damage equal to the
damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex
save; the DC for this save is equal to
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher). On a failure, they must spend an
Interact action to dig themselves out of
the collapse, and on a critical failure,
they must spend 2 Interact actions
to do so.
