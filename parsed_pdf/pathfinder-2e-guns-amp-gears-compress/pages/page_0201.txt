1ST LEVEL
ADAPTIVE VISION

DWARF

After years of using black powder weaponry in dimly lit
spaces, you’ve become accustomed to dazzling flashes

FEAT 1

region, you display your lineage with a clan pistol, rather
than a clan dagger. You get one clan pistol of your clan for
free, as it was given to you at birth. This replaces your clan
dagger. Selling this pistol is a terrible taboo and earns you
the disdain of other dwarves. You are trained with the clan
pistol. In addition, when your clan pistol is visible, you gain
a +1 circumstance bonus on checks to Gather Information
or Make an Impression when interacting with citizens of
Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or their allies.
