Steam Cloud Whenever the steam cart takes collision
damage, its engine expels a dense cloud of steam in
a 5-foot emanation. The steam cart and all creatures in
the steam become concealed, and creatures outside the
steam become concealed to creatures within it. The steam
dissipates in 1 round.

SAND DIVER
VEHICLE 3
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 155 gp
A sand diver is a vaguely scorpion-shaped vehicle that uses
alchemical reactions to propel itself. The tail-like structure
acts as a heat sink and releases alchemical fumes behind the
diver as it burrows. Instead of pincers, it has two burrowing
mechanisms in front that allow it to dig through sand.
Space 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, 6 feet high

Speed 20 feet, burrow 10 feet (alchemical)
Collision 2d10 (DC 18)
Shard Trail A sand diver can only burrow through sand,
using the heat and flame from its alchemical core to slowly
dig its way through. The alchemical fumes left behind
become trapped belowground as it Burrows, temporarily
catalyzing fragments of sand into a glass‑like byproduct.
Creatures that Burrow through a space this vehicle has
Burrowed through within the last 24 hours take 1d12
piercing damage from the shards (DC 17 basic Fortitude
save). A creature that continues Burrowing through
a stretch of the same space the sand diver recently
Burrowed through must continue to attempt this save
the first time each round that it Burrows through the
shards.
Sluggish This vehicle must move twice its length for each
90-degree turn it makes.
