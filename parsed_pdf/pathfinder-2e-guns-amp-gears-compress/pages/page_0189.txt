THE ROTATING GEAR
My adventure started years ago when I left the port of Goka. I would like to say it was my
curiosity that drew me away from the place of my birth. It is more accurate, however, if
I also mention that several bounty hunters sought me on warrants for piracy. Regardless,
my impending capture also served as my opportunity to seek new horizons, and I arranged
passage to Vudra with a talented smuggler from whom I bought my powder kegs.
The trek across that land was educational. Vudrani methods of mixing black powder are
different than the process I learned, and their formula seems more stable, if less potent.
I also discovered strange wonders imported from even farther west. Clockwork toys that
move about under their own power—what kind of society could have the excess to craft
such devices? I asked that question and discovered an answer: Absalom.
So my journey continued ever westward. I had to see this fabled city, this monument
to humanity’s curiosity. Boarding a ship in Katheer, I exchanged drinks with a dwarf
captain whose clockwork hand was nimble and refined, and I listened with rapt attention
as he told me his story of crossing a blasted wasteland to reach the city of Alkenstar
and obtain the prosthetic to replace the hook that had served him for many years. And
finally, Absalom! Jewel of the Inner Sea! Repository of wonders from across the globe! A
fitting home for a man who has seen half the world and hopes to see the rest.
