MOBILITY DEVICES
Over the history of Golarion, countless cultures have used innovative mobility devices.
While you can find more information, as well as several magical mobility devices and
additional add-ons, on page 66 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, additional
devices appropriate to the themes of invention and innovation can be found in this section.
Wheelchairs
Wheelchairs provide comfort and support when traveling.
You can use the item either in an ambulatory manner or
every day, depending on your character. Wheelchairs come
in a variety of sizes to suit every person regardless of height
or body type. Each wheelchair has the following features.
Adjustable Seat Belts: These belts strap around your
waist, knees, and shins to keep you in the chair if it’s
thrown, knocked or handled roughly. You can open and
release all of your belts with an Interact action.
Bulk Limit: A wheelchair is strong enough to support
you and any amount of Bulk you could typically hold
or carry (Core Rulebook 272). Sum up the Bulk of all
the items you are wearing, carrying, and stowing on your
wheelchair. You take the usual consequences when there
is too much Bulk on you and your wheelchair: if there is
more than 5 + your Strength modifier, you’re encumbered,
and you and your wheelchair can’t hold or carry more
than 10 + your Strength modifier. The wheelchair’s own
Bulk does not count against your Bulk limit while riding
in the wheelchair; it’s listed in case you need to carry the
wheelchair separately.
Frame: A wheelchair is typically made from common
materials like wood. It can also be made from other
materials such as steel, or rarer materials like mithral. The
wheelchairs presented in this section are assumed to be
made from durable wood.
Magic: The wheelchair is considered an extension
of yourself. Spells or abilities that change your bodily
form are also applied to the chair and it transforms
