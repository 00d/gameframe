SIEGE WEAPONS
Shattering towering palisades. Mowing down hordes of soldiers. Breaking through
barred castle gates. All of these tasks call for something heftier than the typical armaments
carried by the common soldier: siege weapons. These massive, often‑complex devices
require full crews to operate. In significant numbers, they allow attackers to lay siege
to entire fortifications, just as their name would suggest.
There are two categories of siege weapons: mounted and
portable. Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size
and space, typically have defensive statistics, and are used
for large-scale warfare. More adaptable are portable
siege weapons, such as battering rams, which can be
carried more easily and can serve a valuable role during
large-scale warfare, smaller conflicts, or even exploration.
All siege weapons need more than one person to operate
them, working together as a crew. These crew members all
need to be adjacent to the siege weapon for it to operate.
A siege weapon’s stat block lists the minimum number
needed and the maximum crew size. Adding additional
crew beyond the minimum is useful for ensuring a quick
and successful Load in uncertain conditions and allowing
for enough time to Aim the siege weapon when firing at
a moving target.
Mounted Siege Weapons
Properly using a mounted siege weapon involves three
activities: Loading, Aiming, and Launching the payload.
Generally, none of these activities can be taken unless the
weapon has enough crew, but the GM might allow a smaller
crew or even an individual to perform simpler parts of the
process, like Launching—especially at a dramatic moment!
AIMING
A cumbersome mounted siege weapon can’t be Aimed in
a moment like a bow could be. A member of the weapon’s
