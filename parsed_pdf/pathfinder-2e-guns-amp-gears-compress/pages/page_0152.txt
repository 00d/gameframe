Repeating: Repeating weapons can’t be loaded
with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows
and firearms can; instead, they require a magazine of
specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special
slot. Once the magazine is in place, the ammunition is
automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to
fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry
(typically 0).
