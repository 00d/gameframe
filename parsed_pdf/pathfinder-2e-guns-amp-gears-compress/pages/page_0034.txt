end the dying condition don’t work to save a construct
companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the
Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill
instead of Medicine. Second, instead of gaining and
tracking the wounded condition, if your construct
becomes broken in this way more than twice within
a 10-minute period, it’s destroyed, and you’ll need to
reconstruct it by spending a day of downtime.
Immunities
Because it’s a construct, your construct companion
is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed,
drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal
attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious.
Because the construct isn’t a living creature, effects that
heal living creatures can’t help it recover Hit Points.
Restoring Hit Points to it requires using the Repair
action or other means that can restore Hit Points to
objects and nonliving creatures.
Senses
Your construct companion has precise vision, imprecise
hearing, and vague touch senses, but no sense of smell
or taste.
Speed
Your construct companion has a Speed of 25 feet.

to an advanced construct companion (usually a

Perception and all saving throws
to expert.
•	 Increase its proficiency ranks
in Intimidation, Stealth, and
Survival to trained. If the
construct is your innovation
and it was already trained
in those skills from a
modification, increase its
proficiency rank in those
skills to expert.
•	 You can change your
companion’s Size, if you
want, to either Small, Medium, or Large.
INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To improve an advanced construct companion to an
incredible construct companion, make the following
adjustments.

Wisdom modifiers by 2.

Acrobatics to expert.

construct companion, make the following adjustments.
