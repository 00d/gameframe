MARUT
A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artiﬁcially extending
their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and
vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth,
use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on
the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable
pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target
is dead.
Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move
with the deliberate grace of a creature made of ﬂesh and bone. A marut never
rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though
able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.

Final End The marut is anathema to beings that unnaturally
extend their existence, including undead. Its ﬁsts bypass such
creatures’ resistances to damage and apply the creatures’ highest weakness to
damage. If a marut kills a creature that rejuvenates, like a lich or ghost, it always
knows that the creature isn’t fully defeated.
Fists of Thunder and Lightning (divine, evocation, incapacitation) Each time the
marut makes a ﬁst Strike, it chooses either lightning or thunder. If it chooses
lightning, the attack deals an additional 2d12 electricity damage and the
target must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 minute. If it
chooses thunder, the attack deals an additional 3d8 sonic damage and the target
must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute.
BYTHOS
The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out
those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly
humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds
and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos
seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional
travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have
become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area
and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no
qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a
bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time
speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from
time and space.
PSYCHOPOMP ALLIES
The mandate of marut inevitables
is similar to that of psychopomps.
Generally, the practical psychopomps
are content to let an unyielding
marut complete its mission and
swoop in afterward to ensure the
work has been done, but occasionally,
they may work together.

it’s confused for 1 round (or 1d4 rounds on a critical failure).

Aging Strikes ʚʖ (divine, necromancy) The bythos
make two ﬁst Strikes against a single target. If both
Strikes hit, the target attempts a DC 37 Fortitude
save. Creatures that don’t get weaker with age or
don’t age are immune (GM’s discretion). If a creature becomes clumsy 4,
drained 4, and enfeebled 4 due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1,
or increases each of these conditions by 1. This eﬀect is
cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a
maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature becomes
clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2, or increases
these conditions by 2.
Focused Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate) The bythos focuses its
gaze on a creature it can see within 30 feet. The
target must attempt a save against the bythos’s
confusing gaze. A bythos can’t use this ability
against the same creature more than once per turn.
Temporal Flurry ʚʖ The bythos makes four ﬁst
Strikes. Its multiple attack penalty increases normally
with each attack.
Temporal Strike ʚʖ (divine, conjuration, incapacitation, teleportation) The
bythos touches a creature or object to displace it from time. The target
attempts a DC 37 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success Time ﬂows around the target; the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target disappears from the present moment and reappears
in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed for it.
If a creature or object occupies that space when the target returns, the
target appears in the closest available space to its original location.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is slowed 1 for an extra 1d4 rounds after
it returns.
GUARDIANS OF TIME
Bythos aeons have no innate ability
to directly enter the mysterious
Dimension of Time, but many know
of the hidden routes in the Great
Beyond one can use to travel to this
strange realm. A bythos prefers to
destroy those who seek entrance to
the Dimension of Time rather than
risk the knowledge of how to reach it
spreading too far.

WHAT IS A DEVA?
Three types of devas exist among
the angelic host, all of which serve
as angelic “ﬁeld agents.” Of the types
of angels, devas are the ones most
likely to be encountered dwelling
somewhere other than Nirvana, as
these angels focus their work on
cultivating and protecting goodness
in mortal souls, be they living or dead.
MONADIC DEVA (SOUL ANGEL)
Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal
realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to ﬁsh souls out for their own use
stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas
ﬁght. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of
Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts.
Monadic devas often ﬁnd their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps,
and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between
their views on a soul’s inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs
220 pounds.

Holy Armaments (divine, evocation) Any weapon gains the eﬀect of a

Rebuke Soul Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, enchantment, good, incapacitation)
The monadic deva speaks a word to cause a creature’s soul to recoil at
its sins or an undead creature to recoil at its lack of a soul. One non-good living or undead
target within 40 feet takes 5d10 good damage and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save.
Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target takes half damage and is stunned 1.
Failure The target takes full damage and is stunned 2.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is stunned 4.
Solid Blow (divine, evocation, force) When a monadic deva hits a target for the second
time during its turn with its mace, it deals an additional 2d12 force damage as its
weapon shimmers with ripples of power.
PLANETAR (JUSTICE ANGEL)
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient
of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often
leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the
importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic
hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture.
In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They
stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.

PLANETAR JUSTICE
Planetars know pathways to travel
between many planes of existence,
and they use these frequently to
deliver messages, warnings, and
ultimatums to those whose actions
have attracted angelic concern. If a
situation can be resolved with swift
on-the-spot justice, a planetar takes
that route in hopes of staving oﬀ an
escalation of violence.

SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.

DAEMON HARBINGERS
The four Horsemen are the most
powerful of the daemonic demigods,
but they are only four of many. Far
more daemonic harbingers dwell on
Abaddon, each a unique and powerful
demigod in their own right that
enjoys sweeping inﬂuence among
daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector
(ruler of the slave city of Awaiting
Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian
(consort to the Horseman of Famine),
and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame
(patron to arsonists and agent of the
Horseman of War) are but three of
the dozens of harbingers who rule
realms in Abaddon.

Derghodaemon’s Stare Ȱɵ (divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) A
non-evil target must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become confused for 1 round, or 1
minute on a critical failure. It is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
Savage Assault ʚʖ The derghodaemon makes up to ﬁve claw
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count
toward the derghodaemon’s multiple attack penalty, but the
penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
Swarming Infestation ʚʖ The derghodaemon spews a
large swarm, making a swarm spit Strike against up to
two adjacent targets within range. Whether or not the
targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reﬂex
save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually
hit by the swarm spit). Persistent damage caused
by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the
creature takes any amount of damage from
an area eﬀect. The derghodaemon can’t use
this ability for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The swarm disperses as soon
as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage.
Success The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 1d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Failure The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 2d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the hissing sounds
caused by the infestation also cause the target to
become confused for 1 round; this additional eﬀect
has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.
THANADAEMON (DEATH DAEMON)
Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons
represent death via old age. They are among the
most patient daemons, and prefer to bide
their time to enact far-reaching, decades-
long plans rather than ﬁght (though they
are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman
of Death, they ply the waters of the River
Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are
thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar
(which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the
river’s muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.

LOOTING EARTH ELEMENTALS
Earth elementals sometimes have
valuable gemstones or minerals
incorporated into their bodies,
and once they are slain, these
valuables can be scavenged as
treasure. Gemstones, precious
metals such as silver or gold ore,
or rarer materials such as mithral
or adamantine can be harvested
from these creatures, although the
more expensive finds tend to be
incorporated into only the most
powerful earth elementals.
Elemental, Earth
Certain earth elementals manifest as speciﬁc types of material, be they boulders,
sand, or crystals.
LIVING BOULDER
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones
and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship’s hull covered in barnacles.
Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders ﬁll much the same role
on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.

Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and
featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace.
The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area
of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles,
making them well suited for long-term service.

MEPHIT INTERACTIONS
Diﬀerent types of mephits that can
be found on the same elemental
plane often develop friendly (or, in
some cases, ﬁerce) rivalries with
one another. While mephits from
elementally opposed planes (such
as ﬁre and water) may have strong
opinions about the superiority of
their own element, the fact that they
rarely see such mephits means that
when they do encounter them, they
often get along better than they do
with their close neighbors.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits are small, weak creatures that serve at the whims of other elemental entities.
The mephits presented here are less common than air mephits, earth mephits, and the
like, as they are a blend of two different elements rather than focusing on one alone.
DUST MEPHIT
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency
to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insigniﬁcant
and minor difﬁculty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making
themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They
tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.

ICE MEPHIT
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their ﬁre mephit kin, ice
mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most
mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company.
Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness,
and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
few moral qualms about acting selﬁshly
and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
should the chance arise.

MASTERS OF ADAPTATION
Kayals understand that many
Material Plane cultures view them
with suspicion or even fear, and
take pains to adapt to cultures with
which they seek to establish trade.
Unfortunately, kayals’ mastery
at cultural adaptation can often
backﬁre, leading to fears that the
so-called “fetchlings” are an invading
force that seeks to duplicate and
replace those with whom they
merely wish to do business.
Fetchling
The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from
generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer
human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic
in coloration, with ﬂesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all
shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid
yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.
Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane,
often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures
there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d’ziriaks. While individual
fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment,
which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the
regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they
trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks
or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.
Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the
event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don’t mind traveling to and
blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react
defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of
the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the
worst of interlopers might make sense to some.
Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane;
most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who
have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere,
exiles who were banished from their homelands,
or planar castaways with no ability to return to the
Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded,
are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities
of signiﬁcant size, one can sometimes even ﬁnd a small community of
a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so
subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing
layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.

TAIGA GIANT CLANS
Each taiga giant clan links its identity
to the deeds of their most famous
ancestors and heroes. Names such
as Cliﬀsmiter and Mountainripper
hint at legendary accomplishments,
though the stories are rarely shared
with outsiders.
TAIGA GIANT
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one
area’s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant
wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
ancestors’ spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when
they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They
occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than
malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people.
Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating
event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants
by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are
scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in
everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of
those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly
than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that
ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the
ﬁrst rune giants is a sureﬁre way to earn a taiga giant’s unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.

GREATER RITUAL GATES
Well-versed and knowledgeable lurkers
in light can lead groups of their kind in
a more advanced Ritual Gate to enable
travel to other planes, rather than
just summoning. Doing so requires
the sacriﬁce of a creature of equal or
greater size to the lurker in light who
wishes to travel the planes. Multiple
lurkers in light can travel in this way,
but this requires multiple sacriﬁces.
The creation of a greater Ritual Gate is
a 1-hour activity, at the end of which
all aﬀected lurkers in light travel to the
same plane, chosen from the Material
Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or
the First World.
Lurker in Light
These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile
wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in
a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they’ve been seen to take
particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness.
With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in
light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light
are benign and friendly.
While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are
often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading
the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there—not to help, but to
spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.

Lurker’s Glow (evocation, light, primal) A creature that takes damage
from a lurker in light’s mote of light must attempt a DC 22

Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily
immune to lurker’s glow for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is lined in golden light for
1 minute and can’t be concealed during
this time. If the creature becomes
invisible, it is concealed rather
than being undetected.
Critical Failure As failure, but the
creature sheds bright light in
a 20-foot emanation for the
duration of the eﬀect. In addition, the creature is dazzled on its
ﬁrst turn after failing this save.
Ritual Gate Ȱɵ (conjuration, primal) Requirements The lurker
in light has reduced a living creature to 0 Hit Points on
this turn or its previous turn and has a summon fey innate
spell available; Eﬀect The lurker in light casts summon fey
with only a verbal component, using the act of slaughter to
replace the normal material and somatic components for the spell. If the fey creature
summoned has the same alignment as the lurker in light, the lurker in light can sustain
the summon fey spell for up to 1 hour instead of 1 minute.
Sneak Attack A lurker in light’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to
ﬂat‑footed creatures.

FEY MANIPULATORS
Marrmoras exert a strange and
subtle dominance over other fey.
The fey under their control are ﬁlled
with both horror at the destruction
wrought by marrmoras and
fascination with their ﬁery power.
Marrmora
On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged
by ﬁre and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildﬁre devastates a wilderness
region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras
can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction.
They seek to reignite the ﬁres that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon
the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of
dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away
from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage
and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent
interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with
others only as a means to more efﬁciently spread their ﬁery devastation.
A marmorra’s twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark
has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands
ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken ﬂesh looks like charcoal‑burnt
wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They
trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies.
Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants
roasting in the ﬂames of their carefully curated ﬁres, there is little that
brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant
creatures cooking to a crisp.

INHUMAN MURDERERS
While it’s true that most mohrgs
seem to rise from the corpses of
humanoid killers, the capacity to
murder is not limited to humanoids.
Mohrgs of other sorts could certainly
exist—as long as they come from a
society that has the capacity not
only to judge and execute, but also to
harbor murder within their hearts.
Mohrg
The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime
of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or
sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch
their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise
after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.
Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally
in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They
seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt
locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even
skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their
nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no
longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to
turn living towns into mass graves.
Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of
a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only
on a society’s dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg’s control, a canny
mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a
point where it feels conﬁdent unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement.
Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking
out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting,
mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are
valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.

1d4 rounds, on its turn. This mohrg spawn is under the command
of the mohrg that created it. If the creator of the mohrg spawn

Strike must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The creature can
attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases
by 1 on each attempt.
MOHRG SPAWN
When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its ﬂesh decays away save
for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead
trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a
living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg’s immunities
and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack
that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack
that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the
mohrg spawn’s level (Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook 503). Mohrg spawn cannot
create mohrg spawn of their own.

DOMINION SEEDLINGS
Moonflower seeds are tough and

fire of reentry into a planet’s

These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged
blossoms. A gaping mouth sits at the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most
creatures smaller than the moonﬂower whole. Moonﬂowers can move slowly on
their powerful roots or use them to attack, but usually they dig them deeply into
the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey.
Though moonﬂowers can’t speak in the conventional sense, they communicate
telepathically with other moonﬂowers. Explorers who encounter a single
moonﬂower can thus be assured that any other moonﬂowers in the vicinity will
be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonﬂower’s telepathic
communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over
by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream
of the future shared by all moonﬂowers is unknown.
Moonﬂowers are alien life‑forms from a long-dead planet, but
their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been ensured through the
machinations of the Dominion of the Black, a sinister, alien organization from
the dark places between the stars.

MORLOCK MACHINERY
Morlocks tend toward brutish actions
and violent traditions and have little
interest in bettering their societies
or creating art. However, they have
a strange obsession with ancient
machinery and magical items,
particularly clockwork constructions.
Their knack for tinkering helps
keep ancient guardians and traps
functional, even if their work
backﬁres now and then.
Morlock
Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal
monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands.
Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and
their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four‑limbed shufﬂe
for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the
surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient
homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as
gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.
Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food,
even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks
encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger.
A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.

Instinctual Tinker ʚʖ The morlock tinkers with an adjacent
construct or mechanical hazard. They attempt a
Crafting check against the construct’s or

MALARIA STRAINS
This pernicious disease is often
associated with mosquitoes. The
most common version of malaria
is presented on page 118 of the
Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
and while the variants inﬂicted
by mosquito swarms and giant
mosquitoes are deadlier, they don’t
have the chance to recur after
1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also
causes weakness and fevers, while
septic malaria causes painful and
infected lesions to form on the
body. Regardless of the strain you
contract, you can’t reduce your
sickened condition while you are
aﬀected with malaria.
Mosquito
While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their
giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous.
FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal
swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms
are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid
months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the
waterfront reaches of settlements.

often prey upon megafauna like dinosaurs and other large
creatures, but they won’t turn down a chance to drink the
blood of a smaller target—such as a humanoid.

NATURAL WARNINGS
Regions haunted by bog mummies
lack small animals, insects, and
other wildlife. A character who is
Investigating, Searching, or Scouting
during exploration mode can attempt
a secret Nature check against the
bog mummy’s Stealth DC to notice
something sinister. A critical success
is enough to speciﬁcally suggest the
presence of undead in the area.
Mummy, Bog
The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can
become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading
undead monstrosities.
Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever,
leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artiﬁcially
preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals
but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or
muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from
the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed
inﬂuence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething
need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unﬁnished at the time of
death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of
this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife
beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body
was disposed of does the rest.
Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulﬁll their
dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the
living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into
their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes,
driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to
the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.

can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn. A creature that
succeeds is temporarily immune to breath of the bog for 24 hours.

EXCEPTIONS TO EVIL
While most undead are evil, revenants
are not—these unusual stalkers rise
not out of a sense of cruelty or hatred
of the living, but spontaneously from
the need for vengeance following
a deep betrayal. One can avoid a
revenant’s wrath by simply getting
out of its way—unless you happen to
be its reason for unlife!
Revenant
Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and
are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom
is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or
abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise
from their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might
legitimately be considered an accident if the revenant doesn’t understand the full
circumstances of their demise. In such cases, it doesn’t matter that the “murderer”
may not have intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never
forgive. Revenants have little memory of their lives other than anything they
might need to recall in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.

Self-Loathing (emotion, mental, visual) If a revenant sees their own
reﬂection or any object that was important to them in life, they
must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
Critical Success The revenant is unaﬀected and can no
longer be aﬀected by that reﬂection or object in this way.
Success The revenant is distracted by self-loathing and
becomes slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The revenant becomes fascinated by the source that triggered
their self-loathing and does everything they can to destroy it until the end of
the revenant’s next turn.
Critical Failure The revenant becomes immobilized as long as the source of their
self-loathing is apparent, until they’re attacked, or until they see their murderer.
Undying Vendetta (emotion, necromancy, occult) If the revenant’s murderer
dies, the revenant is immediately destroyed. A revenant that can’t sense their
murderer must attempt a DC 11 ﬂat check once every 24 hours to avoid becoming
immobilized and prone; they immediately rise again once they can sense their
murderer. A murderer who becomes undead does not trigger the revenant’s
destruction until the murderer is ﬁnally destroyed. The revenant gains a +2

wails horribly. Each creature within a 60-foot burst must attempt a DC 23
Will save. Regardless of the outcome of their saving throw, aﬀected creatures
are then immune to Baleful Shriek for 1 hour. The revenant’s murderer never
improves their degree of success due to this ability’s incapacitation trait. The
revenant can’t use Baleful Shriek again for 1d4 rounds.
