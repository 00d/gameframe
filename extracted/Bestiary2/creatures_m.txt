Bestiary 2
MARUT
A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artiﬁcially extending
their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and
vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth,
use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on
the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable
pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target
is dead.
Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move
with the deliberate grace of a creature made of ﬂesh and bone. A marut never
rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though
able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.

Final End The marut is anathema to beings that unnaturally
extend their existence, including undead. Its ﬁsts bypass such
creatures’ resistances to damage and apply the creatures’ highest weakness to
damage. If a marut kills a creature that rejuvenates, like a lich or ghost, it always
knows that the creature isn’t fully defeated.
Fists of Thunder and Lightning (divine, evocation, incapacitation) Each time the
marut makes a ﬁst Strike, it chooses either lightning or thunder. If it chooses
lightning, the attack deals an additional 2d12 electricity damage and the
target must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 minute. If it
chooses thunder, the attack deals an additional 3d8 sonic damage and the target
must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute.
BYTHOS
The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out
those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly
humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds
and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos
seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional
travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have
become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area
and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no
qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a
bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time
speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from
time and space.
PSYCHOPOMP ALLIES
The mandate of marut inevitables
is similar to that of psychopomps.
Generally, the practical psychopomps
are content to let an unyielding
marut complete its mission and
swoop in afterward to ensure the
work has been done, but occasionally,
they may work together.

# MOVANIC DEVA
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
Angel
Angels are benevolent messengers who aid good forces in the ﬁght against evil.
Each angel has a special aura that assists in their individual tasks, and each angel
delivers certain types of messages and performs other duties for the angelic
hosts. While most angels live in the enlightened realm of Nirvana, some serve
the forces of Heaven and Elysium, especially in the case of the angel empyreal
lords within those two realms. Angels organize themselves into choirs depending
on their ranks and roles.
MOVANIC DEVA (GUARDIAN ANGEL)
Movanic devas are stewards of the ﬂow of good creatures’ souls through the cycle
of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels
arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a speciﬁc
connection with a creature’s vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most
concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives,
so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva
leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of
their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within
animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent
as well, thus increasing the ﬂow of goodness into the afterlife. They also
spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy
Plane, seeking to contain signiﬁcant threats to life.

throws, resistance 10 to positive and negative damage,
and are unharmed by the eﬀects of a plane’s positive and
negative traits. Animals in the aura of 12th level or lower
don’t attack the movanic deva or the deva’s allies unless
they are controlled or otherwise forced to attack.

Rituals DC 29; angelic messenger, awaken animal
Dispelling Field ʚʖ (divine, transmutation) Frequency once per
day; Eﬀect The movanic deva attempts to unravel unwelcome
magic eﬀects on allies within its aura of vitality to protect them
from malevolent forces. The movanic deva attempts a counteract
check against as many spell eﬀects aﬀecting allies in the area as it
wishes with a +19 counteract modiﬁer and a counteract level of 4,
rolling once for the selected eﬀects.
Flaming Armaments (divine, transmutation) When a movanic deva wields
a weapon, that weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming rune.
THE GIFT OF SAPIENCE
When a movanic deva awakens an
animal, the animal becomes neutral
good and is well-disposed toward
the deva, but the deva understands
that free will is an important part of
life. While the deva provides enough
support and guidance to the animal
to help it adjust to its newly sapient
world view, not all animals awakened
in this way remain on the path of good.

WHAT IS A DEVA?
Three types of devas exist among
the angelic host, all of which serve
as angelic “ﬁeld agents.” Of the types
of angels, devas are the ones most
likely to be encountered dwelling
somewhere other than Nirvana, as
these angels focus their work on
cultivating and protecting goodness
in mortal souls, be they living or dead.
MONADIC DEVA (SOUL ANGEL)
Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal
realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to ﬁsh souls out for their own use
stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas
ﬁght. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of
Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts.
Monadic devas often ﬁnd their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps,
and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between
their views on a soul’s inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs
220 pounds.

Rebuke Soul Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, enchantment, good, incapacitation)
The monadic deva speaks a word to cause a creature’s soul to recoil at
its sins or an undead creature to recoil at its lack of a soul. One non-good living or undead
target within 40 feet takes 5d10 good damage and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save.

Solid Blow (divine, evocation, force) When a monadic deva hits a target for the second
time during its turn with its mace, it deals an additional 2d12 force damage as its
weapon shimmers with ripples of power.
PLANETAR (JUSTICE ANGEL)
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient
of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often
leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the
importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic
hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture.
In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They
stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.

Bestiary 2
PLANETAR JUSTICE
Planetars know pathways to travel
between many planes of existence,
and they use these frequently to
deliver messages, warnings, and
ultimatums to those whose actions
have attracted angelic concern. If a
situation can be resolved with swift
on-the-spot justice, a planetar takes
that route in hopes of staving oﬀ an
escalation of violence.

# MELADAEMON
================================================================================


FORMED IN HIS IMAGE
Meladaemons have always been
gaunt and bestial, but they didn’t
always resemble jackals. When
Trelmarixian overthrew the previous
Horseman of Famine, one of his
ﬁrst acts as a ruler of Abaddon was
to forcibly twist the appearance of
his deacon caste to resemble his
own wicked form. He went on to
imbue meladaemons with other
jackal-like aspects as it suited him,
further warping them and cementing
their fealty.

Consumptive Aura (aura, divine) 20 feet. A meladaemon emanates an aura of intense
hunger. Each round a creature begins its turn in the aura, it must attempt a DC 27
Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 negative damage (2d6 on a critical
failure) and becomes fatigued. This fatigue ends as soon as the creature eats any food.

must immediately attempt a save against the meladaemon’s withering touch.

Withering Touch (divine, evil, necromancy) When the
meladaemon hits with a claw Strike or a creature
begins its turn grabbed by the meladaemon, the
creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 negative
damage and becomes fatigued. This fatigue
ends when the creature drinks.
DERGHODAEMON (RAVAGER DAEMON)
Derghodaemons
represent
death
through
unfathomable violence and being eaten alive.
Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to
bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the
elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inﬂict the same twisted
and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons
derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these ﬁends, the quicker they can
enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim
and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected
to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long—
the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience
severe visual warping. The derghodaemon’s appearance becomes more and more
twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous
urges to inﬂict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horriﬁc attack
derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming
infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of
ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death,
provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp
of the insects’ bodies don’t drive them to violent fury ﬁrst!

DAEMON HARBINGERS
The four Horsemen are the most
powerful of the daemonic demigods,
but they are only four of many. Far
more daemonic harbingers dwell on
Abaddon, each a unique and powerful
demigod in their own right that
enjoys sweeping inﬂuence among
daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector
(ruler of the slave city of Awaiting
Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian
(consort to the Horseman of Famine),
and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame
(patron to arsonists and agent of the
Horseman of War) are but three of
the dozens of harbingers who rule
realms in Abaddon.

# MELODY ON THE WIND
================================================================================

Noxious Fumes ʚʖ Requirement The belker occupies the same space as a Medium
or smaller creature; Eﬀect The belker attempts to ﬂow into the creature’s lungs; the
creature must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature partially
inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and
lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing
and succeeding at a DC 23 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the
creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature’s
space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.
Smoke Slash Ȱɵ Requirement The belker is partially inhaled by a creature; Eﬀect The
belker automatically deals its claw damage to the inhaling creature by forming a claw
to slash and scrape the creature from within.
MELODY ON THE WIND
This cloud of song and sound has been caught
by the wind and carried across the air. While
the melody on the wind (known by some as a song
elemental, despite the fact that no such place as a plane of song
exists in the known multiverse) might enjoy the beauty of music, it is
by nature a destructive elemental force.

LOOTING EARTH ELEMENTALS
Earth elementals sometimes have
valuable gemstones or minerals
incorporated into their bodies,
and once they are slain, these
valuables can be scavenged as
treasure. Gemstones, precious
metals such as silver or gold ore,
or rarer materials such as mithral
or adamantine can be harvested
from these creatures, although the
more expensive finds tend to be
incorporated into only the most
powerful earth elementals.
Elemental, Earth
Certain earth elementals manifest as speciﬁc types of material, be they boulders,
sand, or crystals.
LIVING BOULDER
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones
and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship’s hull covered in barnacles.
Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders ﬁll much the same role
on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.

MEPHIT INTERACTIONS
Diﬀerent types of mephits that can
be found on the same elemental
plane often develop friendly (or, in
some cases, ﬁerce) rivalries with
one another. While mephits from
elementally opposed planes (such
as ﬁre and water) may have strong
opinions about the superiority of
their own element, the fact that they
rarely see such mephits means that
when they do encounter them, they
often get along better than they do
with their close neighbors.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits are small, weak creatures that serve at the whims of other elemental entities.
The mephits presented here are less common than air mephits, earth mephits, and the
like, as they are a blend of two different elements rather than focusing on one alone.
DUST MEPHIT
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency
to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insigniﬁcant
and minor difﬁculty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making
themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They
tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.

MASTERS OF ADAPTATION
Kayals understand that many
Material Plane cultures view them
with suspicion or even fear, and
take pains to adapt to cultures with
which they seek to establish trade.
Unfortunately, kayals’ mastery
at cultural adaptation can often
backﬁre, leading to fears that the
so-called “fetchlings” are an invading
force that seeks to duplicate and
replace those with whom they
merely wish to do business.
Fetchling
The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from
generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer
human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic
in coloration, with ﬂesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all
shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid
yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.
Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane,
often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures
there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d’ziriaks. While individual
fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment,
which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the
regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they
trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks
or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.
Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the
event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don’t mind traveling to and
blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react
defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of
the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the
worst of interlopers might make sense to some.
Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane;
most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who
have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere,
exiles who were banished from their homelands,
or planar castaways with no ability to return to the
Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded,
are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities
of signiﬁcant size, one can sometimes even ﬁnd a small community of
a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so
subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing
layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.

# MARSH GIANT
================================================================================


GAFFS
Many marsh giants ﬁght with
oversized gaﬀs—lengths of wood
with a single metal spike aﬃxed
to the tip. Used often by ﬁsherfolk
to land ﬁsh, marsh giants use their
gaﬀs as weapons. A gaﬀ sized for
a Medium creature is a common
martial weapon in the club group.
It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage
and has 1 Bulk. It requires one
hand to use and has the trip and
versatile P weapon traits. Gaﬀs are
readily available in ﬁshing or coastal
settlements for 1 gp.
MARSH GIANT
Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps, marsh giants
are hideous in appearance indeed, with ﬁshlike mouths, slimy gray-green skin, and
dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the ﬂesh of those they slay in battle, but many
are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in
check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the
risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.
Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to
zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no
central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the
demon lord Dagon, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from
the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.
Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location,
but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep
draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who
look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and
screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for
any other residents of the area.
Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small
for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with
their zealotry.

TAIGA GIANT CLANS
Each taiga giant clan links its identity
to the deeds of their most famous
ancestors and heroes. Names such
as Cliﬀsmiter and Mountainripper
hint at legendary accomplishments,
though the stories are rarely shared
with outsiders.
TAIGA GIANT
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one
area’s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant
wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
ancestors’ spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when
they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They
occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than
malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people.
Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating
event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants
by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are
scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in
everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of
those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly
than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that
ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the
ﬁrst rune giants is a sureﬁre way to earn a taiga giant’s unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.

# MEGALANIA
================================================================================

Tongue Grab If the giant chameleon hits a creature with a
tongue Strike, that creature becomes grabbed by the
giant chameleon. The target isn’t immobilized, but it
can’t move beyond the reach of the giant chameleon’s
tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with an
attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing
damage. Though this doesn’t deal any damage to the
giant chameleon, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
MEGALANIA
Megalanias, like their smaller cousins the giant
monitor lizards, strike fast and use their powerful
bite to grip their prey. They prefer to swallow
their prey whole rather than risk others getting
a bite of a hard-won meal.

GREATER RITUAL GATES
Well-versed and knowledgeable lurkers
in light can lead groups of their kind in
a more advanced Ritual Gate to enable
travel to other planes, rather than
just summoning. Doing so requires
the sacriﬁce of a creature of equal or
greater size to the lurker in light who
wishes to travel the planes. Multiple
lurkers in light can travel in this way,
but this requires multiple sacriﬁces.
The creation of a greater Ritual Gate is
a 1-hour activity, at the end of which
all aﬀected lurkers in light travel to the
same plane, chosen from the Material
Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or
the First World.
Lurker in Light
These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile
wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in
a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they’ve been seen to take
particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness.
With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in
light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light
are benign and friendly.
While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are
often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading
the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there—not to help, but to
spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.

# MANDRAGORA
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
MANDRAGORA SUCKLINGS
Sometimes a mandragora oﬀers its
services to a spellcaster in exchange
for sustenance. Tales tell of sorcerers
or other magical creatures who keep
mandragora “familiars” whose loyalty
is sustained by feeding the little beasts
with their own blood. These tales
generally have gruesome endings
wherein the mandragora is overcome
with bloodlust and, unable to control
itself, devours its master.
Mandragora
A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed
shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious
little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon’s
blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon’s blood, the
root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.
Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained
lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While
they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and
they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs,
a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They ﬁnd the
ﬂavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing
these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.
While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil
plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of
giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces,
eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.

FEY MANIPULATORS
Marrmoras exert a strange and
subtle dominance over other fey.
The fey under their control are ﬁlled
with both horror at the destruction
wrought by marrmoras and
fascination with their ﬁery power.
Marrmora
On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged
by ﬁre and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildﬁre devastates a wilderness
region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras
can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction.
They seek to reignite the ﬁres that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon
the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of
dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away
from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage
and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent
interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with
others only as a means to more efﬁciently spread their ﬁery devastation.
A marmorra’s twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark
has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands
ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken ﬂesh looks like charcoal‑burnt
wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They
trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies.
Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants
roasting in the ﬂames of their carefully curated ﬁres, there is little that
brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant
creatures cooking to a crisp.

INHUMAN MURDERERS
While it’s true that most mohrgs
seem to rise from the corpses of
humanoid killers, the capacity to
murder is not limited to humanoids.
Mohrgs of other sorts could certainly
exist—as long as they come from a
society that has the capacity not
only to judge and execute, but also to
harbor murder within their hearts.
Mohrg
The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime
of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or
sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch
their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise
after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.
Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally
in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They
seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt
locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even
skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their
nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no
longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to
turn living towns into mass graves.
Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of
a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only
on a society’s dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg’s control, a canny
mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a
point where it feels conﬁdent unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement.
Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking
out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting,
mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are
valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.

Strike must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The creature can
attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases
by 1 on each attempt.
MOHRG SPAWN
When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its ﬂesh decays away save
for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead
trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a
living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg’s immunities
and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack
that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack
that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the
mohrg spawn’s level (Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook 503). Mohrg spawn cannot
create mohrg spawn of their own.

Moonflower
These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged

the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey.
Though moonﬂowers can’t speak in the conventional sense, they communicate
telepathically with other moonﬂowers. Explorers who encounter a single
moonﬂower can thus be assured that any other moonﬂowers in the vicinity will
be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonﬂower’s telepathic
communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over
by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream

Light Pulse ʚʖ (evocation, light, primal, visual) 50 feet. The moonﬂower
releases a pulse of bright light. Each non-moonﬂower creature in the
emanation must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. The moonﬂower
can’t use Light Pulse again for 1d4 rounds.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.

Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds.
Pod Prison Ǻȓ Trigger The moonﬂower has swallowed
a creature; Eﬀect The swallowed creature is
wrapped in a tight cocoon and extruded from
the moonﬂower’s body into an adjacent square.
The creature continues to be Swallowed Whole.
It can’t use Acrobatics to Escape a pod, but other
creatures can attempt to Rupture the pod. The
cocooned creature takes half damage from any
damage dealt to the cocoon. Once the cocoon is
Ruptured, it deﬂates and decays.
Pod Spawn Should a Small or larger creature die within a
pod prison, the pod transforms into an adult moonﬂower
with full Hit Points after 1d4 hours of growth. The
newly formed moonﬂower has its own consciousness,
but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles
the creature that died within. The dead creature’s
equipment remains inside the new moonﬂower and can
be retrieved if the moonﬂower is slain.

MORLOCK MACHINERY
Morlocks tend toward brutish actions
and violent traditions and have little
interest in bettering their societies
or creating art. However, they have
a strange obsession with ancient
machinery and magical items,
particularly clockwork constructions.
Their knack for tinkering helps
keep ancient guardians and traps
functional, even if their work
backﬁres now and then.
Morlock
Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal
monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands.
Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and
their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four‑limbed shufﬂe
for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the
surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient
homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as
gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.
Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food,
even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks
encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger.
A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.

MALARIA STRAINS
This pernicious disease is often
associated with mosquitoes. The
most common version of malaria
is presented on page 118 of the
Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
and while the variants inﬂicted
by mosquito swarms and giant
mosquitoes are deadlier, they don’t
have the chance to recur after
1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also
causes weakness and fevers, while
septic malaria causes painful and
infected lesions to form on the
body. Regardless of the strain you
contract, you can’t reduce your
sickened condition while you are
aﬀected with malaria.
Mosquito
While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their
giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous.
FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal
swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms
are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid
months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the
waterfront reaches of settlements.

# MUDWRETCH
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
MUDWRETCH LIFESTYLES
Mudwretches are rarely encountered
alone. They inhabit swampy patches
in small groups, often gathering
near the ruins of sites that once held
great signiﬁcance. Mudwretches can
remain dormant for centuries, always
eager to lurch up to attack passersby.
They’re usually more interested
in defending territory than killing
intruders, and they won’t pursue
victims for long if they ﬂee.
Mudwretch
In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped
at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches,
though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy ﬂesh upon itself to form
a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature’s
general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies
or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They
have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries
out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from
living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than
one that’s comfortably wallowing on a river bank.

takes 10 or more ﬁre damage from a single
eﬀect, or spends more than 24 hours outside
of a source of suﬃcient hydration (such as
a swamp, river, well, or recent rainfall), it
becomes dehydrated. While dehydrated, the
mudwretch can’t Spew Mud, is sickened 2,
and is slowed 1 until it either fully immerses
in water, spends 1 minute in the rain, or
rehydrates in another way (such as via Gory Hydration).

any penalties it had as a result of being dehydrated.
Mud Puddle Ȱɵ (concentrate) Until it next acts, the
mudwretch appears to be an ordinary puddle of mud.
It has an automatic result of 20 on Deception checks

as a reaction.
Spew Mud ʚʖ (conjuration, primal) The mudwretch
spews a 20-foot line of pressurized mud that
deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). On a critical failure, a creature also
takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1
round. The mudwretch can’t Spew Mud again for 1d4 rounds.

NATURAL WARNINGS
Regions haunted by bog mummies
lack small animals, insects, and
other wildlife. A character who is
Investigating, Searching, or Scouting
during exploration mode can attempt
a secret Nature check against the
bog mummy’s Stealth DC to notice
something sinister. A critical success
is enough to speciﬁcally suggest the
presence of undead in the area.
Mummy, Bog
The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can
become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading
undead monstrosities.
Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever,
leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artiﬁcially
preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals
but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or
muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from
the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed
inﬂuence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething
need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unﬁnished at the time of
death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of
this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife
beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body
was disposed of does the rest.
Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulﬁll their
dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the
living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into
their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes,
driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to
the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.

MANTA RAY
While manta rays might
appear daunting, they are
generally docile. Manta rays are
found in temperate or tropical oceans,
and they generally stay in the upper reaches
or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are
ﬁlter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also
eat larger ﬁsh or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but
rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater
cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta
rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets.
Manta rays don’t make particularly good mounts, but some
aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.

EXCEPTIONS TO EVIL
While most undead are evil, revenants
are not—these unusual stalkers rise
not out of a sense of cruelty or hatred
of the living, but spontaneously from
the need for vengeance following
a deep betrayal. One can avoid a
revenant’s wrath by simply getting
out of its way—unless you happen to
be its reason for unlife!
Revenant
Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and
are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom
is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or
abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise
from their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might
legitimately be considered an accident if the revenant doesn’t understand the full
circumstances of their demise. In such cases, it doesn’t matter that the “murderer”
may not have intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never
forgive. Revenants have little memory of their lives other than anything they
might need to recall in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.
