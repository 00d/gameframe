ONI ORIGINS
The ﬁrst oni originated in the nation
of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia.
Whether due to prevalent local kami—
particularly in the mist-shrouded
Forest of Spirits—or its peoples’ faiths,
Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni
Not all divine creations are meant to live as mortals. Some spirits are created as
guardians instead, tasked as protectors of elements of nature that cannot protect
themselves. When these spirits accept their divine place in the metacosmos and take
on such charges, they become kami. But some of these spirits are willful, obstinate,
or simply rotten, railing against such demands from the gods and becoming bodiless
and unable to interact with the world they can torturously still observe. Others
receive such punishment simply for failing at their duty, and their despair at their
condition twists them like those that began with a seed of darkness. When these
spirits look upon mortal lives and become overcome with envy of the ﬂesh and
pleasure that humanoids can revel in, they form surrogate bodies of their own and
become monsters known collectively as oni.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a speciﬁc
humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies.
Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these
humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni
are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni
associated with almost every kind of humanoid.
Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising
themselves as their associated humanoid type and use
this ability to inﬁltrate societies and seize control
from within. Once established, oni typically reveal
their true form and revel in dominating those they
view as lesser beings ﬁt only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically
choose comely or striking appearances in their
humanoid disguises—forms that are completely
at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An
oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost
desires and always has features such as oversized
teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually
bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni
have desires as varied as those of any being, though
by their nature these desires are almost always for
hedonistic or destructive experiences of the ﬂesh,
typically food, pleasure, or violence.
ONIDOSHI
Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with
the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi’s
supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect
are enough to awe and cow entire families of
rank-and-ﬁle ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are
often found at the head of ogre war parties or
orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind
the scenes. It’s rare for onidoshi to lead solitary
existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the
countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils
for themselves.

RAVEN TRADERS
Given enough time to develop the
relationship and establish what you
want, it is possible to engage a raven
in a sort of trade. Placing a small,
shiny object where the raven can take
it might entice it to grab the prize and
ﬂy oﬀ, returning 3d6 minutes later
with something from its own stash.
Convincing a raven to trade requires
a DC 20 Nature check to Command
an Animal and, of course, a raven who
has the inclination to trade with you
in the ﬁrst place.
Raven
Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.
RAVEN
These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of
solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the
periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the
wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a ﬂock, ravens live off scraps as often
as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own
kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is
rumored that this extends between ﬂocks as well.

They are also quite adept at stealing objects. A raven can’t use

but it can use Thievery to Steal light objects that it can carry
in its beak or talons or to accomplish other relatively simple tasks.

RAVEN SWARM
A ﬂock of ravens is known as an unkindness. Certainly the name lives up
to its meaning when a swarm of ravens decides to work together. In most cases,
a raven swarm like the one presented here won’t attack larger foes, but when
manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger,
an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

Enraged Cunning There are few things as dangerously
persistent in the natural world as an angry unkindness of
ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most
barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney ﬂues, loosely
shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an
unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a Thievery check to bypass
many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20.
Swarming Beaks Ȱɵ The ravens’ angry pecking deals 1d8 piercing
damage to each enemy in the swarm’s space (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). A creature that critically fails its save is blinded
for 1d4 rounds as the ravens focus their attacks on the target’s
vulnerable face.

RAVENER LAIRS
Cunning and paranoid, raveners
prefer to make their lairs in places
hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so
high that living creatures struggle to
breathe the rareﬁed air, submerged
beneath pools of magma in the
caldera of an active volcano, and so
on. Some raveners even go so far
as to deliberately ﬁll their entire
lair with lethally poisonous gases,
and raveners that are capable of
advanced spellcasting often seal
their lairs completely, accessing
them exclusively by spells such as
teleport or gaseous form. Of course,
raveners must feed on the living to
persist, so they never locate their
lairs so far from sources of life that
they’ll starve.
Ravener
Though their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually
perish. While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some
manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all
living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures,
some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly,
and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger
when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may ﬁnd some dragons,
but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue
a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can
transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.
A ravener’s ﬂesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only
their skeleton. What they lose in ﬂesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending
power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their
skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing ﬂight with now-skeletal wings. This new
existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the
ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane
metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners
are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they
strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a
time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their
power and become a ravener husk (page 224).
CREATING A RAVENER
Any evil dragon of at least level 13 can become a ravener, although it is exceedingly
rare for a dragon younger than an ancient true dragon (such as a chromatic, primal,
or metallic dragon) to do so. Typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called
ravenous reanimation, but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener
has the aid of a powerful patron. In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention
of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without
the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major
impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. If
you don’t have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps.
Increase the dragon’s level by 2 and change their statistics as follows.
•	 They gain the undead trait and the Necril language.
•	 Increase their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
•	 They gain weakness to good damage and more HP (see below).
•	 The ravener’s melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their
damaging Breath Weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage.

RAVENEr ABILITIES

Soulsense A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within
the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like
celestials and ﬁends, appear brighter to this sense.
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Cowering Fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A ravener’s frightful presence causes
creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or
more as a result of the ravener’s frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear.
Soul Ward An intangible ﬁeld of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total
destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level

RAVENER MINIONS
Raveners view most undead
creatures with little more respect
than they have for living creatures,
but they often make use of them as
servants. They prefer incorporeal
undead such as ghosts, specters, and
wraiths over such crude and simple
minions as skeletons and zombies.
RAVENER SPELLCASTERS
Instead of gaining the vicious
criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster
gains additional spellcasting
prowess. When creating your own
ravener spellcaster, give it the
spellcasting ability of a spellcaster
roughly 2 levels higher than a normal
spellcasting dragon of its kind. This
typically means that if the original
dragon had two spells prepared of
its highest level, you should add one
more spell of that level and then
two spells of the next highest level,
while if it had three spells prepared
of its highest level, you would add
three spells of the next highest
level (if applicable, add only a single
10th‑level spell). Either way, increase
its cantrip level by 1.
If the ravener is unusually young,
you might be able to use spells from
the relevant spellcasting dragon
sidebar, but for a typical ancient
dragon, consider the following spells
to ﬁll in the new slots, depending on
which level of spells you need.
•	 10th wish
•	 9th power word kill, telepathic
demand, weird
•	 8th disappearance, maze, mind
blank
•	 7th contingency, energy aegis,
spell turning
21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in
excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If
this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed.
A soul ward’s Hit Points can be restored only via speciﬁc ravener abilities such as
Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a
week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves,
and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener’s soul
ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a
ravener husk (page 224).
Consume Soul Ȳ˓ (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger A living creature within 30 feet of
the ravener dies; Eﬀect The ravener tears the creature’s soul from its body with their
maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a Fortitude save with the
same DC as the ravener’s Breath Weapon.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The ravener tears oﬀ a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored
to life, they are drained 1 in addition to any other side eﬀects of returning to life. The
ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level.
Failure As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the
ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level.
Critical Failure As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t
be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level eﬀect such
as miracle or wish, and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward
equal to twice the creature’s level.
Discorporate Ȳ˓ (divine, necromancy) Trigger The ravener takes excess damage to their
soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; Eﬀect The ravener
draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order
to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes,
reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where
they used Discorporate.
Ravenous Breath A ravener’s Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips
life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener’s
Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature
is drained by the ravener’s Breath Weapon, the ravener’s soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
Vicious Criticals The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20,
as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a
critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or
gain the drained 1 condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than
0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever
the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
RAVENOUS REANIMATION
RITUAL 7
RARE
EVIL
NECROMANCY
Cast 1 day; Cost valuable treasures from the target dragon’s hoard worth a total value
of 50,000 gp
Primary Check Arcana (master), Occultism (master), or Religion (master)
Requirements You must be an evil dragon.
You destroy the gathered treasures with your breath weapon or other powerful magic,
then invoke necromantic energies before you feed upon the charred and melted remains.
As you do so, negative energy courses through your ﬂesh, automatically killing you.
Each individual ravener’s ravenous reanimation requires three to ﬁve unique additional
components. Whether or not you return as a ravener depends on the success of the ritual.
Critical Success You immediately transform into a ravener upon ﬁnishing the ritual; your
soul ward starts at full Hit Points (equal to 5 × your level).
Success You rise as a ravener 24 hours after completing the ritual, as long as your body
remains relatively intact. When you rise as a ravener, your soul ward starts at 1 Hit Point.
Failure You rise as a ravener husk 24 hours after completing the ritual.
Critical Failure You die.

OTHER RAYS
Stingrays and manta rays are among
the most common species of these
ﬁsh, but others dwell in more remote
areas. The dangerous blood ray is
an ambush predator that dwells in
murky swamp waters and drains
creature’s blood after paralyzing them
with its sting, while the immense
leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator
that has a deadly mouth capable of
swallowing small ships whole.
Ray
Rays are an unusual type of ﬁsh with wide, sail-like ﬁns and long tails, giving them
an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have
a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical
charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent
in its accuracy.
STINGRAY
Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when
threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their
toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and
unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray
is a sureﬁre way to receive a painful sting.

MANTA RAY
While manta rays might
appear daunting, they are
generally docile. Manta rays are
found in temperate or tropical oceans,
and they generally stay in the upper reaches
or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are
ﬁlter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also
eat larger ﬁsh or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but
rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater
cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta
rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets.
Manta rays don’t make particularly good mounts, but some
aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.

RHINOCEROS HORNS
While some species have only a
single horn, many rhinos, including
woolly rhinos, have a second,
smaller horn on their brow directly
behind the larger one. Despite their
appearance and durability, rhino
horns aren’t bone or ivory, but rather
are composed of the same substance
as hooves and toenails. A rhino’s
horn continues to grow as it ages,
enabling a rhino to slowly regrow
a broken horn. While some value
rhino horns as trophies, the horns
themselves have no intrinsic value.
Rhinoceros
This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn
on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can
run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of
smell, their eyesight is relatively poor.
RHINOCEROS
Rhinoceroses are short‑tempered, territorial, and easily startled, and these traits
combined with their innate ferocity means their natural instinct when disturbed
is to attack. When intruders disturb or surprise rhinoceroses, the animals
respond by charging directly at the interlopers and then lashing out with their
mighty horns.

their day grazing for sustenance.

BLUE WEEK
Those living in areas where rusalkas
dwell know well to avoid the water
during the week-long period in
early Sarenith when the fey become
particularly active, a time known in
many regions as Blue Week. Most
villages prohibit swimming and
ﬁshing during this time, though the
prohibition is diﬃcult to enforce, as it
takes place during the height of good
weather. Particularly superstitious
folk take care to lock their doors
both from within and without.
Rusalka
These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of
those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break
their victims’ wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for
continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas’ defense, as the shame their
captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.

Beckoning Call  Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, enchantment, incapacitation,
mental, primal) The rusalka cries out a compelling invitation. Each
non-fey creature within a 300-foot emanation must attempt a DC 27
Will save. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if the rusalka uses Beckoning
Call again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for
all aﬀected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against
Beckoning Call, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated and must spend each of its actions to
move closer to the rusalka, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned
creature is adjacent to the rusalka, it stays still and doesn’t act. If
attacked by the rusalka, the creature is freed from captivation at the
end of the rusalka’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but if attacked by the rusalka, the creature
can attempt a new save only at the start of its next turn, rather than
being freed at the end of the rusalka’s turn.

Entangling Tresses A rusalka can have up to eight creatures grabbed within their
tresses at a time.

they succeed against up to 10 feet and each creature they critically
succeed against up to 20 feet. This movement must all be within
reach of its tresses.
Shameful Touch Ȱɵ (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) The rusalka
touches a creature within 5 feet using their hand, stirring up memories
of regret and shame. The target must attempt a DC 35
Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target is sickened 1.
Failure The creature is sickened 1 and stunned 1.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 1 and stunned 1,
and it must use its ﬁrst action on its next turn to Strike
itself, automatically hitting.

OTHER DEVILS
For over a decade, the legend of
the Sandpoint Devil has persisted
in western Varisia. Most hold that
it’s the fantasy of simple folk and
booze-ﬁlled bellies, but locals insist
it exists. Other creatures akin to
the Sandpoint Devil might exist
elsewhere in the world, with slight
variations on their innate spells and
the nature of their Accursed Breath.
Sandpoint Devil
While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that’s graceful and
beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a
powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid
gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs
and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature’s back bears a draconic
tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists
gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children,
with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.

Sandpoint Devil can’t use Accursed
Breath for 1d4 rounds.

Critical Failure The creature takes full damage
and is cursed. The victim’s ﬂesh appears
charred and burned, and the pain of being
burned alive never fully vanishes. The cursed
creature takes a –2 status penalty to all checks
from the constant pain. Healing doesn’t alter the
appearance of the burns or lessen the penalty, but
removing the curse does.
Devil’s Howl ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental,
occult) The Sandpoint Devil unleashes a bloodcurdling howl that
can be heard for miles. Each creature within a 100-foot emanation
must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become frightened 2
(frightened 3 and ﬂeeing as long as it remains frightened on a
critical failure). Creatures that attempt this Will save are
then immune to Devil’s Howl for 24 hours.
