================================================================================


JABBERWOCKS AND DRAGONS
Although jabberwocks may fear
vorpal weapons and are ﬁlled with
rage against all mortal creatures,
few things invite a jabberwock’s
wrath more than a Material Plane
dragon. Some scholars believe that
in the same way the First World is
believed to have been a template or
“ﬁrst draft” of the Material Plane,
dragons were created in the likeness
of jabberwocks. A jabberwock
that learns of a nearby dragon will
attempt to kill it to the exclusion of
all other priorities.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level
24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a
jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World,
mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of ﬁre, and
have eyes that burn with blue ﬂames that deal cold damage instead of ﬁre damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and
slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the
normal ﬂy Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock’s whifﬂing
aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.

Primal Innate Spells DC 43; Constant (10th) true seeing
Burble ʚʖ The jabberwock creates a blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense
in the various languages it knows (and invariably some languages it doesn’t know),
creating one of two eﬀects. The jabberwock can’t Burble again for 1d4 rounds.

60-foot line of sonic energy that deals 24d6 sonic damage to creatures in the area
(DC 46 basic Reﬂex save).
Jaws That Bite If the jabberwock makes a jaws attack and rolls a natural 19 on the d20
roll, the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if the 19 would be a failure.
Whiﬄing Ǻȓ (aura) Trigger The jabberwock Flies or makes a wing Strike; Eﬀect The
jabberwock’s wings whiﬄe, creating severe winds within a 30-foot emanation. These
winds move outward from the jabberwock, and they persist until the start of the
jabberwock’s next turn. During this time, ﬂight of any kind in the emanation requires a
successful DC 43 Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight, and creatures ﬂying toward
the jabberwock are moving through greater diﬃcult terrain. Creatures on the ground
in the emanation must succeed at a DC 43 Athletics check to approach the jabberwock.

JELLYFISH SPECIES
A large number of types of
monstrous jellyﬁsh dwell in the
world’s oceans, each with their
own unusual specialty in hunting.
The immense vampire jellyﬁsh is a
blood-drinking monster that often
attacks sailors aboard ships. Among
the largest are the dreaded whaler
jellyﬁsh, colossal creatures that feed
on whales or even krakens.
Jellyfish
Many varieties of jellyﬁsh drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on ﬁsh and
other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyﬁsh pose a
threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyﬁsh are animals,
they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system.
FIRE JELLYFISH SWARM
While individually one of these ﬁst-sized jellyﬁsh is merely a nuisance, in great
numbers, ﬁre jellyﬁsh can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water,
they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their
bright coloration, but those who are stung by ﬁre jellyﬁsh learn the larger reason
for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.

CRYSTAL VAULTS
Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts
too dangerous to be left where those
hungry for power might seize them.
Only they know what items of myth
and legend, long thought lost or
destroyed, lie within their crystal
vaults. They are unreliable guardians
of religious artifacts, however, which
usually disgust them.
Jyoti
Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they ﬁnd insulting) by the
ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane.
They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains
on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and
religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force
that, from the jyotis’ perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to ﬁsh.
Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their
homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the
palaces of crystallized light and captured ﬂame in which they dwell. They often chase
even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire,
for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis’ full wrath is reserved for
natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise
of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to
oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.

KELPIE FOLKTALES
Some fanciful stories about kelpies
speak of them appearing in equine
form wearing riding tack, complete
with silver stirrups and bridle bit.
These folktales claim that cutting
the harness from the kelpie’s body
grants the bearer power over it, or
causes the kelpie to sicken and die.
In truth, doing so has no ill eﬀect
on a kelpie, suggesting these stories
are spread by kelpies themselves
to further trick prey into making
foolish mistakes.
Kelpie
Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals
to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly
preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater
then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim’s heart and liver—
the only parts of a meal kelpies ﬁnd unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically
disguising itself as ﬁne steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but
its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green ﬂesh
resembling aquatic plants.

# JOTUND TROLL
================================================================================


RAVENOUS MUTANTS
Jotund trolls on the world of Golarion
are found in two particular regions
with greater frequency: the magicwarped reaches of the Mana Wastes,
and the radiation-wracked badlands
of Numeria. In both places, the
presence of life-altering magic or
science seems to have had the same
eﬀect in bolstering the presence of
these lumbering monstrosities.

Head Regrowth A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration
to regrow a head that is severed from an eﬀect like a vorpal weapon. After regaining
Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 ﬂat check. On a success,
one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully
restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.
Multiple Opportunities A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their
heads beyond the ﬁrst, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity
with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can’t use more than 1 reaction for the
same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their
reach, and the jotund troll must use a diﬀerent head for each Attack of
Opportunity they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll’s heads is
severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round.

Damage 2d12+14 bludgeoning
Cacophonous Roar ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, enchantment,
incapacitation, mental, primal) The jotund troll emits a
cacophonous roar from all their heads with a mystical
power that distorts the listener’s mind. Each non-troll
creature within 100 feet must attempt a DC 34 Will
save. The jotund troll can’t use Cacophonous Roar
for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is
temporarily immune to Cacophonous Roar for
24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is confused for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is confused

Ravenous Jaws ʚʖ The jotund troll
makes a number of jaws Strikes
up to their number of heads, each
against a diﬀerent target. These attacks
count toward the troll’s multiple attack penalty, but
the penalty doesn’t increase until after the jotund troll
makes all of these attacks.

TROLLHOUND GENESIS
The ﬁrst trollhounds were the
unexpected result of occult
experimentation on wargs with
alchemically prepared troll blood in
the hope of creating an ooze with
limited regeneration. Most of the
wargs died during the trials; the
few survivors lost their cunning
and intelligence in exchange for
a troll’s voracious appetite and
ability to regenerate. Successive
generations of trollhounds often hunt
alongside trolls, understanding on an
instinctual level the bonds they share
with these lumbering giants.
Trollhound
Trollhounds are squat, slavering beasts akin to trolls in canine form. Requiring
vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild
trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious
hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some
regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds’ keen sense of
smell to aid in the hunt.
Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating
contagion known as bloodﬁre fever. Creatures that contract the disease through
the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on
ﬁre. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-ﬁlled blisters,
and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both
trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.
Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to
regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of ﬁre is enough to repel
them, as the beasts don’t recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, ﬁre is
one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to
burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative
powers are potent indeed.
While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and
even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters.
Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds’ diseased slobber, their
ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality
and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more
reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping
into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds
can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to
multiply into a signiﬁcant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds
to the trolls, as they say!
