Aeon
Aeons are paragons of law above all else. True aeons embody opposing concepts
or forces and are tasked with maintaining balance between those two things,
while inevitables are living constructs that enforce laws both mortal and divine.
THELETOS
Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly
spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow
and ending in three-ﬁngered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges
from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos’s tentacles describe a
disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice
while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from.
Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies,
particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a
theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that
restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.

Envisioning When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic
projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all
creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be
vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly
with any other aeon on the same plane.

Fate Drain (curse, divine, mental) A creature
damaged by the theletos’s tentacle must
succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1. As long as the creature is stupeﬁed, it can
no longer beneﬁt from fortune eﬀects. If the target fails additional
saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a
maximum of stupeﬁed 4). This condition value decreases by 1
every 24 hours.
Wrath of Fate ʚʖ (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) The
theletos releases a 60-foot cone of energy from its center.
Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with
the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in
store for them and lack of clear pathways to
these potential futures. They must succeed at
MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
Theletoses care little for the individuals
and societies they manipulate, only
that balance between freedom and
fate is maintained. A theletos might
help a creature who has lost their
freedom escape, but it may also force
those who swore to perform an unjust
duty to stick to their word. If its plans
are thwarted, a theletos doesn’t seek
revenge, but instead looks for other
ways to redress the balance.

twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.
ZELEKHUT
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical
centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back.
Instead of hands, the zelekhut’s arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with
electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities,
the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active
ﬂight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse’s
most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut’s quarry are as
famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in
enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own
or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While
hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a
dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn’t shift a single hoof to capture a
corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand
that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the
zelekhut’s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments
and track down those who seek to ﬂee their punishment.

ʚʖ
The
zelekhut makes two
chain Strikes, each
targeting a diﬀerent
creature. Each Strike counts toward the zelekhut’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has
made both attacks. If the zelekhut subsequently uses the Knockdown action, it aﬀects
all creatures it hit with Double Attack.
PARADOX AND UNITY
To mortals, aeons sometimes
seem to combine elements that
are fundamentally incompatible,
whether it’s an aeon combining
opposing concepts, or axiomites and
inevitables mixing the organic with
the mathematical or mechanical.
Aeons see no paradox in this, but
rather claim it is an expression of the
underlying unity of all things.

HEAVENLY MOUNTAIN
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that
appears as a single massive mountain.
Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with
most archons occupying the second
level and base of army operations,
Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the
administrative heart of Heaven.

Blinding Soul (divine, evocation, light, visual) Whenever the star archon takes slashing
damage, bright light pours from their wounds. Non-archons within 10 feet must
attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature is dazzled for 1 round. On
a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds instead. The creature is then
temporarily immune for 1 round.
Explosive Rebirth (death, divine, evocation, ﬁre, good) When killed, the star archon
explodes in a blinding ﬂash of holy energy that deals 12d6 ﬁre damage and 12d6
good damage to anything in a 100-foot emanation, with a DC 40 basic Reﬂex
save. A non-archon creature that sees the explosion and critically fails its save is
permanently blinded as well. The slain star archon reincarnates 1d4 rounds later
as a shield archon (Bestiary 29).
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ A star archon can also make a Retributive Strike by throwing
its starknife, and the enemy and ally can be within 60 feet instead of 15 feet.

Prudent Asterism ʚʖ The star archon calculates a celestial
constellation and sends their starknife ﬂying along that
path from one foe to the next. It makes a starknife Strike
against a target within 60 feet. If the Strike hits, it can
make another Strike at a diﬀerent target within 60 feet of the ﬁrst target, and so on,
until it misses with a Strike or runs out of targets it hasn’t attacked within range of
the most recent target. The star archon can attack a given target only once per use
of this ability. These attacks don’t apply any range increment penalty, and the star
archon resolves all the attacks before increasing the multiple attack penalty.
BASTION ARCHON
The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly
uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons
converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a ﬁght that seems all
but lost, a fellow archon of signiﬁcant strength—such as a star archon—
can commit a brave act of self-sacriﬁce by dimensionally transposing
itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is
with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacriﬁce, but instead the
earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of
archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind’s greatest hope.

CHOKER TRINKETS
A choker’s nest is small and conﬁned,
as the choker prefers. It doesn’t tidy
its nest, so everything from animal
bones to valuable treasures might
be within, compacted into one mass.
A choker in the wilderness might
have a few remnants of society taken
from victims who wandered through.
These remnants can include candles,
maps, or animal traps. Chokers in
cities have stolen goods appropriate
to their location: books and scrolls if
a library or wizard’s college is nearby,
steins and pillows near a tavern, or
ﬁshhooks and shipping manifests near
a dock, for example. Chokers almost
never have edible or drinkable items,
as they prefer to consume these
“delicacies” themselves—even magical
potions and alchemical items.
Choker
With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves,
rocky ﬁssures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little
aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that
wander off from their packs or communities. A choker’s long, spongy arms are
ﬂexible but deceptively strong. The ﬁngers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with
spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically
strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude
tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker
tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that
encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the
products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it just results in chokers
that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated,
such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.
Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned
structures. These chokers stalk at night, ﬂopping across rooftops, tapping at
windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An
urban choker that ﬁnds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who
is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the
products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items,
from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one
item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to ﬁnd a larger nest to
accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.

The choker attempts an Athletics check, including its bonus to Grapple. If it succeeds
against the grabbed or restrained creature’s Fortitude DC, the choker redirects the
attack to that creature, and the attacker compares its attack roll result against
the new target’s AC.
The choker must move the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The
creature must also be moved within the attacker’s reach against a
melee attack or into a space between itself and the attacker
against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability
to make the attacker target itself, even if it’s grabbing or
restraining the attacker.

Strike is automatically grabbed, and the choker
begins to strangle the target. The creature is
suﬀocating and can’t speak as long as it’s strangled.
This prevents it from casting spells with a verbal component or
activating items with a command component.

weapon must be one that deals piercing or slashing

If a purrodaemon Interacts to crush a soul

(with a +2 item bonus to the hurled

it ceases being sheathed in the daemon’s living body. A
steeped weapon can be Disarmed.

seizes the triggering weapon. The weapon’s
wielder must attempt a DC 40 Reﬂex save. On
a failure, the weapon is disarmed and falls to an

is sheathed in the purrodaemon’s body as though the daemon had used Steep Weapon.

SHADOW GIANT LOCATIONS
Some shadow giants travel to the
Material Plane to serve as agents
in Nidal’s Umbral Court. Rumors of
these massive shock troops deployed
by the court’s mysterious members
are common, and such rumors often
place them in the mountains near
Cheliax and Molthune.
Protected by the Ancestors by performing a 10-minute prayer as an activity that has

SHADOW GIANT
Shadow giants are ﬁerce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in
perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether
the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On
the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life
as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms.
These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages
to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing
foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their
kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist,
keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in
high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter,
shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous
warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with
outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors
who show the giants the respect and deference they feel
they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants
worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are
so ﬁrmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their
Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize
them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient
religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes
of sacriﬁce and self-mutilation.

doesn’t heal naturally and can be removed only with magic.

LIZARD LOCATIONS
Giant lizards can be found in all
temperate or tropical climates, often
in relatively close proximity to smaller
villages or rural regions where they
can be a dangerous threat to livestock
or travelers. The two lizards presented
here tend to dwell in warmer regions—
jungles for giant chameleons, and
savannas for megalanias.
Lizard
Giant lizards come in a wide variety of species, but they all tend to be voracious
hunters and quick to anger—particularly when they’re molting.
GIANT CHAMELEON
Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in
response to their surroundings. Their eyes are capable of peering in different
directions independently, making them almost as difﬁcult to sneak up on as they
are to notice in the ﬁrst place.

tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with an
attack that hits AC 15 and deals at least 4 slashing
damage. Though this doesn’t deal any damage to the
giant chameleon, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
MEGALANIA
Megalanias, like their smaller cousins the giant
monitor lizards, strike fast and use their powerful
bite to grip their prey. They prefer to swallow
their prey whole rather than risk others getting

QUICKLING PRANKS
Quicklings consider cruelty to
be the pinnacle of pranking. As
a relatively minor example, a
quickling may spend an entire day
constantly moving food out of reach
of a starving man. More commonly,
however, a quickling prefers to cause
pain and injury directly, such as by
suddenly replacing a dinner fork with
a red-hot knife as it’s picked up, or
slashing the legs of a traveler moving
through tall grass.
Quickling
Few creatures can match a quickling’s speed. These malicious fey creatures delight in
striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before
scampering away for cover with maddening­—even frightening—swiftness. Stories
of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously
opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.
Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day,
delighting in inﬂicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to
matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as brownies and pixies, quicklings
care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of
humor and have full conﬁdence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe
from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although
the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform
increasingly deadly pranks against each other.

ﬂat-footed creatures.
Supernatural Speed The quickling’s speed, combined with nearly instantaneous
acceleration and deceleration, enables them to move in astonishing ways. As
long as they have a ﬁrm surface to travel across, they can Stride their full
movement vertically or horizontally. They can even run across unstable
surfaces, such as water, in the same way,
although dangerous surfaces (acid, lava,
etc.) harm them as normal. They must
end their movement on a horizontal surface
capable of bearing their weight or else they fall.

TENDRICULOS LACQUER
Objects coated with tendriculos
lacquer gain resistance 5 to acid.
Making and applying tendriculos
lacquer requires a 5th-level formula,
the Alchemical Crafting skill feat,
and the ﬂuid from the stomach of a
tendriculos. A successful DC 20 Craft
check and 4 days of work are enough
to protect 1 Bulk of items with no
other cost in materials, but the ﬂuid is
used up even on a failed check.
Tendriculos
These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where
the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries.
Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled
forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey
as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices ﬁnish the meal, while
swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature.
When collected, neutralized, and reﬁned, the digestive ﬂuids of a tendriculos
form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos’s acid resistance.
A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the
Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different
tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have
little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined
fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even
closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great
patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive
when handed over.
When it has ﬁnished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into
a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach.
Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible
portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived
digestion and indicate that a tendriculos’s hunting grounds lie nearby.
Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near
populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous
appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast
forth millions of spores. Spores that
happen to alight on carrion grow into
new tendriculoses.

OTHER TANE
Originally engineered by the Eldest
as living weapons, the Tane are a
group of mythical creatures whose
might is capable of bringing entire
cities to heel. The jabberwock and
the sard are two other examples
of the Tane in this book, but
others include creatures like the
bandersnatch, the jubjub bird, and
arguably the most powerful of them
all, the unique monster known
as Leviathan.
Thrasfyr
As bizarre in appearance as they are ferocious, thrasfyrs resemble six-limbed bears

THUNDER AND FIRE
Thunderbirds have a complex
relationship with phoenixes, whom
they regard as too kindly and patient
with human civilizations, even as
they admire phoenixes’ beauty
and mastery over elements that
thunderbirds cannot control. Often,
encounters with phoenixes escalate
into violent arguments, but it’s rare
for one of these meetings to end
in a thunderbird’s death, and even
rarer for a phoenix to be signiﬁcantly
threatened by the upstart challenger.
Thunderbird
Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed.
Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before ﬂooding begins.
When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many
settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.
Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop
nests, where the young are struck by their ﬁrst bolts of lightning and learn the
mysteries of the storm.

TICK DISEASES
Giant ticks and tick swarms can
potentially inﬂict diseases other than
tick fever. Drawing from the list on
pages 118–119 of the Gamemastery
Guide, potential diseases that a
tick could spread include blinding
sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or
scarlet fever. The saving throw DC
should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant
ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).
Tick
These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other
infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid
locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature.

Attach When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed hypostome
attaches it to that creature. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the giant tick
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is ﬂat-footed
while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on
which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping
the attachment or removing the giant tick in other ways doesn’t cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The giant tick is attached to a creature; Eﬀect The giant
tick uses its hypostome to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to. This deals 1d4
damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A
creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick is drained 1 until it receives healing

FROGS AND TOADS
While they might look similar
in appearance, toads and frogs
are quite diﬀerent creatures,
particularly some of their oversized
variants. Frogs tend to dwell in
swampy or marshy areas, while
toads are found in drier regions
like forests, plains, grasslands, and
deserts. Monstrous toads also skew
to a larger size overall.
Toad
Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly
eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They’re known to eat giant
rats, then take over the rats’ burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This
leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly
explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests,
some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for
recreational use.

toad. The creature isn’t immobilized, but it can’t move beyond the reach of the toad’s
tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a successful Strike against AC 15
that deals at least 6 slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the toad but prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
TOAD TEARS
A giant toad’s poison glands can be harvested and
used as raw materials to craft a specialized poison
known somewhat inaccurately as “toad tears” (likely
due to the harvesting process, which requires one to
dig the glands out from behind the eyes). One giant
toad’s poison gland can supply enough materials for
a single dose.

Toad tears can be mixed with any other foodstuﬀ or

deadly qualities, and as a result, toad tears are
rarely directly fatal. Yet those who are exposed
to toad tears often lose control of their actions,
making it a dangerous poison nevertheless.

TRITON CONCH TRUMPETS
Tritons use a conch shell as a focus
to summon aquatic allies. Some
specialize in diﬀerent uses of the
conch, such as frightening foes (as
the fear spell) or using water for
attacks (as the spell hydraulic push).
Triton conch shells in the hands
of non-tritons do not produce any
magical eﬀects, but have inspired
other crafters to build magical
triton’s conches (Core Rulebook 576).
Triton
While sometimes understandably mistaken for merfolk—both species live
underwater and have a blend of features from both humans and ﬁsh—tritons
have two legs instead of a tail. This gives tritons the ability to operate on land,
though they are neither as comfortable nor as skilled above water as below.
The arms and legs of a triton feature ﬁns that assist in swimming, and their
entire body is covered in ﬁne scales that range in color from silver to cerulean
blue to seaweed green. Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between
the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and
a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass,
commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in
color from sea blue to golden.
Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to
protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders—whether
they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are
sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons
have had to ﬁght underwater and on land.
In their quest to ﬁght underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins
and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elementals, and
sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using
a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea
species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufﬁciency, rarely trading
with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely
forming established alliances.
Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea ﬂoor,
forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys
heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons—
though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to
the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They
like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants,
bioluminescent ﬁsh, and attractive trinkets recovered
from shipwrecks.

DEATHLESS FROST
Historically isolated in the remote
frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands,
frost trolls have increasingly been
encountered in more temperate
climates on Golarion. It’s unclear
what’s driving these ice-hearted
trolls southward, but some suspect
the machinations of a wrathful
demon lord are at play.
Troll
Towering brutes with slavering jaws and razor-sharp claws, trolls are voracious
predators. They are nigh invulnerable and single-minded in their pursuit, so they
throw themselves against prey with reckless abandon. Wounds that would cripple
or kill most other creatures regenerate into healthy troll ﬂesh within seconds.
Trolls don’t mark their hunting grounds with claw marks or urine as beasts
do. After gorging upon their kill, they suspend any meat, bones, or other bodily
detritus that remain from tree branches to mark their domains. Unfortunately,
trolls tend to treat these borders as approximations. Before a hapless traveler
even spots such a grisly marker and realizes that they have wandered into troll
territory, the trolls are already preparing to attack.
These pages present lesser-known varieties beyond the common troll.
FROST TROLL
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost
teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in
packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to
assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human
ﬂesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity
to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost
troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their
sickly, cracked ﬂesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
themselves with trophies of bone and hide ﬂayed from their kills.

RAVENOUS MUTANTS
Jotund trolls on the world of Golarion
are found in two particular regions
with greater frequency: the magic-
warped reaches of the Mana Wastes,
and the radiation-wracked badlands
of Numeria. In both places, the
presence of life-altering magic or
science seems to have had the same
eﬀect in bolstering the presence of
these lumbering monstrosities.

Head Regrowth A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration
to regrow a head that is severed from an eﬀect like a vorpal weapon. After regaining
Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 ﬂat check. On a success,
one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully
restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.
Multiple Opportunities A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their
heads beyond the ﬁrst, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity
with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can’t use more than 1 reaction for the
same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their
reach, and the jotund troll must use a diﬀerent head for each Attack of
Opportunity they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll’s heads is
severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round.

cacophonous roar from all their heads with a mystical
power that distorts the listener’s mind. Each non-troll
creature within 100 feet must attempt a DC 34 Will
save. The jotund troll can’t use Cacophonous Roar
for 1d4 rounds.

BUILDING WITH SHELLS
The shell of a giant snapping turtle
is over 20 feet long and is sturdy,
naturally curved, and waterproof,
making it a useful building material.
While boggards seldom have
advanced construction techniques,
they use giant snapping turtle shells
as roofs and rafts when available.
Boggards also incorporate smaller
turtle shells into their armor.
Turtle
These generally mild-mannered and docile creatures prefer to be left alone, but the
ill-tempered snapping turtle is a notably violent exception to this rule.
SNAPPING TURTLE
Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long ﬂexible neck, a sharp piercing
beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn’t prevent some spellcasters
from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have
shells around 18 inches in length.

Strike in its previous action; Eﬀect The snapping turtle clenches its jaws down and
automatically deals an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the creature it just bit.
Shell Defense Ȱɵ The snapping turtle retracts its limbs and head into its shell and ends
its turn. This increases its AC to 18, but it can’t act except to reemerge, which it can
do as a single action.
GIANT SNAPPING TURTLE
If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle
seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain.
Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is
capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly
boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to
serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those
unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle ﬁnd that even
the creature’s stomach is somewhat armored, making it difﬁcult to cut through.

UMONLEE FABLES
While they’re immense, violent,
and frightening, umonlees aren’t
inherently evil creatures. As such,
there are stories of youths, gnomes,
or other small-statured creatures
who encounter umonlees in the wild
and manage to befriend them, so that
at some later point in the tale when
the pint-sized protagonists are in
peril, their enormous ally can arrive,
bursting from a nearby glacier to
play the role of overwhelming savior.
Whether or not these tales have any
basis in truth is unknown.
Umonlee
Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that
swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes.
Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the
Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.
Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service
of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are
semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are
not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafﬁcked
areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse
group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path
of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that
crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by
an encounter with one of these monstrosities.
Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as
the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean
predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they
can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to
this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of
alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these
alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren’t evil argues well
against such a theory.

Freezing Breath ʚʖ (cold, evocation, incapacitation,
primal) The umonlee breathes a cone of extremely
cold air that damages its prey and can freeze
them to the ground. Its breath deals 12d8 cold
damage to creatures in the 50-foot cone (DC
38 Reﬂex save). The umonlee can’t use Freezing
Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage and is
slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is slowed 1
for 1 round. If the creature is standing on the ground, it’s
immobilized as thick ice forms around it, and it can’t recover from
being slowed. The creature remains immobilized and slowed 1
until it manages to Escape (DC 36) or deal 30 damage to the
ice, which has weakness 10 to ﬁre.
Critical Failure As failure, except the creature takes double
damage and the ice holding it in place requires 60 damage
to break.
