Bestiary 2
Aeon
Aeons are paragons of law above all else. True aeons embody opposing concepts
or forces and are tasked with maintaining balance between those two things,
while inevitables are living constructs that enforce laws both mortal and divine.
THELETOS
Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly
spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow
and ending in three-ﬁngered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges
from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos’s tentacles describe a
disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice
while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from.
Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies,
particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a
theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that
restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.

Envisioning When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic
projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all
creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be
vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly
with any other aeon on the same plane.

Fate Drain (curse, divine, mental) A creature
damaged by the theletos’s tentacle must
succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1. As long as the creature is stupeﬁed, it can
no longer beneﬁt from fortune eﬀects. If the target fails additional
saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a
maximum of stupeﬁed 4). This condition value decreases by 1
every 24 hours.
Wrath of Fate ʚʖ (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) The
theletos releases a 60-foot cone of energy from its center.
Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with
the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in
store for them and lack of clear pathways to
these potential futures. They must succeed at
MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
Theletoses care little for the individuals
and societies they manipulate, only
that balance between freedom and
fate is maintained. A theletos might
help a creature who has lost their
freedom escape, but it may also force
those who swore to perform an unjust
duty to stick to their word. If its plans
are thwarted, a theletos doesn’t seek
revenge, but instead looks for other
ways to redress the balance.

a DC 26 Will save or be slowed 1 indeﬁnitely. An aﬀected creature can choose to roll
twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.
ZELEKHUT
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical
centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back.
Instead of hands, the zelekhut’s arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with
electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities,
the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active
ﬂight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse’s
most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut’s quarry are as
famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in
enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own
or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While
hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a
dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn’t shift a single hoof to capture a
corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand
that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the
zelekhut’s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments
and track down those who seek to ﬂee their punishment.

# TRUMPET ARCHON
================================================================================


INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
A trumpet archon’s magical
instrument is no mere piece of
brass; each of these immaculately
crafted horns is said to be crafted
in Heaven’s blessed forges and
infused with the voices of a thousand
angels. Only archons can truly
play such trumpets—mortals lack
the power necessary to create
trumpet archons’ iconic clarion
calls, but can still play them as
virtuoso instruments.
TRUMPET ARCHON
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers­—embodiments of
the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and
among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps
leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet
archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon
is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

STAR ARCHON
Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star
archons serve as philosophers and administrators,
and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and
generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory
and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are
as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and
unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather
than on battleﬁelds, star archons are ﬁerce opponents when motivated to enter

CHOKER TRINKETS
A choker’s nest is small and conﬁned,
as the choker prefers. It doesn’t tidy
its nest, so everything from animal
bones to valuable treasures might
be within, compacted into one mass.
A choker in the wilderness might
have a few remnants of society taken
from victims who wandered through.
These remnants can include candles,
maps, or animal traps. Chokers in
cities have stolen goods appropriate
to their location: books and scrolls if
a library or wizard’s college is nearby,
steins and pillows near a tavern, or
ﬁshhooks and shipping manifests near
a dock, for example. Chokers almost
never have edible or drinkable items,
as they prefer to consume these
“delicacies” themselves—even magical
potions and alchemical items.
Choker
With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves,
rocky ﬁssures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little
aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that
wander off from their packs or communities. A choker’s long, spongy arms are
ﬂexible but deceptively strong. The ﬁngers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with
spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically
strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude
tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker
tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that
encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the
products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it just results in chokers
that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated,
such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.
Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned
structures. These chokers stalk at night, ﬂopping across rooftops, tapping at
windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An
urban choker that ﬁnds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who
is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the
products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items,
from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one
item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to ﬁnd a larger nest to
accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.

STYX PASSAGE FEES
Gliding with eerie ease along the
murky River Styx, thanadaemons
are only too happy to oﬀer mortals
passage aboard their dilapidated
skiﬀs—for a price. Gold is typically
an acceptable payment for a
thanadaemon’s services, though these

by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, fear, visual) The
thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can
see within 30 feet. The target must immediately
attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon’s
terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened,
a failed save causes it to become ﬂeeing for 1d4

PURRODAEMON (WAR DAEMON)
Few creatures embody war’s sheer amount of bloodshed
and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons
of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked
in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their
ﬂesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however,
these weapons are the purrodaemon’s arsenal. A
purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness
and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its
own ﬂesh as though drawing a sword from a
sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil
that weapons steeped in it become
powerful tools of war.

# TAIGA GIANT
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
TAIGA GIANT CLANS
Each taiga giant clan links its identity
to the deeds of their most famous
ancestors and heroes. Names such
as Cliﬀsmiter and Mountainripper
hint at legendary accomplishments,
though the stories are rarely shared
with outsiders.
TAIGA GIANT
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one
area’s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant
wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
ancestors’ spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when
they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They
occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than
malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people.
Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating
event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants
by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are
scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in
everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of
those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly
than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that
ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the
ﬁrst rune giants is a sureﬁre way to earn a taiga giant’s unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.

SHADOW GIANT LOCATIONS
Some shadow giants travel to the
Material Plane to serve as agents
in Nidal’s Umbral Court. Rumors of

are common, and such rumors often
place them in the mountains near

SHADOW GIANT
Shadow giants are ﬁerce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in
perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether
the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On
the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life
as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms.
These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages
to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing
foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their
kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist,
keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in
high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter,
shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous
warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with
outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors
who show the giants the respect and deference they feel
they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants
worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are
so ﬁrmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their
Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize
them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient
religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes
of sacriﬁce and self-mutilation.

Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears.
Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in

Sometimes this means of tracking isn’t enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga
linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk
in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the

LIZARD LOCATIONS
Giant lizards can be found in all
temperate or tropical climates, often
in relatively close proximity to smaller
villages or rural regions where they
can be a dangerous threat to livestock
or travelers. The two lizards presented

jungles for giant chameleons, and

Giant lizards come in a wide variety of species, but they all tend to be voracious
hunters and quick to anger—particularly when they’re molting.
GIANT CHAMELEON
Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in

QUICKLING PRANKS
Quicklings consider cruelty to
be the pinnacle of pranking. As
a relatively minor example, a
quickling may spend an entire day
constantly moving food out of reach
of a starving man. More commonly,
however, a quickling prefers to cause
pain and injury directly, such as by
suddenly replacing a dinner fork with
a red-hot knife as it’s picked up, or
slashing the legs of a traveler moving
through tall grass.
Quickling
Few creatures can match a quickling’s speed. These malicious fey creatures delight in
striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before
scampering away for cover with maddening­—even frightening—swiftness. Stories
of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously
opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.
Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day,
delighting in inﬂicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to
matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as brownies and pixies, quicklings
care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of
humor and have full conﬁdence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe
from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although
the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform
increasingly deadly pranks against each other.

# TATZLWYRM
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
OTHER TATZLWYRMS
People in some regions claim to have
seen creatures that are just like
tatzlwyrms in most respects—a long
body, two arms, and a head—except
that they have traits that are not
of reptilian origin. Travelers on a
savanna should beware a furry,
lion-headed tatzlwyrm protecting its
cubs, while those in the mountains
might be attacked by a feathered
(but wingless) variant with the head
of an eagle.
Tatzlwyrm
Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon’s head.
Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of
intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their
ability to reason is limited and they can’t use magic. They do possess a level of
cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and
even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don’t expect to ﬁnd a
tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.
Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons,
though it’s a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as
messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due
to their smaller size), guides (when they’re familiar with a particular mountain),
and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon’s direct attention).
Tatzlwyrms don’t work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.
Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they
seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable
occasion, townsfolk reported being brieﬂy overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conﬂict
between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still
debate whether the cause of the inﬂux was the sudden change in weather or if the
creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part
of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.
When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed,
they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales’ natural
camouﬂage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching
poisonous vapor into an opponent’s face. Since this breath attack doesn’t have
much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes ﬁrst and bring them close
to their mouth.

TENDRICULOS LACQUER
Objects coated with tendriculos
lacquer gain resistance 5 to acid.
Making and applying tendriculos
lacquer requires a 5th-level formula,
the Alchemical Crafting skill feat,
and the ﬂuid from the stomach of a
tendriculos. A successful DC 20 Craft
check and 4 days of work are enough
to protect 1 Bulk of items with no
other cost in materials, but the ﬂuid is
used up even on a failed check.
Tendriculos
These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where
the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries.
Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled
forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey
as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices ﬁnish the meal, while
swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature.
When collected, neutralized, and reﬁned, the digestive ﬂuids of a tendriculos
form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos’s acid resistance.
A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the
Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different
tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have
little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined
fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even
closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great
patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive
when handed over.
When it has ﬁnished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into
a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach.
Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible
portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived
digestion and indicate that a tendriculos’s hunting grounds lie nearby.
Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near
populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous
appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast
forth millions of spores. Spores that
happen to alight on carrion grow into
new tendriculoses.

TICK DISEASES
Giant ticks and tick swarms can
potentially inﬂict diseases other than
tick fever. Drawing from the list on
pages 118–119 of the Gamemastery
Guide, potential diseases that a
tick could spread include blinding
sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or
scarlet fever. The saving throw DC
should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant
ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).
Tick
These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other
infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid
locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature.
GIANT TICK
This grotesque tick is the size of a dog and scurries with surprising speed.

================================================================================
# TICK SWARM
================================================================================

Attach When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed hypostome
attaches it to that creature. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the giant tick
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is ﬂat-footed
while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on
which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping
the attachment or removing the giant tick in other ways doesn’t cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The giant tick is attached to a creature; Eﬀect The giant
tick uses its hypostome to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to. This deals 1d4
damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A
creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick is drained 1 until it receives healing

FROGS AND TOADS
While they might look similar
in appearance, toads and frogs
are quite diﬀerent creatures,
particularly some of their oversized
variants. Frogs tend to dwell in
swampy or marshy areas, while
toads are found in drier regions
like forests, plains, grasslands, and
deserts. Monstrous toads also skew
to a larger size overall.
Toad
Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly
eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They’re known to eat giant
rats, then take over the rats’ burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This
leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly
explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests,
some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for
recreational use.

# TOTENMASKE
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
FLESH SCULPTORS
Some totenmaskes craft macabre
“art” by shaping the ﬂesh of their
victims, spending hours, days, or
even weeks molding a victim’s skin,
or even fusing multiple creatures
together into one piece. The
horrifying results of this process can
take the form of furniture made from
ﬂesh that still lives and breathes,
“sculptures” that in no way resemble
the human form, and even more
twisted and depraved things.
Totenmaske
Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them
when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most selfindulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these
foul undead can drain the very ﬂesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves
in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants.
Totenmaskes’ speciﬁc longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink,
while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a
mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the
sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is
what helped condemn it to unlife in the ﬁrst place. A totenmaske obsessed with
food, for example, might ﬁnd itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain
totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and
switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.

Fortitude save (sickened 2 and drained 2 on a critical failure).

The totenmaske takes the appearance of a Medium or
smaller humanoid creature. This is either its form

The target can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save
to resist; a critical success grants temporary

sealed can’t breathe and begins to suﬀocate (Core
Rulebook 478). Changes are permanent until reversed
by removing this curse, or the sealed ﬂesh can be
surgically opened with a DC 25 Medicine check that takes

TRITON CONCH TRUMPETS
Tritons use a conch shell as a focus
to summon aquatic allies. Some
specialize in diﬀerent uses of the
conch, such as frightening foes (as
the fear spell) or using water for
attacks (as the spell hydraulic push).
Triton conch shells in the hands
of non-tritons do not produce any
magical eﬀects, but have inspired
other crafters to build magical
triton’s conches (Core Rulebook 576).
Triton
While sometimes understandably mistaken for merfolk—both species live
underwater and have a blend of features from both humans and ﬁsh—tritons
have two legs instead of a tail. This gives tritons the ability to operate on land,
though they are neither as comfortable nor as skilled above water as below.
The arms and legs of a triton feature ﬁns that assist in swimming, and their
entire body is covered in ﬁne scales that range in color from silver to cerulean
blue to seaweed green. Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between
the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and
a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass,
commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in
color from sea blue to golden.
Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to
protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders—whether
they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are
sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons
have had to ﬁght underwater and on land.
In their quest to ﬁght underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins
and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elementals, and
sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using
a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea
species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufﬁciency, rarely trading
with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely
forming established alliances.
Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea ﬂoor,
forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys
heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons—
though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to
the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They
like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants,
bioluminescent ﬁsh, and attractive trinkets recovered
from shipwrecks.

DEATHLESS FROST
Historically isolated in the remote
frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands,
frost trolls have increasingly been
encountered in more temperate
climates on Golarion. It’s unclear
what’s driving these ice-hearted
trolls southward, but some suspect
the machinations of a wrathful
demon lord are at play.
Troll
Towering brutes with slavering jaws and razor-sharp claws, trolls are voracious
predators. They are nigh invulnerable and single-minded in their pursuit, so they
throw themselves against prey with reckless abandon. Wounds that would cripple
or kill most other creatures regenerate into healthy troll ﬂesh within seconds.
Trolls don’t mark their hunting grounds with claw marks or urine as beasts
do. After gorging upon their kill, they suspend any meat, bones, or other bodily
detritus that remain from tree branches to mark their domains. Unfortunately,
trolls tend to treat these borders as approximations. Before a hapless traveler
even spots such a grisly marker and realizes that they have wandered into troll
territory, the trolls are already preparing to attack.
These pages present lesser-known varieties beyond the common troll.
FROST TROLL
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost
teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in
packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to
assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human
ﬂesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity
to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost
troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their
sickly, cracked ﬂesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
themselves with trophies of bone and hide ﬂayed from their kills.

legs. Any ability that would sever a two-headed troll’s head (such as the vorpal weapon
property) doesn’t cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head,

JOTUND TROLL
Jotund
trolls
are
gigantic,
nine-headed
horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes,
and wastelands, always alone and always
enraged. While each of the jotund troll’s nine
heads possess their own brains and senses,
they work much more in tandem than the
dual-minded nature of the two-headed
troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and
bicker, particularly over which head gets to
eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the
same shared stomach makes little difference
in such culinary disagreements.
Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund
troll represents a primordial, if not
original, shape and design for the ﬁrst
trolls to plague the world, arising from a
mythical realm in the Great Beyond known
as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be
nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary
home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the
jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague
the Material Plane as punishment or challenge,
or if it’s merely an evocative legend told
by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the
jotund trolls themselves likely care little.

RAVENOUS MUTANTS
Jotund trolls on the world of Golarion
are found in two particular regions
with greater frequency: the magicwarped reaches of the Mana Wastes,
and the radiation-wracked badlands
of Numeria. In both places, the
presence of life-altering magic or
science seems to have had the same
eﬀect in bolstering the presence of
these lumbering monstrosities.

# TROLLHOUND
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
TROLLHOUND GENESIS
The ﬁrst trollhounds were the
unexpected result of occult
experimentation on wargs with
alchemically prepared troll blood in
the hope of creating an ooze with
limited regeneration. Most of the
wargs died during the trials; the
few survivors lost their cunning
and intelligence in exchange for
a troll’s voracious appetite and
ability to regenerate. Successive
generations of trollhounds often hunt
alongside trolls, understanding on an
instinctual level the bonds they share
with these lumbering giants.
Trollhound
Trollhounds are squat, slavering beasts akin to trolls in canine form. Requiring
vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild
trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious
hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some
regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds’ keen sense of
smell to aid in the hunt.
Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating
contagion known as bloodﬁre fever. Creatures that contract the disease through
the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on
ﬁre. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-ﬁlled blisters,
and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both
trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.
Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to
regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of ﬁre is enough to repel
them, as the beasts don’t recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, ﬁre is
one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to
burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative
powers are potent indeed.
While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and
even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters.
Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds’ diseased slobber, their
ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality
and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more
reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping
into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds
can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to
multiply into a signiﬁcant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds
to the trolls, as they say!

BUILDING WITH SHELLS
The shell of a giant snapping turtle
is over 20 feet long and is sturdy,
naturally curved, and waterproof,
making it a useful building material.
While boggards seldom have
advanced construction techniques,
they use giant snapping turtle shells
as roofs and rafts when available.
Boggards also incorporate smaller
turtle shells into their armor.
Turtle
These generally mild-mannered and docile creatures prefer to be left alone, but the
ill-tempered snapping turtle is a notably violent exception to this rule.
SNAPPING TURTLE
Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long ﬂexible neck, a sharp piercing
beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn’t prevent some spellcasters
from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have
shells around 18 inches in length.

its turn. This increases its AC to 18, but it can’t act except to reemerge, which it can
do as a single action.
GIANT SNAPPING TURTLE
If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle
seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain.
Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is
capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly
boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to
serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those
unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle ﬁnd that even
the creature’s stomach is somewhat armored, making it difﬁcult to cut through.

UMONLEE FABLES
While they’re immense, violent,
and frightening, umonlees aren’t
inherently evil creatures. As such,
there are stories of youths, gnomes,
or other small-statured creatures
who encounter umonlees in the wild
and manage to befriend them, so that
at some later point in the tale when
the pint-sized protagonists are in
peril, their enormous ally can arrive,
bursting from a nearby glacier to
play the role of overwhelming savior.
Whether or not these tales have any
basis in truth is unknown.
Umonlee
Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that
swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes.
Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the
Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.
Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service
of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are
semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are
not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafﬁcked
areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse
group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path
of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that
crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by
an encounter with one of these monstrosities.
Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as
the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean
predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they
can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to
this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of
alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these
alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren’t evil argues well
against such a theory.
