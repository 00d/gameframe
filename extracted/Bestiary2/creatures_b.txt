Confusing Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, emotion, incapacitation, mental, visual) 30
feet. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 34 Will save. If it fails,
it’s confused for 1 round (or 1d4 rounds on a critical failure).
Temporal Reversion Ȳ˓ (fortune) Trigger The bythos fails or critically fails a check; Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect The bythos rerolls the triggering check and takes the better result.

dimensional lock, haste, plane shift; 6th
slow; 4th dimensional anchor (at will)
Rituals DC 37; imprisonment (temporal stasis only)
Aging Strikes ʚʖ (divine, necromancy) The bythos
make two ﬁst Strikes against a single target. If both
Strikes hit, the target attempts a DC 37 Fortitude
save. Creatures that don’t get weaker with age or
don’t age are immune (GM’s discretion). If a creature becomes clumsy 4,
drained 4, and enfeebled 4 due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1,
or increases each of these conditions by 1. This eﬀect is
cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a
maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature becomes
clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2, or increases
these conditions by 2.
Focused Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate) The bythos focuses its
gaze on a creature it can see within 30 feet. The
target must attempt a save against the bythos’s
confusing gaze. A bythos can’t use this ability
against the same creature more than once per turn.
Temporal Flurry ʚʖ The bythos makes four ﬁst
Strikes. Its multiple attack penalty increases normally
with each attack.
Temporal Strike ʚʖ (divine, conjuration, incapacitation, teleportation) The
bythos touches a creature or object to displace it from time. The target
attempts a DC 37 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success Time ﬂows around the target; the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target disappears from the present moment and reappears
in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed for it.
If a creature or object occupies that space when the target returns, the
target appears in the closest available space to its original location.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is slowed 1 for an extra 1d4 rounds after
it returns.
GUARDIANS OF TIME
Bythos aeons have no innate ability
to directly enter the mysterious
Dimension of Time, but many know
of the hidden routes in the Great
Beyond one can use to travel to this
strange realm. A bythos prefers to
destroy those who seek entrance to
the Dimension of Time rather than
risk the knowledge of how to reach it
spreading too far.

Bestiary 2
Ahuizotl
The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous
cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-ﬁngered paws
supplemented by a ﬁfth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and
stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the
cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl’s macabre habit of feeding on a victim’s
eyes, ﬁngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated.
Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist
ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact
that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual ﬂesh of its victims, instead depositing
their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure
to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely
possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread
fear and despair.
An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating
simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an
extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of
cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature’s vision. Yet despite their bestial
appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser
than most. Although they don’t form societies of their own, they have been
known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found
small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman
of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to
an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.

# BASTION ARCHON
================================================================================


ARMORED ARCHONS
Always ready to defend others, most
archons are never encountered out of
their suits of armor. Even those who
eschew armor, such as the bastion
archon, tend to still appear as if they
are wearing heavy protection against
the scourge of battle.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven’s Holy
Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt
that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of
sacriﬁce, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested,
and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness
upon the surrounding region.

good‑aligned creatures in the aura have fast healing 30 for as long as
they remain in range, and they gain a +2 status bonus to attack
rolls and damage rolls.
Ultimate Sacriﬁce (divine, good, healing, necromancy) If the
bastion archon is slain by an evil creature, it explodes in a
geyser of holy light, restoring 140 HP to all good-aligned
creatures in a 40-foot emanation. The ground in the aﬀected
area is also subjected to a level 10 consecrate ritual, and the
ground is consecrated for 10 years (or only 24 hours if the
ultimate sacriﬁce took place in Hell, Abaddon, or the Abyss).

Blinding Beams Ȳ˓ Trigger The bastion archon hits a
creature with two ﬁst Strikes this turn and can use its Holy
Beam; Eﬀect The bastion archon ﬁres its Holy Beam at only the
creature it hit twice. The creature’s save result is one degree of
success worse than the result it rolled.
Entrench Ȱɵ The bastion archon locks itself in place, becoming
voluntarily immobilized. While Entrenched, the archon can’t be
forcibly moved or tripped, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus
to AC and Reﬂex saves. Entrench ends automatically as soon as
the bastion archon uses another move action.
Holy Beam ʚʖ (divine, good, incapacitation, light) The bastion
archon releases a blinding beam of holy light in a 500-foot line
that deals 20d6 good damage to non-archons in the area, with a
DC 38 Reﬂex save. The bastion archon can’t use Holy Beam again
for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is blinded for
1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is
blinded permanently.

Bestiary 2
ASSASSIN WINE
The berries of an assassin vine are
something of an acquired taste to
most, but the process of aging the
berries into wine can remove the
unpleasant aftertaste—provided the
berries are harvested from a living
vine. After the vine’s death, toxins in
the plant quickly seep into its berries,
making them unsuitable for harvest,
and as a result, assassin vine wine is a
dangerous delicacy to prepare. Those
who master the art, though, ﬁnd that
the proceeds can more than cover
the cost of having to periodically hire
adventures to help curtail an unruly—
and—hungry vineyard.
Assassin Vine
The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than
consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey
and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the
carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying ﬂesh. Although an assassin
vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its
root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat
changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its
learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.
As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area
for as long as it has sufﬁcient prey. Though most often found along woodland
trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements,
poorly tended ﬁelds, and vineyards. While assassin vines can’t be trained in the
classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures
like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians
for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to
make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while
simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines’ victims are removed to
keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy
approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.
Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller
vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10
feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches
or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear
small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump,
blood‑red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant
iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.

Bestiary 2
BRALANI CONTESTS
Bralanis enjoy inventing games and
contests and adding new twists to
popular sports rather than following
familiar rules. Speed often features
somewhere in bralani games, whether
it be physical speed or quickness of
wit. It is not uncommon for bralanis
to seek the input of young children,
encouraging adults to draw inspiration
from a child’s creativity rather than
allowing themselves to settle into
comfortable and repetitive patterns.
Azata
Azatas embrace the love of life and the ﬁght to retain individuality and choice.
BRALANI (WIND AZATA)
Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to
test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of
good‑natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conﬂict also extends
to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure
that neither side’s desires are crushed by the other’s and work as mediators when
needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are
going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures.
They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.

Fair Competition (divine, enchantment,
mental) Once per day, a bralani can
spend 1 minute to bless willing creatures within
100 feet who are about to participate in a
contest. This blessing lasts 24 hours.
If a blessed creature cheats or uses
the contest to harm another,
the creature grows visibly ill,
becoming sickened 1 and unable to remove this condition for
the duration or until they withdraw from the competition. At
the end of the contest, participants
who competed fairly ﬁnd it easier
to negotiate and understand their
opponent’s perspective. For 1 hour,
they gain a +2 status bonus to
Diplomacy checks and Recall Knowledge checks
that directly pertain to their opponents.
Whirlwind Blast ʚʖ (air, divine, evocation) The bralani
generates a 20-foot line of scouring wind that deals
7d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save).
It can’t use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

PRIMORDIAL VERANALLIA
In the deepest reaches of Elysium,
the eldest of veranallias roam. These
beings concern themselves with
transformations that take place over
the course of millennia, as well as
changes in the climates of entire
worlds. Primordial veranallias have
an array of unique powers that
can aﬀect the area for many miles
around them, from turning deserts
into glass to triggering earthquakes.
VERANALLIA (REBIRTH AZATA)
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely
interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings ﬁnd their nature hard to
comprehend, but those who secure their aid ﬁnd them powerful allies. The lower
half of a veranallia’s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying
cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body
appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain
consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and
destruction alike. The world around them overﬂows with an abundance of
vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction,
they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life.
They trigger forest ﬁres in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels,
and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

# BADGER
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
TRAINED DIGGERS
Kobolds and others who dwell in
underground warrens know the
value of having a few trained giant
badgers in their lair, since when
their digging habits are supervised
and directed, they can excavate new
tunnels and chambers with ease. Of
course, the fact that giant badgers
ﬁnd kobolds and others who dwell
in underground warrens delicious
means that relying on such trained
diggers can be a risky endeavor. A
giant badger trained for use as a
digger or a guardian tends to only
obey the commands of one master,
and even then they can be prone
to unpredictable outbursts for no
reason other than pique.
Badger
The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally
ﬁerce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
BADGER
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A
threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically ﬁghts
until slain.

GIANT BADGER
The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore,
its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or
adventurer. A giant badger’s claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from
solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

# BAOBHAN SITH
================================================================================


HAUNTING LAIRS
A baobhan sith adores the aesthetics
of abandoned homes, desolate burial
grounds, and crumbling ruins. They
strive to give their lairs a gothic
beauty rather than allowing them to
get run down and ﬁlthy.
Baobhan Sith
Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane’s infusion with the
raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted
the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves,
as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.
A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although
territorial, they won’t reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink
blood from victims they ﬁnd attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals
and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.

The baobhan sith sways rhythmically and Strides up to their Speed.
Each creature within 30 feet of the baobhan sith at the end of their
movement must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily
immune to Captivating Dance for 24 hours.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round and
is temporarily immune to Captivating Dance for
24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend at
least 1 of its actions on each of its turns to move closer
to the baobhan sith as expediently as possible, while
avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature ends its
movement or turn adjacent to the fey, it is slowed
1 until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature must
spend each of its actions moving closer to the baobhan
sith, and if it ends its movement or turn adjacent to
the fey, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal,
transmutation) The baobhan sith can transform into a
large raven, with the eﬀects from the bird option in the
aerial form spell (Core Rulebook 316).
Drink Blood Ȱɵ Requirements A bleeding creature is within
the baobhan sith’s reach; Eﬀect The baobhan sith tries to
Drink the Blood from the bleeding creature’s wounds. The
baobhan sith attempts an Athletics check against the victim’s
Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes drained 1 and the
baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit
Points as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that’s already drained
doesn’t restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim’s
drained value by 1. A victim’s drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood
transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 Medicine check,
and suﬃcient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.

HARVESTING SPORES
The psychotropic spores of the
basidirond can be harvested with
a successful DC 20 Herbalism Lore
or Nature check, yielding 1 dose
of spores (1d4 doses on a critical
success); on a critical failure, the
basidirond creates a 10-foot-radius
hallucinogenic cloud. Each dose
is worth 10 gp for use in Crafting
poisons, or 20 gp if the poison causes
the confused or stupeﬁed condition.
Basidirond
The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on
woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral‑rich
moisture—whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—for sustenance. It uses
hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to
a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for
consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs
nearly 300 pounds when saturated.

DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

# BLACK BEAR
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
VENGEFUL BEASTS
Polar bears have been known to take
special interest in those who have
vexed or wounded them, sometimes
following individual hunters back
to their villages and stalking them
exclusively for several days. This
could happen because the hunter
killed the bear’s mate or one of its
cubs, or took prey that the polar
bear had been stalking. Polar bears
engaged in such behavior have even
ignored easier prey to focus intently
on the chosen target.
Bear
Determined foragers and persistent predators, bears spend much of each year
either preparing for hibernation, recovering from hibernation, or taking care of
young following a successful opportunity to mate.
BLACK BEAR
Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration,
depending on which hue is most beneﬁcial for surviving in their local environment.
Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance
from berries and nuts just as often as from ﬁsh and smaller mammals. They
steal food when they ﬁnd it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are
predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves
or their young, black bears often avoid conﬂict or ﬁght only until they can retreat.

POLAR BEAR
Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips,
and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures,
stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy
waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing
ambush predators, leaping from the water to
ambush seals resting on ice ﬂoes. If they are
desperate, polar bears hunt not only other
animals but also humanoids.

================================================================================
# BEBILITH
================================================================================


ADAPTIVE HUNTERS
Though it doesn’t happen often due
to their ability to shift planes, some
bebiliths ﬁnd themselves trapped on
other planes either through magical
binding or subjugation to beings of
great power. While trapped away
from their favored prey, a bebilith’s
hungers can shift. In such cases, the
creature’s penetrating strikes can
adapt—a bebilith trapped in Elysium,
for example, might become a hunter
of azatas, and its Penetrating Strike
would count as cold iron and evil
instead so that it could target
traditional azata weaknesses.
Bebilith
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder
regions of this horriﬁc plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not
the deadliest—is the bebilith. These ﬁends resemble elephant-sized spiders with
glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic ﬂuid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths’ devious
intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take
advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out
at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic
ﬂesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

blue dragons, citing their reptilian
features, lightning breath, and ability

they encounter in the ﬁeld. Nothing

Behir
The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short

SIGNAL LIGHTS
To communicate at a distance,
blindheims ﬂash their eye lights in
speciﬁc patterns. This is instinctual,
not truly a language, and blindheims
are incapable of inventing new
signals. Some underground explorers
use lanterns to ape these signals.
Two Quick Flashes: Danger!
Long Pulse: All is safe.
Two Long Pulses: Captured food.
Very Long Pulse: Come here.
Rapid Strobing: Let’s mate!
Intermittent Quick Flashes: Excited!
One Long Flash, then Darkness: Sad.
Blindheim
Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids
with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all
times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers
them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their
lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or
ﬁsh. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When
they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, ﬂashing their eyes to
facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using
their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures
they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and
using its light to chase ﬁsh to the surface, while another up above snatches them
up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.
Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to
underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of
fungus to eat, a few ﬁsh swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water
from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when
ﬁrst born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining,
and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.
It’s not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples ﬁnd the
creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars
use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims’ heads
and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They
sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack
darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for
some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known
to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the
ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care
of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.

BLINK DOG SAGES
In every blink dog pack, the wisest
and most intelligent member of
the pack is chosen by the alpha to
act as the pack’s sage. The sage is
charged with maintaining the longrunning oral histories and tales of
the pack, to bind all packs together
in one story that spans centuries.
The sage often has a closer bond to
the mysteries and hidden paths of
magic than the average blink dog, a
result of their advanced years. They
counsel the alpha on all matters
pertaining to the stars, omens,
tactics, and even diplomacy.
Blink Dog
At ﬁrst glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines
with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that
dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog’s inherent intelligence, but
also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the
sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most
humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the
hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures—particularly those that dwell
in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.
Unless acting in concert with speciﬁc allies who have proven that their goals
are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs
are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out.
But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and
lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for
extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between
the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink
to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that
might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream
of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog,
this constant state of ﬂux is as natural as breathing.
Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called
an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted
pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of
blink dog society. They are ﬁercely loyal, defending
the pack or creatures they befriend to the
death and maintaining oaths handed
down from litter to litter. Though
different packs hold different traditions
and oaths, their connection through
the tales and stories told among their
kind and the shared experience of the
movement of stars above weave all blink
dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through
their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for
celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars,
and read omens from unusual
stellar
conjunctions.
These
celestial signs are woven into
blink dogs’ lifeways; their names
contain a reference to the speciﬁc
constellation under which they were born, and a pack’s sage
watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is
old enough for their ﬁrst hunt.

BLODEUWEDDS AND NYMPHS
Nymphs often think of blodeuwedds
as uncouth or too wild, while the
reverse holds true for blodeuwedds,
who consider nymphs to be spoiled
and pampered “princesses” who
take the beautiful parts of the world
in which they dwell for granted. It
speaks volumes to blodeuwedds’
strength of personality that they
don’t let these bitter emotions
control them. Very few of their kind
drift into actual evil—yet likewise,
very few of them display the
kindness that nymphs do.
Blodeuwedd
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the
boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or
around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural
world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of
great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them
for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians
of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from
forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part
of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow
cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to
the other, regardless of their actual goals.

Bodak
When a living, sentient humanoid is exposed to an extreme expression of
supernatural evil, the experience can irrevocably damn the victim, crushing their
mind and ripping out their soul in an appalling, unholy transformation that results
in a creature that’s anathema to life—the bodak.
The shreds of physicality that survive this absolute corruption serve only to
enhance the humanoid’s profoundly disturbing appearance. The bodak’s body
is horriﬁcally twisted, as though it’s locked in a convulsion of agony and terror.
Its desiccated and hairless ﬂesh bears an otherworldly, pearlescent sheen, strung
taut across a malformed skeleton that reduces its gait to a slow shamble. But
most disturbing of all are its eyes, set in a
drooping, melted visage with scant remains of
its former facial structure. These eyes, sunken
deep into their sockets, nevertheless glow with an
unholy light, stare with unremitting malevolence,
and constantly weep noxious vapor.
Fragmented memories of a prior existence ﬁltered
through a vengeful hatred of the living lead the bodak to
try to return to those places it once knew. If successful,
it assaults former friends, acquaintances, and loved
ones with its murderous gaze and an incomprehensible
torrent of gibberish laced with vile curses, accusations, and
threats—an assault that often leads to the victims rising as
newly formed bodaks themselves.

Bog Strider
The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those
who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright
water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders
can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or ﬂeeing from
predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they
call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
A bog strider’s diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed
only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the ﬂesh of any sapient
creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to
ensure the society’s survival against the more aggressive creatures often found
in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community
is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community’s prosperity,
and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female
bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but
often such roles aren’t limited to a single gender, as every member of a small
community pitches in to help as they can.

a hit, the target is ﬂat-footed and takes a
–10‑foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds.

TREMOR TAPPING
Seshes can communicate with other
bog striders via wavesense by
tapping at a water surface they’re
standing upon. Other creatures with
wavesense can detect these tappings,
but understanding them is typically
beyond non-seshes. A GM might
allow a character who has wavesense,
can speak Aquan, and spends a
signiﬁcant amount of time living
among bog striders to understand
tremor tapping or to communicate via
this unusual method.

BROWNIE BARGAINS
As they are not a monolithic group
of fey and often have their own
proclivities, it’s sometimes hard to
predict what might attract a brownie
or ensure their aid. One of the more
commonly thought gifts is a saucer
of milk or cream, though brownies
seem to enjoy other edible treats.
Some farmers have reported success
in leaving shiny but inconsequential
knickknacks like buttons, polished
and painted stones, smoothed glass,
thimbles, or silver ﬂatware. The
whims of some brownies shift, so
someone who wants to retain the
services of a brownie should vary
the gifts they leave for these elusive
fey creatures.
Brownie
Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy burrows,
and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often attired in
clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with
pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled
with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might
call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for
example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems
as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they
do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There’s often no swifter way
to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2
feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.
When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to
confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape.
Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a paciﬁst
nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult.
Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a
hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their “ﬁnal trick,” reserving their use
for the direst of circumstances.
Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through
work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from
a farmer’s orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might
eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash
the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while
avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually ﬁnds
this a beneﬁcial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and
sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home
clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators.
Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one.
Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.

VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

SIGNS OF MURDER
Babaus revel in their art and often
leave behind a grim token or marker
as a signature. They may leave a
distinctive mutilation upon the
bodies of their victims, rather than
harvesting keepsakes and trophies
for a personal collection. Babaus
want their legacy to grow among
those they hunt and kill.
Demon
The living embodiment of mortal souls obsessed with sin and empowered by the
Abyss, demons are armed and armored by their prior lives’ obsessions.
BABAU (BLOOD DEMON)
The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits,
yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus
form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal
murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.

CONJURING DEMONS
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet
the desperate or wicked still do.
Rituals like planar ally or planar
binding are typical for long-term
ends, and summon ﬁend for combat
applications. For planar ally, demons
sometimes accept oﬀerings that aren’t
valuable if gifting them to a demon
pushes the ritualist further into sin.
INVIDIAK (SHADOW DEMON)
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition,
but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing.
Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.

DOLPHINS TO THE RESCUE
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual

Dolphin
Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite
social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans.
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin.

ORCA
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually

inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and
lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing
and succeeding at a DC 23 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the

# BOG MUMMY
================================================================================


NATURAL WARNINGS
Regions haunted by bog mummies
lack small animals, insects, and
other wildlife. A character who is
Investigating, Searching, or Scouting
during exploration mode can attempt
a secret Nature check against the
bog mummy’s Stealth DC to notice
something sinister. A critical success
is enough to speciﬁcally suggest the
presence of undead in the area.
Mummy, Bog
The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can
become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading
undead monstrosities.
Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever,
leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artiﬁcially
preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals
but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or
muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from
the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed
inﬂuence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething
need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unﬁnished at the time of
death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of
this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife
beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body
was disposed of does the rest.
Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulﬁll their
dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the
living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into
their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes,
driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to
the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.

LUNAR NAGA ADDICTION
Some people enjoy the eﬀects
of lunar naga venom and have
developed ways to enhance the
euphoric qualities through alchemical
reﬁnement. While some merchants
pay nagas for their venom, most hire
hunters to capture and enslave the
creatures. As a result, nagas despise
any humanoid who sells or buys their
venom for any reason. Reﬁned lunar
naga venom is identical in price and
eﬀect to dreamtime tea (Pathﬁnder
Gamemastery Guide 121).
Naga
Nagas are identiﬁable by their serpentine bodies and strange, humanlike heads.
All nagas have magical abilities and great intelligence, which they combine to
advance their own agendas.
LUNAR NAGA
Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair
sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever
drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a
graceful beauty that many ﬁnd entrancing, even without the help of the naga’s
inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga’s trust is difﬁcult, but not impossible,
especially for someone who shares the creature’s interest in the celestial sphere.
As they have no hands, lunar nagas use mage hand to manipulate delicate
instruments and ﬁne telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions
of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best,
lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of
the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities
that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive
others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.
On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to
serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in
which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their
knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader
world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar
nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise
to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.

SCYTHEWOOD
Wood harvested from a dead scythe
tree is knotted and twisted, and
often contains pockets of teeth and
bones from long-digested meals
embedded in the growth rings. While
diﬃcult to obtain and challenging
to work with, this wood is sought
out by necromancers, as it is a vital
component in creating particularly
potent necromantic wands and
staves. A single scythe tree typically
yields about 150 gp worth of viable
scythewood for such endeavors.
Scythe Tree
Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest
paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance
from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the ﬂesh, blood, and bone of
sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted
gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The
screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an
extra dimension of ﬂavor to the meal.
Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean
that they don’t need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once
food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When
a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its
bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow
into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on
to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.
Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted
branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have darkbrown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown
leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees’ disturbing mouths
remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on
the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices
are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when
discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally
ﬁnd to be insufferable and worthy of little more than
being hacked to pieces.

# BONE PROPHET
================================================================================

image (at will); 1st ventriloquism (at will)
Deceptive Reposition Ȱɵ The Coil spy Strides up to half their Speed and attempts a Feint,
in either order.
Maintain Disguise A Coil spy can maintain an ongoing illusory disguise as long as they
are conscious without having to re-cast the spell; they need only Cast the Spell again
to reassume their illusory disguise if they wish to change their appearance or if the
active spell is dispelled. Coil spies typically seek privacy when they need to sleep, as
an ongoing illusory disguise ends an hour after they fall unconscious.
Serpentfolk Venom (poison) As zyss serpentfolk, but DC 19.
Sneak Attack The Coil spy’s Strikes deal an extra 2d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
BONE PROPHET
The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place
as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals,
and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by
Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often
raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.

Raise Serpent ̂ˬ (divine, necromancy) Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The
bone prophet animates corpses of snakes, serpentfolk, or similar serpentine
creatures within a 30-foot emanation. Any ﬂesh on the bodies sloughs oﬀ,
and they rise as skeletons. The bone prophet can raise one Large creature
as a skeletal giant or up to three Medium creatures as skeletal champions;
the equipment and attacks might be diﬀerent depending on the corpses’
possessions (Bestiary 298). These skeletons have the minion trait and
are under the bone prophet’s control; the bone prophet can give all
these minions the same command with a single action that has
the concentrate trait. Any skeletal minions that still
remain after 10 minutes crumble to dust.
Serpentfolk Venom (poison) As zyss serpentfolk, but

SHOCKER LIZARD TRAPS
Kobolds are particularly fond of using
shocker lizards in their trap designs,
although such traps rarely keep the
shocker lizards’ safety and comfort in
mind, forcing these cruel but creative
kobolds to constantly replace the
permanently restrained lizards they’ve
set up to defend their lairs.
Shocker Lizard
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard
dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their
scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning
strong enough to harm signiﬁcantly larger foes. Though they’re meek and docile
when encountered alone, shocker lizards are signiﬁcantly more aggressive in
packs, when they can amplify each other’s electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difﬁcult to domesticate because they’re
dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept
alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and
weighs 25 pounds.
