Confusing Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, emotion, incapacitation, mental, visual) 30
feet. A creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 34 Will save. If it fails,
it’s confused for 1 round (or 1d4 rounds on a critical failure).
Temporal Reversion Ȳ˓ (fortune) Trigger The bythos fails or critically fails a check; Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect The bythos rerolls the triggering check and takes the better result.

Rituals DC 37; imprisonment (temporal stasis only)
Aging Strikes ʚʖ (divine, necromancy) The bythos
make two ﬁst Strikes against a single target. If both
Strikes hit, the target attempts a DC 37 Fortitude
save. Creatures that don’t get weaker with age or
don’t age are immune (GM’s discretion). If a creature becomes clumsy 4,
drained 4, and enfeebled 4 due to Aging Strikes, it dies of old age.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1,
or increases each of these conditions by 1. This eﬀect is
cumulative with other aging strikes from bythoses, to a
maximum of clumsy 4, drained 4, and enfeebled 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature becomes
clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2, or increases
these conditions by 2.
Focused Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate) The bythos focuses its
gaze on a creature it can see within 30 feet. The
target must attempt a save against the bythos’s
confusing gaze. A bythos can’t use this ability
against the same creature more than once per turn.
Temporal Flurry ʚʖ The bythos makes four ﬁst
Strikes. Its multiple attack penalty increases normally
with each attack.
Temporal Strike ʚʖ (divine, conjuration, incapacitation, teleportation) The
bythos touches a creature or object to displace it from time. The target
attempts a DC 37 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success Time ﬂows around the target; the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target disappears from the present moment and reappears
in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed for it.
If a creature or object occupies that space when the target returns, the
target appears in the closest available space to its original location.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is slowed 1 for an extra 1d4 rounds after
it returns.
GUARDIANS OF TIME
Bythos aeons have no innate ability
to directly enter the mysterious
Dimension of Time, but many know
of the hidden routes in the Great
Beyond one can use to travel to this
strange realm. A bythos prefers to
destroy those who seek entrance to
the Dimension of Time rather than
risk the knowledge of how to reach it
spreading too far.

Ahuizotl
The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous
cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-ﬁngered paws
supplemented by a ﬁfth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and
stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the
cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl’s macabre habit of feeding on a victim’s
eyes, ﬁngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated.
Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist
ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact
that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual ﬂesh of its victims, instead depositing
their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure
to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely
possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread
fear and despair.
An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating
simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an
extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of
cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature’s vision. Yet despite their bestial
appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser
than most. Although they don’t form societies of their own, they have been
known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found
small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman
of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to
an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.

AHUIZOTL ALLIES
An ahuizotl is unexpectedly
canny in how it handles potential
competitors in its territory, and
when presented with fellow
predators capable of conversation,
it sometimes brokers alliances. Will-
o’-wisps are particular favorites as
allies, as they can lure prey into the
ahuizotl’s clutches and feast on the
anguish later when the mutilated
corpse is discovered.

ASSASSIN WINE
The berries of an assassin vine are
something of an acquired taste to
most, but the process of aging the
berries into wine can remove the
unpleasant aftertaste—provided the
berries are harvested from a living
vine. After the vine’s death, toxins in
the plant quickly seep into its berries,
making them unsuitable for harvest,
and as a result, assassin vine wine is a
dangerous delicacy to prepare. Those
who master the art, though, ﬁnd that
the proceeds can more than cover
the cost of having to periodically hire
adventures to help curtail an unruly—
and—hungry vineyard.
Assassin Vine
The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than
consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey
and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the
carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying ﬂesh. Although an assassin
vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its
root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat
changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its
learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.
As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area
for as long as it has sufﬁcient prey. Though most often found along woodland
trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements,
poorly tended ﬁelds, and vineyards. While assassin vines can’t be trained in the
classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures
like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians
for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to
make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while
simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines’ victims are removed to
keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy
approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.
Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller
vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10
feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches
or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear
small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump,
blood‑red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant
iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.

via tremorsense; Eﬀect The assassin vine causes
vegetation within a 20-foot emanation to writhe for
1 round, turning this area into diﬃcult terrain. When
a creature starts its turn in this area, it must attempt a
DC 20 Reﬂex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it
leaves the area, and on a critical
failure it is also immobilized for
1 round. A creature can
attempt to Escape to
remove these eﬀects.

PRIMORDIAL VERANALLIA
In the deepest reaches of Elysium,
the eldest of veranallias roam. These
beings concern themselves with
transformations that take place over
the course of millennia, as well as
changes in the climates of entire
worlds. Primordial veranallias have
an array of unique powers that
can aﬀect the area for many miles
around them, from turning deserts
into glass to triggering earthquakes.
VERANALLIA (REBIRTH AZATA)
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely
interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings ﬁnd their nature hard to
comprehend, but those who secure their aid ﬁnd them powerful allies. The lower
half of a veranallia’s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying
cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body
appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain
consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and
destruction alike. The world around them overﬂows with an abundance of
vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction,
they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life.
They trigger forest ﬁres in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels,
and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

encase a creature that has been dead for
no more than a year in a cocoon. After 24
hours, the creature is restored to life, and
the cocoon explodes in a shower of colorful
blossoms. If the veranallia’s chooses, Rebirth can change the
creature’s ancestry or heritage, typically into an aasimar.

HARVESTING SPORES
The psychotropic spores of the
basidirond can be harvested with
a successful DC 20 Herbalism Lore
or Nature check, yielding 1 dose
of spores (1d4 doses on a critical
success); on a critical failure, the
basidirond creates a 10-foot-radius
hallucinogenic cloud. Each dose
is worth 10 gp for use in Crafting
poisons, or 20 gp if the poison causes
the confused or stupeﬁed condition.
Basidirond
The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on
woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral‑rich
moisture—whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—for sustenance. It uses
hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to
a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for
consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs
nearly 300 pounds when saturated.

Hallucinogenic Cloud ʚʖ The basidirond releases a
cloud of invisible spores in a 20-foot emanation.
Each creature in the area must succeed
at a DC 22 Fortitude save or experience
powerful hallucinations as long
as it remains in the cloud, plus
an additional 1d4 rounds after
leaving the area. A creature
must attempt a new save each
round it remains within the
area. The cloud persists for 5
rounds unless dispersed before
then by a strong wind. Each
hallucinating creature rolls 1d6
each round to determine what it
hallucinates that round.
1 The target is sinking in quicksand. It falls
prone and spends 1 action on its next turn
ﬂailing its limbs as if attempting to swim.
2 The target is attacked by a swarm of spiders. It spends 2
actions on its next turn attacking the ﬂoor with a melee weapon
(drawing a weapon if needed). It is ﬂat-footed against all attacks.
3 An item the target is holding turns into a viper. The
target Releases the item and spends its next turn ﬂeeing
from it.
4 The target is suﬀocating. It holds its breath and is

DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed
1. If the creature already was slowed
by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a
failed save causes the creature to be
petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this
manner can be instantly restored
to ﬂesh by being coated (not just
splashed) with fresh dracolisk or
basilisk blood no more than 1 hour
old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood
to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner.
Savage Jaws ʚʖ The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its
jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S ) .
This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.

HATRED OF DRAGONS
Some scholars have speculated
that behirs are somehow related to
blue dragons, citing their reptilian
features, lightning breath, and ability
to speak the Draconic language,
but such scholars would do well
to keep such opinions from behirs
they encounter in the ﬁeld. Nothing
infuriates a behir faster than likening
it to a dragon!
Behir
The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short
legs, each ending in three hooked talons. A behir can live to 80 years, but most
perish far younger to violence. Fully grown, a behir is 40 feet long and weighs
4,000 pounds.

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The behir breathes lightning that
deals 9d6 electricity damage in an 60‑foot line (DC 27 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t use
Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Claw Storm ̂ˬ The behir Strides up to its Speed, during which it can
walk on air as if it were solid ground, ascending or descending at
up to a 45-degree angle. It can make up to four claw
Strikes at any point during this movement,
each against a diﬀerent target
within reach, and it deals an
extra 1d6 electricity damage
with each Strike. These attacks
count toward the behir’s multiple
attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until
after the behir makes all of its attacks.
If the behir moves half its Speed or less
during a Claw Storm, that movement doesn’t
trigger reactions. The behir can’t use Claw
Storm if it has a creature wrapped in its coils.
At the end of Claw Storm, it drifts downward up
to 60 feet to the ground, landing softly and taking
no damage from the fall. If it descends further
than 60 feet, it takes damage normally
from the remaining fall.

SIGNAL LIGHTS
To communicate at a distance,
blindheims ﬂash their eye lights in
speciﬁc patterns. This is instinctual,
not truly a language, and blindheims
are incapable of inventing new
signals. Some underground explorers
use lanterns to ape these signals.
Two Quick Flashes: Danger!
Long Pulse: All is safe.
Two Long Pulses: Captured food.
Very Long Pulse: Come here.
Rapid Strobing: Let’s mate!
Intermittent Quick Flashes: Excited!
One Long Flash, then Darkness: Sad.
Blindheim
Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids
with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all
times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers
them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their
lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or
ﬁsh. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When
they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, ﬂashing their eyes to
facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using
their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures
they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and
using its light to chase ﬁsh to the surface, while another up above snatches them
up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.
Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to
underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of
fungus to eat, a few ﬁsh swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water
from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when
ﬁrst born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining,
and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.
It’s not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples ﬁnd the
creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars
use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims’ heads
and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They
sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack
darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for
some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known
to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the
ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care
of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.

BLINK DOG SAGES
In every blink dog pack, the wisest
and most intelligent member of
the pack is chosen by the alpha to
act as the pack’s sage. The sage is
charged with maintaining the long-
running oral histories and tales of
the pack, to bind all packs together
in one story that spans centuries.
The sage often has a closer bond to
the mysteries and hidden paths of
magic than the average blink dog, a
result of their advanced years. They
counsel the alpha on all matters
pertaining to the stars, omens,
tactics, and even diplomacy.
Blink Dog
At ﬁrst glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines
with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that
dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog’s inherent intelligence, but
also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the
sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most
humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the
hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures—particularly those that dwell
in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.
Unless acting in concert with speciﬁc allies who have proven that their goals
are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs
are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out.
But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and
lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for
extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between
the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink
to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that
might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream
of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog,
this constant state of ﬂux is as natural as breathing.
Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called
an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted
pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of
blink dog society. They are ﬁercely loyal, defending
the pack or creatures they befriend to the
death and maintaining oaths handed
down from litter to litter. Though
different packs hold different traditions
and oaths, their connection through
the tales and stories told among their
kind and the shared experience of the
movement of stars above weave all blink
dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through
their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for
celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars,
and read omens from unusual
stellar
conjunctions.
These
celestial signs are woven into
blink dogs’ lifeways; their names
contain a reference to the speciﬁc
constellation under which they were born, and a pack’s sage
watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is
old enough for their ﬁrst hunt.

BLODEUWEDDS AND NYMPHS
Nymphs often think of blodeuwedds
as uncouth or too wild, while the
reverse holds true for blodeuwedds,
who consider nymphs to be spoiled
and pampered “princesses” who
take the beautiful parts of the world
in which they dwell for granted. It
speaks volumes to blodeuwedds’
strength of personality that they
don’t let these bitter emotions
control them. Very few of their kind
drift into actual evil—yet likewise,
very few of them display the
kindness that nymphs do.
Blodeuwedd
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the
boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or
around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural
world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of
great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them
for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians
of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from
forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part
of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow
cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to
the other, regardless of their actual goals.

Bodak
When a living, sentient humanoid is exposed to an extreme expression of
supernatural evil, the experience can irrevocably damn the victim, crushing their
mind and ripping out their soul in an appalling, unholy transformation that results
in a creature that’s anathema to life—the bodak.
The shreds of physicality that survive this absolute corruption serve only to
enhance the humanoid’s profoundly disturbing appearance. The bodak’s body
is horriﬁcally twisted, as though it’s locked in a convulsion of agony and terror.
Its desiccated and hairless ﬂesh bears an otherworldly, pearlescent sheen, strung
taut across a malformed skeleton that reduces its gait to a slow shamble. But
most disturbing of all are its eyes, set in a
drooping, melted visage with scant remains of
its former facial structure. These eyes, sunken
deep into their sockets, nevertheless glow with an
unholy light, stare with unremitting malevolence,
and constantly weep noxious vapor.
Fragmented memories of a prior existence ﬁltered
through a vengeful hatred of the living lead the bodak to
try to return to those places it once knew. If successful,
it assaults former friends, acquaintances, and loved
ones with its murderous gaze and an incomprehensible
torrent of gibberish laced with vile curses, accusations, and
threats—an assault that often leads to the victims rising as
newly formed bodaks themselves.

temporary Hit Points equal to 5 times the value of the drained condition the target

BODAK CREATION
The rarity of the events that create
bodaks ensure that most of these
abominations were humanoids slain
by another bodak’s gaze. Yet bodaks
can also be brought into being by
a rare version of the create undead
ritual. This horriﬁc ritual emulates an
encounter of absolute, supernatural
evil, and so the spell must begin
when the subject is alive and located
on one of the evil Outer Planes.

Bog Strider
The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those
who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright
water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders
can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or ﬂeeing from
predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they
call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
A bog strider’s diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed
only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the ﬂesh of any sapient
creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to
ensure the society’s survival against the more aggressive creatures often found
in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community
is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community’s prosperity,
and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female
bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but
often such roles aren’t limited to a single gender, as every member of a small
community pitches in to help as they can.

TREMOR TAPPING
Seshes can communicate with other
bog striders via wavesense by
tapping at a water surface they’re
standing upon. Other creatures with
wavesense can detect these tappings,
but understanding them is typically
beyond non-seshes. A GM might
allow a character who has wavesense,
can speak Aquan, and spends a
signiﬁcant amount of time living
among bog striders to understand
tremor tapping or to communicate via
this unusual method.

BROWNIE BARGAINS
As they are not a monolithic group
of fey and often have their own
proclivities, it’s sometimes hard to
predict what might attract a brownie
or ensure their aid. One of the more
commonly thought gifts is a saucer
of milk or cream, though brownies
seem to enjoy other edible treats.
Some farmers have reported success
in leaving shiny but inconsequential
knickknacks like buttons, polished
and painted stones, smoothed glass,
thimbles, or silver ﬂatware. The
whims of some brownies shift, so
someone who wants to retain the
services of a brownie should vary
the gifts they leave for these elusive
fey creatures.
Brownie
Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy burrows,
and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often attired in
clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with
pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled
with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might
call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for
example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems
as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they
do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There’s often no swifter way
to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2
feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.
When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to
confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape.
Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a paciﬁst
nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult.
Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a
hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their “ﬁnal trick,” reserving their use
for the direst of circumstances.
Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through
work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from
a farmer’s orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might
eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash
the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while
avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually ﬁnds
this a beneﬁcial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and
sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home
clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators.
Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one.
Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.

VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

Cold Healing Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold
damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the
cold eﬀect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments (Core Rulebook
518), calathgars gain fast healing 1.
Mold Mulch When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays
and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold
if it was killed by ﬁre damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute,
during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its
turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn
in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an
hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot
square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points,
BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing,
and
slashing
damage;
the mold deals half its
regular cold damage once
it’s broken).

Seed Spray ʚʖ (cold, evocation,

thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot
cone, dealing 1d6 piercing and
4d6 cold damage (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). In mild cold or colder
environments (Core Rulebook 518),
these seeds cling to living creatures
they strike, dealing 1d4 persistent
cold damage. The calathgar can’t
use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.

CONJURING DEMONS
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet
the desperate or wicked still do.
Rituals like planar ally or planar
binding are typical for long-term
ends, and summon ﬁend for combat
applications. For planar ally, demons
sometimes accept oﬀerings that aren’t
valuable if gifting them to a demon
pushes the ritualist further into sin.
INVIDIAK (SHADOW DEMON)
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition,
but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing.
Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.

a critical success on its saving throw to resist possession, or if an invidiak’s possession
of a creature is ended prematurely, such as via a successful dispel magic, the invidiak
takes 6d6 mental damage and cannot use possession

Favored Host Each invidiak has a particular type of
creature they prefer possessing, chosen from the
following list: aberration, animal, beast, or any
humanoid (such as dwarf)—in most cases, the favored
type of target is human. When an invidiak uses
possession against a favored host, the duration of
possession increases to unlimited, and the eﬀect lasts
until dispelled or until the invidiak dismisses it.
Shadow Blend ʚʖ (divine, illusion) The invidiak Strides
up to twice their speed. If the invidiak ends their
movement in an area of dim light, they become
hidden as long as they don’t move and the lighting
in the area they’re in doesn’t grow brighter than
dim light.
Unbodied Possession An invidiak leaves no body
behind when using possession.
NABASU (GLUTTONY DEMON)
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material
Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that
releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life.
Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage
to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more
powerful. Once they have sufﬁciently feasted, the demons become
worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo
a vile transformation, ﬁnally digesting their accumulated meals
and deforming further into powerful vrolikais (page 69).
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those
who prefer the tang of undead ﬂesh.

BELKER LORE
Fiercely territorial, belkers attack
trespassers into their lands without

and raking their bodies from the

the Elemental Lord of Air, Hshura,
but some hold secret allegiances to

creature must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature partially
inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and
lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing
and succeeding at a DC 23 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the
creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature’s
space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.
Smoke Slash Ȱɵ Requirement The belker is partially inhaled by a creature; Eﬀect The
belker automatically deals its claw damage to the inhaling creature by forming a claw
to slash and scrape the creature from within.
MELODY ON THE WIND
This cloud of song and sound has been caught
by the wind and carried across the air. While
the melody on the wind (known by some as a song

LUNAR NAGA ADDICTION
Some people enjoy the eﬀects
of lunar naga venom and have
developed ways to enhance the
euphoric qualities through alchemical
reﬁnement. While some merchants
pay nagas for their venom, most hire
hunters to capture and enslave the
creatures. As a result, nagas despise
any humanoid who sells or buys their
venom for any reason. Reﬁned lunar
naga venom is identical in price and
eﬀect to dreamtime tea (Pathﬁnder
Gamemastery Guide 121).
Naga
Nagas are identiﬁable by their serpentine bodies and strange, humanlike heads.
All nagas have magical abilities and great intelligence, which they combine to
advance their own agendas.
LUNAR NAGA
Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair
sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever
drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a
graceful beauty that many ﬁnd entrancing, even without the help of the naga’s
inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga’s trust is difﬁcult, but not impossible,
especially for someone who shares the creature’s interest in the celestial sphere.
As they have no hands, lunar nagas use mage hand to manipulate delicate
instruments and ﬁne telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions
of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best,
lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of
the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities
that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive
others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.
On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to
serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in
which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their
knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader
world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar
nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise
to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.

or become fascinated until the end of the naga’s
next turn (on a critical failure, fascinated creatures
drop whatever items they are carrying as well). The lunar
naga can Sustain a Spell on Hypnosis. If the naga moves, aﬀected creatures are
compelled to remain within 30 feet of the naga and must spend each of its actions
moving closer to the naga as expediently as possible on its next turn. If a creature
is unable to end its turn within 30 feet of the naga, the eﬀect ends for that creature.

SCYTHEWOOD
Wood harvested from a dead scythe
tree is knotted and twisted, and
often contains pockets of teeth and
bones from long-digested meals
embedded in the growth rings. While
diﬃcult to obtain and challenging
to work with, this wood is sought
out by necromancers, as it is a vital
component in creating particularly
potent necromantic wands and
staves. A single scythe tree typically
yields about 150 gp worth of viable
scythewood for such endeavors.
Scythe Tree
Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest
paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance
from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the ﬂesh, blood, and bone of
sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted
gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The
screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an
extra dimension of ﬂavor to the meal.
Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean
that they don’t need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once
food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When
a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its
bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow
into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on
to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.
Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted
branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-
brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown
leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees’ disturbing mouths
remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on
the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices
are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when
discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally
ﬁnd to be insufferable and worthy of little more than
being hacked to pieces.

SHOCKER LIZARD TRAPS
Kobolds are particularly fond of using
shocker lizards in their trap designs,
although such traps rarely keep the
shocker lizards’ safety and comfort in
mind, forcing these cruel but creative
kobolds to constantly replace the
permanently restrained lizards they’ve
set up to defend their lairs.
Shocker Lizard
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard
dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their
scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning
strong enough to harm signiﬁcantly larger foes. Though they’re meek and docile
when encountered alone, shocker lizards are signiﬁcantly more aggressive in
packs, when they can amplify each other’s electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difﬁcult to domesticate because they’re
dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept
alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and
weighs 25 pounds.

Greater Electrolocation A shocker lizard can sense minute electrical charges in living

Amplify Voltage Ǻȓ Trigger A shocker lizard within 20 feet
makes a shock Strike or uses Discharge; Eﬀect The
shocker lizard lends some of its electrical power to the
nearby lizard. This either causes the other lizard’s
shock Strike to lose the nonlethal trait or increases
the DC of its Discharge to 20.
Discharge ʚʖ (electricity) The shocker
lizard releases a blast of lightning
from its body. Creatures within
a 10-foot emanation take 3d6
electricity damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). The shocker lizard can’t
use
Discharge
for
1d4
rounds.
Shocking Burst ̂ˬ (electricity,
evocation, primal) The shocker
lizard hunkers down and begins
to spark with electricity, which it
releases in a 10-foot emanation that
deals 3d8 electricity damage (DC 18 basic
Reﬂex save). The shocker lizard can’t use
Shocking Burst again for 1 minute.
Up to four shocker lizards can combine
their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards
can delay the release of their electricity until
any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes
its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create
an emanation with the combined area from all participating
shocker lizards. For each additional shocker lizard that joins
the burst, the damage increases by 3d8 and the save DC increases by 1
(to a maximum of four lizards dealing 12d8 damage with a DC 21 save).
