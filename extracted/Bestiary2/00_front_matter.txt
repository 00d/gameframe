INTRODUCTION
APPENDIX
Welcome to Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2! Inside this tome of
creatures, you’ll ﬁnd ﬁckle fey and grotesque ﬁends,
legendary beasts and powerful animals, new allies to
interact with and horrid monsters to hunt down. This
book details hundreds of new creatures, expanding upon
the myriad monsters introduced in the ﬁrst Pathﬁnder
Bestiary volume.
To use this book, you need the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, which contains the rules of the game and gives
you further understanding of each creature’s rules and
its place in the world. Using both of these books allows
you as the Game Master (or GM) to create stories of
grand adventure and populate them with fearsome foes,
possible allies, and friendly guides.
Most of the sections of this book describe a creature or
a group of related creatures, present their game statistics,
illustrate their place within the game world, and provide
details about their behavior or society.
In this introduction, you can ﬁnd advice on how
to play these creatures in the game, including how to
read and use their statistics, advice on roleplaying their
interactions with player characters, and guidance on
adjusting creature statistics to ﬁt the needs of your setting.
Lastly, the appendix in the back of the book contains
sections that provide information about frequently used
monster abilities, creature traits, new rituals, uncommon
languages, and lists of monsters sorted by type and level.
Playing Creatures
While the other players portray their characters, you
as the Game Master get to play everyone else. This
section provides the basics for using the creatures in this
book. It guides you through the process of reading and
understanding the creatures’ statistics so the creature can
either provide a threat or serve as an ally in and out of
combat. It also provides general advice for roleplaying
creatures to help provide more depth to the creatures in
your game’s world.
READING CREATURE STATISTICS
Each creature’s rules appear in a stat block, with a
structure similar to those of feats, spells, and magic items.
Because creatures have more abilities than those game
elements, however, their statistics include more entries,
many of which have special formats.
A creature’s traits line sometimes begins with a rarity;
if the creature’s rarity is common, no rarity is listed. The
next entry is its alignment, which is given as a one- or
two-letter abbreviation (LG for lawful good, N for neutral,
CE for chaotic evil, and so on); these abbreviations are
listed comprehensively on page 307. Next is the creature’s
size (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan).
Any other traits are then listed. The traits appearing in
Introduction
this book, including some traits from the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, can be found in Creature Traits on page 304.
Actions and activities the creature can use have the
appropriate icons next to those abilities’ names noting
how many actions they require. A creature always has the
requisite proﬁciency ranks or other abilities required to use
what’s listed in its stat block. For instance, a spellcasting
creature can perform the Cast a Spell activity, and a
creature is never untrained with any of its items.
Some abilities are abbreviated in stat blocks and
described in full in the Ability Glossary on pages 304–306.
CREATURE NAME
LEVEL
RARITY TRAIT
ALIGNMENT ABBREVIATION
SIZE
OTHER TRAITS
Perception The creature’s Perception modiﬁer is listed here,
followed by any special senses.
Languages The languages for a typical creature of that kind are
listed here, followed by any special communication abilities.
If a creature lacks this entry, it cannot communicate with or
understand another creature through language.
Skills The creature is trained or better in these skills. For
untrained skills, use the corresponding ability modiﬁer.
Ability Modiﬁers The creature’s ability modiﬁers are listed here.
Items Any signiﬁcant gear the creature carries is listed here.
Interaction Abilities Special abilities that aﬀect how a creature
perceives and interacts with the world are listed here.
AC, followed by any special bonuses to AC; Saving Throws
A special bonus to a speciﬁc save appears in parentheses
after that save’s bonus. Any special bonuses to all three
saving throws against particular types of eﬀects are listed
after the three saves.
HP, followed by automatic abilities that aﬀect the creature’s
Hit Points or healing; Immunities; Weaknesses; Resistances
Any immunities, weaknesses, or resistances the creature
has are listed here.
Automatic Abilities The creature’s auras, any abilities that
automatically aﬀect its defenses, and the like are listed here.
Reactive Abilities Free actions or reactions that are usually
triggered when it’s not the creature’s turn are listed here.
Speed, followed by any other Speeds or movement abilities.
Melee Ȱɵ (traits; some weapon traits, such as deadly, include
their calculations for convenience) The name of the weapon
or unarmed attack the creature uses for a melee Strike,
followed by the attack modiﬁer and traits in parentheses.
If a creature has any abilities or gear that would aﬀect its
attack modiﬁer, such as a weapon with a +1 weapon potency
rune, those calculations are already included, Damage
amount and damage type, plus any additional eﬀects (this
entry is Eﬀect if the Strike doesn’t deal damage).
Ranged Ȱɵ As Melee, but also lists range or range increment
with traits, Damage as Melee.
Spells The entry starts with the magical tradition and
whether the spells are prepared or spontaneous, followed

================================================================================

================================================================================

Bestiary 2
by the DC (and attack modiﬁer if any spells require spell
attack rolls). Spells are listed by level, followed by cantrips.
A spell prepared multiple times lists the number of times
in parentheses—for example, “(×2).” Spontaneous spells list
the number of spell slots after the spell level.
Innate Spells These are listed like other spells, but can also
include constant, at-will, and focus spells. If the creature
has a focus spell as an innate spell, it works like other innate
spells with listed uses, rather than costing Focus Points.
Spells that can be used an unlimited number of times list
“(at will)” after the spell’s name. Constant spells appear at
the end, separated by level. Rules for constant and at-will
spells appear on page 342 in the Ability Glossary.
Focus Spells If a creature has focus spells, this entry lists the
spells’ level, the Focus Points in the creature’s focus pool, the
DC, and those spells.
Rituals Any rituals the creature can cast appear here.
Oﬀensive or Proactive Abilities Any actions, activities, or
abilities that automatically aﬀect the creature’s oﬀense, as
well as free actions or reactions that are usually triggered
on the creature’s turn, appear here in alphabetical order.
ROLEPLAYING CREATURES
Whether it’s an adversary or a potential ally, a creature
might have a very different worldview than the PCs. When
roleplaying creatures, think about how they experience
the world differently due to their senses, physiology, and
habitat. Each creature entry in this book gives you some
context about the creature’s worldview, motivations,
ecology, and societies. Many sections have sidebars that
provide relevant facts about creatures (labeled with the
icons listed in the Sidebar Icons section on page 7). You can
use the information in each creature entry as cues on how
to roleplaying the creature in and out of combat. These
cues can be as simple as a difference in idioms (perhaps
saying “in the other tentacle” rather than “on the other
hand”) and as complex as determining motivations, hopes,
and dreams for an individual creature. Understanding a
creature you’re playing also informs what tactics they’ll
use, as well as whether they are willing to surrender or ﬂee
when things don’t go their way.
Adjusting Creatures
Sometimes you might need to customize a creature based
on the needs of your story or the narrative circumstances as
your story unfolds. This section guides you through some
basic strategies you can use to adjust creatures. It includes
quick adjustments you can make to a creature to alter its
level. You might also need to adjust a creature’s languages
or gear, or know its proﬁciency ranks in skills or Perception.
COMBAT POWER
The creatures presented in this book have appropriate
statistics for their levels. In many cases, you can make
relatively minor adjustments, called elite and weak
adjustments, to their statistics to make them function 1 level
higher or lower than presented.
Elite and weak adjustments work best with creatures
that focus on physical combat. These adjustments
overstate the normal numerical gains the creature would
make from increasing its level to make up for the lack
of new special abilities. As such, when applied multiple
times to the same creature, these adjustments cause its
statistics to become less accurate for the creature’s level.
These adjustments have a greater effect on the power
level of low-level creatures; applying elite adjustments to
a level –1 creature gives you one closer to 1st level, and
applying weak adjustments to a 1st-level creature gives
you one whose level is closer to –1.
Creatures that cast spells or rely on noncombat abilities
typically need speciﬁc adjustments to those spells or abilities.
ELITe ADJUSTMeNTS
Sometimes you’ll want a creature that’s just a bit more
powerful than normal so that you can present a challenge
that would otherwise be trivial, or show that one enemy
is stronger than its kin. To do this quickly and easily,
apply the elite adjustments to its statistics as follows:
• Increase the creature’s AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs,
saving throws, Perception, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
• Increase the damage of its Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 2. If the creature has limits on how many
times or how often it can use an ability (such as a
spellcaster’s spells or a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 4 instead.
• Increase the creature’s Hit Points based on its starting
level (see the table below).

Starting Level

5–19

WeaK ADJUSTMeNTS
Sometimes you’ll want a creature that’s weaker than
normal so you can use a creature that would otherwise
be too challenging, or show that one enemy is weaker
than its kin. To do this quickly and easily, apply the weak
adjustments to its statistics as follows.
• Decrease the creature’s AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs,
saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
• Decrease the damage of its Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 2. If the creature has limits on how many
times or how often it can use an ability (such as a
spellcaster’s spells or a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
decrease the damage by 4 instead.
• Decrease the creature’s HP based on its starting level.

INTRODUCTION
APPENDIX
LANGUAGES
The languages listed in a creature’s entry are what a typical
creature of that type knows. However, you might want to
vary these based on the speciﬁc creature. For instance, if
a creature is interested in speaking with or understanding
the people in its region, it would most likely know the
language those people speak. This language is most often
Common, but you can give it a more appropriate language
depending on what region the creature lives in (such as
Undercommon if the creature lives in the Darklands).
Beings from other planes are unlikely to know any
languages from the Material Plane unless they frequently
travel there. If such a creature knows a mortal language,
then that creature likely is interested in communicating
with mortals. This language is most often Common,
although keep in mind that such a creature should speak
Common only if it speciﬁcally travels to or studies your
campaign’s world and region above others.
The languages in Pathﬁnder can be found on page 65 of
the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook and in the New Languages
section of this book (page 348).
GEAR
Some creatures rely on gear, like armor and weapons. You
might need statistics for such a creature that doesn’t have
its gear. For example, a creature could be Disarmed, it
might be ambushed while it’s out of its armor, or one of its
worn magic items could be disabled with dispel magic. In
most cases, you can simply improvise, but if you want to be
more exacting, use these guidelines for weapons and armor.
If a creature loses its weapon, it might draw another
weapon or use an unarmed attack. If it uses a Strike it
doesn’t have listed in its stat block, ﬁnd a Strike entry
for the creature that most closely matches the substitute,
reduce the attack modiﬁer by 2, and use the damage
dice for the new Strike. If the creature needs to make an
unarmed attack and doesn’t have one listed in its stat
block, it uses the statistics for a ﬁst (Core Rulebook 280).
If the creature loses a weapon with a weapon potency rune,
you usually should reduce the attack modiﬁer by 2 plus the
bonus granted by the weapon’s potency rune for the new
weapon. For example, if the creature is Disarmed of its
+1 mace, then you would reduce the attack modiﬁer by 3
instead of 2 for the new Strike.
If a creature doesn’t have its
armor, ﬁnd the armor in its
Items entry and reduce
the creature’s AC by that
armor’s item bonus (Core Rulebook 275). If the armor has
a potency rune, increase the reduction as appropriate; for
example, if the creature has a suit of +2 chain mail in its
statistics, and the characters catch the creature without its
armor, you would reduce the creature’s AC by 6 instead of
4. If the armor has a resilient rune, reduce the creature’s
saves based on the rune’s type (1 for resilient, 2 for greater
resilient, or 3 for major resilient).
SKILLS, PERCEPTION, AND PROFICIENCY
In some situations, such as when a creature is trying to
Disable a PC’s snare, you need to know the creature’s
proﬁciency rank. Creatures are trained in the skills listed in
their stat blocks. Because monsters aren’t created using the
same rules as PCs, they are untrained in skills that aren’t
listed. A creature usually has expert proﬁciency in its listed
skills around 5th level, master proﬁciency around 9th level,
and legendary proﬁciency around 17th level. A creature
might need a certain proﬁciency rank in Perception to detect
certain things. Many creatures have expert proﬁciency in
Perception, and improve to master proﬁciency around 7th
level and legendary proﬁciency around 13th level.
At your discretion, creatures with world-class aptitude for
a particular skill or in Perception, such as a doppelganger
with Deception, might have a higher rank in that skill
or Perception.
