KELPIE FOLKTALES
Some fanciful stories about kelpies
speak of them appearing in equine
form wearing riding tack, complete
with silver stirrups and bridle bit.
These folktales claim that cutting
the harness from the kelpie’s body
grants the bearer power over it, or
causes the kelpie to sicken and die.
In truth, doing so has no ill eﬀect
on a kelpie, suggesting these stories
are spread by kelpies themselves
to further trick prey into making
foolish mistakes.
Kelpie
Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals
to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly
preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater
then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim’s heart and liver—
the only parts of a meal kelpies ﬁnd unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically
disguising itself as ﬁne steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but
its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green ﬂesh
resembling aquatic plants.

Captivating Lure ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental,
primal) The kelpie instills an overwhelming attraction to itself within the mind of a
single creature within 60 feet. The target perceives the kelpie as a desirable person (if
the kelpie is in humanoid form) or a valuable steed (if the kelpie is in equine form) and
must attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to Captivating
Lure for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round and is then temporarily immune to
Captivating Lure for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to
the kelpie as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated
creature is adjacent to the kelpie, it either attempts to mount the kelpie
(if the kelpie is in equine form) or stays still and
doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked by the
kelpie, or if it can’t breathe water and enters
an area of water, the creature is freed from
captivation at the end of the kelpie’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target
doesn’t consider water a danger and
will enter an area of water even if
it can’t swim or breathe water.
If it is attacked by the kelpie or
starts to drown, it can attempt
a new save at the start of its
next turn, but it isn’t freed
automatically.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate,
polymorph,
primal,
transmutation)
The
kelpie

take
on
the appearance of any
Medium or Large animal
of an equine nature (such as
a horse, hippocampus, or pony), or
any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change its Speeds or its attack and damage
modiﬁers with its Strikes.

KORRED DANCES
Despite their insular nature, korreds
love to dance. On certain auspicious
dates, korreds hold great festivals
of music and dance in ancient stone
circles deep within forest glades.
A few non-korred fey sometimes
receive invitations to these dances,
but any non-fey who interrupts the
dance is berated at best or attacked
at worst.
Korred
Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long,
animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural afﬁnity and admiration for
stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or
wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don’t take
kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who
stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their
minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to ﬂow freely, often wearing only a
belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears—though this belt and
pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.

Animated Hair (aura, primal, transmutation) 5 feet.
The korred’s long, animated hair reaches out
and interferes with creatures in the area. The
korred can select which targets are aﬀected by their
animated hair. An aﬀected creature that ends its turn in the
emanation must succeed at a DC 18 Reﬂex save or become clumsy 1
(clumsy 2 on a critical failure) as long as it remains in the aura.

Primal Innate Spells DC 21; 6th stone tell; 4th shape stone (at will), shatter
(at will)
Hair Snare Ȱɵ (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) The korred causes a
long, tangled length of their hair to detach from their body and snake out
to coil around an adjacent creature. The creature must attempt a DC 21
Reﬂex save. The korred cannot use Hair Snare again for 1d4 rounds.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The hair wraps around the creature. The creature takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all of its Speeds until it Escapes (DC 21) or until
the korred uses Hair Snare again (at which point the previous snare drops to
the ground, no longer animated).
Critical Failure The creature is immobilized until it Escapes (DC 21) or the korred
uses Hair Snare again.
Otherworldly Laugh ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, incapacitation, primal, sonic) Frequency
three times per day; Eﬀect The korred unleashes an otherworldly laugh. Each non-fey
creature within a 30-foot burst must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save. On a failure, the
creature is slowed 1 for 1 round (or stunned 1 on a critical failure).
Stone Stride ʚʖ (conjuration, earth, primal, teleportation) The korred steps into a block
of stone large enough for them to ﬁt inside and instantly teleports to any other stone
within 30 feet that has the same minimum size. Once the korred enters the stone, they
instantly know the rough locations of other suﬃciently large stones within 30 feet.
They can exit from the original stone, if they prefer. They can’t carry extradimensional
spaces with them when they Stone Stride; if the korred attempts to do so, Stone
Stride fails.

LEECH SPECIES
The spotted hooktooth leech is
often found in areas frequented
by trolls, who sometimes wear
them as awful decorations, relying
on their regeneration to control
the bleeding eﬀects. The gigantic
elephant leech feeds on immense
beasts of the swamplands or jungles,
like elephants, froghemoths, and
dinosaurs, attacking from unexpected
range. But it’s the relatively small
gutleech that provides the most fuel
for nightmares, due to its awful habit
of feeding on victims from inside.
Leech
Though valued by apothecaries and ﬁeld medics as methods to reduce swelling
or drain blood, leeches are despised by most who encounter them, regardless
of the setting.
GIANT LEECH
Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws
ﬁlled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving
shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are
their favorite prey, but they won’t balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or
halﬂing-sized meal.

Eﬀect The giant leech drains blood from the creature it has grabbed. This
deals 2d4 damage. A creature that has its blood drained by a giant leech
is drained 1 until it receives any kind or amount of healing.
BROOD LEECH SWARM
Most smaller species of leeches do not tend to swarm, but
brood leeches are prone to gathering in seething, undulant
mats of squirming gluttony. When they gather in sufﬁcient
numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech’s
feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding.
In these situations, their mild venom can affect much
larger creatures than their usual prey.
