Bestiary 2
Archon
Tireless agents of Heaven, archons embody virtues and strive to guide mortals
while battling the evil forces of the ﬁendish realms. Heaven’s seven-tiered
mountain is generally known as a place of contemplation and philosophy,
as exempliﬁed by the ﬁfth level, Illumis. But the archon denizens of Heaven’s
threshold and the second level, Proelera, concern themselves with defense and
mustering armies for the endless battles against Hell and the Abyss. However,
whereas devils and demons take pleasure in harming the innocent, Heaven’s
wardens reserve their blades for only the truly wicked and irredeemable. Among
mortals, they prefer to guide and nurture a rule of law that looks out for the
weak and powerless, leading mortal agents to overcome mortal threats rather
than solving those threats themselves.
HOUND ARCHON
Among the rank-and-ﬁle soldiers of Heaven’s armies, few individuals are more
dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments
of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar
level along Heaven’s grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for
evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon’s
role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with
protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast
dimension door, the archon can use dimension door (heightened to
5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the
maximum distance of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s
dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the
same distance and direction from the creature as before either
creature used dimension door.
Change Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
polymorph,
transmutation) A hound archon can take the appearance
of any canid animal of Small to Large size. This doesn’t
change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses
for their Strikes, but if the canid’s bite attack has the
Knockdown ability, then the hound archon’s bite
attack gains that ability while they are in that form.
Diligent Assault ʚʖ The hound archon carefully
makes one greatsword Strike and one jaws Strike
in any order. These attacks count toward the
hound archon’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
ARCHON EVOLUTIONS
When a spirit becomes an archon,
they usually start as a lantern archon,
the lowliest of archonkind. As they
perform noble deeds and bolster their
pureness of heart, an archon evolves
into greater forms, possibly skipping
stages or remaining in others for long
spans of time, depending on their
particular strengths and personality.

INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
A trumpet archon’s magical
instrument is no mere piece of
brass; each of these immaculately
crafted horns is said to be crafted
in Heaven’s blessed forges and
infused with the voices of a thousand
angels. Only archons can truly
play such trumpets—mortals lack
the power necessary to create
trumpet archons’ iconic clarion
calls, but can still play them as
virtuoso instruments.
TRUMPET ARCHON
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers­—embodiments of
the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and
among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps
leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet
archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon
is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

# HEZROU
================================================================================


HALF-DEMONS
The Abyss can corrupt living
creatures through direct congress
or supernatural infusion of Abyssal
energies, resulting in monstrous
hybrids. A half-demon should be a
custom creature, but you can quickly
generate one by giving an existing
creature a few of a demon’s abilities
along with the demon’s sin-related
vulnerability. For example, a halfhezrou hill giant would gain purity
vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite,
swim Speed, and poisonous pustules.
When swapping over abilities between
creatures of diﬀerent levels, be sure to
adjust the numbers for the new level.
a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often
waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber,
squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to
fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own.
Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or
neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious
spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

Purity Vulnerability A hezrou revels in the foulness it exudes and becomes distraught
when contaminations are puriﬁed. The ﬁrst time in a round when a contamination
is puriﬁed (such as via purify food and drink) or a toxin is neutralized (such as via
neutralize poison) within 30 feet of a hezrou, the demon takes 6d6 mental damage.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the
aura must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1

creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to

NALFESHNEE (BOAR DEMON)
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed
demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike
and form from the souls of avaricious mortals.
Few demons understand the inner workings
of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it’s not
unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor
of the Abyss itself ﬁrst rather than bow before
a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the
ﬂeshy realms that birth new demons, while others
guard sites of particular signiﬁcance deep in the
plane’s secret reaches. A nalfeshnee’s realm in the
Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the
largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a
singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos
of the Abyss.

SECRET MONGERS
Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as
well as material goods, especially if
such information can help satisfy the
needs and desires of the Abyss. Each
nalfeshnee has areas of interest in
which they’re highly knowledgeable,
but before a nalfeshnee reveals a
secret, they typically demand a secret
of at least equal value in return.

Will saves against attempts to Coerce it for 1 hour (this is a mental eﬀect).
Quick Invisibility The osyluth can cast innate invisibility using only 1 action.
Sadistic Strike An osyluth deals an extra 2d6 damage whenever they
Strike an enfeebled, frightened, or prone creature.
Stygian Inquisitor Ȱɵ (linguistic, mental) The osyluth telepathically
questions a creature aﬀected by zone of truth. After 1
round, if the creature intentionally refuses to answer
the question, it takes 2d6 mental damage.
Tail Sweep Ȱɵ The osyluth sweeps their tail in
a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone
must succeed at a DC 26 Reﬂex save or be
knocked prone.
HAMATULA (BARBED DEVIL)
Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to
protect infernal vaults from those
foolish enough to try to rob the
archdevil Mammon. In case the
vicious spines protruding from their
bodies and ability to teleport weren’t
deadly enough, they are also clever
wielders of warding glyphs. They are
effective conjured guardians, though
they resent being pulled away from
their duties in Hell. Unlike most ﬁends,
hamatulas are formed from several souls
that lack any features distinctive enough to
merit another role.

HAMATULA TREASURES
Perhaps because hamatulas exist to
guard the riches of archdevils, infernal
dukes, and queens of the night, they
ﬁnd themselves drawn to wealth.
Though they despise summoners who
pull them away from their assigned
duties, hamatulas use their servitude
as an opportunity to collect treasures
and wealth that they can oﬀer to their
lords upon their return. Treasures that
are painful or dangerous to handle are
among their favorite prizes.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Barb only. A hamatula gains an extra reaction at the start of
each of its turns that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity. It can’t use
more than one Attack of Opportunity triggered by the same action. In addition to the
normal trigger, a hamatula can make an Attack of Opportunity against a creature that
touches it or an adjacent creature that attempts a melee Strike against it.

Bloodletting On a critical hit, the hamatula’s barbs deal 3d6 persistent bleed damage.
Frightful Strike Ȳ˓ (divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Trigger The hamatula
hits a creature with a barb Strike; Eﬀect The creature struck must succeed at
a DC 27 Will save or become frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical
failure). Regardless of the result of its saving throw, the creature
is then temporarily immune to Frightful Strike for 24 hours.
Impaling Barb ʚʖ The hamatula makes a barb Strike, then
Strides up to half its Speed without triggering reactions. If
the Strike hits, the hamatula impales the target with one of
its barbs and snaps the barb free as it moves away from
the target. This deals an additional 2d8 piercing damage
to the target and pins it to an adjacent surface, rendering
it immobilized (Escape DC 29).
Warden of Erebus A hamatula’s glyph of warding innate
spell can contain any common spell from the Core
Rulebook that meets the criteria in glyph of warding;
the hamatula doesn’t need to provide the spell.
GYLOU (HANDMAIDEN DEVIL)
Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive
and complex machinations of Hell, they are highly
skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful
deception, physical ﬁnesse, and nearly any other
tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has
led to gylous becoming widespread throughout
all layers of Hell, enabling them to ﬁlter key
information to their masters regarding other
devils’ plots and schemes. Their allegiance
is no secret, but their skills are so great
that powerful devils employ one or more
gylous regardless. While most gylous have
a feminine form (combined with their role,
this is the source of their common moniker
of “handmaiden”), some have other gender
presentations, and nearly all gylous take on
carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles
they ﬁll. More often than not, gylous arise when
lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility
and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though
on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals
who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.

IGUANODON
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests
where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other
depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach
delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger.
Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A
well‑placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a
cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh
6,000 pounds.

================================================================================
# HELLCAT
================================================================================


CATS AND DOGS
If there’s one thing more certain to
infuriate a hellcat other than to treat
it as a mere animal, that is to compare
it in any way to a hell hound. Hellcats
consider hell hounds little more than
vermin infesting the hellscapes they
call home, and enjoy torturing them
more than any other creature.
Hellcat
Hellcats are devious predators native to the ﬁery pits of Hell. While the ﬁendish
creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and
dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with
transparent ﬂesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet
long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and
stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As ﬁendish creatures, they do not require
mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inﬂicting
pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being
treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may ﬁnd themself
made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate
elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.
Though they can’t speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate
by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much
except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of
their diabolic masters.
Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up
against foes they’re unable to reach, but they never forget prey that
escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies,
including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes
against their foes.

any hellcat that moves out of a 100-foot radius. While linked to at least one ally, the
hellcat can’t be ﬂanked and gains a +2 status bonus to Will saving throws.
Menacing Growl ʚʖ (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The hellcat produces a low growl
to disorient and frighten foes. The hellcat can cause this vocalization to originate from
somewhere else within 30 feet. Non-ﬁends in a 15-foot burst must attempt a DC 25

defend against aquatic foes, and

Hippocampus
The strange beasts known as hippocampi resemble terrestrial horses from head
to midbody, but on their legs, they have splayed ﬁns instead of hooves, and in
place of horses’ hindquarters, they have powerful tails resembling those of ﬁsh.
Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and
brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi
tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that
provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to
provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike,
as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be
that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though
hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most
handlers outﬁt them with the lightest options available. More often they are
trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi
do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while
ﬂopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them
differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species,
such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best
presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.

# HIPPOGRIFF
================================================================================


HIPPOGRIFF EGGS
Rather than birthing live young,
hippogriﬀs lay a clutch consisting of
only a single egg. Hippogriﬀ eggs are
sought after by potential trainers and
opportunists alike.
Hippogriff
With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magniﬁcence of a powerful
horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps
the creation of a ﬂesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of
their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above
their favored plains or hill country.
Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather
coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have
managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their
torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are
colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or
even palomino coloration.
Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their
equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies
above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and
wyverns. Only hippogriffs’ superior speed helps protect them from
these predators.
Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and ﬁercely protect the
lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands,
rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their
homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb
the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid.
Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal
to aid in digestion.
Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both
ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set
bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs
frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote
outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer,
elk, and bears.
However, other communities train hippogriffs from
hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—
the most notable among these groups in the Inner
Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the citystate of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult
hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more
difﬁcult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat
techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount,
ﬁghting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement
of their companion’s wings.

HIPPO SWEAT
A hippopotamus’s sweat is an
unusual reddish color that can lend
them an even more frightening
appearance that evokes the visage of
a blood-coated monster. This sweat
helps to protect the hippopotamus
from becoming overheated, but it
also bolsters their resistance to all
manner of diseases.
Hippopotamus
Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of

them an even more frightening
appearance that evokes the visage of
a blood-coated monster. This sweat
helps to protect the hippopotamus
from becoming overheated, but it
also bolsters their resistance to all
manner of diseases.
Hippopotamus
Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of
their time in rivers and lakes, but they also can thrive on land.
HIPPOPOTAMUS
Typical adult hippos move quickly on land and attack stealthily in the water.
Though herbivorous, hippos are notoriously aggressive and territorial.

HODAG TALES
Those who’ve encountered hodags
tend to create larger-than-life
reports of the sighting. In the
dense Verduran Forest, lumberjacks
working for the Lumber Consortium
regale each other with competing
stories about Big Marna, a legendary
hodag who the loggers claim has
killed two dozen people. Inhabitants
of Echo Wood in the River Kingdoms
spin lore about Black Shiv, a hodag
spotted haunting the outskirts of
small settlements, and in recent
months, hunters and miners in the
southwestern reaches of Ravounel
speak of a frightening undead hodag
called Ghouliegut.
Hodag
Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers’ or miners’
tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote
areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous
beasts ﬁrsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.
Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators’ long
claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines
that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their
wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark.
The hodags’ rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to
blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red
eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage
by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily
moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.
In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a
foul‑smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between
their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and
weighs upward of 700 pounds.

Strike, the hodag
deals damage normally
and then attempts an
Athletics check against
the creature’s Fortitude DC to
toss the enemy into the air. On
a success, the tossed creature is thrown
10 feet in a straight line in the direction of the hodag’s
choice and then lands prone. If the creature is knocked
into a solid object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as
well before landing prone. The hodag can instead toss
a creature straight up in the air. The creature lands in
the same square where it started, takes
1d6 bludgeoning damage, and
lands prone.

TINDALOS
Ancient texts refer to these
relentless temporal hunters as the
hounds of Tindalos, yet they never
seem to explore what Tindalos
actually is. In some references, the
implication is that Tindalos is one of
the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods,
but if this is the case, it is among the
most obscure of these entities. Other
tomes refer as Tindalos as a location,
perhaps even a city or nation that
once existed before time began and
that can be reached only by methods
impossible for any creature bound
by the laws of time. In all likelihood,
both and neither are right—what
Tindalos is may simply be impossible
for mortal minds to comprehend.
Hound of Tindalos
Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the
ﬂow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send
their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can
draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the
hounds’ ire, so few who trafﬁc in such rituals live long enough to spread their
knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely
interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have
attracted their unblinking attention.
Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The
pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and
devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of
Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.

Otherworldly Mind (mental) Whenever a creature targets the hound with a mental eﬀect,
that creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 25 basic Will save). On a critical failure, it
also becomes confused for 1d4 rounds.
Ripping Gaze (aura, evocation, occult, visual) 30 feet. The hound of Tindalos’s eyes glow
balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that
meets its awful gaze. When a creature ends its turn in the aura’s emanation, it
takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). A creature that
critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Vulnerable to Curved Space When a hound of Tindalos is not
adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its
resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it
becomes sickened 1. It can’t recover from this sickened
condition, but the condition ends automatically once
the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.

Angled Entry Ȱɵ The hound of Tindalos casts
a 4th-level dimension door spell, but it must
transport itself into a space adjacent to an
angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or
environment around it. For example, it could teleport
to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle
between the wall and ﬂoor) or a corner in a room, or
adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of
the ground, but not to a ﬂat plain or a room
with only curved corners and edges.
Once per day, the hound can use
this ability to plane shift to or from
the Dimension of Time, with the
same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.

SENSATION SEEKERS
Intellect devourers steal bodies to
experience the physical sensations
denied their nearly invulnerable
natural forms. Each new body
brings the opportunity to explore
new vistas of taste, touch, and pain.
Intellect devourers occupying a
body fear little but discovery, and
even that simply puts a temporary
end to their games. Harm to the
host is just another sensation to
experience, and replacement bodies
are easy to ﬁnd.
Intellect Devourer
Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and inﬁltrators for the powerful
force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the
Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When
an intellect devourer inﬁltrates a society, its ﬁrst priority is to acquire a body. It
might ﬁrst seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than ﬁghting
and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host’s brain
cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of
its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to
make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.
