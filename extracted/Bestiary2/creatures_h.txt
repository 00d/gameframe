Archon
Tireless agents of Heaven, archons embody virtues and strive to guide mortals
while battling the evil forces of the ﬁendish realms. Heaven’s seven-tiered
mountain is generally known as a place of contemplation and philosophy,
as exempliﬁed by the ﬁfth level, Illumis. But the archon denizens of Heaven’s
threshold and the second level, Proelera, concern themselves with defense and
mustering armies for the endless battles against Hell and the Abyss. However,
whereas devils and demons take pleasure in harming the innocent, Heaven’s
wardens reserve their blades for only the truly wicked and irredeemable. Among
mortals, they prefer to guide and nurture a rule of law that looks out for the
weak and powerless, leading mortal agents to overcome mortal threats rather
than solving those threats themselves.
HOUND ARCHON
Among the rank-and-ﬁle soldiers of Heaven’s armies, few individuals are more
dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments
of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar
level along Heaven’s grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for
evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon’s
role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with
protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast
dimension door, the archon can use dimension door (heightened to
5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the
maximum distance of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s
dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the
same distance and direction from the creature as before either
creature used dimension door.
Change Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
polymorph,
transmutation) A hound archon can take the appearance
of any canid animal of Small to Large size. This doesn’t
change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses
for their Strikes, but if the canid’s bite attack has the
Knockdown ability, then the hound archon’s bite
attack gains that ability while they are in that form.
Diligent Assault ʚʖ The hound archon carefully
makes one greatsword Strike and one jaws Strike
in any order. These attacks count toward the
hound archon’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
ARCHON EVOLUTIONS
When a spirit becomes an archon,
they usually start as a lantern archon,
the lowliest of archonkind. As they
perform noble deeds and bolster their
pureness of heart, an archon evolves
into greater forms, possibly skipping
stages or remaining in others for long
spans of time, depending on their
particular strengths and personality.

INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
A trumpet archon’s magical
instrument is no mere piece of
brass; each of these immaculately
crafted horns is said to be crafted
in Heaven’s blessed forges and
infused with the voices of a thousand
angels. Only archons can truly
play such trumpets—mortals lack
the power necessary to create
trumpet archons’ iconic clarion
calls, but can still play them as
virtuoso instruments.
TRUMPET ARCHON
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers­—embodiments of
the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and
among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps
leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet
archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon
is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

Kind Word Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment,

ally praise or encouragement. The archon attempts
to counteract one emotion eﬀect on the ally (with a
counteract modiﬁer of +24), and the archon and the
ally both gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and
saving throws for 1 round.

those who hear it are paralyzed in awe. Non-archons
within 100 feet must attempt a DC 34 Fortitude save.

STAR ARCHON
Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star
archons serve as philosophers and administrators,
and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and
generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory
and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are
as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and
unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather
than on battleﬁelds, star archons are ﬁerce opponents when motivated to enter

SECRET MONGERS
Nalfeshnees covet knowledge as
well as material goods, especially if
such information can help satisfy the
needs and desires of the Abyss. Each
nalfeshnee has areas of interest in
which they’re highly knowledgeable,
but before a nalfeshnee reveals a
secret, they typically demand a secret
of at least equal value in return.

AC 34; Fort +28, Ref +22, Will +23; +1 status to all saves vs. magic
HP 365; Weaknesses cold iron 15, good 15
Forfeiture Aversion A nalfeshnee’s greed is such that losing possessions causes them
harm. If an item is stolen from a nalfeshnee, the demon takes 3d6+10 mental damage.
Greedy Grab Ǻȓ Trigger A creature critically fails a weapon Strike against the nalfeshnee;
Eﬀect The nalfeshnee attempts to Disarm the weapon used in the triggering Strike at a
–2 circumstance penalty. On a success, the nalfeshnee steals the weapon.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +29 (magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d12+14 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +29 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d8+14 slashing
Divine Innate Spells DC 34; 6th dispel magic (at will), divine wrath (at will); 5th dimension
door, illusory object (at will); 4th dimension door (at will); Constant (6th)
true seeing
Rituals DC 34; Abyssal pact
Claim Wealth Ȱɵ (conjuration, divine, extradimensional) The
nalfeshnee steals all unattended items glowing with its Light
of Avarice into an extradimensional space. The demon can
Interact to regurgitate any number of these items into their
hand or onto the ground. If the demon dies, is aﬀected by a
teleportation eﬀect, or consumes an extradimensional space
(such as a bag of holding), they vomit up all the items.
Light of Avarice ʚʖ (divine, enchantment, light, mental);
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect Beams of unholy light
shoot from the nalfeshnee toward four items within 60
feet. If someone is holding or wearing a targeted item,
they can keep it from being aﬀected with a successful
DC 34 Reﬂex save. For 1 minute, the aﬀected items glow
in nauseating colors. Any non-demon is sickened 2
and slowed 1 as long as it holds, wears, or touches a
glowing item. Recovering from the sickness requires
a successful DC 29 Will save instead of a Fortitude
save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed
condition and makes the creature temporarily
immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours. If the
creature removes or drops the item, both conditions
end immediately but the creature doesn’t become
immune to Light of Avarice.
VROLIKAI (DEATH DEMON)
Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn’t
form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from
a nabasu once the nabasu ﬁnally satisﬁes their hunger
and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais
suffer from no vulnerability associated with
a speciﬁc sin. A vrolikai who survives this
process and the period of vulnerability
that follows gains great power and in time can
claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain.
Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters
often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

HAMATULA TREASURES
Perhaps because hamatulas exist to
guard the riches of archdevils, infernal
dukes, and queens of the night, they
ﬁnd themselves drawn to wealth.
Though they despise summoners who
pull them away from their assigned
duties, hamatulas use their servitude
as an opportunity to collect treasures
and wealth that they can oﬀer to their
lords upon their return. Treasures that
are painful or dangerous to handle are
among their favorite prizes.
Str +7, Dex +6, Con +5, Int +1, Wis +5, Cha +4
AC 31; Fort +23, Ref +20, Will +20; +1 status to all saves vs. magic
HP 165; Immunities ﬁre; Weaknesses good 10; Resistances physical 10 (except silver),
poison 10
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Barb only. A hamatula gains an extra reaction at the start of
each of its turns that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity. It can’t use
more than one Attack of Opportunity triggered by the same action. In addition to the
normal trigger, a hamatula can make an Attack of Opportunity against a creature that
touches it or an adjacent creature that attempts a melee Strike against it.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 30 feet
Melee Ȱɵ barb +24 (evil, magical), Damage 3d8+13 piercing plus 1d6 evil and bloodletting
Ranged Ȱɵ hurled barb +23 (evil, magical, range increment 60 feet), Damage 2d8+13
piercing plus 1d6 evil and bloodletting
Divine Innate Spells DC 27, attack +21; 5th dimension door, glyph of warding (at will); 4th
dimension door (at will); 3rd harm, paralyze (×2); Cantrips (5th) produce ﬂame
Rituals DC 27; infernal pact
Bloodletting On a critical hit, the hamatula’s barbs deal 3d6 persistent bleed damage.
Frightful Strike Ȳ˓ (divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Trigger The hamatula
hits a creature with a barb Strike; Eﬀect The creature struck must succeed at
a DC 27 Will save or become frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical
failure). Regardless of the result of its saving throw, the creature
is then temporarily immune to Frightful Strike for 24 hours.
Impaling Barb ʚʖ The hamatula makes a barb Strike, then
Strides up to half its Speed without triggering reactions. If
the Strike hits, the hamatula impales the target with one of
its barbs and snaps the barb free as it moves away from
the target. This deals an additional 2d8 piercing damage
to the target and pins it to an adjacent surface, rendering
it immobilized (Escape DC 29).
Warden of Erebus A hamatula’s glyph of warding innate
spell can contain any common spell from the Core
Rulebook that meets the criteria in glyph of warding;
the hamatula doesn’t need to provide the spell.
GYLOU (HANDMAIDEN DEVIL)
Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive
and complex machinations of Hell, they are highly
skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful
deception, physical ﬁnesse, and nearly any other
tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has
led to gylous becoming widespread throughout
all layers of Hell, enabling them to ﬁlter key
information to their masters regarding other
devils’ plots and schemes. Their allegiance
is no secret, but their skills are so great
that powerful devils employ one or more
gylous regardless. While most gylous have
a feminine form (combined with their role,
this is the source of their common moniker
of “handmaiden”), some have other gender
presentations, and nearly all gylous take on
carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles
they ﬁll. More often than not, gylous arise when
lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility
and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though
on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals
who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.

deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Indispensable Savvy Ǻȓ Frequency once per day; Trigger The gylou
attempts a skill check but hasn’t rolled yet; Eﬀect The gylou demonstrates
a preternatural ability for the task at hand. They use their Deception modiﬁer for the
triggering check and for all skill checks using the same skill thereafter until the next
time the gylou uses this ability or until 24 hours have passed, whichever happens ﬁrst.
Tentacle Encage Ȱɵ (attack) Requirements The gylou has a Medium or smaller creature
grabbed; Eﬀect The gylou transfers the grabbed creature into their lower body’s
net of encaging tentacles, freeing their limbs and tentacles to make Strikes. This
has the same eﬀects as Swallow Whole (Medium, 2d12+12 bludgeoning,
Rupture 30), except the encaged creature is not at risk of suﬀocation,
and the gylou can bring the encaged creature with them when
they cast dimension door. A gylou can have only one creature
encaged at a time.
CORNUGON (HORNED DEVIL)
Hell’s armies contain legions upon legions of
different devils all suited precisely to their roles.
But such an army needs able commanders,
and it is this role that cornugons ﬁll. Their
mere presence inspires those under their
command to improved performance—
often through fear of the horrible
torments that a cornugon can unleash as
punishment for failure. Forged in the ﬁres
of Malebolge from the most renowned
warriors among lesser devilkind, even
the least cornugon is among the ﬁercest
warriors of the multiverse. The greatest
among them on occasion ascend further
still, becoming those rare and feared
legends of Hell called malebranche.

AQUATIC CAVALRY
Protecting the harbor of Absalom
and the shores of Starstone Isle,
the elite Wave Riders use combat-
trained hippocampi as mounts. The
Wave Riders harass enemy ships,
defend against aquatic foes, and
intercept smugglers.
Hippocampus
The strange beasts known as hippocampi resemble terrestrial horses from head
to midbody, but on their legs, they have splayed ﬁns instead of hooves, and in
place of horses’ hindquarters, they have powerful tails resembling those of ﬁsh.
Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and
brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi
tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that
provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to
provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike,
as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be
that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though
hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most
handlers outﬁt them with the lightest options available. More often they are
trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi
do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while
ﬂopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them
differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species,
such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best
presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.
HIPPOCAMPUS
Hippocampi serve as steeds for aquatic humanoids or roam wild in the sea.

HIPPO SWEAT
A hippopotamus’s sweat is an
unusual reddish color that can lend
them an even more frightening
appearance that evokes the visage of
a blood-coated monster. This sweat
helps to protect the hippopotamus
from becoming overheated, but it
also bolsters their resistance to all
manner of diseases.
Hippopotamus
Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are semiaquatic animals that spend most of
their time in rivers and lakes, but they also can thrive on land.
HIPPOPOTAMUS
Typical adult hippos move quickly on land and attack stealthily in the water.
Though herbivorous, hippos are notoriously aggressive and territorial.

HODAG TALES
Those who’ve encountered hodags
tend to create larger-than-life
reports of the sighting. In the
dense Verduran Forest, lumberjacks
working for the Lumber Consortium
regale each other with competing
stories about Big Marna, a legendary
hodag who the loggers claim has
killed two dozen people. Inhabitants
of Echo Wood in the River Kingdoms
spin lore about Black Shiv, a hodag
spotted haunting the outskirts of
small settlements, and in recent
months, hunters and miners in the
southwestern reaches of Ravounel
speak of a frightening undead hodag
called Ghouliegut.
Hodag
Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers’ or miners’
tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote
areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous
beasts ﬁrsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.
Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators’ long
claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines
that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their
wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark.
The hodags’ rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to
blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red
eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage
by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily
moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.
In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a
foul‑smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between
their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and
weighs upward of 700 pounds.

moves at least 20 feet
and succeeds at its
Strike, the hodag
deals damage normally
and then attempts an
Athletics check against
the creature’s Fortitude DC to
toss the enemy into the air. On
a success, the tossed creature is thrown
10 feet in a straight line in the direction of the hodag’s
choice and then lands prone. If the creature is knocked
into a solid object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as
well before landing prone. The hodag can instead toss
a creature straight up in the air. The creature lands in
the same square where it started, takes
1d6 bludgeoning damage, and
lands  prone.

TINDALOS
Ancient texts refer to these
relentless temporal hunters as the
hounds of Tindalos, yet they never
seem to explore what Tindalos
actually is. In some references, the
implication is that Tindalos is one of
the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods,
but if this is the case, it is among the
most obscure of these entities. Other
tomes refer as Tindalos as a location,
perhaps even a city or nation that
once existed before time began and
that can be reached only by methods
impossible for any creature bound
by the laws of time. In all likelihood,
both and neither are right—what
Tindalos is may simply be impossible
for mortal minds to comprehend.
Hound of Tindalos
Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the
ﬂow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send
their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can
draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the
hounds’ ire, so few who trafﬁc in such rituals live long enough to spread their
knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely
interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have
attracted their unblinking attention.
Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The
pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and
devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of
Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.

Otherworldly Mind (mental) Whenever a creature targets the hound with a mental eﬀect,
that creature takes 4d6 mental damage (DC 25 basic Will save). On a critical failure, it
also becomes confused for 1d4 rounds.
Ripping Gaze (aura, evocation, occult, visual) 30 feet. The hound of Tindalos’s eyes glow
balefully, causing painful but bloodless wounds to rip open in the body of a creature that
meets its awful gaze. When a creature ends its turn in the aura’s emanation, it
takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 25 basic Fortitude save). A creature that
critically succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Vulnerable to Curved Space When a hound of Tindalos is not
adjacent to a structural angle of 90º (or more acute), its
resistance to physical damage is suppressed and it
becomes sickened 1. It can’t recover from this sickened
condition, but the condition ends automatically once
the hound is again adjacent to a suitable angle.

Angled Entry Ȱɵ The hound of Tindalos casts
a 4th-level dimension door spell, but it must
transport itself into a space adjacent to an
angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or
environment around it. For example, it could teleport
to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle
between the wall and ﬂoor) or a corner in a room, or
adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of
the ground, but not to a ﬂat plain or a room
with only curved corners and edges.
Once per day, the hound can use
this ability to plane shift to or from
the Dimension of Time, with the
same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.

SENSATION SEEKERS
Intellect devourers steal bodies to
experience the physical sensations
denied their nearly invulnerable
natural forms. Each new body
brings the opportunity to explore
new vistas of taste, touch, and pain.
Intellect devourers occupying a
body fear little but discovery, and
even that simply puts a temporary
end to their games. Harm to the
host is just another sensation to
experience, and replacement bodies
are easy to ﬁnd.
Intellect Devourer
Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and inﬁltrators for the powerful
force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the
Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When
an intellect devourer inﬁltrates a society, its ﬁrst priority is to acquire a body. It
might ﬁrst seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than ﬁghting
and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host’s brain
cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of
its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to
make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.

Body Thief ̂ˬ (manipulate, necromancy, occult, possession) The intellect devourer
reduces in size and burrows into the brain of a creature dead for no longer than 1 day.
At the start of the intellect devourer’s next turn, the body revives at its maximum Hit
Points, controlled by the devourer. The intellect devourer is conscious and can sense
everything the possessed body could. Any eﬀect that ends the possession kills the host
body with the same eﬀects as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can’t use any of the host
creature’s spells with Body Thief but can use its own spells. The host body slowly decays
while inhabited by the intellect devourer, becoming uninhabitable after
7 days unless preserved with gentle repose or a similar eﬀect.
Exit Body Ȱɵ (move) Requirements The intellect devourer is
controlling a body with Body Thief; Eﬀect The intellect
devourer leaves its host body, which dies instantly
and is no longer a suitable host for any Body
Thief ability. The intellect devourer appears
at full size in an adjacent space.
Ravage ̂ˬ The intellect devourer makes
two talon Strikes against a paralyzed,
restrained, or unconscious creature,
using the same attack modiﬁer as its
highest attack modiﬁer. These Strikes
gain the death trait. If Ravage kills the
target, the intellect devourer may use Body
Thief against it as a free action.
Stolen Identity While an intellect devourer
uses Body Thief, it gains the ability to
understand and speak all languages
known by the host, as well as knowledge
of the host body’s abilities, identity, role
in society, and personality. However,
it does not gain the
speciﬁc memories
or knowledge of
the host body.
