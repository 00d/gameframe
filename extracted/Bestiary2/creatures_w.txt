WOOD GIANT CELEBRATIONS
Despite the seriousness with which
wood giants approach their duties,
or perhaps because of it, wood giant
gatherings are joyous occasions.
Wood giants most often gather to
sing, dance, seek life partners, and
celebrate their hard work.
Giant
Giants prosper in many environments, and although they are quite diverse, they
all tend to have equally larger-than-life personalities.
WOOD GIANT
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval
forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of
nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out.
Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild
places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part
of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense
humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most
giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense
forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely
with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness
regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory,
foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands.
While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey
creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most
fey as far too ﬂighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200
pounds.

Piercing Shot Ȱɵ The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it
glances oﬀ the ﬁrst target to strike another target behind the ﬁrst
one. The wood giant chooses two targets in a direct line, one of which
must be giving lesser cover to the other, then makes a single ranged
Strike with its longbow against both targets. This attack ignores
the lesser cover the ﬁrst target provides to the second. The wood
giant rolls damage only once, and applies it to each creature it hits.
Piercing Shot counts as two attacks for the wood giant’s multiple
attack penalty.

GAFFS
Many marsh giants ﬁght with
oversized gaﬀs—lengths of wood
with a single metal spike aﬃxed
to the tip. Used often by ﬁsherfolk
to land ﬁsh, marsh giants use their
gaﬀs as weapons. A gaﬀ sized for
a Medium creature is a common
martial weapon in the club group.
It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage
and has 1 Bulk. It requires one
hand to use and has the trip and
versatile P weapon traits. Gaﬀs are
readily available in ﬁshing or coastal
settlements for 1 gp.
MARSH GIANT
Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps, marsh giants
are hideous in appearance indeed, with ﬁshlike mouths, slimy gray-green skin, and
dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the ﬂesh of those they slay in battle, but many
are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in
check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the
risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.
Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to
zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no
central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the
demon lord Dagon, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from
the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.
Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location,
but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep
draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who
look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and
screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for
any other residents of the area.
Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small
for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with
their zealotry.

================================================================================
# WOOD GOLEM
================================================================================

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, cold, evocation) The ice golem exhales a blast of freezing
mist that deals 6d6 cold damage in a 30-foot cone (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t
use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Creeping Cold (arcane, cold, evocation) When the ice golem gets a critical hit with a ﬁst
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 persistent cold damage and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
WOOD GOLEM
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
together from scraps of ﬁrewood and discarded burls. It’s less common for
wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to
be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their
owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems
to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve
dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don’t
bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically
see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids
often feel when facing a carrion or ﬂesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such
creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic
match between the wood golem’s appearance and such locations.

GLASS GOLEM COMPONENTS
The destruction of a glass golem
often leaves nothing behind but a
pile of tiny shards of crystal and lead.
However, if larger pieces survive, the
crystal can be sold to glass merchants
or skilled crafters who can turn them
into glittering works of art.
Ranged Ȱɵ splinter +16 (magical, range increment 30 feet), Damage 2d4+8 piercing
Splinter Volley ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The wood golem makes up to four splinter
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the wood golem’s
multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the
wood golem makes all of its attacks.
GLASS GOLEM
Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems
are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often
protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power
of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of
their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems.
Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds
that bleed profusely.
Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a
work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature
regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem’s colorful
glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.

# WATER YAI
================================================================================


ONI DAIMYO
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with
isolated mortal domains. The most
powerful is Inma, the Empress of the
World, but Akuma the Horned King,
Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka
the Red King are also worshipped.
WATER YAI
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants.
Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to
lurk alone in the world’s oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote freshwater lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they
prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition
of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in
richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous
faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie
magical properties, and in combat, they can also ﬁre bolts of electricity from their
third eye.

AMOEBAS LARGE AND SMALL
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms
are usually found near each other,
as the two oozes are part of the
same life cycle. When a giant
amoeba grows large enough, it can
spontaneously split apart into two
separate amoeba swarms, and when
an amoeba swarm feeds enough,
its individual components can fuse
together into a single creature.
Ooze
Due to their bizarre physical structures and ability to break down and feed on a
wide variety of materials, oozes are able to adapt to nearly any climate, especially
when assisted by magical or alchemical tinkering. As a result, explorers frequently
encounter new and terrifying varieties of these amorphous creatures.
AMOEBA SWARM
An amoeba swarm consists of thousands of individual single-celled organisms
held together by acrid-smelling slime. As ravenous as they are mindless, amoeba
swarms use no tactics.

================================================================================
# WATER ORM
================================================================================


LOCAL ORMS
People who live by the lakes
inhabited by legendary water
orms have a tendency to give local
lake monsters names that sound
somewhat homey or even adorable.
As a result, such creatures are often
regarded as local mascots or goodluck charms—particularly in lakeside
settlements that depend on ﬁshing
as a signiﬁcant income source.
Water Orm
Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always ﬁnd their way
into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of
respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of ﬁshers claiming to have
spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and
gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and
linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability
to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid
contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling
curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm
sightings usually occur when they can’t help but to rise up to the surface to take
a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or ﬂoating
on the water’s surface.
These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even
centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes
without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water
without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty
lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to
their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes
missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the
local water orm is responsible, leading to
folk tales that caution residents against
venturing out alone near the water.
While
most
water
orms
are
described as serpentine or long-necked
reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely
elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea
horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.

Slow Metabolism A water orm can go for 10 years without
feeding. Beyond this limit, the water orm’s hunger causes it to
become slowed 1, but doesn’t otherwise impact its lifespan. A
water orm that’s slowed as a result of starvation can remove
this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.
Undetectable (abjuration, primal) A water orm automatically tries to
counteract any detection, revelation, or scrying divination attempted against it,
using its Stealth modiﬁer for the counteract check.

Water Travel ̂ˬ (primal, transmutation, water) A water orm can dissolve into water,
appearing only as a long, dark, serpentine stretch of water. While in this form, a water
orm’s swim Speed increases to 600 feet, it automatically succeeds at Athletics checks
to swim, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks in water. A water
orm can remain in this form for 8 hours, but it can’t enter salt water when using this
ability. A water orm can return to its normal form using a single action which has the
concentrate trait.

CREATING WERECREATURES
Werecreatures are complex monsters
capable of shifting between three
diﬀerent forms and of inﬂicting their
condition upon other humanoids. Full
rules for building werecreatures, along
with how to apply the werecreature’s
curse, appear on pages 328–329 of
the Pathﬁnder Bestiary.
Werecreature
Werecreatures transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under
the light of the full moon. The doomed fate of these shapechanging creatures
derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through
their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reﬂect werecreatures in their
hybrid forms.
WERECREATURE ABILITIES
The following abilities are shared among all werecreatures. A werecreature also
gains several other abilities, as explained in the Bestiary, but additional rules for
those abilities aren’t necessary unless you create your own werecreature.
Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of
the same general kind.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature
changes into their humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a speciﬁc,
persistent appearance. A true werecreature’s natural form is their hybrid shape. In
humanoid shape, the werecreature uses their original humanoid size, loses their jaws
and claw Strikes, and gains a melee ﬁst Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to
the slashing damage dealt by their claw. In animal shape, their Speed and size change
to that of the animal, they gain any special Strike eﬀects of the animal that they didn’t
already have (such as Grab), and they lose their weapon Strikes.
Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This
curse aﬀects only humanoids; Saving Throw Fortitude DC
is the standard DC for the werecreature’s new level – 1. On
each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another
Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature
until dawn. The creature is under the GM’s
control and goes on a rampage for half the
night before falling unconscious until dawn.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation)
When a full moon appears in the
night sky, the werecreature must
enter hybrid form, can’t Change
Shape thereafter, becomes one
size larger, increases their reach
by 5 feet, and increases the
damage of their jaws Strike by 2.
When the moon sets or the sun rises,
the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued
for 2d4 hours.
WEREBOAR
Wereboars tend to be aggressive and stubborn, and often
live with their own kind in small, remote
communities. Even when they’re inclined
to interact with others, wereboars’ short
tempers and hostile nature lead other creatures
to avoid them. Lone wereboars who settle down—often on
remote farms—are extremely territorial, though others are
content to roam and explore lands far from home. Their other
habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down
to diet: some wereboars might feast on human ﬂesh, while others are
mostly vegetarian.

LYCANTHROPY
Many scholars refer to the curse of
the werecreature as “lycanthropy,”
but technically this is correct only
when speaking of werewolves.
Nevertheless, the word has gained
traction in certain circles, and as a
result it’s not uncommon to hear
the whispers of locals who fear
lycanthropes even when a ravenous
weretiger is the real threat. Naturally,
the werecreatures themselves don’t
take this ignorance lightly, and tend
to see being equated with a werewolf
as a great insult. Unless, of course, the
werecreature is a werewolf!

environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated
cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders)
often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming

CAIRN WIGHT DIRGES
Unlike a typical wight, cairn wights
have an unusual aﬃnity for music.
The lyrics of their dirges often
contain a valuable bit of knowledge
or long-lost lore, possibly the
greatest treasure a cairn wight
guards. There are even brave souls
who seek out the creatures to listen
to their songs in hopes of ﬁnding
proﬁt from the dry, rasping words.
Wight, Cairn
Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn
from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought
of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered
by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently,
particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to
transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time.
Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to
spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the
intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant
wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.
As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to
the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread
their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn
wight’s sword channels life from the victim into the wight.

================================================================================
# WITCHFIRE
================================================================================


WISPS AND FIRE
Witchﬁres have the ability to summon
will-o’-wisps, but a number of these
aberrations usually linger nearby of
their own accord. The fear-inducing
witchﬂame aura manifested by
witchﬁres provides will-o’-wisps their
favored sustenance.
Witchfire
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green ﬂames, this incorporeal
undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the
center of the ﬂames usually resembles the witch’s idealized self-image, regardless
of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchﬁre often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays
around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o’-wisps, which seem to
have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchﬁre. A witchﬁre might visit
villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always
attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams.
A witchﬁre might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens,
but a witchﬁre is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.

ALIEN ALLIES
High-ranking or wealthy witchwyrds
rarely travel the planes alone,
employing bodyguards to accompany
them and leading entourages
composed of various strange beings
they’ve met during their travels.
Witchwyrd
Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked. Their
inscrutability is a boon to one of their most signiﬁcant interests—mercantilism—
and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by
their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new
opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone
is trying to pull one over on them.
These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically
6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and
spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the
local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-ﬁtting clothes in bright reds or
yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions
of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This,
however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about
details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on
Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the
notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked,
many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these
queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars
have theorized a connection between
witchwyrds and several other four-armed
creatures, but like with questions of their
place of origin, witchwyrds have little to
say about the topic.

TERRITORIAL BEASTS
Wolverines are territorial animals
and ﬁercely defend their kills,
even from larger predators or
when they’re outnumbered. They
claim wide swaths of forests or
frozen tundra as their territory,
marking it with a pungent odor that
serves as a warning to those who
recognize the smell. Wolverines
have voracious appetites and tend to
aggressively devour their food with
reckless abandon.
Wolverine
Few creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.
WOLVERINE
Wolverines resemble small bears, to which they are related. Stocky and muscular
with long claws, wolverines are about 3 feet in length and weigh approximately 40
pounds. They have a thick fur coat that protects them from the cold temperatures
of the forests and frozen tundras where they reside.

Wolverine Rage Ȱɵ (concentrate, emotion, mental) The wolverine enters a state of pure
rage that lasts either for 1 minute, until there are no enemies it can perceive, or until
it falls unconscious, whichever comes ﬁrst. While raging, the wolverine has AC 17,
its jaws Strike deals 1d8+7 damage, and its claw Strike deals 1d6+7 damage. While
raging, the wolverine can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait, except for Seek.
After it’s stopped raging, a wolverine can’t use Wolverine Rage again for 1 minute.
GIANT WOLVERINE
Giant wolverines grow to the approximate size of

# WORM THAT WALKS CULTIST
================================================================================


WORMS REDEEMED
In rare situations, once a spellcaster
rises as a worm that walks it might
recant its evil ways, given the right
inﬂuence and enough time. Many
of these worms that walk seek selfdestruction, not out of abhorrence at
their new form but at the realization
of the evils they wrought while alive.
Others, though, take advantage of
their second chance and use their
new life to help undo the ruin and
horror they might have aﬄicted upon
the world in their prior existence.
eﬀect performed on the area reduces the DC of this ﬂat check by 2, to a minimum of
DC 5. If any of these ﬂat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm
that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping
or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to ﬁnish oﬀ the worm
that walks.
Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with
reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as
the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should
deal three-quarters of that damage.
Squirming Embrace Ȱɵ The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a
space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an
additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a
basic Reﬂex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2.
Swarm Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm
of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While
discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions
and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small
enough for its individual worms to ﬁt without having
to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back
into its normal form.
WORM THAT WALKS
This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One
Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and
strives to further its evil plots in its new life.

DREAD WRAITH ORIGINS
The most unusual dread wraiths
are those that coalesce from an
amalgamation of evil spirits, often
in regions where such spirits are
shredded from their consciousnesses
and churned in foci of negative
energy, such as the Negative Energy
Plane or on the Isle of Terror.
Wraith, Dread
These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals
are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths
haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel
greater distances to sow terror or amass inﬂuence, often sticking to dark glades or
sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to
be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead
to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer
might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly
malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw
several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.
