NABASU GROWTH
A nabasu stores their stolen deaths
until they ﬁnally become satiated.
For most, this occurs after consuming
death from at least 100 mortals, but
the exact timing is left to the GM. The
demon then travels to the Abyss and
transforms into a vrolikai.

Starvation Vulnerability A nabasu denied food suﬀers painful backlash as their demonic
nature feeds on their own corrupted spirituality. If a nabasu’s Consume Death is disrupted
(such as by a ﬁghter using Disruptive Stance) or a creature resists the eﬀect with a

Consume Death Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, necromancy,

gaze upon a single target they can see within
30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a
Fortitude save against death-stealing gaze.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and
the nabasu suﬀers starvation vulnerability.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is aﬀected by deathstealing gaze and becomes drained 1. If
the creature was already drained 1 by the
death-stealing gaze before attempting
the save, a failed save increases the
value of the drained condition by 1, to a
maximum of drained 4. The nabasu gains
10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained
creature is temporarily immune until the
start of the nabasu’s next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature
increases the amount of drain by 2.
Stolen Death A creature that dies while suﬀering
drain from a nabasu’s death-stealing gaze rises as
a ghoul (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 168) the next midnight.
HEZROU (TOAD DEMON)
Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps,
mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land
and in the water. A hezrou’s presence has an obvious effect
on nearby ﬂora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot
and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much
easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long
exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations
and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities
of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where

HALF-DEMONS
The Abyss can corrupt living
creatures through direct congress
or supernatural infusion of Abyssal
energies, resulting in monstrous
hybrids. A half-demon should be a
custom creature, but you can quickly
generate one by giving an existing
creature a few of a demon’s abilities
along with the demon’s sin-related
vulnerability. For example, a half-
hezrou hill giant would gain purity
vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite,
swim Speed, and poisonous pustules.
When swapping over abilities between
creatures of diﬀerent levels, be sure to
adjust the numbers for the new level.
a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often
waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber,
squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to
fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own.
Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or
neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious
spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

Purity Vulnerability A hezrou revels in the foulness it exudes and becomes distraught
when contaminations are puriﬁed. The ﬁrst time in a round when a contamination
is puriﬁed (such as via purify food and drink) or a toxin is neutralized (such as via
neutralize poison) within 30 feet of a hezrou, the demon takes 6d6 mental damage.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the
aura must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1
for as long as itʼs sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, aﬀected
creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to

NALFESHNEE (BOAR DEMON)
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed
demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike
and form from the souls of avaricious mortals.
Few demons understand the inner workings
of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it’s not
unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor
of the Abyss itself ﬁrst rather than bow before
a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the
ﬂeshy realms that birth new demons, while others
guard sites of particular signiﬁcance deep in the
plane’s secret reaches. A nalfeshnee’s realm in the
Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the
largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a
singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos
of the Abyss.

VROLIKAI NEWCOMERS
When vrolikais ﬁrst manifest on the
Abyss, they have no base of power and
are, despite their abilities, relatively
defenseless from denizens even more
powerful than themselves. As a result,
most rely upon stealth and patience
for their ﬁrst few centuries while
they build up a network of minions
and establish their own Abyssal
fortiﬁcations before they turn their
attentions back to the Material Plane.

Consume Death Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, necromancy, visual) As

Focused Flames ʚʖ The vrolikai attacks a single target with
all of its black ﬂame knives. The demon makes a black
ﬂame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the
vrolikai deals the damage from a black ﬂame
knife Strike to the target, plus an additional
2d6 negative damage for every black ﬂame
knife they wield beyond the ﬁrst (typically
6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack,
the vrolikai deals the damage from one black
ﬂame knife to the target, though they still
miss completely on a critical failure. On a
critical hit, the victim becomes drained 2 as
the focused attack drains pure life essence
as well as damage. This counts toward the
vrolikai’s multiple attack penalty as a number
of attacks equal to the number of black ﬂame
knives the demon wields.
Mindwarping (emotion, enchantment, mental)
The sting of a vrolikai is mind-warping. A creature struck
must attempt a DC 44 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute.
Failure The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1. Further failed
saves against mindwarping increase the condition value
by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature also
becomes confused for 1 minute.
Stolen Death As nabasu.

GRENDEL’S MOTHER
At the bottom of a remote mountain
lake ﬁlled with sea serpents is a
magical house—the lair of Grendel’s
mother. Among her many treasures is
a sword so big and heavy that only a
supernaturally strong individual can
wield it. When Grendel is injured, he
retreats here to heal.
Grendel
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there
is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility
is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking
settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting
celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.
Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won’t save the world from his
ravages for long. Once Grendel’s mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent
son’s death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the
sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts
heroes powerful enough to defeat him.

DENEBRUM
Most neothelids on Golarion reside in
the Vault of Derebrum, deep within
the Darklands. Here, in a vast cavern
of fetid pools of stinking swamps
and surreal forests of poisonous
fungi, neothelid hives nestle among
twisted spires of hardened resin that
look as horriﬁc as the monstrous
worms themselves. Tended by armies
of worm-like minions who worship
them as gods, they endlessly plot,
scheme, and wage war.
Neothelid
This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular bands of
teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and a vast alien
intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange dimensions
beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos.
Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn
and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time
when all other life is nothing more than food.

NEREID SHAWLS
A nereid’s shawl has Hardness 1
and 4 Hit Points (BT 2). If the shawl
is broken, it no longer grants the
amphibious trait. If it’s destroyed, it
melts away into water, and the nereid
who created it becomes doomed 1
and drained 1. These conditions
values increase by 1 every 2d6 hours
thereafter until it creates a new shawl.
Nereid
Nereids are aquatic fey with deep ties to water. They share some similarities with
naiads, but they are not guardians and do not bind themselves to a speciﬁc body
of water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability to
imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land as
well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life
essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid.
Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat,
but when forced to ﬁght, their ability to transform the natural waters in their ﬂesh
into poison serves them as well as any weapon.
Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of
“aquatic tempters,” regardless of the fey’s type or gender, using these creatures’
names interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful ﬁgure who exists to
lure mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and
often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can
cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas
are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids
loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the
beauty of the natural world in peace.
When a nereid learns of a rusalka’s increased activity, it often seeks
out the rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect
humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to
prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from
humanoids who can’t be bothered to note the difference between a
murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.

Manifest Shawl ̂ˬ (conjuration, primal) The nereid divests themself of part of their
connection to the First World and imbues this essence into a ﬂowing shawl that enables
them to function on land. The nereid can Dismiss this eﬀect as long as they are touching
the shawl. As long as the shawl exists, the nereid gains the amphibious trait. A non-
nereid who carries the shawl also gains the amphibious trait. If a
nereid’s shawl is destroyed rather than Dismissed, the nereid can’t
Manifest a Shawl for 24 hours.

BOG NIXIES
Nixies who dwell in swampy regions
tend to have fouler attitudes and
are more eager to turn to violence.
Known as bog nixies, these evil fey
prefer dwelling in festering swamps
or blighted fens and delight in using
their ability to grant desires to tempt
visitors into acts of unplanned evil.
Nixie
These aquatic fey often guard ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs, protecting their
bucolic homes from the advances of predators and careless humanoids alike.
Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids,
hoping trespassers won’t give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted
by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive
fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon.
On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better,
a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing
openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid.
Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them
ﬁrst; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing
story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more
signiﬁcant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the
source of pollution near their home.
Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer
solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conﬂicts before they can escalate
to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm
individuals and, when they can establish magical inﬂuence, encourage intruders to
leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them
from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers.
Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or
help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is
underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe
water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are
given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most
trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.
Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes,
catﬁsh-like whiskers, and webbed ﬁngers and toes. They have scaly skin,
pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small
communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great
enough. In many cultures’ folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden
at the bottom of particularly large lakes.

NORN TRIUMVIRATES
Norns who visit the Material Plane
often do so in groups of three
known as triumvirates. The norns
of a triumvirate can communicate
with each other telepathically over
a planetary distance. Regardless of
their appearance on the First World,
when a norn becomes part of a
triumvirate on the Material Plane,
her apparent age shifts so that in
each group, there always appears to
be one young adult norn, one middle-
aged norn, and one elderly norn—a
Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch.
Norn
Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their
hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread.
They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a
vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.
Norns’ relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among
norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the
ﬁrst norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies:
a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads
of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in
her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic
commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are
powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power,
and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns ﬁnd the other Eldest
even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the
Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave
to meddle with fate as much as they desire.
While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unafﬁliated norn with
ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are
spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They
know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious
demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns’ interference. And so the balance of
power remains tenuous between unafﬁliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for
eons. However, norns know that it’s merely a matter of time before the Eldest
lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite
norns’ best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
WORSHIPPING NORNS
On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others,
especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who
uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to
discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support
such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a speciﬁc norn or norn
triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same beneﬁts regardless
of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears
cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the
aging process.
FOLLOWERS OF FATE (LN)
Edicts make predictions of the future, oﬀer advice and guidance to those in positions of
power, provide comfort to the elderly
Anathema apologize for making an incorrect prediction, disrespect mothers, accept
payment for fortune-telling

LOST NORNS
When separated from a triumvirate
for too long, a norn on the Material
Plane can grow confused and weak.
Her powers remain strong, but her
ability to interpret fate becomes
skewed and warped. Lost norns
begin to use their abilities for their
own goals rather than serving fate.
A lost norn’s alignment slowly
shifts from lawful neutral to
either lawful evil or lawful good,
depending on how she interprets
her visions.

Sense Fate (fortune) A norn automatically rolls a 20 when she rolls initiative.
Triumvirate This functions as the coven ability (page 304), except only norns can join
a triumvirate, and it functions only as long as exactly three norns are part of the
triumvirate. A triumvirate grants the following spells: alter reality (once per day),
cataclysm, discern location, foresight, and revival.

Fated When a creature is subject to a fortune eﬀect from a norn and a
misfortune eﬀect from any source other than a norn (or vice versa), the
norn’s eﬀect automatically counteracts the other eﬀect and then takes
place normally, rather than the two eﬀects canceling
each other out. If both the fortune and misfortune
eﬀect are from a norn, then the two cancel each
other out as normal. At the GM’s discretion,
powerful entities related to fate or luck, like
Desna, Magdh, or Pharasma, count as a norn for
the purpose of this ability.
Sever Fate (necromancy, occult) When a norn deals
negative damage with a Strike, she regains 10 Hit
Points. The target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude
save or become drained 1 (drained 2 on a critical failure).
Further negative damage dealt by the norn increases
the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save (or by 2
on a critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.
Shift Fate Ǻȓ (divination, occult) Trigger A creature within 120
feet attempts a saving throw; Eﬀect The creature rolls the
saving throw twice, and then the norn decides which
result applies. If the norn chooses the lower roll, this is
a misfortune eﬀect; if she chooses the higher roll, it’s
a fortune eﬀect; if they’re the same, she decides
which trait to apply.
Snip Thread ʚʖ (death, manipulate, necromancy,
occult) Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The
norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate
of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips
it short with her shears. The target takes 100
negative damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). If
the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this
damage, the thread is completely severed and the
creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip
Thread can’t be restored to life except by miracle, wish,
or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome
of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours. The norn can’t use Snip Thread again for 1d4 rounds.

UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS
Nuckelavees are equally delighted to
murder and feed upon both hapless
peasants and altruistic naturalists
engaged in the process of cleaning
up pollution. Indeed, those who
would seek to purify such sites
are often regarded as the greater
threat by a nuckelavee, as without a
befouled land to dwell in, the foul fey
would wither away.
Nuckelavee
When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee to
it from the First World. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold: a horselike
monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly from its
back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen
hybrid form, as though it survived its own ﬂaying.
When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction
across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the
cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those
who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn’t
discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

OCTOPUS SPECIES
The octopuses presented here
are smaller versions of the much
larger giant octopus, but other
species exist as well. The brightly
colored seaﬁre octopus occupies
a predatory niche somewhere
between the reef octopus and giant
octopus—its bite injects a venom
that causes a painful rash and
nausea. The immense grisly octopus
is among the largest of its kind. It
can swallow humans whole and can
squirt particularly sticky crimson
ink to incapacitate prey.

count toward the octopus’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all of its attacks.
