# DRACOLISK
================================================================================


DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

Draconic Resistance A dracolisk has resistance 10 to the type of damage it produces
with its breath weapon (see below).
Petrifying Glance Ǻȓ (arcane, aura, transmutation, visual) Trigger A creature within 30
feet that the dracolisk can see starts its turn; Eﬀect The target must attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save. If it fails, it becomes slowed 1 for 1 minute as its body stiﬀens.
Speed 20 feet, ﬂy 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +21, Damage 2d12+8 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +21 (agile), Damage 2d10+8 slashing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The dracolisk breathes a gout of energy based
on its draconic heritage, as noted below. This breath weapon deals 6d10 damage
of the appropriate type, with a DC 28
basic save of a type indicated in
parenthesis below. The dracolisk
can’t use Breath Weapon again for
1d4 rounds.
Black (acid) 60-foot line of acid (Reﬂex)
Blue (electricity) 60-foot line of electricity (Reﬂex)
Green (poison) 30-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)
Red (ﬁre) 30-foot cone of ﬁre (Reﬂex)
White (cold) 30-foot cone of cold (Reﬂex)
Petrifying
Gaze
ʚʖ
(arcane,
concentrate,
incapacitation,
transmutation, visual) The dracolisk stares at a creature it can
see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt
a DC 28 Fortitude save. If it fails and has
not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed
1. If the creature already was slowed
by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a
failed save causes the creature to be
petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this
manner can be instantly restored
to ﬂesh by being coated (not just
splashed) with fresh dracolisk or
basilisk blood no more than 1 hour
old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood
to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner.
Savage Jaws ʚʖ The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its
jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S ) .
This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.

VENGEFUL BEASTS
Polar bears have been known to take
special interest in those who have
vexed or wounded them, sometimes
following individual hunters back
to their villages and stalking them
exclusively for several days. This
could happen because the hunter
killed the bear’s mate or one of its
cubs, or took prey that the polar
bear had been stalking. Polar bears
engaged in such behavior have even
ignored easier prey to focus intently
on the chosen target.
Bear
Determined foragers and persistent predators, bears spend much of each year
either preparing for hibernation, recovering from hibernation, or taking care of
young following a successful opportunity to mate.
BLACK BEAR
Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration,
depending on which hue is most beneﬁcial for surviving in their local environment.
Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance
from berries and nuts just as often as from ﬁsh and smaller mammals. They
steal food when they ﬁnd it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are
predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves
or their young, black bears often avoid conﬂict or ﬁght only until they can retreat.

# DERGHODAEMON
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
DAEMON HARBINGERS
The four Horsemen are the most
powerful of the daemonic demigods,
but they are only four of many. Far
more daemonic harbingers dwell on
Abaddon, each a unique and powerful
demigod in their own right that
enjoys sweeping inﬂuence among
daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector
(ruler of the slave city of Awaiting
Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian
(consort to the Horseman of Famine),
and Zelishkar the Bitter Flame
(patron to arsonists and agent of the
Horseman of War) are but three of
the dozens of harbingers who rule
realms in Abaddon.

Divine Innate Spells DC 32; 6th blade barrier, feeblemind (×3); 5th dimension door; 4th
dimension door (at will); 1st detect alignment (good only; at will)
Derghodaemon’s Stare Ȱɵ (divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) A
non-evil target must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or become confused for 1 round, or 1
minute on a critical failure. It is temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
Savage Assault ʚʖ The derghodaemon makes up to ﬁve claw
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count
toward the derghodaemon’s multiple attack penalty, but the
penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
Swarming Infestation ʚʖ The derghodaemon spews a
large swarm, making a swarm spit Strike against up to
two adjacent targets within range. Whether or not the
targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reﬂex
save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually
hit by the swarm spit). Persistent damage caused
by the swarming infestation ends as soon as the
creature takes any amount of damage from
an area eﬀect. The derghodaemon can’t use
this ability for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The swarm disperses as soon
as it deals its swarm spit Strike damage.
Success The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 1d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Failure The swarm clings to the target
and infests it, dealing 2d6 persistent
piercing damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the hissing sounds
caused by the infestation also cause the target to
become confused for 1 round; this additional eﬀect
has the auditory, emotion, and mental traits.
THANADAEMON (DEATH DAEMON)
Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons
represent death via old age. They are among the
most patient daemons, and prefer to bide
their time to enact far-reaching, decadeslong plans rather than ﬁght (though they
are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman
of Death, they ply the waters of the River
Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are
thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar
(which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the
river’s muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.

================================================================================

================================================================================

STYX PASSAGE FEES
Gliding with eerie ease along the
murky River Styx, thanadaemons
are only too happy to oﬀer mortals
passage aboard their dilapidated
skiﬀs—for a price. Gold is typically
an acceptable payment for a
thanadaemon’s services, though these
ﬁends are well-known for altering the
details of arrangements after the fact,
and may just as likely demand a favor
or some esoteric good, such as a soul
gem, instead of coin.

# DENIZEN OF LENG
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
LENG
Known variously as the Nightmare
Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams,
the frozen Plateau of Leng looms
physically and spiritually above the
Dreamlands. Both a part of that
dimension and a corruption of it, Leng
is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors
and ruled by the horrors’ ancient gods.
Denizen of Leng
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent
humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond
the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
dress themselves in ﬂowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the ﬁerce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even
higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests,
laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare
Realm with cold malice.

No Breath Denizens of Leng don’t need to breathe.
Planar Fast Healing A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng
at all times, and when away from Leng, they have fast healing 5.
They lose this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections
do not function. If killed, their body dissolves into nothingness
in 1d4 rounds, leaving behind their equipment. A slain denizen
reforms in Leng; they can be permanently killed only when
their planar fast healing doesn’t function.

message, read aura; Constant (4th) tongues
Debilitating Bite (curse, occult) A creature that takes damage
from a denizen’s bite must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save
or become clumsy 1. Each time a target fails an additional
save against this ability, the condition value increases by 1
(to a maximum of clumsy 4). This condition value decreases
by 1 every 24 hours.
Leng Ruby (enchantment, occult) Many denizens of Leng carry
strange rubies mined from quarries in Leng. As long as a creature
holds a Leng ruby that it willingly accepted as a gift or payment
from a denizen of Leng, any denizen of Leng can target that
creature with outcast’s curse, phantom pain, or mind reading at
a range of 1 mile, and the bearer uses an outcome one
degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw
against outcast’s curse.

DESTRACHAN LANGUAGE
The Destrachan language can be
learned by other creatures, but
without a destrachan’s unique vocal
organs, non-destrachans can convey
only basic notions and concepts with
it. In most cases, it’s better to speak
Undercommon to a destrachan than
attempt to use its own language.
Destrachan
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its
forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular
head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in
its vicinity. This cruel monster’s true weapon, however, is an ampliﬁed version of
the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates
with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles,
but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans
understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often
be reasoned with.
An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won’t hesitate to
make a meal of carrion it ﬁnds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures
take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking
and subduing them, then devouring them alive.

Painful Harmonics ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, incapacitation, occult)
The destrachan emits a sonic cry in either a 60-foot cone or a

manifesting as waves of incapacitating pain washing

Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.

against a single item within 60 feet that is
made of crystal, metal, stone, or wood. The
target object takes 7d8 sonic damage. If the
item is attended, its bearer can attempt a
DC 26 basic Reﬂex save for the item. The
destrachan can’t use Shattering Harmonics
again for 1d4 rounds.

THE HIERARCHY OF HELL
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little
use for compassion or empathy. As
such, it exists entirely within a strict
hierarchy, and this order extends to
its denizens. While diﬀerent types of
demons correspond to various sins
and daemons are associated with
modes of mortal death, the diﬀerent
types of devils exist solely to fulﬁll
particular roles in the infernal
machine. On occasion, a particular
devil can transcend the role for
which they were literally shaped,
but this often transforms the devil
physically into the type suitable for
their new role.
Devil
Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell’s bureaucracies and hierarchies,
though some have far more specialized functions than others.
ZEBUB (ACCUSER DEVIL)
Zebubs serve as Hell’s messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they’ve seen
with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also
to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms
upon unsuspecting lands to debase ﬂesh and land alike while collecting secrets the
infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate
weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs’ whims. While
arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and conﬁdence of most devils, and
thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions.
Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil
Baalzebul in the frozen, ﬁlthy wastes of Hell’s seventh layer, Cocytus.

# DEVOURER

Bestiary 2
SOUL SWALLOWERS
The fact that devourers consume
souls makes them particularly hated
by the church of Pharasma and
psychopomps alike.
Devourer
When ﬁends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches
of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horriﬁc undead called devourers that
consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are
ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—
manifestations of the devourers’ most recently consumed souls.

Spell Deﬂection (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster who targets a devourer with
a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession,
spirit blast, or spirit song can attempt a counteract check to free a soul the
devourer has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds,
the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the
devourer can’t use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are
otherwise immune to these spells.

Devour Soul ʚʖ (death, divine, necromancy) The devourer touches
a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative damage (DC 31 basic
Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes
trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature
can’t be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a wish spell.
Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul
(see Spell Deﬂection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one
soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature
(see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast
spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature
is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul
charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by
powerful magic such as wish.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living
creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become
drained 1. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition
value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Soul Spells A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend
a number of soul charges equal to the spell’s level (similar to casting a spell
using charges from a staﬀ). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by
expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically
has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.

WIDGET WORKSHOPS
The ﬁrst dig-widget came from the
workshops of a dwarven thieves’
guild called Godak’s Grifters, which
used more advanced magical
clockwork theories as a springboard
for these simpler but no less eﬀective
contraptions. With their dig-widgets,
the Grifters plagued the authorities
of several dwarven settlements
over the years. Their travels spread
dig-widget technology, and numerous
improvements have since led to faster
and more reliable versions. Though
upstanding dwarven mechanics have
observed dig-widgets and recognized
the complexity of the technology,
they’ve steadfastly refused to
adapt something with such an
unscrupulous origin.
Dig-Widget
Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for inﬁltration. Each
dig‑widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices
that function as thieves’ tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews
for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel
themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct,
they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path,
dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They’re rarely left unattended, as a thief
needs to be nearby to follow after—both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget
from engaging in further larceny once it’s achieved its goal.
The source of a dig-widget’s power is as much mechanical as it is magical.
The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement
over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant
winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget’s moving
parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.

creature). This is similar to Grabbing the
creature, but the dig-widget moves with that
creature rather than holding it in place. While

COMPSOGNATHUS FAMILIARS
Appropriate familiar abilities for
a compsognathus familiar include
climber, damage avoidance, fast
movement, kinspeech, manual
dexterity, scent, or speech. A
compsognathus familiar who can
talk tends to do so in a rapid voice,
with plenty of questions as a result
of its eager curiosity. Note that while
dinosaurs aren’t technically all the
same species, you should consider
allowing a compsognathus with
kinspeech the ability to speak to any
dinosaur rather than limiting it to
only fellow compsognathuses.
Dinosaur
Dinosaurs encompass a staggering range of creatures, from tiny but still
dangerous scavengers like the compsognathus to lumbering giants like the
ravenous spinosaurus to ornery herbivores like iguanodons. Often sought out
and partially domesticated to serve as exotic pets for eccentric aristocrats or
dangerous guardians for those eager to protect their holdings with frightening
but tamable creatures, dinosaurs are far from limited to lurking in primeval
“lost worlds.”
COMPSOGNATHUS
The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting
motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that
the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or
snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus
is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive
dinosaurs result not from the creatures’ hunger but from frightened defensive
reactions when the dinosaurs’ inquisitive natures compel them to enter into
situations (such as wagons or bedrolls) that inadvertently put them at odds with

A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and
weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar
for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren’t involved, however, those
encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with
the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as
they are at best partly tame.

PACHYCEPHALOSAURUS
Pachycephalosauruses are normally peaceful herbivorous dinosaurs, but they grow
much more violent during their mating season, when they ﬁght one another to win
over mates and warn away interlopers. They also defend themselves vehemently
when potential predators stray too close to their herd. The pachycephalosaurus’s
skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous blunt, bony
horns. This feature, combined with the dinosaur’s powerful, compact neck, allows
it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inﬂicting great damage.
Some humanoid groups have successfully trained pachycephalosauruses for use
as mounts, but the creatures aren’t particularly well suited to the task.
Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.

DINOSAUR ABILITIES
While the real world fossil records
hold a wealth of inspiration for
the reconstruction of dinosaurs
in an RPG, you can also look to
living creatures for ideas. Giving
a dinosaur a poisonous bite or
an unusual attack routine like
Clobbering Charge ensures that
dinosaurs are as interesting in
combat as they are in appearance.

# DOPRILLU
================================================================================


DOPRILLU MASKS
A doprillu’s stylized mask isn’t a part
of the creature itself, though doprillus
inherently understand the mask’s
purpose and power. When born,
doprillus start out weak and small.
Once one matures and gains suﬃcient
intelligence and manual dexterity, it
carves its personal mask. The ﬁrst
time it dons the mask, the doprillu
rushes out to seek a ﬁght. This mask
is never replaced, and it might be
marred from hundreds of battles.
Doprillu
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate
masks at all times that ﬁll their wearers with magical strength and ﬁghting spirit.
Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On
neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when
a doprillu’s home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As beﬁts the
superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations:
hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.

enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu’s
turns, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the
doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the enfeebled

Dragon, Primal
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the
Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true
dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an
afﬁnity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor
arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons
can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their
home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have
sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example,
or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands.
Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop
shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in inﬁltrating settlements or
inﬂuencing others from the shadows.
PRIMAL DRAGON SPELLCASTERS
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of
that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy
and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You
can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the
same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s
Wisdom or Charisma modiﬁer by 1 or 2 to reﬂect their mastery of magic.
PRIMAL DRAGONS OF GOLARION
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to
Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build
new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources
that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated
by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated
coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as
their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud
dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer
to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal
dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural
beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons,
cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on
Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains.
Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they
can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in
the sinister nation of Nidal.
BRINE DRAGON
Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help
them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either
good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order
on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted
community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards
of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement
seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the
most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon’s personality, their community members might view
their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful
tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or
philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of
greater concern than individuals’ well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion
rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine
dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.

REZLARABREN
A series of underwater caverns
on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound
Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren’s
lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini
who labor as miners. Her relationship
with the Linnorm Kings is complex,
and whether she views them as allies
or enemies depends on her mood.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their
lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside
grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed,
or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel
safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of
offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged
from sunken ships.

# DRAINBERRY BUSH
================================================================================


DRAINBERRY COLLECTIONS
As drainberry bushes sell their berries
to others, they collect coins and small
curios—such as a cameo depicting a fey
noble, a lock of golden hair knotted in
a complex pattern, or a ring inscribed
“To my dearest Memdaria.” Not all of
these baubles have monetary value,
but those that don’t certainly had
emotional value to the original owner.
Occasionally, drainberry bushes
accept intangible trade goods, such as
odes celebrating the bushes’ grandeur.
Drainberry Bush
Drainberry bushes are ﬂoating bushes that originate from the First World, with long,
thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly
siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn
consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a
faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.
Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense
of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their
berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes ﬁnds the plants
telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money
please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an
item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though
a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly
prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of signiﬁcantly lower value.

Melee Ȱɵ vine +17 (reach 20 feet), Damage 2d8+10 bludgeoning plus

Blood Berries The drainberry bush must drain blood from living
creatures for sustenance. This causes clusters of bright red
berries to grow among its branches. Each cluster of berries lasts
for 1 day, and a drainberry bush typically has 1d6+3 clusters when
encountered. When consumed, a cluster
restores 2d8+10 Hit Points. This eﬀect has
the healing, necromancy, and primal traits.
A creature can pluck a cluster of berries
with a successful unarmed Strike or
Thievery check against the bush’s AC.
Consume Berries Ȱɵ (healing, necromancy,
positive, primal) The bush draws nourishment
from one cluster of blood berries, regaining
2d8+10 HP. That berry cluster wrinkles and dies.
Drain Blood Ȱɵ Requirements The drainberry bush
has at least one living creature grabbed with one of its
vines; Eﬀect The bush’s hollow thorns siphon blood
from creatures it has grabbed. Each creature
must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take
2d8+10 damage and become drained 1 (double
damage and drained 2 on a critical failure). For
every creature damaged this way, a cluster of
blood berries (see above) immediately grows
along the bush’s branches.
Storm of Vines ʚʖ The drainberry bush makes up to
four vine Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These
attacks count toward the bush’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until after the bush makes all these attacks.

DRAKES AND DRAGONS
Although drakes and dragons are
related to one another, little love is
lost between them, and even the
most territorial drakes know better
than to remain in a dragon’s territory
longer than they have to. In rare
cases, large rampages of drakes band
together to attack an encroaching
dragon, especially if the dragon is
young and inexperienced.
Drake
Distant cousins to dragons, drakes menace and terrorize settlements.
SHADOW DRAKE
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their
species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales
and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception
to the norm for drakes and dragons.

# DRAUGR

Bestiary 2
DRAUGR SHIPS
When an entire ship’s crew dies
in one calamity, they might rise
simultaneously, bound together in
death. Tirelessly plaguing the seas,
these draugr crews slowly corrupt
their vessels. The cursed ships often
exhibit unsettling phenomena, such
as being able to sail against the wind
or leaving schools of dead ﬁsh in
their wake. Sea shanties tell of draugr
raiders approaching during the night,
wreathed in fog pierced only by the
green glow emanating from their eyes.
Draugr
Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of
the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed,
barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can’t speak, but
expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally
drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living
creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs
often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the
depths with even more dead.
Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative
energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the
sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a
corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it ﬁnally rises. Proximity to intelligent
life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a
shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures
don’t take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.
Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as
mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work
song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures
have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but
providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the
beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the
draugr, reafﬁrming their desire for blood and death.
More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr
captains. They’re 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments
(page 6) that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell
three times per day.

foes, each of whom must be within its melee reach

apply it to each creature hit. A Swipe counts as two
attacks for the draugr’s multiple attack penalty.

D’ziriak
These strange creatures are native to the Plane of Shadows, where their colorful
nature is in opposition to that realm’s overwhelmingly monochromatic palette.
Averaging 7 feet in height, d’ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termitelike abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have ﬁve‑ﬁngered
hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for ﬁne
manipulations and are not effective in combat.
D’ziriaks’ otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous
runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual’s
role in d’ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane’s other native
inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and d’ziriaks can make
them ﬂare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical
glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and
shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized
carefully over time to ﬁt the individual’s station.
The D’ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few
other creatures. D’ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy
rather than endure the sound of their language being “butchered by ﬂeshy
throats.” D’ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These
hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost
part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for
residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D’ziriak settlements are lit inside

runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and
perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.

hive cities, light weavers create art,
lighting, signage, and magic wards.
They also use their light weaving for
entertainment and education.

OTHER AQUATIC REPTILES
The elasmosaurus is but one of
many types of aquatic reptiles found
in primeval oceans or lost worlds.
Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are
almost ﬁshlike in appearance.
Others, such as the mosasaurus,
are truly massive beasts capable of
killing and eating whales.
Elasmosaurus
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and
seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar
locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies
underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to
their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An
elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for
even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote
lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are
mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with
near‑humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem
to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it’s theorized that a typical water
orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both
to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions,
those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds
to speciﬁc regions. As a result, it’s not unheard of for a wandering specimen to
ﬁnd its way to coastal waters. Those that do often ﬁnd the ports of small towns
or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by
coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward
elasmosaurus like this ﬁnds its way into a city’s
sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become
the stuff of urban legends.

# DUST MEPHIT

Bestiary 2
MEPHIT INTERACTIONS
Diﬀerent types of mephits that can
be found on the same elemental
plane often develop friendly (or, in
some cases, ﬁerce) rivalries with
one another. While mephits from
elementally opposed planes (such
as ﬁre and water) may have strong
opinions about the superiority of
their own element, the fact that they
rarely see such mephits means that
when they do encounter them, they
often get along better than they do
with their close neighbors.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits are small, weak creatures that serve at the whims of other elemental entities.
The mephits presented here are less common than air mephits, earth mephits, and the
like, as they are a blend of two different elements rather than focusing on one alone.
DUST MEPHIT
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency
to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insigniﬁcant
and minor difﬁculty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making
themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They
tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.

ICE MEPHIT
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their ﬁre mephit kin, ice
mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most
mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company.
Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness,
and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
few moral qualms about acting selﬁshly
and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
should the chance arise.

SOUL GLUTTONS
As if soul eaters weren’t frightening
enough, there exists on Abaddon
much larger variants of these
monsters, known as soul gluttons.
Appearing as roiling, inky black
clouds and possessing a half dozen
arms, soul gluttons are much deadlier
than their smaller kin and are also
much more dangerous to conjure,
as they have a disturbing knack for
wriggling out of a conjurer’s control.
Soul Eater
Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange
ﬁends from the inky swamps of Abaddon.

# DREAM SPIDER
================================================================================


SHIVER ADDICTS
Talented alchemists process dream
spider venom into an addictive drug
called shiver (Gamemastery Guide
121). Those who become addicted to
shiver may be driven in desperation
to seek out dream spiders and allow
them to bite their ﬂesh in order
to get their ﬁx—a tactic that often
backﬁres awfully as the spiders feed.
Spider
Spiders range dramatically in size, yet all are to some extent venomous.
DREAM SPIDER
A dream spider’s webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same
hallucinogenic compound as the creature’s toxin. Originally denizens of tropical
jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly
thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to
produce the drug known as shiver.

Web Trap A creature hit by the dream spider’s web attack is immobilized and stuck to the
nearest surface until it Escapes (DC 16).
OGRE SPIDER
These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement
of their eyes above their wide mandibles evokes the grimacing visage
of an ogre’s leer. Ogres themselves ﬁnd the appearance of ogre spider
faces simultaneously amusing and adorable, but in most cases, ogres’
attempts to keep these spiders as pets result in dead ogres and wellfed spiders.

# DREAD WRAITH
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
DREAD WRAITH ORIGINS
The most unusual dread wraiths
are those that coalesce from an
amalgamation of evil spirits, often
in regions where such spirits are
shredded from their consciousnesses
and churned in foci of negative
energy, such as the Negative Energy
Plane or on the Isle of Terror.
Wraith, Dread
These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals
are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths
haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel
greater distances to sow terror or amass inﬂuence, often sticking to dark glades or
sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to
be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead
to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer
might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly
malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw
several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.

Draining Presence (aura, negative) 10 feet. A creature entering the aura must succeed at
a DC 26 Fortitude save or become drained 1. It recovers after it has been out of the
aura for 1 minute. This drained condition value is cumulative with the drained value
caused by drain life, but not with multiple draining presence auras. A creature
that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to draining presence for 24 hours.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed ﬂy 60 feet
Melee Ȱɵ spectral hand +21 (ﬁnesse, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d10+7

Absorb Wraith ʚʖ The dread wraith extends its hand toward
another wraith creature within 100 feet. The target wraith
dissolves and streaks toward the dread wraith in a straight
line, dealing 6d10 negative damage to each creature along the
line (DC 28 basic Fortitude save). The dread wraith absorbs the
essence of the target wraith, becoming quickened and gaining a
+10-foot status bonus to its ﬂy Speed for a number of rounds
equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its
extra action only to Fly or Strike. An unwilling target can
attempt a DC 28 Will save to resist being absorbed.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the dread wraith
damages a living creature with its spectral hand
Strike, the wraith gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the target must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude
save or become drained 1. Further damage dealt
by the wraith increases the drained condition value
by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Wraith Spawn (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid
slain by a wraith’s spectral hand Strike rises as a wraith
spawn after 1d4 rounds. This wraith spawn is under the
command of the dread wraith that killed it. It doesn’t have drain
life or wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies,
the wraith spawn becomes a full-ﬂedged, autonomous wraith; it
regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn.

THE ETHER WAR
Xills see Material Plane creatures as
little more than incubators, but the
need for fresh hosts never abates,
for on their home plane, xills are
constantly at war. Only the relative
emptiness of the Ethereal Plane
keeps their conﬂict with creatures
like ether spiders from becoming too
overwhelming and outpacing the speed
at which new ranks of soldiers can
replace those who have fallen.
Xill
Xills visit the Material Plane, where they’re often known as ethereal stalkers,
primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane.
These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting
them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles.
Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while
they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.
