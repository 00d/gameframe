DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

Draconic Resistance A dracolisk has resistance 10 to the type of damage it produces
with its breath weapon (see below).
Petrifying Glance Ǻȓ (arcane, aura, transmutation, visual) Trigger A creature within 30
feet that the dracolisk can see starts its turn; Eﬀect The target must attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save. If it fails, it becomes slowed 1 for 1 minute as its body stiﬀens.

Melee Ȱɵ claw +21 (agile), Damage 2d10+8 slashing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The dracolisk breathes a gout of energy based
on its draconic heritage, as noted below. This breath weapon deals 6d10 damage
of the appropriate type, with a DC 28
basic save of a type indicated in
parenthesis below. The dracolisk
can’t use Breath Weapon again for
1d4 rounds.
Black (acid) 60-foot line of acid (Reﬂex)
Blue (electricity) 60-foot line of electricity (Reﬂex)
Green (poison) 30-foot cone of poison (Fortitude)
Red (ﬁre) 30-foot cone of ﬁre (Reﬂex)
White (cold) 30-foot cone of cold (Reﬂex)
Petrifying
Gaze
ʚʖ
(arcane,
concentrate,
incapacitation,
transmutation, visual) The dracolisk stares at a creature it can
see within 30 feet. That creature must attempt
a DC 28 Fortitude save. If it fails and has
not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed
1. If the creature already was slowed
by this ability or Petrifying Glance, a
failed save causes the creature to be
petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this
manner can be instantly restored
to ﬂesh by being coated (not just
splashed) with fresh dracolisk or
basilisk blood no more than 1 hour
old. A single dracolisk contains enough blood
to coat 1d4+2 Medium creatures in this manner.
Savage Jaws ʚʖ The dracolisk makes a single Strike with its
jaws. If the attack hits, it deals 4d12+16 piercing damage (versatile S ) .
This counts as two attacks for its multiple attack penalty.

VENGEFUL BEASTS
Polar bears have been known to take
special interest in those who have
vexed or wounded them, sometimes
following individual hunters back
to their villages and stalking them
exclusively for several days. This
could happen because the hunter
killed the bear’s mate or one of its
cubs, or took prey that the polar
bear had been stalking. Polar bears
engaged in such behavior have even
ignored easier prey to focus intently
on the chosen target.
Bear
Determined foragers and persistent predators, bears spend much of each year
either preparing for hibernation, recovering from hibernation, or taking care of
young following a successful opportunity to mate.
BLACK BEAR
Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration,
depending on which hue is most beneﬁcial for surviving in their local environment.
Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance
from berries and nuts just as often as from ﬁsh and smaller mammals. They
steal food when they ﬁnd it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are
predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves
or their young, black bears often avoid conﬂict or ﬁght only until they can retreat.

POLAR BEAR
Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips,
and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures,
stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy
waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing
ambush predators, leaping from the water to
ambush seals resting on ice ﬂoes. If they are
desperate, polar bears hunt not only other
animals but also humanoids.

STYX PASSAGE FEES
Gliding with eerie ease along the
murky River Styx, thanadaemons
are only too happy to oﬀer mortals
passage aboard their dilapidated
skiﬀs—for a price. Gold is typically
an acceptable payment for a
thanadaemon’s services, though these
ﬁends are well-known for altering the
details of arrangements after the fact,
and may just as likely demand a favor
or some esoteric good, such as a soul
gem, instead of coin.

creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a DC 30 Will save. If the creature fails,
it becomes frightened 2. The creature is then temporarily immune to terrifying gaze (but
not Focus Gaze) for 24 hours.

Rituals DC 34; animate dead
Draining Strike (divine, necromancy) When a thanadaemon
damages a living creature with a melee Strike, the
creature must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or
become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the
thanadaemon increases the drained condition value
by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, fear, visual) The
thanadaemon glares at a single creature they can
see within 30 feet. The target must immediately
attempt a DC 33 Will save against the thanadaemon’s
terrifying gaze. If the target was already frightened,
a failed save causes it to become ﬂeeing for 1d4
rounds. After attempting its save, the creature is
temporarily immune to this ability until the start of
the thanadaemon’s next turn.
Soul Crush ʚʖ (manipulate) Requirements The
thanadaemon has a soul gem; Eﬀect The thanadaemon
crushes the soul gem in one hand and gains fast healing
15 for 1 minute.
PURRODAEMON (WAR DAEMON)
Few creatures embody war’s sheer amount of bloodshed
and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons
of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked
in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their
ﬂesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however,
these weapons are the purrodaemon’s arsenal. A
purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness
and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its
own ﬂesh as though drawing a sword from a
sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil
that weapons steeped in it become
powerful tools of war.

DESTRACHAN LANGUAGE
The Destrachan language can be
learned by other creatures, but
without a destrachan’s unique vocal
organs, non-destrachans can convey
only basic notions and concepts with
it. In most cases, it’s better to speak
Undercommon to a destrachan than
attempt to use its own language.
Destrachan
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its
forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular
head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in
its vicinity. This cruel monster’s true weapon, however, is an ampliﬁed version of
the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates
with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles,
but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans
understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often
be reasoned with.
An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won’t hesitate to
make a meal of carrion it ﬁnds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures
take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking
and subduing them, then devouring them alive.

Destructive Harmonics ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, occult, sonic) The
destrachan emits a harsh sonic cry that deals 9d6 sonic damage (DC 26
basic Reﬂex save) in either a 60-foot cone or a 30-foot burst. It can’t
use Destructive Harmonics again for 1d4 rounds.
Painful Harmonics ʚʖ (auditory, evocation, incapacitation, occult)
The destrachan emits a sonic cry in either a 60-foot cone or a
30-foot burst. This discordant ululation resonates along
the nerves and bones of living creatures in the area,
manifesting as waves of incapacitating pain washing
over the victims. Each living creature in the area must
attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save. The destrachan can’t
use Painful Harmonics again for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is sickened 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is deafened for 3 rounds

Critical Failure The creature is deafened for 1

Shattering Harmonics ʚʖ (evocation, occult,
sonic) The destrachan focuses its harmonics
against a single item within 60 feet that is
made of crystal, metal, stone, or wood. The
target object takes 7d8 sonic damage. If the
item is attended, its bearer can attempt a
DC 26 basic Reﬂex save for the item. The
destrachan can’t use Shattering Harmonics
again for 1d4 rounds.

THE HIERARCHY OF HELL
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little
use for compassion or empathy. As
such, it exists entirely within a strict
hierarchy, and this order extends to
its denizens. While diﬀerent types of
demons correspond to various sins
and daemons are associated with
modes of mortal death, the diﬀerent
types of devils exist solely to fulﬁll
particular roles in the infernal
machine. On occasion, a particular
devil can transcend the role for
which they were literally shaped,
but this often transforms the devil
physically into the type suitable for
their new role.
Devil
Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell’s bureaucracies and hierarchies,
though some have far more specialized functions than others.
ZEBUB (ACCUSER DEVIL)
Zebubs serve as Hell’s messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they’ve seen
with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also
to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms
upon unsuspecting lands to debase ﬂesh and land alike while collecting secrets the
infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate
weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs’ whims. While
arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and conﬁdence of most devils, and
thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions.
Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil
Baalzebul in the frozen, ﬁlthy wastes of Hell’s seventh layer, Cocytus.

Infernal Eye ̂ˬ (divine, divination) The zebub records everything they see,
and though they don’t remember all observations, they can pass them along
to another creature. The zebub replays 10 minutes of witnessed
events to a touched willing creature, which receives the memories
in a ﬂash of information. By remaining in contact, the zebub can
spend additional 3-action activities to replay more information. After relaying
their visions to another, the zebub can’t ever recall those events again.
Sneak Attack The zebub’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
SARGLAGON (DROWNING DEVIL)
Sarglagons dwell in Hell’s myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve
as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the
ﬁfth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and
can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness.
Few ﬁends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river
crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their
infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the
ﬁends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway’s memory-sapping
qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious
secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons
sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what
they did to earn their unwanted protectors’ attention. The constant uninvited
vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stiﬂing to their wards.

WIDGET WORKSHOPS
The ﬁrst dig-widget came from the
workshops of a dwarven thieves’
guild called Godak’s Grifters, which
used more advanced magical
clockwork theories as a springboard
for these simpler but no less eﬀective
contraptions. With their dig-widgets,
the Grifters plagued the authorities
of several dwarven settlements
over the years. Their travels spread
dig-widget technology, and numerous
improvements have since led to faster
and more reliable versions. Though
upstanding dwarven mechanics have
observed dig-widgets and recognized
the complexity of the technology,
they’ve steadfastly refused to
adapt something with such an
unscrupulous origin.
Dig-Widget
Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for inﬁltration. Each
dig‑widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices
that function as thieves’ tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews
for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel
themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct,
they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path,
dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They’re rarely left unattended, as a thief
needs to be nearby to follow after—both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget
from engaging in further larceny once it’s achieved its goal.
The source of a dig-widget’s power is as much mechanical as it is magical.
The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement
over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant
winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget’s moving
parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.

Fastening Leap Ȱɵ The dig-widget Leaps up 20
feet onto a creature or object and attempts
a corkscrew Strike against it. If the Strike
damages the target, the dig-widget attaches
to the target (typically to the back of a
creature). This is similar to Grabbing the
creature, but the dig-widget moves with that
creature rather than holding it in place. While
attached, the dig-widget can’t use its corkscrew. The
dig-widget can be Shoved oﬀ, or it can detach itself with
an Interact action.
Sneak Attack A dig-widget’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.

COMPSOGNATHUS FAMILIARS
Appropriate familiar abilities for
a compsognathus familiar include
climber, damage avoidance, fast
movement, kinspeech, manual
dexterity, scent, or speech. A
compsognathus familiar who can
talk tends to do so in a rapid voice,
with plenty of questions as a result
of its eager curiosity. Note that while
dinosaurs aren’t technically all the
same species, you should consider
allowing a compsognathus with
kinspeech the ability to speak to any
dinosaur rather than limiting it to
only fellow compsognathuses.
Dinosaur
Dinosaurs encompass a staggering range of creatures, from tiny but still
dangerous scavengers like the compsognathus to lumbering giants like the
ravenous spinosaurus to ornery herbivores like iguanodons. Often sought out
and partially domesticated to serve as exotic pets for eccentric aristocrats or
dangerous guardians for those eager to protect their holdings with frightening
but tamable creatures, dinosaurs are far from limited to lurking in primeval
“lost worlds.”
COMPSOGNATHUS
The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting
motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that
the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or
snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus
is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive
dinosaurs result not from the creatures’ hunger but from frightened defensive
reactions when the dinosaurs’ inquisitive natures compel them to enter into
situations (such as wagons or bedrolls) that inadvertently put them at odds with
surprised adventurers.
A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and
weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar
for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren’t involved, however, those
encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with
the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as
they are at best partly tame.

PACHYCEPHALOSAURUS
Pachycephalosauruses are normally peaceful herbivorous dinosaurs, but they grow
much more violent during their mating season, when they ﬁght one another to win
over mates and warn away interlopers. They also defend themselves vehemently
when potential predators stray too close to their herd. The pachycephalosaurus’s
skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous blunt, bony
horns. This feature, combined with the dinosaur’s powerful, compact neck, allows
it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inﬂicting great damage.
Some humanoid groups have successfully trained pachycephalosauruses for use
as mounts, but the creatures aren’t particularly well suited to the task.
Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.

DINOSAUR ABILITIES
While the real world fossil records
hold a wealth of inspiration for
the reconstruction of dinosaurs
in an RPG, you can also look to
living creatures for ideas. Giving
a dinosaur a poisonous bite or
an unusual attack routine like
Clobbering Charge ensures that
dinosaurs are as interesting in
combat as they are in appearance.

Clobbering Charge ʚʖ The pachycephalosaurus Strides up to its Speed. If it ends its
movement within melee reach of a target, it can make a skull Strike against that
target. If the pachycephalosaurus critically hits with this Strike, the creature hit is
stunned 1.
Sudden Shove Ǻȓ (attack) Trigger The pachycephalosaurus damages a Medium or
smaller foe with its skull Strike; Eﬀect The pachycephalosaurus digs in and ﬂings
its head up, shoving its foe away. It attempts an Athletics check against the target’s
Fortitude DC.
Critical Success The pachycephalosaurus pushes the opponent up to 10 feet away
from itself and knocks the target prone.
Success The pachycephalosaurus pushes the opponent back 5 feet.
Failure The pachycephalosaurus fails to push the opponent.
Critical Failure As failure, but the failed attempt leaves the pachycephalosaurus
ﬂat‑footed for 1 round.
HADROSAURID
Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping
of herbivorous dinosaurs that
share
characteristic
ﬂat
snouts ﬁlled with rows
of grinding teeth well
suited
for
feeding
on vegetation. Also
known as “duck-billed
dinosaurs” due to the
unusual shape of their jaws,
hadrosaurids
are
lumbering
creatures that can rival an
elephant for size, although they
tend to be much less aggressive and
are prone to ﬂight when confronted
with danger rather than stubbornly standing
their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have
uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each
species its own unusual proﬁle, making them easily
recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.
Giants and other oversized creatures have been known
to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite
their ability to sprint quickly, they don’t make particularly
viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group,
a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak
great damage with their trampling.
A hadrosaurid can walk for short
distances on its hind legs but prefers
to graze and travel on all fours. The
typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30
feet long and can weigh up to
10,000 pounds.

Dragon, Primal
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the
Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true
dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an
afﬁnity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor
arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons
can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their
home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have
sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example,
or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands.
Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop
shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in inﬁltrating settlements or
inﬂuencing others from the shadows.
PRIMAL DRAGON SPELLCASTERS
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of
that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy
and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You
can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the
same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s
Wisdom or Charisma modiﬁer by 1 or 2 to reﬂect their mastery of magic.
PRIMAL DRAGONS OF GOLARION
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to
Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build
new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources
that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated
by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated
coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as
their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud
dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer
to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal
dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural
beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons,
cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on
Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains.
Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they
can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in
the sinister nation of Nidal.
BRINE DRAGON
Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help
them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either
good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order
on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted
community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards
of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement
seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the
most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon’s personality, their community members might view
their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful
tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or
philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of
greater concern than individuals’ well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion
rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine
dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.

REZLARABREN
A series of underwater caverns
on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound
Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren’s
lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini
who labor as miners. Her relationship
with the Linnorm Kings is complex,
and whether she views them as allies
or enemies depends on her mood.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their
lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside
grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed,
or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel
safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of
offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged
from sunken ships.

DRAKES AND DRAGONS
Although drakes and dragons are
related to one another, little love is
lost between them, and even the
most territorial drakes know better
than to remain in a dragon’s territory
longer than they have to. In rare
cases, large rampages of drakes band
together to attack an encroaching
dragon, especially if the dragon is
young and inexperienced.
Drake
Distant cousins to dragons, drakes menace and terrorize settlements.
SHADOW DRAKE
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their
species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales
and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception
to the norm for drakes and dragons.

DWEOMERCAT FAMILIARS
Particularly powerful spellcasters
sometimes take young dweomercat
cubs as familiars. Their
independence and ﬂightiness makes
dweomercats somewhat unreliable
allies, though, so one is never
sure whether their bond with a
dweomercat will be long-lasting or a
temporary aﬀair.
Dweomercat
Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey
upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes
encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is
thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are
famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near
them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to
instantly teleport across the battleﬁeld.

Alter Dweomer Ǻȓ (abjuration, arcane) Trigger The dweomercat is targeted by a
spell or is within the area of a spell as it is cast; Eﬀect The dweomercat gains an
eﬀect related to the school of the triggering spell. This eﬀect occurs before the
dweomercat is aﬀected by the triggering spell. The eﬀect lasts for 1 minute, until the
dweomercat uses this ability again, or until the dweomercat Dismisses the eﬀect,
whichever comes ﬁrst.

If the dweomercat ends its teleport adjacent to a
creature under an ongoing spell eﬀect or who cast a
spell since the dweomercat’s last turn, this does not
expend a casting of dimension door.
Pounce Ȱɵ The dweomercat Strides and makes
a Strike at the end of that movement. If the
dweomercat began this action hidden, it remains
hidden until after this ability’s Strike.

D’ziriak
These strange creatures are native to the Plane of Shadows, where their colorful
nature is in opposition to that realm’s overwhelmingly monochromatic palette.
Averaging 7 feet in height, d’ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termite-
like abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have ﬁve‑ﬁngered
hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for ﬁne
manipulations and are not effective in combat.
D’ziriaks’ otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous
runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual’s
role in d’ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane’s other native
inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and d’ziriaks can make
them ﬂare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical
glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and
shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized
carefully over time to ﬁt the individual’s station.
The D’ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few
other creatures. D’ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy
rather than endure the sound of their language being “butchered by ﬂeshy
throats.” D’ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These
hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost
part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for
residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D’ziriak settlements are lit inside
and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of
runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and
perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.

Glow (aura, light) 20 feet. The colorful runes that decorate a d’ziriak’s

emanation must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. After using this
ability, the d’ziriak loses its glow for 24 hours; during this time it can’t use
Dazzling Burst again. A creature that attempts this save is immune to all
Dazzling Bursts for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.

Double Claw Ȱɵ Frequency once per round; Eﬀect The d’ziriak makes
two claw Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their
damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. This
counts as two attacks for the d’ziriak’s multiple attack penalty,
and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both attacks.
LIGHT WEAVERS
The masters of the d’ziriaks’
light‑weaving craft are occult
practitioners, almost always sorcerers
of the aberrant bloodline. Light
weavers prefer spells that provide
light or create magical writing. In their
hive cities, light weavers create art,
lighting, signage, and magic wards.
They also use their light weaving for
entertainment and education.

OTHER AQUATIC REPTILES
The elasmosaurus is but one of
many types of aquatic reptiles found
in primeval oceans or lost worlds.
Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are
almost ﬁshlike in appearance.
Others, such as the mosasaurus,
are truly massive beasts capable of
killing and eating whales.
Elasmosaurus
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and
seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar
locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies
underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to
their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An
elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for
even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote
lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are
mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with
near‑humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem
to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it’s theorized that a typical water
orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both
to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions,
those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds
to speciﬁc regions. As a result, it’s not unheard of for a wandering specimen to
ﬁnd its way to coastal waters. Those that do often ﬁnd the ports of small towns
or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by
coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward
elasmosaurus like this ﬁnds its way into a city’s
sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become
the stuff of urban legends.

Long Neck An elasmosaurus’s long neck allows it to interact with the surface while
its body remains submerged underwater. While submerged no deeper than 15 feet
underwater, an elasmosaurus can still stick its head up to breathe. An elasmosaurus
gains cover against attacks made against creatures who are above the water’s
surface while it is underwater, even if its head is above the surface.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Jaws only.
Speed 5 feet, swim 35 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +17 (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+10 piercing plus Grab
Melee Ȱɵ paddle +17, Damage 2d6+10 bludgeoning
Drag Below Ȱɵ (attack) The elasmosaurus attempts an Athletics check against a
grabbed foe’s Fortitude DC. If the elasmosaurus succeeds, the foe is forcibly moved
5 feet toward the elasmosaurus’s body. If the elasmosaurus
critically succeeds, the foe is moved 10 feet towards the
elasmosaurus’s body.
Thrashing Retreat ʚʖ A swimming
elasmosaurus thrashes the area
around it as it attempts to ﬂee.
It makes two paddle Strikes, each
of which must be against
separate
targets,
and
each of which takes the
normal multiple attack penalty. It then Swims up
to its swim Speed. This Swim does not trigger
reactions based on movement.

SOUL GLUTTONS
As if soul eaters weren’t frightening
enough, there exists on Abaddon
much larger variants of these
monsters, known as soul gluttons.
Appearing as roiling, inky black
clouds and possessing a half dozen
arms, soul gluttons are much deadlier
than their smaller kin and are also
much more dangerous to conjure,
as they have a disturbing knack for
wriggling out of a conjurer’s control.
Soul Eater
Only the most desperate or foolhardy conjurers call upon the aid of these strange
ﬁends from the inky swamps of Abaddon.

Caster Link (detection, divine, divination) A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with
its conjurer. While both are on the same plane, the soul eater knows the location of its
conjurer per its ﬁnd target ability. If the soul eater’s target dies before the soul eater
can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the
soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them.
Find Target (detection, divine, divination) When a soul eater is
conjured to the Material Plane to ﬁnd a speciﬁc
creature, it gains the beneﬁts of a 5th-level
locate spell that isn’t blocked by lead or
running water. The conjurer must
have seen the target and must
speak the target’s name while
conjuring the soul eater in
order to grant this ability.

Drain Soul ̂ˬ (death, divine, manipulate, necromancy)
Requirements The soul eater is adjacent to a dying
creature; Eﬀect The soul eater attempts to
devour the dying creature’s soul. The creature
must attempt a DC 25 Will save. A creature
that dies as a result of Drain Soul can’t be
restored to life except by a spell or ritual of 8th
level or higher. If the soul eater that used Drain
Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that
creature’s corpse and the creature has been dead no
longer than 1 minute, the creature’s soul returns to
its body and is restored to life, leaving the creature
unconscious and dying 1 but no longer doomed.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes doomed 1, or
increases its doomed value by 1 if it was already doomed.
Failure As success, but doomed 2.
Critical Failure As success, but doomed 3.
Mind-Numbing Touch (curse, divine, necromancy) When a soul eater hits a creature with
its claw Strike, the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become stupeﬁed
1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure). Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases
the stupeﬁed value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. This condition
value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night’s rest. As long as the
creature is stupeﬁed by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any doomed
value that creature might have.

THE ETHER WAR
Xills see Material Plane creatures as
little more than incubators, but the
need for fresh hosts never abates,
for on their home plane, xills are
constantly at war. Only the relative
emptiness of the Ethereal Plane
keeps their conﬂict with creatures
like ether spiders from becoming too
overwhelming and outpacing the speed
at which new ranks of soldiers can
replace those who have fallen.
Xill
Xills visit the Material Plane, where they’re often known as ethereal stalkers,
primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane.
These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting
them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles.
Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while
they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.

to each strike normally.

unconscious, willing, or paralyzed creature; Eﬀect The xill
implants xill eggs in the creature’s ﬂesh.
Xill Eggs (disease) The sickened condition from xill eggs doesn’t
improve on its own until the disease is cured or runs its

requires a successful DC 26 Medicine check and deals
4d6 slashing damage to the host; Saving Throw

Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is immune to xill
paralysis for 1 minute.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round.
