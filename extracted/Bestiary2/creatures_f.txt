ELEMENTAL ALIGNMENTS
More than other elementals, ﬁre
elementals tend to deviate from
neutrality, and are often good, evil,
or chaotic in nature. Lawful ﬁre
elementals are rare. Fire’s inherently
capricious nature seems to prevent
these creatures from succumbing to
the inﬂuence of order.

IRNAKURSE MOCKERIES
When drow capture a particularly
hated surface elf, or one with a large
following, they inﬂict even greater pain
upon them during the ﬂeshwarping
process than most other victims. The
resulting irnakurse are known as
“mockeries,” and always have elite
adjustments. Rather than using them,
drow keep them close at hand as living
“art” akin to a pet or trophy.
Fleshwarp
Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two ﬂeshwarps
presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths
into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
IRNAKURSE
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and
humiliating ﬂeshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment
of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose ﬂesh,
and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display
to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to
hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all
other targets.

UNKNOWN ORIGINS
Frost worms are clearly supernatural
in origin, though the source of their
magical abilities remains unclear.
Research is hampered by the fact
that neither the corpse nor its magic
survive the creature’s death, and live
frost worms are notoriously diﬃcult
and dangerous to keep or transport.
Evidence exists that the winter
witches of Irrisen may have created
the ﬁrst frost worms, while other
clues suggest they hail from the
distant planet of Triaxus.
Frost Worm
The frost worm’s single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous
mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually
two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth.
An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouﬂage, burrowing, and
deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive,
high‑pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared
it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.
The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while
it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such
regions. A frost worm that somehow ﬁnds itself in temperate or even tropical
environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time,
creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.

Death Throes (cold, evocation, primal) When a frost worm dies, it
explodes in a 100-foot burst of searing cold blood. All creatures
and objects in range take 10d8 cold damage (DC 29 basic
Reﬂex save).
Worm Chill (aura, cold, evocation, primal) 5 feet. A creature
that enters or begins its turn in the emanation takes 3d6
cold damage (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save).
Freezing Blood Ǻȓ (cold) Trigger The frost worm takes
piercing or slashing damage; Eﬀect The frost worm’s
freezing blood sprays out on a random creature within
10 feet of the frost worm. That creature takes 7d6 cold
damage (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save).

worm exhales a blast of frost, dealing 13d6 cold damage
to creatures in a 50-foot cone (DC 32 basic Reﬂex save). It
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Worm Trill Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, enchantment,
mental, primal) The frost worm emits a hypnotic
trill. Each non–frost worm creature within 100
feet must attempt a DC 32 Will save. The
eﬀects of Worm Trill last for 1 round, but if the
frost worm uses this ability again on subsequent
rounds, it extends this duration by 1 round for any
creature already aﬀected.
Success The creature is unaﬀected and is
immune to Worm Trill for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated by the frost
worm.
Critical Failure As failure, but the fascinated
condition doesn’t end if the frost worm uses
hostile actions against the creature.

WOOD GIANT CELEBRATIONS
Despite the seriousness with which
wood giants approach their duties,
or perhaps because of it, wood giant
gatherings are joyous occasions.
Wood giants most often gather to
sing, dance, seek life partners, and
celebrate their hard work.
Giant
Giants prosper in many environments, and although they are quite diverse, they
all tend to have equally larger-than-life personalities.
WOOD GIANT
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval
forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of
nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out.
Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild
places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part
of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense
humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most
giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense
forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely
with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness
regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory,
foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands.
While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey
creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most
fey as far too ﬂighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200
pounds.

Piercing Shot Ȱɵ The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it
glances oﬀ the ﬁrst target to strike another target behind the ﬁrst
one. The wood giant chooses two targets in a direct line, one of which
must be giving lesser cover to the other, then makes a single ranged
Strike with its longbow against both targets. This attack ignores
the lesser cover the ﬁrst target provides to the second. The wood
giant rolls damage only once, and applies it to each creature it hits.
Piercing Shot counts as two attacks for the wood giant’s multiple
attack penalty.

GNOLL MASTERS
Leucrottas often associate with
gnolls. They never submit to serve
others as beasts of burden, but they
sometimes permit gnoll leaders who
impress them to ride them into battle
as steeds. More often, a leucrotta
considers itself to be the true leader
of a gnoll clan, whispering and
manipulating a gnoll warchief into
doing its bidding or (if it tires of the
game) goading them into challenging
the leucrotta for leadership and then
taking over the clan directly after
eliminating its rival.
Leucrotta
The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas,
leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry
to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can ﬁrst torment and then devour
them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they
are perpetually ﬁlthy. A leucrotta’s oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged,
hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through ﬂesh, bone, and
even steel with ease.

Language Adaptation A leucrotta can learn any language it hears spoken for at least 10

learned using this ability. Typically, a leucrotta knows Gnoll as the language granted
by this ability.

Eﬀect
The
leucrotta utters a plaintive cry to
draw its prey closer. Each creature
within the emanation that was
deceived by Sound Mimicry must
succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become
fascinated and compelled to move toward the sound of the
leucrotta’s voice on their turn. Fascinated creatures are
also ﬂat-footed. If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated
condition ends only for the creature that is attacked.
If the leucrotta speaks a creature’s name while
using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a –2
circumstance penalty to their saving throw to
resist the ability. On a successful save, a creature
is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours.
Sound Mimicry Ȱɵ The leucrotta perfectly imitates
voices and speech and attempts a Deception check
against listeners’ Will DC to fool them. The leucrotta
gains a +4 bonus to this Deception check if it has
listened to the creature it’s imitating for at least
10 minutes at any point in the last 24 hours. The
leucrotta can’t duplicate voice-based abilities or
spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound
of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to
deceive constructs or undead that respond to
voice commands. The leucrotta can’t imitate
speech in languages it doesn’t know.

FIRST WORLD CONNECTIONS
Linnorms have a deep connection to
the First World, the primordial home
of the fey. While linnorms typically
won’t think twice before devouring
a gnome or other fey, they do have
an unusual respect for wielders of
powerful primal magic. The only
way to cow a linnorm, according
to common wisdom, is to remind it
that there are forces of nature even
stronger than itself.

rounds; Stage 1 4d6 cold damage and clumsy 1 (1 round); Stage 2 6d6 cold damage and

CAIRN LINNORM
Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes
in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some
point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a
service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any
creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb
without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the
deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a
cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won’t leave until it has secured permission
to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone’s guess; nevertheless,
reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade
even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts
or mausoleums.

ONI DAIMYO
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with
isolated mortal domains. The most
powerful is Inma, the Empress of the
World, but Akuma the Horned King,
Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka
the Red King are also worshipped.
WATER YAI
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants.
Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to
lurk alone in the world’s oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote fresh-
water lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they
prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition
of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in
richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous
faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie
magical properties, and in combat, they can also ﬁre bolts of electricity from their
third eye.

NAR-VOTH DELICACIES
Both cavern trolls and xorns—squat,
tripartite earth elementals—share a
voracious appetite for deposits of
precious minerals. When either group
encounters the other, a frenzy of
claws and ravenous gorging ensues
until only one side remains. Powerful
cavern trolls who consume a critical
mass of xorns can gain tremorsense
and rule as monarchs over their
subterranean kin.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
vulnerability to sunlight that petriﬁes them on sustained contact. Unlike common
trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by ﬁre. The crystalline nature of
their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their ﬂinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete
with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and
weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Sunlight Petrification If exposed to direct sunlight, a cavern troll immediately
becomes slowed 1 and can’t use reactions or Trample. The slowed value increases
by 1 each time the cavern troll ends its turn in sunlight. If the cavern troll’s
actions are reduced to 0 in this way, they become petrified until they
spends at least 1 minute in darkness. Spells like sunburst that
create magical sunlight cannot petrify a cavern troll, but the
troll is slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to
such an effect.

TWO-HEADED TROLL
Two-headed trolls are savage, dual-
minded monsters with an unquenchable
thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their
ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the
lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke
the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children.
“Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or
a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow
you whole!” It’s unclear why such a morbid tradition gained
traction with parents, but it’s an undeniable fact that two-
headed trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures
small enough to devour with one bite.
Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height,
weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common
trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright
gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk
hunched over.
