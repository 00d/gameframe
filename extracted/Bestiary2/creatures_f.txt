FILTH FIRE

# FETCHLING SCOUT
================================================================================


MASTERS OF ADAPTATION
Kayals understand that many
Material Plane cultures view them
with suspicion or even fear, and
take pains to adapt to cultures with
which they seek to establish trade.
Unfortunately, kayals’ mastery
at cultural adaptation can often
backﬁre, leading to fears that the
so-called “fetchlings” are an invading
force that seeks to duplicate and
replace those with whom they
merely wish to do business.
Fetchling
The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from
generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer
human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic
in coloration, with ﬂesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all
shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid
yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.
Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane,
often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures
there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d’ziriaks. While individual
fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment,
which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the
regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they
trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks
or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.
Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the
event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don’t mind traveling to and
blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react
defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of
the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the
worst of interlopers might make sense to some.
Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane;
most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who
have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere,
exiles who were banished from their homelands,
or planar castaways with no ability to return to the
Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded,
are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities
of signiﬁcant size, one can sometimes even ﬁnd a small community of
a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so
subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing
layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.

IRNAKURSE MOCKERIES
When drow capture a particularly
hated surface elf, or one with a large
following, they inﬂict even greater pain
upon them during the ﬂeshwarping
process than most other victims. The
resulting irnakurse are known as
“mockeries,” and always have elite
adjustments. Rather than using them,
drow keep them close at hand as living
“art” akin to a pet or trophy.
Fleshwarp
Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two ﬂeshwarps
presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths
into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
IRNAKURSE
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and
humiliating ﬂeshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment
of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose ﬂesh,
and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display
to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to
hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all
other targets.

# FROGHEMOTH
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
ALIEN ORIGINS
Froghemoths have been known to
suddenly abandon an established lair
to seek a new home, as if in response
to some cosmic convergence or
subspace signal imperceptible to
other creatures. Some argue that
the froghemoth is never fully
comfortable in any environment
because it isn’t from this world at
all, and that these wanderings are
instinctual urges to seek out its true
home—a home not represented by
the strange world in which the beast
ﬁnds itself trapped.
Froghemoth
A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth
is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote
Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a
frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its
eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.

Str +8, Dex +6, Con +7, Int –4, Wis +6, Cha +4
Otherworldly Vision A froghemoth’s alien eyes allow it to perceive creatures within 30
feet, even if they are invisible or ethereal. It can still be fooled by successful Stealth
checks to Hide, but it has Perception DC 38 in such cases. It also sees through and is
unaﬀected by illusions with the visual trait if they are within 30 feet.

Barbed Tongue A creature hit
by the froghemoth’s tongue
becomes grabbed by the
froghemoth.
The
creature
isn’t immobilized, but it can’t
move beyond the reach of the
froghemoth’s tongue. A creature
can sever the tongue with a successful
Strike against AC 31 that deals at least 15
slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the froghemoth but prevents it
from using its tongue Strike until
it regrows its tongue, which
takes 1 minute.
Flailing Tentacles ʚʖ The
froghemoth makes up to four
tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These count toward the froghemoth’s
multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t
increase until after all the attacks.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ 3d6+12, DC 33
Retract Tongue ʚʖ The froghemoth pulls a creature grabbed by its
tongue toward itself. The froghemoth rolls an Athletics check against
the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the froghemoth pulls the
creature into an adjacent space, and if it critically succeeds it can
also make a bite Strike against the creature after the pull.

UNKNOWN ORIGINS
Frost worms are clearly supernatural
in origin, though the source of their
magical abilities remains unclear.
Research is hampered by the fact
that neither the corpse nor its magic
survive the creature’s death, and live
frost worms are notoriously diﬃcult
and dangerous to keep or transport.
Evidence exists that the winter
witches of Irrisen may have created
the ﬁrst frost worms, while other
clues suggest they hail from the
distant planet of Triaxus.
Frost Worm
The frost worm’s single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous
mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually
two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth.
An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouﬂage, burrowing, and
deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive,
high‑pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared
it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.
The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while
it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such
regions. A frost worm that somehow ﬁnds itself in temperate or even tropical
environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time,
creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.

WOOD GIANT CELEBRATIONS
Despite the seriousness with which
wood giants approach their duties,
or perhaps because of it, wood giant
gatherings are joyous occasions.
Wood giants most often gather to
sing, dance, seek life partners, and
celebrate their hard work.
Giant
Giants prosper in many environments, and although they are quite diverse, they
all tend to have equally larger-than-life personalities.
WOOD GIANT
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval
forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of
nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out.
Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild
places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part
of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense
humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most
giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense
forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely
with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness
regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory,
foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands.
While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey
creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most
fey as far too ﬂighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200
pounds.

# FIRE JELLYFISH SWARM
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
JELLYFISH SPECIES
A large number of types of
monstrous jellyﬁsh dwell in the
world’s oceans, each with their
own unusual specialty in hunting.
The immense vampire jellyﬁsh is a
blood-drinking monster that often
attacks sailors aboard ships. Among
the largest are the dreaded whaler
jellyﬁsh, colossal creatures that feed
on whales or even krakens.
Jellyfish
Many varieties of jellyﬁsh drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on ﬁsh and
other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyﬁsh pose a
threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyﬁsh are animals,
they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system.
FIRE JELLYFISH SWARM
While individually one of these ﬁst-sized jellyﬁsh is merely a nuisance, in great
numbers, ﬁre jellyﬁsh can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water,
they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their
bright coloration, but those who are stung by ﬁre jellyﬁsh learn the larger reason
for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.

# FLYTRAP LESHY

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The sunﬂower leshy
transforms into a Small ﬂower. This ability otherwise uses the eﬀects of tree shape.
Seed Spray ʚʖ (conjuration, primal) The sunﬂower leshy launches a deluge of seeds
from their head in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within
the area (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save). It gains a +2 status bonus to this damage against
dazzled creatures. The sunﬂower leshy can’t use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
FLYTRAP LESHY
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, ﬂytrap leshys get along well with other
leshys. Nonetheless, they’re among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the
most vulnerable places in the natural world with their ﬂytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of ﬂytrap leshys band together to create
amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal
defense suffuses ﬂytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between
multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight
humanoids—to a ﬂytrap leshy, though, there’s nothing strange about sharing your
innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your
home from an enemy.

leshy can Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop,
the target leshy takes 3d8 damage. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once

GNOLL MASTERS
Leucrottas often associate with
gnolls. They never submit to serve
others as beasts of burden, but they
sometimes permit gnoll leaders who
impress them to ride them into battle
as steeds. More often, a leucrotta
considers itself to be the true leader
of a gnoll clan, whispering and
manipulating a gnoll warchief into
doing its bidding or (if it tires of the
game) goading them into challenging
the leucrotta for leadership and then
taking over the clan directly after
eliminating its rival.
Leucrotta
The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas,
leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry
to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can ﬁrst torment and then devour
them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they
are perpetually ﬁlthy. A leucrotta’s oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged,
hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through ﬂesh, bone, and
even steel with ease.

steam lingers until the end of the linnorm’s next turn; anyone who enters the area
or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 ﬁre damage (DC 36 Reﬂex save negates).
During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight,
turning the area into diﬃcult terrain. All creatures in the steam become concealed,
and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The shoal
linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes

point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a
service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any
creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb
without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the
deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a
cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won’t leave until it has secured permission
to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone’s guess; nevertheless,
reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade
even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts
or mausoleums.

# FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
================================================================================


MALARIA STRAINS
This pernicious disease is often
associated with mosquitoes. The
most common version of malaria
is presented on page 118 of the
Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
and while the variants inﬂicted
by mosquito swarms and giant
mosquitoes are deadlier, they don’t
have the chance to recur after
1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also
causes weakness and fevers, while
septic malaria causes painful and
infected lesions to form on the
body. Regardless of the strain you
contract, you can’t reduce your
sickened condition while you are
aﬀected with malaria.
Mosquito
While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their
giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous.
FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal
swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms
are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid
months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the
waterfront reaches of settlements.

OTHER ONI
Diﬀerent oni exist for nearly every
humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask
their golden skin and four-ﬁngered
claws in human form, while ja oni
hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include
wind yai (who take their form from
cloud giants) and the immensely
powerful void yai (who form from
other yai and ascend to rule over
rune giants).
FIRE YAI
Fire yai take the form of ﬁre giants. Like ﬁre giants, ﬁre yai are shrewd and
militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage
in battle to conquer and control others, ﬁre yai also love the thrill of war, ﬁghting
for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a ﬁre yai with a true challenge in combat can
potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai’s
third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of ﬁre.

ONI DAIMYO
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with
isolated mortal domains. The most
powerful is Inma, the Empress of the
World, but Akuma the Horned King,
Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka
the Red King are also worshipped.
WATER YAI
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants.
Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to
lurk alone in the world’s oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote freshwater lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they
prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition
of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in
richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous
faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie
magical properties, and in combat, they can also ﬁre bolts of electricity from their
third eye.

# FROST TROLL
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
DEATHLESS FROST
Historically isolated in the remote
frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands,
frost trolls have increasingly been
encountered in more temperate
climates on Golarion. It’s unclear
what’s driving these ice-hearted
trolls southward, but some suspect
the machinations of a wrathful
demon lord are at play.
Troll
Towering brutes with slavering jaws and razor-sharp claws, trolls are voracious
predators. They are nigh invulnerable and single-minded in their pursuit, so they
throw themselves against prey with reckless abandon. Wounds that would cripple
or kill most other creatures regenerate into healthy troll ﬂesh within seconds.
Trolls don’t mark their hunting grounds with claw marks or urine as beasts
do. After gorging upon their kill, they suspend any meat, bones, or other bodily
detritus that remain from tree branches to mark their domains. Unfortunately,
trolls tend to treat these borders as approximations. Before a hapless traveler
even spots such a grisly marker and realizes that they have wandered into troll
territory, the trolls are already preparing to attack.
These pages present lesser-known varieties beyond the common troll.
FROST TROLL
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost
teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in
packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to
assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human
ﬂesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity
to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost
troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their
sickly, cracked ﬂesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
themselves with trophies of bone and hide ﬂayed from their kills.

CAVERN TROLL
Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom
of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in
their path—even rocks and minerals when more
nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky
goliaths can tunnel through stone with their
iron-sharp claws.

================================================================================
PAGE 266
================================================================================

NAR-VOTH DELICACIES
Both cavern trolls and xorns—squat,
tripartite earth elementals—share a
voracious appetite for deposits of
precious minerals. When either group
encounters the other, a frenzy of
claws and ravenous gorging ensues
until only one side remains. Powerful
cavern trolls who consume a critical
mass of xorns can gain tremorsense
and rule as monarchs over their
subterranean kin.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
vulnerability to sunlight that petriﬁes them on sustained contact. Unlike common
trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by ﬁre. The crystalline nature of
their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their ﬂinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete
with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and
weighs about 2,000 pounds.
