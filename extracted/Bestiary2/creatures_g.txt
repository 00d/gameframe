ANT HIVES
Giant ants form vast underground
colonies, excavating deep burrows
or infesting existing caverns. Ants
are omnivorous and cultivate fungus
farms, but they are happy to eat
whatever presents itself. Humanoids
and their domesticated animals are
easy fuel for the insectile machinery
of their hives. Worker ants lack the
sting of their warrior cousins, while
elite drones ﬂy on gossamer wings
(ﬂy Speed of 30 feet) to seek new
food sources for their queen.
Ant
Ants are industrious insects that aid the natural processes of decay and renewal.
GIANT ANT
Giant ants are much like their smaller kin in their industrious habits, though
growing to the size of ponies makes them much deadlier.

# GIANT BADGER
================================================================================

GIANT BADGER
The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore,
its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or
adventurer. A giant badger’s claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from
solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

HAUNTING LAIRS
A baobhan sith adores the aesthetics
of abandoned homes, desolate burial
grounds, and crumbling ruins. They
strive to give their lairs a gothic
beauty rather than allowing them to
get run down and ﬁlthy.
Baobhan Sith
Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane’s infusion with the
raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted
the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves,
as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.
A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although
territorial, they won’t reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink
blood from victims they ﬁnd attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals
and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.

Primal Innate Spells DC 24; 3rd mind reading (at will)
Captivating Dance ʚʖ (enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual)
The baobhan sith sways rhythmically and Strides up to their Speed.
Each creature within 30 feet of the baobhan sith at the end of their
movement must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily
immune to Captivating Dance for 24 hours.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round and
is  temporarily immune to Captivating Dance for
24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend at
least 1 of its actions on each of its turns to move closer
to the baobhan sith as expediently as possible, while
avoiding obvious dangers. If the creature ends its
movement or turn adjacent to the fey, it is slowed
1 until the end of its next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature must
spend each of its actions moving closer to the baobhan
sith, and if it ends its movement or turn adjacent to
the fey, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal,
transmutation) The baobhan sith can transform into a
large raven, with the eﬀects from the bird option in the
aerial form spell (Core Rulebook 316).
Drink Blood Ȱɵ Requirements A bleeding creature is within
the baobhan sith’s reach; Eﬀect The baobhan sith tries to
Drink the Blood from the bleeding creature’s wounds. The
baobhan sith attempts an Athletics check against the victim’s
Fortitude DC. On a success, the victim becomes drained 1 and the
baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit
Points as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that’s already drained
doesn’t restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim’s
drained value by 1. A victim’s drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood
transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 Medicine check,
and suﬃcient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1.

OTHER COUATLS
The quetz couatl presented here is
the most common of its kind, and
while most adventurers and scholars
refer to them simply as “couatls,”
other kinds exist as well, such as
the ﬁerce xiuh couatl, the nomadic
auwaz couatl, the wise mix couatl,
the nurturing chicome couatl, and
the furious tletli couatl.
Couatl, Quetz
These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and good. Some
operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while others
operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they watch
over mortals and try to inﬂuence and aid them from the shadows, shifting from
plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz
couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while they
do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster peace
and cooperation with others.
Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green
scales. Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh
nearly a ton. They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the
occasional evil humanoid.

CRAWLING HAND ORIGINS
A popular tale among necromancers
tells of an ancient wizard who
traﬃcked in evil magic. During a
summoning ritual gone wrong, the
wizard’s hand became possessed
and later strangled them while they
slept. The hand dragged the corpse
across the wizard’s rooms to their
workbench, propped up a knife in a
vise, and severed itself from the rest
of the body. According to the story,
the hand went on to commit several
more murders and disappeared into
the sewers of a major metropolis,
never to be seen again. Some
necromancers believe that this
original crawling hand still creeps
through the shadows of that city,
killing as it pleases.
Crawling Hand
Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with
a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers.
Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an
appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the
Negative Energy Plane.
CRAWLING HAND
A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and
agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.

gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. The hand gains a +1 circumstance
bonus to Perception checks when it Seeks its quarry, to Survival checks when it

THE CURSE OF CRAWLEY JACK
The damnable curse of the culdewen
traces back to the First World, when
a bitter old culdewen named Crawley
Jack poached a ﬁsh from the pool
of a powerful fey noble. Short of
temper and feeling vindictive, the
noble doomed Crawley Jack’s people
to never consume another ﬁsh again.
Yet their desire to eat ﬁsh never
diminished. The curse’s punishment
is exacted in endless creative ways.
A culdewen’s catch might be rescued
by merfolk, stolen by skum, eaten
by nipping sharks, or carried away
on a piece of driftwood when the
culdewen’s boat is destroyed in a
storm or shipwreck.
Culdewen
Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of
appealing ﬁsh to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated
fey calls every living creature a “ﬁsh.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend
to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never ﬁnd satisfaction. Each
time they catch a ﬁsh, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot
to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace.
By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.
A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack
things with their oar, and shake their tiny ﬁsts at the sky. Conversation with a
culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of ﬁshing and the weather.
Capturing a “ﬁsh” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen
capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.

Culdewen’s Curse (curse, enchantment, primal) A culdewen that captures a creature is
compelled to immediately retreat to a secluded place to eat, typically journeying by
boat. The travel to the secluded place always takes at least 1 day. Their captive is cursed
to vanish on the journey—typically being lost in the water or consumed by aquatic
creatures—and can be recovered only by a wish spell or similarly powerful magic.

Hooked A creature struck by the culdewen’s ﬁsh hook is
skewered, taking 1d4 persistent bleed damage as long as
the hook remains stuck in it. The ﬁsh hook can be removed
only if a creature spends an Interact action and succeeds at a
DC 25 Athletics check to pull it free.
Land the Fish Ȱɵ Requirements A creature is hooked by the
culdewen’s ﬁsh hook and adjacent to the culdewen; Eﬀect The
culdewen hoists the creature over their shoulder, as though it
weighs no more than a ﬁsh. Unless the creature is unable to
act, the culdewen must attempt an Athletics check against the
creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.
While hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their
Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen’s curse above).
Reel In Ȱɵ (manipulate) The culdewen pulls the rope attached to their hook. If they
have no creature hooked, the ﬁsh hook returns to the culdewen’s hand. If a creature
is hooked, the culdewen attempts an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude
DC, pulling it up to 30 feet closer on a success (60 feet on a critical success).
Swear Ȱɵ (auditory, curse, enchantment, primal) The culdewen
unleashes a string of invectives. Each creature that hears them
must attempt a DC 25 Will save, with the eﬀects of mariner’s
curse and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Even on
a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day.

DRAINBERRY COLLECTIONS
As drainberry bushes sell their berries
to others, they collect coins and small
curios—such as a cameo depicting a fey
noble, a lock of golden hair knotted in
a complex pattern, or a ring inscribed
“To my dearest Memdaria.” Not all of
these baubles have monetary value,
but those that don’t certainly had
emotional value to the original owner.
Occasionally, drainberry bushes
accept intangible trade goods, such as
odes celebrating the bushes’ grandeur.
Drainberry Bush
Drainberry bushes are ﬂoating bushes that originate from the First World, with long,
thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly
siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn
consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a
faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.
Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense
of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their
berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes ﬁnds the plants
telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money
please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an
item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though
a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly
prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of signiﬁcantly lower value.

berries to grow among its branches. Each cluster of berries lasts
for 1 day, and a drainberry bush typically has 1d6+3 clusters when
encountered. When consumed, a cluster
restores 2d8+10 Hit Points. This eﬀect has

A creature can pluck a cluster of berries
with a successful unarmed Strike or

Drain Blood Ȱɵ Requirements The drainberry bush
has at least one living creature grabbed with one of its
vines; Eﬀect The bush’s hollow thorns siphon blood
from creatures it has grabbed. Each creature
must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take
2d8+10 damage and become drained 1 (double
damage and drained 2 on a critical failure). For
every creature damaged this way, a cluster of
blood berries (see above) immediately grows
along the bush’s branches.
Storm of Vines ʚʖ The drainberry bush makes up to
four vine Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These
attacks count toward the bush’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until after the bush makes all these attacks.

FIRE ELEMENTAL TREASURE
Often, nothing remains after
defeating a ﬁre elemental but a pile
of ashes and the fading smell of
smoke. But sometimes, fragments
of their elemental power remain
behind. At the GM’s discretion, a ﬁre
elemental can leave behind ashes,
lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering
cinders that are valuable components
for the construction of ﬁre-themed
magic items.
Elemental, Fire
Fire elementals sometimes incorporate burning materials into their being, or
possibly superheated materials such as molten rock or searing smoke.

FLY SPECIES
The giant ﬂy presented here is
but the most common of these
unsettlingly oversized pests. Others
can grow much larger, such as the
blood-drinking glutton ﬂy, the highly
toxic and foul-smelling blight ﬂy,
and the immensely bloated plague
ﬂy—a nauseating creature ironically
incapable of ﬂight that fattens itself
on undead ﬂesh and carries a host of
awful diseases.
Fly
Giant ﬂies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies
bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat
they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding
grounds for virulent diseases.
GIANT MAGGOT
Giant ﬂies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they
hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous
young who voraciously consume any ﬂesh in the immediate vicinity—typically
starting with the body upon which they were born.

FROG SPECIES
While all frogs are amphibious, some
frogs spend more of their time out of
the water. Even those usually found
near lakes and streams are adapted
for climbing. You can add variety
to frog encounters by replacing a
frog’s swim Speed with a climb Speed
(or even allowing it to have both).
Likewise, for frogs that are poisonous
or venomous, the speciﬁc eﬀects
of their toxin can vary by species,
with exposure to some frog poison
causing a creature to become clumsy
or stupeﬁed instead of enfeebled.

ALIEN ORIGINS
Froghemoths have been known to
suddenly abandon an established lair
to seek a new home, as if in response
to some cosmic convergence or
subspace signal imperceptible to
other creatures. Some argue that
the froghemoth is never fully
comfortable in any environment
because it isn’t from this world at
all, and that these wanderings are
instinctual urges to seek out its true
home—a home not represented by
the strange world in which the beast
ﬁnds itself trapped.
Froghemoth
A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth
is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote
Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a
frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its
eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.

can sever the tongue with a successful
Strike against AC 31 that deals at least 15
slashing damage. This deals no damage
to the froghemoth but prevents it
from using its tongue Strike until
it regrows its tongue, which
takes 1 minute.
Flailing Tentacles ʚʖ The

increase until after all the attacks.

ILL-ADVISED TRAININGS
While many have tried to train
gorgons as mounts or beasts of war,
the combination of their notoriously
short tempers and the diﬃculty
in containing the eﬀects of their
petrifying breath make this a diﬃcult
task. In most cases, those who
attempt to domesticate gorgons
end up creating untamed gorgon
breeding grounds.
Gorgon
Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic,
interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a
creature of ﬂesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a
charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are
dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become
especially deadly.
Gorgons typically subsist on petriﬁed ﬂesh or fossils. These supernatural
beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they ﬁnd
raw stone ﬂavorless, so it’s not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons
use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the
resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks
with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetriﬁed organic material,
and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such
discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures
even more ill tempered than usual—much to the chagrin of anyone they
subsequently encounter.
Gorgon ﬂesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and
aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs ﬁnd off-putting. Creatures with a close
association to earth and stone are more likely to ﬁnd the ﬂavor appetizing;
stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be
delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures,
consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a
physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with
gorgon ﬂesh can ﬁnd renown for their skill in creating
palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.

DOMINION PLOTS
While Golarion largely survived
the events of the Doomsday Dawn,
the threat of the Dominion of the
Black is far from over. This alien
conglomerate recognizes that it
needs to understand the vastness
of humanoids in the universe to
better enact their plans, and certain
nihilistic scholars suggest that the
Doomsday Dawn was never intended
to end the world, but instead served
its primary goal of setting the
stage for an even more devastating
invasion from the Dominion in the
near future.
Gosreg
Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into
humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as
spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting
plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.
In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy
legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to inﬁltrate
societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately
compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their
brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of
the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.

GREMLIN MINIONS
Most know better than to employ
gremlins, so when the fey creatures
live side-by-side with others, it’s often
as parasites and unwelcome guests.
Imaginative and sinister folk who ﬁnd
themselves infested sometimes catch
the gremlins and release them in the
homes of their enemies.
Gremlin
The mischievous fey known as gremlins seem to come in endless varieties with
differing appearances. Preferring to destroy rather than to build, gremlins almost
never construct their own homes, instead infesting tunnels and abandoned buildings.
They augment these lairs with cruel traps, and sometimes trained animals (often
ones considered pests by humanoids). Gremlin lairs are generally near a city or
village (whether on the surface or in the Darklands) that provides them with a ready
source of food, trap-building materials, and, of course, victims for entertainment.
There is little difference in appearance between male and female gremlins, and
many observers wrongly assume that they are single-gender or genderless. Gremlins
are proliﬁc breeders, and a handful can quickly become a mob. Young gremlins are
raised communally—a necessity, as they exhibit the urge to cause mischief from
birth. They grow quickly and reach full size in a matter of weeks.
VEXGIT
These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that
clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the
works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An
individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or
remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become ﬁlled
with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding
violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.
Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and
other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they’re unable
to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a
maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.
Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger
groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with
additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained
giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in
vexgit lairs.

GRIMSTALKER FORESTRY
Grimstalkers often harvest the seeds
of carnivorous plants, particularly
assassin vines, which they sow
during their wanderings. Typically
they seed their territory’s borders
with these dangerous plants as a
defense tactic, but they also sow
gardens and ﬁelds, weaponizing
these plots of land against hapless
gardeners and farmers.
Grimstalker
These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and
slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they
prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work
to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature
can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy
to perform nature’s dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters,
and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or
travel within.
Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown ﬂesh
gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a
thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of
their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that
often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny
plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, ﬁlling roles that
pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these “pets”
poorly at best.
There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the
most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or
weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps
shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company
worth keeping.
Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets.
They surround enemies ﬁrst, then work to unnerve them by knocking on
trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry.
Of course, a band of grimstalkers won’t stay together for long, quickly
succumbing to bickering and inﬁghting. These violent arguments
are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each
grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more
powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers
from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that
this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afﬂicted fey
who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it’s just
part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered,
confrontational, and bitter.

GIANT GRINDYLOWS
While most grindylows are Small, a
minute percentage of these creatures
keep growing throughout their lives.
Those that become Large or larger
gain the giant trait and often become
champions of their schools.
Grindylow
The top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but from the waist
down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles. They dwell
mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers, coastal
regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging
from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be
brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances
last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving
grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own.
Grindylows aren’t territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build
permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until
driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of
seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters
that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.
Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred
for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-
infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in
hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay,
it can also backﬁre, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated
attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship’s route becomes predictable.
This hatred of squids does not extend to
other tentacled creatures; grindylows
consider octopuses to be the
epitome of grace and power.

A HISTORY OF NEUTRALITY
Grippli villages rarely get involved in
the concerns of other communities,
preferring to focus on maintaining
relative peace within their own
small societies. Legends explain
this attitude with a tale of a grippli
champion who dragged his people
into a war between humans and
charau-kas. The stories diﬀer as to
which side the gripplis took, but every
version ends with the bloody deaths
of the hero and his family. Since that
time, village elders claim, gripplis have
done their best to remain far from the
conﬂicts of others.
Grippli
Gripplis make their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests. These
frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized
eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow
them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with
their physiologies inﬂuenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live
in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes.
In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown
coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and
orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately
30 pounds.
Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers.
Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don’t maintain typical
farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and
gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis
hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of
giant dragonﬂies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly
enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger
ﬂying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The
rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however,
so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as
local heroes.
Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly
dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden
platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad
leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages,
making them especially difﬁcult to spot from the forest ﬂoor,
and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that
only they can navigate.
Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts
of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the
settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or
agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on
ﬁnesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.

GRODAIR TREASURE
Amid the vile, rubbery entrails of
an exploded grodair is a bizarre
cluster of tubular organs about the
size of a melon that serves as its
extradimensional water storage.
Harvesting the organ cluster
takes 5 minutes and a successful
DC 22 Survival check. For the next
2d6 hours, the cluster can then be
used produce either the “stream” or
the “fountain” eﬀect of a decanter of
endless water (Core Rulebook 573).
On a critical failure to harvest the
organ cluster, it bursts and deals 2d6
bludgeoning damage to the harvester.
Grodair
Grodairs are bizarre ﬁshlike creature native to the First World. Their supernatural
physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of
storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create
a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly
transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish
to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When
necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long,
ﬂeshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies.
Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes
the creatures difﬁcult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During
conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difﬁculty
remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing
tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they
aren’t reliable. They have difﬁculty following plans or schedules, and they can
keep a secret only if they happen to forget it ﬁrst. For these reasons, grodairs
don’t always make the best allies.
Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in
fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that
they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their
throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them
for consumption at a later time.

CATS AND DOGS
If there’s one thing more certain to
infuriate a hellcat other than to treat
it as a mere animal, that is to compare
it in any way to a hell hound. Hellcats
consider hell hounds little more than
vermin infesting the hellscapes they
call home, and enjoy torturing them
more than any other creature.
Hellcat
Hellcats are devious predators native to the ﬁery pits of Hell. While the ﬁendish
creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and
dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with
transparent ﬂesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet
long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and
stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As ﬁendish creatures, they do not require
mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inﬂicting
pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being
treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may ﬁnd themself
made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate
elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.
Though they can’t speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate
by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much
except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of
their diabolic masters.
Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up
against foes they’re unable to reach, but they never forget prey that
escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies,
including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes
against their foes.

HIPPOGRIFF EGGS
Rather than birthing live young,
hippogriﬀs lay a clutch consisting of
only a single egg. Hippogriﬀ eggs are
sought after by potential trainers and
opportunists alike.
Hippogriff
With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magniﬁcence of a powerful
horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps
the creation of a ﬂesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of
their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above
their favored plains or hill country.
Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather
coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have
managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their
torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are
colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or
even palomino coloration.
Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their
equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies
above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and
wyverns. Only hippogriffs’ superior speed helps protect them from
these predators.
Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and ﬁercely protect the
lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands,
rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their
homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb
the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid.
Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal
to aid in digestion.
Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both
ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set
bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs
frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote
outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer,
elk, and bears.
However, other communities train hippogriffs from
hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—
the most notable among these groups in the Inner
Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-
state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult
hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more
difﬁcult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat
techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount,
ﬁghting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement
of their companion’s wings.

CRYSTAL VAULTS
Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts
too dangerous to be left where those
hungry for power might seize them.
Only they know what items of myth
and legend, long thought lost or
destroyed, lie within their crystal
vaults. They are unreliable guardians
of religious artifacts, however, which
usually disgust them.
Jyoti
Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they ﬁnd insulting) by the
ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane.
They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains
on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and
religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force
that, from the jyotis’ perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to ﬁsh.
Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their
homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the
palaces of crystallized light and captured ﬂame in which they dwell. They often chase
even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire,
for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis’ full wrath is reserved for
natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise
of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to
oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.

MUDWRETCH LIFESTYLES
Mudwretches are rarely encountered
alone. They inhabit swampy patches
in small groups, often gathering
near the ruins of sites that once held
great signiﬁcance. Mudwretches can
remain dormant for centuries, always
eager to lurch up to attack passersby.
They’re usually more interested
in defending territory than killing
intruders, and they won’t pursue
victims for long if they ﬂee.
Mudwretch
In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped
at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches,
though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy ﬂesh upon itself to form
a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature’s
general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies
or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They
have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries
out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from
living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than
one that’s comfortably wallowing on a river bank.

SLIME MOLD FUNGI
The particularly foul environments
in which slime molds dwell are
conducive to the growth of extremely
potent and dangerous mushrooms
and other fungi. A dead slime mold
can be a source of enough materials
to produce a few doses of deathcap
powder or other types of poison.
Some creatures, such as deros or
those with inherent immunity to
disease, cultivate slime molds in order
to harvest these materials.
the amoeba’s body. This thereafter has the same eﬀect as if the amoeba had Engulfed
the creature (DC 17, 1d6 acid, Escape DC 17, Rupture 3).
Weak Acid As amoeba swarm.
SLIME MOLD
A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick
layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares
a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive
system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains
perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with
disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with
a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horriﬁc disease that painfully breaks
down a victim’s ﬂesh. At ﬁrst, the disease manifests as painful rashes and
agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the ﬂesh of the affected creature
actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature’s spores continue
to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open
and release a brand new slime mold.

GRAY OOZE
These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes,
or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or
patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims
to reach down for a drink or step into what
appears to be a puddle, then lash out
with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare
and consume their hapless prey.

EATING HABITS
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals
by devouring their prey whole. After
incapacitating a creature, a snake
unhinges its jaw and consumes the
creature entirely, even if it’s more
than twice the diameter of the
snake’s body. A snake can consume
a creature of the same size as itself
or smaller, but most snakes are logy
and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snake
Snakes of some variety thrive in every non-arctic ecosystem, each with their own
particular hunting patterns and defense mechanisms.
SEA SNAKE
These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-foot-
long, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey.
Tales speak of massive sea snakes that swim in deeper waters and follow ships,
waiting for sailors to fall overboard or climbing the side to snatch them from the deck.

STYGIRA GEMS
The gem a stygira carries does not
need to be particularly valuable,
but some stygiras prefer to use
more expensive gems as an
aﬀectation. More powerful stygiras
have developed methods of using
particularly expensive gems to
enhance their gem gaze ability,
allowing some to charm those they
gaze upon, light them on ﬁre, or even
aﬄict them with crippling poison.
Stygira
Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures
command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the
subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even
gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware
of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient
empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left
behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean
mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.
Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the
stony, scarred ﬂesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through
their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these ﬂashing glimpses, so
they keep to their caves during the day and
wander into the world above only after
nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out
unwary travelers or explorers to capture and
reduce them down to the base chemicals and
supernatural humors the stygiras require to
infuse gemstones with the capacity to give
them sight and magical power.

The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or become frightened 1
(frightened 2 on a critical failure).
Stone Curse (curse, primal, transmutation) Wounds dealt by the stygira’s
claws leave the ﬂesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from
them dark gray. Each time a creature is damaged by the stygira’s claw
Strike, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become permanently
slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its ﬂesh stiﬀens like stone. If
a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the stygira’s claw Strike and
fails the saving throw against stone curse, it is petriﬁed. A creature
that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving
throw to remove the eﬀects of stone curse, even if it has
been petriﬁed.

FLESH SCULPTORS
Some totenmaskes craft macabre
“art” by shaping the ﬂesh of their
victims, spending hours, days, or
even weeks molding a victim’s skin,
or even fusing multiple creatures
together into one piece. The
horrifying results of this process can
take the form of furniture made from
ﬂesh that still lives and breathes,
“sculptures” that in no way resemble
the human form, and even more
twisted and depraved things.
Totenmaske
Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them
when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most self-
indulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these
foul undead can drain the very ﬂesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves
in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants.
Totenmaskes’ speciﬁc longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink,
while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a
mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the
sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is
what helped condemn it to unlife in the ﬁrst place. A totenmaske obsessed with
food, for example, might ﬁnd itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain
totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and
switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.

Fortitude save (sickened 2 and drained 2 on a critical failure).
Living Form Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
The totenmaske takes the appearance of a Medium or
smaller humanoid creature. This is either its form
from before it became undead, or the form of
the last creature it successfully hit with Drink
Flesh. This doesn’t change the totenmaske’s
Speed or the attack and damage bonuses for its
Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Shape Flesh (curse, divine, necromancy) After spending
1 minute in contact with a paralyzed, unconscious,
or willing creature, a totenmaske can reshape the
target’s face, causing ﬂesh to cover vital features.
The target can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save
to resist; a critical success grants temporary
immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours. Each
time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses
one feature: ears (target becomes deafened),
eyes (target becomes blinded), mouth (target
can’t speak or eat), or nose (target can’t
smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth
sealed can’t breathe and begins to suﬀocate (Core
Rulebook 478). Changes are permanent until reversed
by removing this curse, or the sealed ﬂesh can be
surgically opened with a DC 25 Medicine check that takes
1d4 rounds and deals 1d6 slashing damage per round.

TWIGJACK BRAMBLES
Sometimes groups of twigjacks
gather and form temporary
communities called “brambles,”
usually to aid in times of need for
the forest or to enact some great
vengeance. These groups can
consist of anywhere from three to
30 twigjacks. Once their task is
complete, the twigjacks go their
separate ways.
Twigjack
Maladjusted forest denizens, twigjacks form from the cruel and prankish
combination of fey and the very woods in which they reside. A twigjack’s body  is
made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike
hair, tops a twigjack’s head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken
sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from
the creature’s body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of
twigjacks living in the undergrowth.
While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider
to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their
wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and
travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However,
they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When
sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the
area eagerly arrive to ﬁght, even if they were not invited.
Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often
mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they
have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks
resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they
embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks
go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures
they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of
a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only
to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey
seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but
some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness
the twigjacks’ violent urges and disruptive
behavior for their own purposes.
While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often
found in the First World, it’s somewhat curious that
those twigjacks who ﬁnd religion only rarely turn to
the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend
to worship false deities of their own design: ﬁgures
spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth,
or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions
are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support
clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.

Worm That Walks
When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and a
remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with eldritch
magic, a strange phenomenon can occur. The decaying body fattens and
instructs the very worms that feast upon it. These grave worms thrive not
only on the consumption of the spellcaster’s dead ﬂesh, but on their corrupt
memories and magical power. The spellcaster’s very soul is consumed in this
vile process, only to be split apart into fragments that inhabit each of the
individual worms. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known
as a worm that walks—a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the
body that granted it this new existence and can use the powers and magic
the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a
spellcaster before its death, but it is not undead—it is a hideous new form of
undulant life.
CREATING A WORM THAT WALKS
You can turn an existing evil, living, spellcasting creature into a worm that
walks using the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 It gains the aberration and swarm traits and usually remains evil.
•	 Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
•	 Reduce its Hit Points by the amount listed on the table (to a minimum of 2
HP per level).
•	 The worm that walks gains fast healing, resistance to physical damage, and
weakness to area damage and splash damage as indicated in the table. These
abilities are the reason the worm that walks has fewer HP.

WORM THAt WALKS ABILItIES
A worm that walks loses any abilities that came from its previous physical form
and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. It retains
any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the
abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conﬂict with the
monster’s new theme as a worm that walks.
Darkvision
Tremorsense 30 feet (imprecise)
Immunities All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision,
and unconscious. They also have the swarm mind ability, which makes them immune
to mental eﬀects that target a speciﬁc number of creatures, though they are still
subject to mental eﬀects that aﬀect all creatures in an area.
All-Around Vision
Discorporate When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the
component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single
worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that
typically takes 1d10 days.
While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm
that walks’s foes have to dispatch the ﬂeeing worms before they escape, usually its
foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area eﬀect
or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed.
After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing
the damage must attempt a DC 15 ﬂat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage

WORMS REDEEMED
In rare situations, once a spellcaster
rises as a worm that walks it might
recant its evil ways, given the right
inﬂuence and enough time. Many
of these worms that walk seek self-
destruction, not out of abhorrence at
their new form but at the realization
of the evils they wrought while alive.
Others, though, take advantage of
their second chance and use their
new life to help undo the ruin and
horror they might have aﬄicted upon
the world in their prior existence.
eﬀect performed on the area reduces the DC of this ﬂat check by 2, to a minimum of
DC 5. If any of these ﬂat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm
that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping
or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to ﬁnish oﬀ the worm
that walks.
Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with
reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as
the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should
deal three-quarters of that damage.
Squirming Embrace Ȱɵ The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a
space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an
additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a
basic Reﬂex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2.
Swarm Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm
of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While
discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions
and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small
enough for its individual worms to ﬁt without having
to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back
into its normal form.
WORM THAT WALKS
This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One
Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and
strives to further its evil plots in its new life.
