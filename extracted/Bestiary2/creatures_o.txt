SOUL GEMS AS GEAR
Daemons often carry soul gems
either as trophies or for powering
an ability. Cacodaemons (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 70) are the most common
source for soul gems, but they can
also be created by spells like bind
soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem
to power an ability, the trapped soul
is released into the afterlife and can
be resurrected normally.
OLETHRODAEMON (APOCALYPSE DAEMON)
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for
creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
of an even greater being: a mysterious ﬁfth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying
enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing
eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns,
olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.

SIGNS OF MURDER
Babaus revel in their art and often
leave behind a grim token or marker
as a signature. They may leave a
distinctive mutilation upon the
bodies of their victims, rather than
harvesting keepsakes and trophies
for a personal collection. Babaus
want their legacy to grow among
those they hunt and kill.
Demon
The living embodiment of mortal souls obsessed with sin and empowered by the
Abyss, demons are armed and armored by their prior lives’ obsessions.
BABAU (BLOOD DEMON)
The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits,
yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus
form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal
murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.

when wounds are healed, they recoil in

that the babau dealt on their last turn
with Grievous Strike, sneak attack, or a

damage. The babau can take this mental
damage only once per round.

horriﬁc and gory wound. The babau makes a melee Strike. This counts
as two attacks when calculating the daemon’s multiple attack penalty. If
this Strike hits, the babau deals an additional 2d6 damage of the same
damage type, and the creature struck is frightened 2.
Sneak Attack The babau’s Strikes deal an extra 2d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.

DOPRILLU MASKS
A doprillu’s stylized mask isn’t a part
of the creature itself, though doprillus
inherently understand the mask’s
purpose and power. When born,
doprillus start out weak and small.
Once one matures and gains suﬃcient
intelligence and manual dexterity, it
carves its personal mask. The ﬁrst
time it dons the mask, the doprillu
rushes out to seek a ﬁght. This mask
is never replaced, and it might be
marred from hundreds of battles.
Doprillu
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate
masks at all times that ﬁll their wearers with magical strength and ﬁghting spirit.
Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On
neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when
a doprillu’s home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As beﬁts the
superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations:
hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.

Mask of Power A doprillu’s unique wooden mask is the source of its power. A
doprillu deprived of its mask loses its regeneration and its immunity to
enfeebled and slowed, and it immediately becomes enfeebled 1. The
enfeebled value increases by 1 at the start of each of the doprillu’s
turns, to a maximum of enfeebled 4. If the mask is put back on, the
doprillu immediately regains its abilities and loses the enfeebled
condition. A creature can pull oﬀ the mask with a successful DC 34

ONI SHAPECHANGERS
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one
speciﬁc appearance. An ogre mage can
assume only one speciﬁc ogre form,
while an ice yai can appear only as
one speciﬁc frost giant. Some oni have
greater control over their shapeshifting
power and can assume the form of any
humanoid creature, and these oni tend
to be the most dangerous.

the appearance of an ogre. This doesn’t change their Speed or Strike attack and damage.
ICE YAI
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More
than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the ﬂesh, but in ﬂesh
itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice
yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into
powerful ﬁghting machines.

GENIEKIN ON GOLARION
While most geniekin planar scions
live on their genie parent’s ancestral
plane, rare fonts of elemental power
or genie activity sometimes give
rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far,
geniekin are most commonly found
in Katapesh, as genies are more
prevalent there than other regions
due to the inﬂuence of genie binders.
claims help to bolster those they travel with. Suli from regions other than deserts
adjust their names to match their terrains, but regardless of whether they prefer
forests, hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.

SYLPH
Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar
scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions
between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but
they are prone to ﬂights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.
Sylphs are notorious for their practice of “listening to the wind,” which
most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means
much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to
them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs
may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others,
most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying
connected to the world around them while still keeping it
comfortably at arm’s length. Certainly the typical sylph
sneak doesn’t seek to use what they learn for ill, but
instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized
or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.

SPIRAL CENTURION GLITCHES
A spiral centurion might have one of
the following glitches.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals
only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
 Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up,
and if it Strides more than once per
round, it takes 1d10 damage.
 Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same
actions each round, regardless of
the circumstances.
Spiral Centurion
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient
and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they
resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies
take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting
down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a
password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of
time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or
a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions
besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only
staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still,
millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches
or malfunctions.

Top-Heavy
A
spiral
centurion’s
top‑like design makes it susceptible
to eﬀects that would cause it to fall
prone. The DC of any attempt to knock
the spiral centurion prone is reduced
by 5. If the spiral centurion attempts
a check or saving throw to resist being
knocked prone, it takes a –5 status penalty. A
spiral centurion that has been knocked prone can’t use any actions other
than to attempt to Stand, but it must succeed at a DC 30 Acrobatics
check to do so.
Speed 40 feet
Melee Ȱɵ blade +23 (agile, sweep), Damage 2d12+12

Hurl Blade ʚʖ The spiral centurion hurls one of its
blades with an angled spin to ensure a swooping
ﬂight path. The blade deals 6d6 slashing damage
to each creature in a 40-foot line (DC 30 basic Reﬂex
save). At the start of the spiral centurion’s next turn, the
blade swoops around and returns along the same ﬂight path,
again dealing 6d6 slashing damage (DC 30 basic Reﬂex save) to
each creature along the same line.
Rev Up Ȱɵ Requirements The spiral centurion has not acted yet this turn; Eﬀect The
spiral centurion Strides up to its Speed. It then gains a +2 circumstance bonus to
attack and damage rolls until the end of its turn.
Trample ̂ˬ Medium or smaller, blade, DC 30
Whirling Death ̂ˬ The spiral centurion spins furiously in place, its blades extended
to slice through nearby creatures. It makes up to five melee blade Strikes. No
single creature can be targeted by more than one blade Strike during one use
of this ability. These attacks count toward the spiral centurion’s multiple attack
penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks
are made.

DESPICABLE ORIGINS
Velstracs originated with the ﬁrst
debased thoughts of mortals, which
divine beings found so deplorable
that they locked all velstracs away
in Hell. It wasn’t long, however,
before the newly formed beings
escaped their infernal prison to the
Shadow Plane.
Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal ﬂesh-sculptors or serving as
wardens of horriﬁc dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may
serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for
mortal’s souls or choice mortal ﬂesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans,
although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh
350 pounds or more.

Unnerving Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. When a
creature ends its turn in the aura, it sees the face of a departed loved one in place
of the evangelist’s face. The creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become
frightened 2 (frightened 3 on a critical failure).
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ chain +17 (disarm, evil, magical, reach 10 feet, trip), Damage
2d8+7 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed and impaling chain
Animate Chains (divine, transmutation) Chains in the evangelist’s
vicinity sprout barbs and writhe menacingly. The evangelist can
make chain Strikes against any creature that is adjacent to an
unattended chain within 20 feet, in addition to those within the
reach of the evangelist’s chain Strike.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual)
The evangelist stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The
target must immediately attempt a Will save against unnerving
gaze. In addition, if the creature was already frightened, on a failed
save, the evangelist is concealed from the creature for as long as the
creature remains frightened. After attempting this save, the creature
is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist’s next turn.
Impaling Chain When the evangelist critically hits with a chain Strike,
the target is impaled and anchored in place, becoming grabbed by
the chain. The creature is unable to recover from persistent bleed
damage until it gets free (DC 25 Escape).
SACRISTAN
Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures
whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken
by the velstracs’ torments. These unfortunates are
assembled from scrap metal, nerveless ﬂesh, and
bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic
pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans
are empowered by a miniature gateway to the
Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending
their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and
windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in
appearance but are the size of maimed humans.
Their features are redundant or absent and they are
wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.
