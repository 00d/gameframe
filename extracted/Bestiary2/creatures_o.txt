SOUL GEMS AS GEAR
Daemons often carry soul gems
either as trophies or for powering
an ability. Cacodaemons (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 70) are the most common
source for soul gems, but they can
also be created by spells like bind
soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem
to power an ability, the trapped soul
is released into the afterlife and can
be resurrected normally.
OLETHRODAEMON (APOCALYPSE DAEMON)
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for
creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
of an even greater being: a mysterious ﬁfth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying
enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing
eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns,
olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.

SIGNS OF MURDER
Babaus revel in their art and often
leave behind a grim token or marker
as a signature. They may leave a
distinctive mutilation upon the
bodies of their victims, rather than
harvesting keepsakes and trophies
for a personal collection. Babaus
want their legacy to grow among
those they hunt and kill.
Demon
The living embodiment of mortal souls obsessed with sin and empowered by the
Abyss, demons are armed and armored by their prior lives’ obsessions.
BABAU (BLOOD DEMON)
The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist—certainly not unusual traits,
yet their penchant for stealth and surprise sets them apart from their kin. Babaus
form from mortal souls of lone killers—those who took pleasure in more personal
murders, and particularly those with grisly patterns to their killings.

HELLMOUTHS
While travel to and from Hell is
possible with plane shift, another
way to reach and traverse the
infernal realms is via hellmouths,
strange living portals connecting
diﬀerent layers or even diﬀerent
planes. A hellmouth takes the form
of a grimacing face, distended
maw, or other distressingly organic
aperture, and no two share the
same appearance. Most are carefully
guarded, but some new or well-hidden
hellmouths have yet to be discovered.

Sadistic Strike An osyluth deals an extra 2d6 damage whenever they
Strike an enfeebled, frightened, or prone creature.
Stygian Inquisitor Ȱɵ (linguistic, mental) The osyluth telepathically
questions a creature aﬀected by zone of truth. After 1
round, if the creature intentionally refuses to answer
the question, it takes 2d6 mental damage.
Tail Sweep Ȱɵ The osyluth sweeps their tail in
a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone
must succeed at a DC 26 Reﬂex save or be

HAMATULA (BARBED DEVIL)
Hamatulas are forged in Erebus to
protect infernal vaults from those
foolish enough to try to rob the
archdevil Mammon. In case the
vicious spines protruding from their
bodies and ability to teleport weren’t
deadly enough, they are also clever
wielders of warding glyphs. They are
effective conjured guardians, though
they resent being pulled away from
their duties in Hell. Unlike most ﬁends,
hamatulas are formed from several souls
that lack any features distinctive enough to
merit another role.

Large or smaller creature hit by this attack must succeed at
a DC 16 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1 round.
ORCA
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually
the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt
together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true
whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh
8,000–12,000 pounds.

Breach ʚʖ The orca Swims up to its swim Speed, then
Leaps vertically out of the water up to 25 feet in the
air, making a Strike against a creature at any point
during the jump (this lets it attack a creature within
30 feet of the water’s surface). After the Strike, the orca splashes back down into
the water.

DOPRILLU MASKS
A doprillu’s stylized mask isn’t a part
of the creature itself, though doprillus
inherently understand the mask’s
purpose and power. When born,
doprillus start out weak and small.
Once one matures and gains suﬃcient
intelligence and manual dexterity, it
carves its personal mask. The ﬁrst
time it dons the mask, the doprillu
rushes out to seek a ﬁght. This mask
is never replaced, and it might be
marred from hundreds of battles.
Doprillu
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate
masks at all times that ﬁll their wearers with magical strength and ﬁghting spirit.
Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On
neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when
a doprillu’s home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As beﬁts the
superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations:
hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.

# OOZE MEPHIT

OOZE MEPHIT
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants,
shamelessly ﬂattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although
their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting
targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ochercolored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell
disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.

save). The ooze mephit can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
STEAM MEPHIT
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They
are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in
shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even
when they aren’t bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from
their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.

ONI SHAPECHANGERS
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one
speciﬁc appearance. An ogre mage can
assume only one speciﬁc ogre form,
while an ice yai can appear only as
one speciﬁc frost giant. Some oni have
greater control over their shapeshifting
power and can assume the form of any
humanoid creature, and these oni tend
to be the most dangerous.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The onidoshi takes on
the appearance of an ogre. This doesn’t change their Speed or Strike attack and damage.
ICE YAI
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More
than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the ﬂesh, but in ﬂesh
itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice
yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into
powerful ﬁghting machines.

EXTRAPLANAR HUMANOIDS
An important distinction exists
between planar scions and extraplanar
humanoids, such as fetchlings.
Fetchlings and other extraplanar
humanoids represent true ancestral
groups with their own physical and
cultural identities and traditions.
Planar scions are members of diverse
ancestries who share a similar
inheritance from extraplanar beings
and, with exception of marids, typically
integrate into other humanoid societies
instead of building their own.
with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and
ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to
each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural
splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they
are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random
direction, departing with only their hope that they’ll discover whatever mystery
lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads ﬁnd that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in
such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also ﬁnd time
to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a speciﬁc portion of a fortiﬁcation or a remote
location on a wilderness trail.

SULI
Because their genie forebears are native to the Material
Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large
the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are
often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring
harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.
Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other
geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful
pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or
humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that
bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffedup ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution
easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis’ boasts not
only glorify themselves, but also secure their
companions’ and families’ accomplishments
in history, with the ultimate goal of
spinning stories that will be retold for
generations. This is especially true
for sulis who have lived with other
geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a
strong connection to an Elemental Plane.
Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek
to integrate with other humanoid societies. They work
to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their

GENIEKIN ON GOLARION
While most geniekin planar scions
live on their genie parent’s ancestral
plane, rare fonts of elemental power

rise to geniekin on Golarion. By far,
geniekin are most commonly found
in Katapesh, as genies are more
prevalent there than other regions
due to the inﬂuence of genie binders.

forests, hills, or arctic plains, their boasts remain as compelling.

These terrifying creatures grow as large as elephants. The placement

SPIRAL CENTURION GLITCHES
A spiral centurion might have one of
the following glitches.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals
only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
 Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up,
and if it Strides more than once per
round, it takes 1d10 damage.
 Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same
actions each round, regardless of
the circumstances.
Spiral Centurion
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient
and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they
resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies
take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting
down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a
password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of
time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or
a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions
besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only
staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still,
millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches
or malfunctions.

VELSTRAC DIVINITIES
The most powerful velstracs are
unique divinities known collectively
as velstrac demagogues—powerful
creatures worshipped by those
mortals who seek to experience
agonizing new revelations and
gain power by enhancing the body
through pain.
OSTIARIUS
Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the Shadow
Plane and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world
of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs—
from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of
the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and
they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found
in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals
range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.

Compel Courage Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment,

themself by whispering words of courage from their wounds.
The ostiarius and their allies in a 50-foot emanation gain a +1
status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear eﬀects.
The ostiarius can Sustain Compel Courage. Non-velstracs who accept this
compelled courage ﬁnd bleeding wounds opening on their own bodies to
whisper in thanks. They take 1 persistent bleed damage and can’t attempt
a ﬂat check to end this damage as long as they’re compelled.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The ostiarius
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against whispering wounds. In addition, if the creature was
already sickened and fails its save, the creature is fascinated by the ostiarius and
can’t use hostile actions. This fascination lasts for 1 round or until the ostiarius takes
any hostile action against the creature or the creature’s allies. Whether the creature
succeeds at or fails the save, it is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
EVANGELIST
Evangelists, the velstracs’ unofﬁcial ambassadors, roam the farthest reaches
of the planes to spread the word of their kind’s abhorrent belief in perfection
through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the

DESPICABLE ORIGINS
Velstracs originated with the ﬁrst
debased thoughts of mortals, which
divine beings found so deplorable
that they locked all velstracs away
in Hell. It wasn’t long, however,
before the newly formed beings
escaped their infernal prison to the
Shadow Plane.
Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal ﬂesh-sculptors or serving as
wardens of horriﬁc dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may
serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for
mortal’s souls or choice mortal ﬂesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans,
although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh
350 pounds or more.
