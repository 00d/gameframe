REZLARABREN
A series of underwater caverns
on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound
Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren’s
lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini
who labor as miners. Her relationship
with the Linnorm Kings is complex,
and whether she views them as allies
or enemies depends on her mood.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their
lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside
grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed,
or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel
safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of
offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged
from sunken ships.

ZANEMBIS
While most cloud dragons prefer
solitude and avoid confrontations,
Zanembis is an excellent example of
how failed dragonslaying attempts
can create problems. Previously
content to dwell atop Angel Peak in
the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud
dragon has grown vengeful and
violent in the wake of unexpected and
unjustiﬁed attacks on his lair.
creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other
true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon’s
penchant for living in the moment is not a personality ﬂaw—they’re more than
capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won’t make foolish
choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have
little interest in worrying about the future and are as conﬁdent in their ability to
handle tomorrow’s problems as they are today’s.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural
result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended
periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather
a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a
cloud dragon, a diversiﬁed hoard is a perfect hoard.

PRIMAL DRAGON HOARDS
Primal dragons may hail from other
planes of existence than chromatic or
metallic dragons, but they share one
thing in common with those types—
an obsession with treasure. Speciﬁc
details on the types of treasures each
category of primal dragon favors are
detailed in their respective entries
on the following pages; beyond
those broad guidelines, the treasures
in a dragon’s hoard should match
the themes of that type of dragon.
A brine dragon’s treasures should
have nautical themes to them, for
example, while an umbral dragon
would have collected treasures
of grim and shadowy nature; a
crystal dragon focuses on gemstone
valuables, and a cloud dragon seeks
items that grant ﬂight or produce an
exotic scent. Of them all, the magma
dragon’s treasure hoards are most
akin to that of the classic dragon—
provided the items collected can
survive at the blazing temperatures
that tend to be present in these
dragons’ volcanic dens!
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The dragon breathes a thundercloud
that deals 11d6 electricity damage in a 40-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save). They
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Cloud Walk The cloud dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ The dragon makes two claw Strikes and one horn Strike in any order.
Draconic Momentum The dragon recharges their Breath Weapon whenever they score
a critical hit with a Strike.

QLIPPOTH AND DEMONS
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons
and still see themselves as its rightful
rulers. When the Abyss ﬁrst began to
spawn demons from the souls of sinful
humanoids, the realm was plunged
into a brutal war spanning untold
millennia, in which qlippoth, though
more powerful and established, were
slowly but surely driven back by the
endless demonic hordes who spawned
far more quickly than qlippoth could
ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth
have been driven to the deepest,
darkest corners of the Abyss where
they cling tightly to the crumbling
remains of their territory.
Qlippoth
Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in
the Abyss, qlippoth ruled the Outer Rifts. These inimical creatures are a form of
primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well.
Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through
the Abyss, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest reaches of the Abyss, and
they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet rather than directly oppose
demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless
war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might
be turned back.
CYTHNIGOT
The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of
small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the
ﬂeshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything
else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot’s most identifying feature is
the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature’s body, ending in a
surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.

RECOVERY FROM THRALLDOM
A creature that’s transformed into a
yellow musk thrall or brute doesn’t
die right away, although it no longer
retains its personality, memories,
or abilities as long as it exists as a
thrall. Within the ﬁrst few days after
its transformation, a thrall or brute
can be restored to its normal life with
any magical eﬀect that can remove
disease or a 1-hour procedure that
requires a successful DC 22 Medicine
(expert) check and deals
2d6 slashing damage to the
thrall or brute.
creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation
takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions:
bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few
days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead
within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper
within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.

YETH HOUND ALLIES
When an evil cult engages the
services of a yeth hound, the
process is more like forging an
alliance than animal training. Yeth
hound allies can provide much more
complex services than a typical
animal, but they also present the
risk of possible treachery.
Yeth Hound
Wicked canine creatures who live for the thrill of the hunt, yeth hounds often
serve evil masters as guardians and trackers. Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek
dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the
ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent,
although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate
tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside
when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten
and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a
dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to
corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their
lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from
the hounds’ previous meals.
Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt
only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a
subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their
prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight,
working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when
then can’t simply overpower and kill them.
Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound
servants by ﬁendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to
turn against those who fail to advance the patrons’ wicked aims. The cult of
Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.

(auditory,

enchantment, fear, mental) The yeth hound emits
an unearthly howl audible up
to 300 feet away. Any non-
ﬁend creature that hears the
howl must succeed at a DC 20
Will save or become frightened
1. Any creature that critically
fails and is within 60 feet of the
yeth hound is instead frightened
3 and ﬂeeing for 1d4 rounds (or
until it recovers from its frightened
condition). Whether it succeeds or fails
the saving throw, the creature is then
temporarily immune to Bay for 24 hours.
Sinister Bite A good creature bitten by a yeth
hound must attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a
critical success, the creature is temporarily immune
to sinister bite for 1 minute. A creature that fails
becomes frightened 1, or increases the value of its
frightened condition by 1 if already frightened.

ZOMOKS’ PRIMAL CALL
Zomoks can use primal call without
needing any secondary casters. The
zomok typically calls an awakened
tree, arboreal, or shambler, and
often tasks the called creature
with guarding a sacred location,
accompanying an ally on a mission
for the good of the forest, or a
similar assignment.
Zomok
Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes
from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural
disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons,
growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in
the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow
their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically
left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest
Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.

Entombing Breath ʚʖ (conjuration, earth, primal) The zomok blasts forth a 60-foot
cone of earth and gravel, dealing 17d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 34 basic
Reﬂex save); prone creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving
throw. Creatures touching the ground that fail their saves take a 10-foot
circumstance penalty to their Speeds and are restrained (Escape DC 34)
on a critical failure. The zomok can’t use Entombing Breath again
for 1d4 rounds.
The bodies of creatures slain by Entombing Breath
instantly decompose and are destroyed—they can be
restored to life only by a 7th-level or higher spell or
ritual that restores life. The creature’s equipment is
unharmed but buried under 5 feet of earth.
