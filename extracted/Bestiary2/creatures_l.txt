# LIVING THUNDERCLAP
================================================================================

Arc Lightning [(move, electricity, primal, transmutation) The spark bat transforms into
lightning that arcs to a large piece of metal within 100 feet, such as a suit of metal
armor or a metal weapon. The bat then returns to its normal form in a space adjacent
to the metal. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions.

a lightning bolt Strike that deals 1d12 electricity damage. If it hits, the target and any
creatures within a 15-foot emanation around the target take 2d6 sonic damage and
must attempt a DC 18 basic Fortitude save. Any creature that fails its save is also
deafened for 1d4 rounds.
BELKER
These reclusive elementals have glowing red eyes, leathery wings,
and long, sharp claws. While they always retain their shape,
belkers can control the solidity of their forms at will,
transforming into clouds of smoke, ash, and dust.

LOOTING EARTH ELEMENTALS
Earth elementals sometimes have
valuable gemstones or minerals
incorporated into their bodies,
and once they are slain, these
valuables can be scavenged as
treasure. Gemstones, precious
metals such as silver or gold ore,
or rarer materials such as mithral
or adamantine can be harvested
from these creatures, although the
more expensive finds tend to be
incorporated into only the most
powerful earth elementals.
Elemental, Earth
Certain earth elementals manifest as speciﬁc types of material, be they boulders,
sand, or crystals.
LIVING BOULDER
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones
and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship’s hull covered in barnacles.
Barely more intelligent than many animals, living boulders ﬁll much the same role
on the Plane of Earth as the great herd animals found on Material Plane worlds.

# LENG SPIDER
================================================================================


WEB TEMPLES
Leng spiders build complex lairs out
of their webs, many of which serve a
dual purpose as temples to the eldritch
gods they venerate. Most Leng spiders
worship deities of the Elder Mythos,
such as Hastur, Nyarlathotep, or
Yog-Sothoth, among others.
Leng Spider
The monstrous, bloated spiders from the windswept realm of Leng build eerie,
dangerous lairs with the aid of magically compelled slaves. Leng spiders have
anywhere from ﬁve to 13 legs, but never an even number.

Create Web Weaponry Ȱɵ (manipulate) The Leng spider
creates a weapon by applying a cord of webbing to
heavy objects, such as rocks or chunks of metal, either
attaching two heavy objects together to create a web
bola or fastening one to its leg to create a web war ﬂail.
Descend on a Web Ȱɵ (move) The Leng spider moves
straight down up to 120 feet, suspended by a web line. It can
hang from the web or drop oﬀ. The distance it Descends
on a Web doesn’t count when calculating falling
damage. The web can be severed by a Strike that
deals slashing damage (AC 30, Hardness 15,
25 HP), causing the Leng spider to fall.
Lay Web Trap Ȱɵ (manipulate) Frequency
three times per day; Eﬀect The Leng spider
spins a web within 20 feet of itself to
create a grasping snare, stunning snare,
or warning snare. The Leng spider’s web
provides all the raw materials it needs. All
save and Escape DCs associated with web
traps use the Leng spider’s Crafting DC for traps
(DC 36). A web trap decays after 24 hours.

confused eﬀect has the emotion and mental traits.
Ranged Trip A Leng spider can use a web bola to Trip a target
with the Athletics skill. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. A web bola deals no damage when used to Trip.

POTS OF GOLD
While it’s true that leprechauns
typically return items they steal,
they particularly love gold and often
hoard gold coins and treasures in
pots tucked away in hidden places.
It’s rumored that a person who ﬁnds
a gold coin in the forest and returns
it to the leprechaun who dropped it
will be granted a wish as a reward.
Unfortunately, this rumor is false—a
deception perpetrated by leprechauns
to trick others into bringing them even
more gold for their pots.
Leprechaun
Leprechauns are mostly jovial tricksters who prefer mischief over conﬂict. They
ﬁll their days with as much fun, wine, and food as possible. Mostly found in
forested regions, leprechauns respect nature and those who protect it.
Leprechauns do not attack on sight. Rather, they engage in conversation and
try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely
giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises
of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of
those they meet—a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining
for goods or favors. They aren’t above turning people against each other for their
own beneﬁt but generally not to an extent that causes harm.
In most cases, a leprechaun doesn’t keep a purloined possession for long. The
leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions,
often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement
and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun’s trick goes too far and
results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly ﬂees the conﬂict rather
than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to ﬂee from
battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for
thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their
powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a
joke into danger... or even death.

LERRITAN CAVALCADES
Every few decades, lerritans gather in
large bands to travel from one volcanic
region to another, razing every sign
of civilization they ﬁnd along the
way. Lerritan cavalcades contain
up to a dozen lerritans and their
lackeys: crimson worms, powerful ﬁre
elementals, and ﬁre giants.
Lerritan
Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling
lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay
homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of ﬁre, and they bully other ﬁery
creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn
forests, destroy villages, and boil rivers, but they avoid large bodies of water.

LESHY COMMUNITIES
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when
interacting with their own kind.
Most communities are meritocracies,
rewarding leshys who defend their
communities and help each other
succeed, and they see working together
as the best path to a successful future.
Leshy
These intelligent plant creatures maintain complex societies in remote wildernesses
and places of primal power. By working together, leshys help to defend powerful
fey and druidic sites from interloping humanoids. They often have good relations
with local fey and druidic orders but distrust most other humanoids.
A primal spell caster, often a druid, can create a leshy by binding a nature spirit
to a carefully crafted body grown from speciﬁc vegetation. The details of these
rites vary based on the type of leshy, but all are carefully guarded secrets and tend
to take place in sacred areas associated with nature or primal magic, such as a
druid circle or dryad grove.
SUNFLOWER LESHY
Sunﬂower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind.
Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a
serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their
eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they
become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant
coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts
in coloration are echoed in sunﬂower leshy art, which
can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For
example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place
of glowing lava and ﬂickering ﬂames, drawing upon
many vibrant colors, but to a sunﬂower leshy, the only
proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays,
blacks, and whites.
The more adventurous sunﬂower leshys leave their
communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of
humanoids. When interacting with humanoids,
sunﬂower leshys are some of the most likely
to act friendly and give strangers a chance to
prove their good intentions, though they remain
cautious. They’re often accompanied by other,
more powerful leshys.

LEYDROTH LEGACY
On Golarion, the ﬁrst leydroths
were created by a secret society of
Azlanti sorcerers who drew their
powers from elemental bloodlines.
These sorcerers clashed often
against various wizardly guilds who
held power throughout the various
regions of Azlant, and intended
for leydroths to serve as weapons
of terror against their foes. Today,
leydroths remain isolated on certain
particularly dangerous islands
among the remnants of the shattered
continent of Azlant, but now and
then foolish explorers seek to
transport them back to the mainland.
Leydroth
In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both
supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent
weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the ﬁrst
leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true,
and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.
Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing
from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.

Will DC of each creature in the area, with the eﬀects
of Demoralize. It also uses this result to attempt
to counteract each spell or magical eﬀect in the

LINNORM LEGENDS
Creatures as powerful as linnorms
tend to spawn stories of their own,
accurate or not. Critical failure on
a check to Recall Knowledge on
linnorms might suggest that you
can avoid a linnorm’s death curse by
closing your eyes as you deliver the
fatal blow, or that rubbing poison
oak on yourself can ward oﬀ a
linnorm’s attention.
Linnorm
The powerful, serpentine beings known as linnorms may be distantly related
to the more well-known chromatic and metallic dragons, but their draconic
physiologies are where any such similarities end. Whereas true dragons boast
incredible intellectual capabilities and far-reaching plans, linnorms are driven
only by their insatiable hunger and desire to inﬂict cruelty on others. Linnorms
are exceptionally difﬁcult to outwit due to their strong wills, and it’s not wise
to try bargaining with them—when faced with one of these legendary beasts,
one’s best option is ﬂight, pure and simple. Failing that, a noble death is a viable
back-up plan.
Extremely powerful linnorms dwell in remote parts of the world. One such
creature is the legendary Fafnheir, the Father of All Linnorms, said to be the oldest
and mightiest linnorm of them all. Fafnheir’s death curse causes anyone who
would slay him to slowly erode away physically and mentally until they die, at
which point the cursed victim’s body fuels Fafnheir’s resurrection.
SHOAL LINNORM
Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither
along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek
out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer
ﬁshers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may
even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the
town’s defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt
large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred
quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich
in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the ﬁery steam that
courses through their veins.

services to a spellcaster in exchange
for sustenance. Tales tell of sorcerers
or other magical creatures who keep
mandragora “familiars” whose loyalty
is sustained by feeding the little beasts
with their own blood. These tales
generally have gruesome endings
wherein the mandragora is overcome
with bloodlust and, unable to control
itself, devours its master.
Mandragora
A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed
shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious
little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon’s
blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon’s blood, the
root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.
Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained
lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While
they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and
they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs,
a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They ﬁnd the
ﬂavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing
these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.
While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil
plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of
giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces,
eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.

SPIRIT NAGA COVENS
Like hags, spirit nagas occasionally
form small groups of their own kind.
They normally do this for mutual
protection against a greater threat
or to accomplish a goal that a single
spirit naga cannot complete on their
own. Sometimes, spirit nagas form
a coven to bring groups of cultists
together or take over a city or other
large community, and in rare cases a
spirit naga might even join a hag or
witch coven.
Lunar Naga Venom (poison, sleep) Saving Throw DC 24; Maximum Duration 6 rounds;
Stage 1 stupeﬁed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 as stage 1 (1 round); Stage 3 stupeﬁed 2 (1 round);
Stage 4 unconscious (1 round). Once a creature falls unconscious from lunar naga
venom, they remain asleep for 1d8 hours unless woken.
SPIRIT NAGA
In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place
similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives
of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they
can beneﬁt from the spirit naga’s powers without paying a heavy price—for most
who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.
Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and
corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards,
crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may
know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to
the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth
and stones there.
Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit
nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.
They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are
revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of
“civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship
of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They
often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and
rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread
the nagas’ foul inﬂuence throughout a community.
