PLANETAR JUSTICE
Planetars know pathways to travel
between many planes of existence,
and they use these frequently to
deliver messages, warnings, and
ultimatums to those whose actions
have attracted angelic concern. If a
situation can be resolved with swift
on-the-spot justice, a planetar takes
that route in hopes of staving oﬀ an
escalation of violence.

SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.

POLAR BEAR
Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips,
and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures,
stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy
waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing
ambush predators, leaping from the water to
ambush seals resting on ice ﬂoes. If they are
desperate, polar bears hunt not only other
animals but also humanoids.

ADAPTIVE HUNTERS
Though it doesn’t happen often due
to their ability to shift planes, some
bebiliths ﬁnd themselves trapped on
other planes either through magical
binding or subjugation to beings of
great power. While trapped away
from their favored prey, a bebilith’s
hungers can shift. In such cases, the
creature’s penetrating strikes can
adapt—a bebilith trapped in Elysium,
for example, might become a hunter
of azatas, and its Penetrating Strike
would count as cold iron and evil
instead so that it could target
traditional azata weaknesses.
Bebilith
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder
regions of this horriﬁc plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not
the deadliest—is the bebilith. These ﬁends resemble elephant-sized spiders with
glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic ﬂuid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths’ devious
intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take
advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out
at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic
ﬂesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

hit by the bebilith’s web Strike
is restrained and tethered to
the bebilith, preventing it from
moving further away from the
bebilith. The restrained creature
is also under the eﬀects of a
dimensional anchor spell (DC 29)
with a duration that lasts as long as
the creature remains tethered. The
bebilith can have only one creature
tethered at a time. The DC to Escape
or Force Open the tether is 29. The
tether can be severed with a Strike
(AC 20, Hardness 2, HP 20); this ends
the dimensional anchor eﬀect but does
not free the restrained creature.
Penetrating Strike Against demons, a bebilith’s
Strikes count as cold iron and good.

FORMED IN HIS IMAGE
Meladaemons have always been
gaunt and bestial, but they didn’t
always resemble jackals. When
Trelmarixian overthrew the previous
Horseman of Famine, one of his
ﬁrst acts as a ruler of Abaddon was
to forcibly twist the appearance of
his deacon caste to resemble his
own wicked form. He went on to
imbue meladaemons with other
jackal-like aspects as it suited him,
further warping them and cementing
their fealty.

Consumptive Aura (aura, divine) 20 feet. A meladaemon emanates an aura of intense
hunger. Each round a creature begins its turn in the aura, it must attempt a DC 27
Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 negative damage (2d6 on a critical
failure) and becomes fatigued. This fatigue ends as soon as the creature eats any food.
Withering Opportunity Ǻȓ Trigger The meladaemon is attacked by an adjacent creature
and the attack misses; Eﬀect The meladaemon swipes at the triggering creature, which
must immediately attempt a save against the meladaemon’s withering touch.

Withering Touch (divine, evil, necromancy) When the
meladaemon hits with a claw Strike or a creature
begins its turn grabbed by the meladaemon, the
creature must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 negative
damage and becomes fatigued. This fatigue
ends when the creature drinks.
DERGHODAEMON (RAVAGER DAEMON)
Derghodaemons
represent
death
through
unfathomable violence and being eaten alive.
Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to
bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the
elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inﬂict the same twisted
and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons
derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these ﬁends, the quicker they can
enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim
and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected
to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long—
the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience
severe visual warping. The derghodaemon’s appearance becomes more and more
twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous
urges to inﬂict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horriﬁc attack
derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming
infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of
ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death,
provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp
of the insects’ bodies don’t drive them to violent fury ﬁrst!

SOUL GEMS AS GEAR
Daemons often carry soul gems
either as trophies or for powering
an ability. Cacodaemons (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 70) are the most common
source for soul gems, but they can
also be created by spells like bind
soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem
to power an ability, the trapped soul
is released into the afterlife and can
be resurrected normally.
OLETHRODAEMON (APOCALYPSE DAEMON)
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for
creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
of an even greater being: a mysterious ﬁfth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying
enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing
eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns,
olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.

HADROSAURID CRESTS
The diﬀerent species of hadrosaurids
all use the same statistics. While
some species have no cranial crest
at all, those who do, such as the
distinctive backward-curling crest
of the parasaurolophus, are capable
of vocalizing sonorous and haunting

IGUANODON
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests
where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other
depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach
delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger.
Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A
well‑placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a
cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh
6,000 pounds.

PERYTON FLOCKS
On rare occasions, a peryton ﬂock
forms at the lead of an alpha female. It
lasts until the alpha makes a mistake
that erodes her perceived power. Then
the rest of the ﬂock tears her apart.
Peryton
The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag, wolf, and
hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out their still-
beating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole, so the
doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their ﬂesh is consumed.
Despite perytons’ animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously
cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to ﬁnd a lone
traveler and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other
creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult
males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else.
Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have
collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to
secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating
ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally
abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched
perytons must fend for themselves from the moment
they emerge.
A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky
overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree
where they can observe nearby lands. Although they
aren’t particularly interested in wealth, perytons do
like to collect small objects from their victims. During
those times between hunts, they sometimes study these
trophies in order to relive the memories of victims’ last
moments and the taste of victims’ hearts.

rips out the heart of an adjacent corpse with their jaws.
The creature must have died in the last minute. As the
peryton rips the heart free and swallows it whole,
they regain 2d6 HP, and any non-peryton that
witnesses this event must succeed at a DC 21 Will
save or become frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on
a critical failure).

at a DC 21 Will save or the peryton’s shadow changes to match that cast by the
target creature. With their shadow so transformed, the peryton gains a +2 status
bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature. In addition, each time
the peryton successfully Strikes that creature, the creature must succeed at a DC
21 Will save or become frightened 1, or increase its frightened condition by 1 if
it’s already frightened. This is an emotion and fear eﬀect. The shadow remains
transformed for 1 hour or until the peryton Mimics a Shadow again, whichever
comes ﬁrst.

OTHER PETITIONERS
Each plane (save the Negative
Energy Plane) has its own category
of petitioner, but not every plane or
demiplane present in the Pathﬁnder
setting is listed here. Certainly,
planes of your own design aren’t
represented! You can use the wide
range of petitioner types and
descriptions here as templates or
inspiration for creating new types
of petitioners: each needs a name,
appearance, alignment, language,
additional ability, and attack.
For instance, Desna maintains a
demiplane called Cynosure that
straddles the Material Plane and
Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are
known as the chosen dreamers, and
they appear as idealized and softly
glowing versions of their mortal
selves; they are chaotic good, speak
Celestial, are immune to confusion
and stupeﬁed, and deal bludgeoning
damage with their ﬁsts.
Petitioner
When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where
they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged,
their soul is sent on to their ﬁnal reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the
process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants
the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical
forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner’s memories from their life are
typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments
akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner’s size, power, or
nature in life, they’re a Medium creature in their afterlife.
Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily
eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes
themselves can further change the petitioner’s nature by transforming them
into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane’s
physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of
supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or ﬁend. Should a petitioner die,
their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back
to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the
true end of a soul’s journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart
of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the
creation of entirely new souls.

FIRST WORLD PETITIONERS
A soul sent to the First World does
not become a petitioner. Rather, they
immediately reincarnate into a fey
creature whose temperament and
role match their mortal personalities.
This process tends to leave souls
who incarnate into the First World
with slightly more fragments of
memories than most petitioners, yet
still not enough that they remember
who they once were.

GENIEKIN PARENTAGE
Planar scions from the elemental
planes are known as geniekin because
they are overwhelmingly born from
couplings between mortals and
genies: ifrits are born of efreet, oreads
of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of
djinn, and undines of marids. Despite
this distinguished ancestry, geniekin
do not display most of their parents’
exceptional talents, such as their
ability to grant wishes.
Planar Scion, Geniekin
Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of genies,
causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though
the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments,
geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any
alignment. More information on genies can be found on page 162 of the Bestiary.
IFRIT
Ifrits’ blood blazes with elemental ﬁre. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who
serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those
born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to ﬂee it live
lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.
Ifrits are fond of ﬁre, but this doesn’t mean they all
embrace ﬁre’s destructive nature. Those who seek
more productive roles in a society ﬁnd inspiration in
the way ﬂames ﬂit and dance, and they pride themselves
in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of
Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit ﬁre dancers, both in
appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits
have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.
But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and
callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of ﬁre.
Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical
teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown
or conﬂagration lit.

OREAD
Elemental earth laces through the bones of oreads, who appear similar to stone
statues of their mortal ancestry, with delicate crystals in place of hair, fur, or
scales. Oreads are stoic and slow to plan but are of steadfast resolve and
unwavering in their convictions.
The typical oread cherishes quiet seclusion. Yet as they age, many
oreads ﬁnd themselves inexplicably drawn to some far-ﬂung location
