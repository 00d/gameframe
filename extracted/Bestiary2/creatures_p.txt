PLANETAR JUSTICE
Planetars know pathways to travel
between many planes of existence,
and they use these frequently to
deliver messages, warnings, and
ultimatums to those whose actions
have attracted angelic concern. If a
situation can be resolved with swift
on-the-spot justice, a planetar takes
that route in hopes of staving oﬀ an
escalation of violence.

Blade of Justice ʚʖ The planetar makes a greatsword
Strike against a target it detects as evil. If the target is
evil, the Strike deals three extra weapon damage dice
and deals 1d6 persistent good damage to the target.
The planetar can convert all the physical damage from
the attack into good damage.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph,
transmutation) The planetar can take on the
appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This
doesn’t change their Speed or Strikes.
Holy Armaments (divine, evocation) Any weapon gains
the eﬀect of a holy property rune while a planetar
wields it.
SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.

# POLAR BEAR

POLAR BEAR
Polar bears are known for their pale fur, with black eyes, lips,
and toe pads. They are aggressively predatory creatures,
stalking prey for miles on land or across the icy
waters of frozen oceans. They are also amazing
ambush predators, leaping from the water to
ambush seals resting on ice ﬂoes. If they are
desperate, polar bears hunt not only other
animals but also humanoids.

ADAPTIVE HUNTERS
Though it doesn’t happen often due
to their ability to shift planes, some
bebiliths ﬁnd themselves trapped on
other planes either through magical
binding or subjugation to beings of
great power. While trapped away
from their favored prey, a bebilith’s
hungers can shift. In such cases, the
creature’s penetrating strikes can
adapt—a bebilith trapped in Elysium,
for example, might become a hunter
of azatas, and its Penetrating Strike
would count as cold iron and evil
instead so that it could target
traditional azata weaknesses.
Bebilith
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder
regions of this horriﬁc plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not
the deadliest—is the bebilith. These ﬁends resemble elephant-sized spiders with
glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic ﬂuid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths’ devious
intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take
advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out
at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic
ﬂesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

# PISCODAEMON
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
ABADDON
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane
of pure evil for only the most corrupt
souls. If Hell is a realm of torture
and systematic depravity, Abaddon
is its twisted cousin—a place where
one can ﬁnd only misery and
despair in ample quantities, with
neither the strictures of Hell nor
the chaotic freedom of the Abyss.
For evildoers who seek simply to
inﬂict their wickedness on others,
Abaddon is a rich hunting ground
where one can revel in turpitude,
though visitors be forewarned: the
competition is ﬁerce.
Daemon
Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.
PISCODAEMON (VENOM DAEMON)
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards,
delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on
a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and
even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons’ preferred
tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River
Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They
are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by
drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget
their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.

(1 round); Stage 2 2d8 poison and enfeebled 1 (1 round);
Stage 3 4d8 poison and enfeebled 2 (1 round)
MELADAEMON (FAMINE DAEMON)
Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst,
and revel in spreading the same despair that brought
about their mortal demise. When they aren’t blighting
ﬁelds, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies,
they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures
can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that
result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian,
Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other
daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.

================================================================================
PAGE 60
================================================================================

FORMED IN HIS IMAGE
Meladaemons have always been
gaunt and bestial, but they didn’t
always resemble jackals. When
Trelmarixian overthrew the previous
Horseman of Famine, one of his
ﬁrst acts as a ruler of Abaddon was
to forcibly twist the appearance of
his deacon caste to resemble his
own wicked form. He went on to
imbue meladaemons with other
jackal-like aspects as it suited him,
further warping them and cementing
their fealty.

Bestiary 2
DAEMONIC DEACONS
Each of the four Horsemen is
served by a speciﬁc category
of servitor daemons known as
deacons. Leukodaemons serve
as deacons to the Horseman of
Pestilence. Meladaemons serve as
deacons to the Horseman of Famine,
while thanadaemons serve as
deacons to the Horseman of Death.
Purrodaemons are currently the most
powerful of the deacons, and serve
the Horseman of War—yet over time,
which category of deacon is the most
powerful can wax and wane.

Hurl Weapon Ȱɵ (divine, evocation) The purrodaemon causes a weapon that has steeped
in their ﬂesh (see Steep Weapon) to telekinetically launch from their ﬂesh. The
purrodaemon makes a hurled weapon Strike without using their hands.
Recall Weapon Ȱɵ (evocation) Requirements A steeped
weapon that’s no longer sheathed in the
purrodaemon’s body is within 120 feet of the
daemon; Eﬀect The steeped weapon swiftly
ﬂies through the air to resheath itself in the
purrodaemon’s body. If a creature is along
this ﬂight path, the purrodaemon can make a
hurled weapon Strike against the target; if it
hits, the weapon drops to the ground in a square
adjacent to the creature.
Steep Weapon Ȱɵ (manipulate) The
purrodaemon sheathes a weapon in
their own ﬂesh. This deals no damage
to the purrodaemon, which can have up to 10
weapons sheathed in their body at a time. A steeped
weapon must be one that deals piercing or slashing
damage.
If a purrodaemon Interacts to crush a soul
gem, one weapon of their choice sheathed in
their ﬂesh becomes enchanted with the daemon’s
ﬁendish power and becomes a +2 greater
striking weapon that can be used in place
of their glaive or hurled at targets
(with a +2 item bonus to the hurled
weapon’s attack modiﬁer and an extra
d10 of damage). This magical quality fades 24 hours after
it ceases being sheathed in the daemon’s living body. A
steeped weapon can be Disarmed.
Twist the Blade Ǻȓ Requirements The purrodaemon
has fewer than 10 weapons sheathed in their body;
Trigger The purrodaemon is hit with a weapon that
deals piercing damage; Eﬀect The purrodaemon
seizes the triggering weapon. The weapon’s
wielder must attempt a DC 40 Reﬂex save. On
a failure, the weapon is disarmed and falls to an
adjacent square. On a critical failure, the weapon
is sheathed in the purrodaemon’s body as though the daemon had used Steep Weapon.

SOUL GEMS AS GEAR
Daemons often carry soul gems
either as trophies or for powering
an ability. Cacodaemons (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 70) are the most common
source for soul gems, but they can
also be created by spells like bind
soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem
to power an ability, the trapped soul
is released into the afterlife and can
be resurrected normally.
OLETHRODAEMON (APOCALYPSE DAEMON)
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for
creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
of an even greater being: a mysterious ﬁfth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying
enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing
eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns,
olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.

DINOSAUR ABILITIES
While the real world fossil records
hold a wealth of inspiration for
the reconstruction of dinosaurs
in an RPG, you can also look to
living creatures for ideas. Giving
a dinosaur a poisonous bite or
an unusual attack routine like
Clobbering Charge ensures that
dinosaurs are as interesting in
combat as they are in appearance.

HADROSAURID
Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping
of herbivorous dinosaurs that
share
characteristic
ﬂat
snouts ﬁlled with rows
of grinding teeth well
suited
for
feeding
on vegetation. Also
known as “duck-billed
dinosaurs” due to the
unusual shape of their jaws,
hadrosaurids
are
lumbering
creatures that can rival an
elephant for size, although they
tend to be much less aggressive and
are prone to ﬂight when confronted
with danger rather than stubbornly standing
their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have
uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each
species its own unusual proﬁle, making them easily
recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.
Giants and other oversized creatures have been known
to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite
their ability to sprint quickly, they don’t make particularly
viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group,
a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak
great damage with their trampling.
A hadrosaurid can walk for short
distances on its hind legs but prefers
to graze and travel on all fours. The
typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30
feet long and can weigh up to
10,000 pounds.

Bestiary 2
HADROSAURID CRESTS
The diﬀerent species of hadrosaurids
all use the same statistics. While
some species have no cranial crest
at all, those who do, such as the
distinctive backward-curling crest
of the parasaurolophus, are capable
of vocalizing sonorous and haunting
calls when they seek the attention
of a mate or warning their herd of a
predator’s approach.

# PELUDA
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
PELUDA PATRONS
Occasionally a particularly cunning
band of humanoids—typically
lizardfolk or orcs—ﬁnds a way to
assuage a local peluda’s temper
and then elevate the dragon to the
status of a local liege, patron, or even
object of worship. Although peludas
rarely have any actual aﬀection
for such servants, they revel in
the submission of these weaker
creatures and the gifts of gold and
food they bring.
Peluda
Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely
forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch
of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential
rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed
footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses
on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt,
roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and
killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.
Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves,
especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or
breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more
impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try
anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry,
which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and ﬁre breath.

PERYTON FLOCKS
On rare occasions, a peryton ﬂock
forms at the lead of an alpha female. It
lasts until the alpha makes a mistake
that erodes her perceived power. Then
the rest of the ﬂock tears her apart.
Peryton
The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag, wolf, and
hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out their stillbeating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole, so the
doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their ﬂesh is consumed.
Despite perytons’ animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously
cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to ﬁnd a lone
traveler and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other
creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult
males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else.
Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have
collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to
secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating
ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally
abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched
perytons must fend for themselves from the moment
they emerge.
A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky
overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree
where they can observe nearby lands. Although they
aren’t particularly interested in wealth, perytons do
like to collect small objects from their victims. During
those times between hunts, they sometimes study these
trophies in order to relive the memories of victims’ last
moments and the taste of victims’ hearts.

target creature. With their shadow so transformed, the peryton gains a +2 status
bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature. In addition, each time
the peryton successfully Strikes that creature, the creature must succeed at a DC
21 Will save or become frightened 1, or increase its frightened condition by 1 if
it’s already frightened. This is an emotion and fear eﬀect. The shadow remains

OTHER PETITIONERS
Each plane (save the Negative
Energy Plane) has its own category
of petitioner, but not every plane or
demiplane present in the Pathﬁnder
setting is listed here. Certainly,
planes of your own design aren’t
represented! You can use the wide
range of petitioner types and
descriptions here as templates or
inspiration for creating new types
of petitioners: each needs a name,
appearance, alignment, language,
additional ability, and attack.
For instance, Desna maintains a
demiplane called Cynosure that
straddles the Material Plane and
Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are
known as the chosen dreamers, and
they appear as idealized and softly
glowing versions of their mortal
selves; they are chaotic good, speak
Celestial, are immune to confusion
and stupeﬁed, and deal bludgeoning
damage with their ﬁsts.
Petitioner
When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where
they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged,
their soul is sent on to their ﬁnal reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the
process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants
the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical
forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner’s memories from their life are
typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments
akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner’s size, power, or
nature in life, they’re a Medium creature in their afterlife.
Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily
eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes
themselves can further change the petitioner’s nature by transforming them
into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane’s
physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of
supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or ﬁend. Should a petitioner die,
their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back
to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the
true end of a soul’s journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart
of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the
creation of entirely new souls.

OTHER PETITIONERS
Each plane (save the Negative
Energy Plane) has its own category
of petitioner, but not every plane or
demiplane present in the Pathﬁnder
setting is listed here. Certainly,
planes of your own design aren’t
represented! You can use the wide
range of petitioner types and
descriptions here as templates or
inspiration for creating new types
of petitioners: each needs a name,
appearance, alignment, language,
additional ability, and attack.
For instance, Desna maintains a
demiplane called Cynosure that
straddles the Material Plane and
Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are
known as the chosen dreamers, and
they appear as idealized and softly
glowing versions of their mortal
selves; they are chaotic good, speak
Celestial, are immune to confusion
and stupeﬁed, and deal bludgeoning
damage with their ﬁsts.
Petitioner
When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where
they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged,
their soul is sent on to their ﬁnal reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the
process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants
the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical
forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner’s memories from their life are
typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments
akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner’s size, power, or
nature in life, they’re a Medium creature in their afterlife.
Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily
eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes
themselves can further change the petitioner’s nature by transforming them
into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane’s
physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of
supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or ﬁend. Should a petitioner die,
their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back
to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the
true end of a soul’s journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart
of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the
creation of entirely new souls.

FIRST WORLD PETITIONERS
A soul sent to the First World does
not become a petitioner. Rather, they
immediately reincarnate into a fey
creature whose temperament and
role match their mortal personalities.
This process tends to leave souls
who incarnate into the First World
with slightly more fragments of
memories than most petitioners, yet
still not enough that they remember
who they once were.

GENIEKIN PARENTAGE
Planar scions from the elemental
planes are known as geniekin because
they are overwhelmingly born from
couplings between mortals and
genies: ifrits are born of efreet, oreads
of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of
djinn, and undines of marids. Despite
this distinguished ancestry, geniekin
do not display most of their parents’
exceptional talents, such as their
ability to grant wishes.
Planar Scion, Geniekin
Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of genies,
causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though
the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments,
geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any
alignment. More information on genies can be found on page 162 of the Bestiary.
IFRIT
Ifrits’ blood blazes with elemental ﬁre. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who
serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those
born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to ﬂee it live
lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.
Ifrits are fond of ﬁre, but this doesn’t mean they all
embrace ﬁre’s destructive nature. Those who seek
more productive roles in a society ﬁnd inspiration in
the way ﬂames ﬂit and dance, and they pride themselves
in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of
Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit ﬁre dancers, both in
appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits
have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.
But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and
callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of ﬁre.
Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical
teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown
or conﬂagration lit.
