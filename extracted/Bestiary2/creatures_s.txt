SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.

SOLAR GENESIS
Unlike most angels, solars are
created from divine energy,
sometimes blended with good souls.
They are joined in this distinction by
the ancient empyrean angels.

HP 500, regeneration 20 (deactivated by evil); Weaknesses evil 25
Aura of Protection (abjuration, aura, divine) 20 feet. Allies in the solar’s aura gain
a +2 status bonus to AC against evil creatures and a +2 status bonus to saves
against eﬀects from evil creatures. The bonus increases to +4 against control by
evil creatures and attacks by evil summoned creatures. When the solar or an ally
is hit by an attack from a creature in the aura, that foe must succeed at a DC 43
Will save or be blinded for 1 minute (this is an
incapacitation eﬀect). It’s then temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Speed 35 feet, ﬂy 100 feet
Melee Ȱɵ holy greatsword +44 (good, magical,

Animate Weapon Ǻȓ Trigger The solar hits with a melee weapon
Strike while Animate Weapon is not already in eﬀect; Eﬀect The
solar’s weapon leaps into the air and moves with the solar as
if held with both hands. The weapon gains the eﬀects of the
dancing weapon rune for 1 minute.
Arrow of Mortality The solar doesn’t need to provide
ammunition for their bow. When they draw their
bow, they create a magical arrow of light that sheds
bright light in a 20-foot radius until the end of the
solar’s next turn. On a critical hit with the arrow, if
the target has 75 or fewer Hit Points after taking
the damage, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes
dying 1 (or, if it was already dying, increases its
dying value by 3).
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine,
polymorph, transmutation) The solar can
take on the appearance of any Small
or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t
change their Speed or Strikes.
Holy Armaments (divine, evocation)
Any weapon gains the eﬀect of a
holy property rune while a solar
wields it.

Animate Dream
An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and
dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams.
In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers
ﬂee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a
supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek
similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together,
they merge into a horriﬁc form as an animate dream.
Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most
take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned
them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly
encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes
that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these
forms, animate dreams ﬁnd their way out of the Dreamlands and into the
waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a
relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.
An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and
fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the
minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link
to that individual’s dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all
manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the
victim ﬁnds it more and more difﬁcult to remain awake. In the end,
the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot
return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form
of fear and are its preferred sustenance.
An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular
nightmares, but these lesser fears aren’t as satisfying, often driving the
animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an
animate dream won’t starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent
and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often
encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue
more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also
tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown
metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a speciﬁc
nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean
waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have
similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.

ARMORED ARCHONS
Always ready to defend others, most
archons are never encountered out of
their suits of armor. Even those who
eschew armor, such as the bastion
archon, tend to still appear as if they
are wearing heavy protection against
the scourge of battle.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven’s Holy
Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt
that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of
sacriﬁce, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested,
and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness
upon the surrounding region.

Bastion Aura (aura, divine, good, healing, necromancy) 50 feet. All
good‑aligned creatures in the aura have fast healing 30 for as long as
they remain in range, and they gain a +2 status bonus to attack
rolls and damage rolls.
Ultimate Sacriﬁce (divine, good, healing, necromancy) If the
bastion archon is slain by an evil creature, it explodes in a
geyser of holy light, restoring 140 HP to all good-aligned
creatures in a 40-foot emanation. The ground in the aﬀected
area is also subjected to a level 10 consecrate ritual, and the
ground is consecrated for 10 years (or only 24 hours if the
ultimate sacriﬁce took place in Hell, Abaddon, or the Abyss).

creature with two ﬁst Strikes this turn and can use its Holy
Beam; Eﬀect The bastion archon ﬁres its Holy Beam at only the
creature it hit twice. The creature’s save result is one degree of
success worse than the result it rolled.
Entrench Ȱɵ The bastion archon locks itself in place, becoming
voluntarily immobilized. While Entrenched, the archon can’t be
forcibly moved or tripped, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus
to AC and Reﬂex saves. Entrench ends automatically as soon as
the bastion archon uses another move action.
Holy Beam ʚʖ (divine, good, incapacitation, light) The bastion
archon releases a blinding beam of holy light in a 500-foot line
that deals 20d6 good damage to non-archons in the area, with a
DC 38 Reﬂex save. The bastion archon can’t use Holy Beam again
for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is blinded for
1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is
blinded permanently.

HELLMOUTHS
While travel to and from Hell is
possible with plane shift, another
way to reach and traverse the
infernal realms is via hellmouths,
strange living portals connecting
diﬀerent layers or even diﬀerent
planes. A hellmouth takes the form
of a grimacing face, distended
maw, or other distressingly organic
aperture, and no two share the
same appearance. Most are carefully
guarded, but some new or well-hidden
hellmouths have yet to be discovered.

DOLPHINS TO THE RESCUE
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual
trait—they often come to the aid of
other creatures in distress, such as to
save a drowning person or to protect
someone from the attack of a shark.
Not every monster in this book
wants to hurt player characters—
consider having a dolphin come to
an endangered PC’s rescue if the
situation merits!
Dolphin
Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite
social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans.
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin.
They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups
called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell tales of how
they save drowning ﬁshers or kill sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.

feet, it gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its attack roll. A
Large or smaller creature hit by this attack must succeed at
a DC 16 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1 round.
ORCA
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually
the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt
together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true
whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh
8,000–12,000 pounds.

Leaps vertically out of the water up to 25 feet in the
air, making a Strike against a creature at any point
during the jump (this lets it attack a creature within
30 feet of the water’s surface). After the Strike, the orca splashes back down into
the water.

DRAKE LOCATIONS
While the diﬀerent species of drakes
are adapted to diﬀerent climates and
environments, many drakes share
similar preferences regarding nest
location, searching out high places
that oﬀer cover from above, such
as cliﬀside or mountaintop caverns,
jungle canopies, and so on.
Creatures within the burst take 3d6 cold damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save). The explosion
of shadow also snuﬀs out mundane light sources the size of a torch, lantern, or smaller,
and attempts to counteract magical light with a +10 counteract modiﬁer. The shadow
drake can’t use Shadow Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Speed Surge Ȱɵ Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The shadow drake Strides or
Flies twice.
SEA DRAKE
Long and slender, sea drakes have ﬁns
down the length of their backs and
webbing between their talons, making
them just as adapted for gliding through
ocean waves as the skies above. More
solitary than most drakes, they hunt and
live alone. Although most sea drakes make
their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn’t
unheard of for them to dwell in underwater
caves, living entirely aquatic lives.

Ball Lightning Breath ʚʖ (arcane, electricity, evocation) The sea drake spews a
ball of electricity that strikes a primary target within 100 feet, dealing 7d6
electricity damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save). The lightning then arcs to up
to three secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target, striking
the closest available targets ﬁrst. The secondary bolts each strike one
secondary target and deal the same rolled damage value as the
primary bolt (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). The sea drake
can’t use Ball Lightning Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Briny Wound A sea drake’s saliva carries a large quantity of
salt, making its bite wounds even more painful. When a
creature takes damage from a sea drake’s jaws Strike, the
creature must attempt a DC 24 Fortitude save; the creature is
then temporarily immune to briny wound for 1 minute.

DRAUGR SHIPS
When an entire ship’s crew dies
in one calamity, they might rise
simultaneously, bound together in
death. Tirelessly plaguing the seas,
these draugr crews slowly corrupt
their vessels. The cursed ships often
exhibit unsettling phenomena, such
as being able to sail against the wind
or leaving schools of dead ﬁsh in
their wake. Sea shanties tell of draugr
raiders approaching during the night,
wreathed in fog pierced only by the
green glow emanating from their eyes.
Draugr
Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of
the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed,
barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can’t speak, but
expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally
drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living
creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs
often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the
depths with even more dead.
Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative
energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the
sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a
corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it ﬁnally rises. Proximity to intelligent
life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a
shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures
don’t take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.
Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as
mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work
song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures
have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but
providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the
beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the
draugr, reafﬁrming their desire for blood and death.
More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr
captains. They’re 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments
(page 6) that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell
three times per day.

CARRION GOLEM COMPONENTS
The decaying body parts that make
up a carrion golem are of little
value in most cultures. However,
the magic used to preserve them
and infuse them with disease can
still be harnessed by unscrupulous
necromancers and other practitioners
of foul arts. Such creatures may
be willing to purchase a destroyed
carrion golem, but the processes
used to extract the power within the
pieces are diﬃcult and ineﬃcient, so
they won’t pay much.
Golems
The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity
of its crafter. Over the ages, skilled minds and hands have reﬁned the formulas
for creating speciﬁc types of golems, resulting in the development of common
forms. The secrets of creating the types of golems presented here may be
guarded within the halls of famous golemworks or the forgotten libraries of
many worlds.
GOLEM ANTIMAGIC
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each
type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions
are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing
here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell
can affect the golem.
•	 Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the
listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual eﬀect. If the
golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is aﬀected by a persistent
eﬀect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
•	 Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the
slowed condition and gain Hit Points equal to half the damage the spell would have
dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the Hit
Points listed in the parenthetical.
•	 Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1
for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual eﬀect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of
this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
•	 Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more speciﬁc spells, with the
eﬀects described in its stat block.
CARRION GOLEM
Carrion golems are foul-smelling and ﬂy-
swarmed amalgams of putreﬁed parts
stitched together from many different
creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion
golems only rarely are given a humanoid
form, instead appearing more twisted and
bestial in frame. As a result, some students of
golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn’t
a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these
foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits,
including their signiﬁcant immunities. What is true is
that most who craft carrion golems don’t do so out
of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but
for the golem’s ability to spread disease. The crafters
of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause
immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and
death behind them.

LESHY HEROES
Occasionally, a leshy proves so
valuable to their community that
they’re uplifted as a hero. These
admired leshys are not all warriors;
outstanding artisans, caretakers,
or diplomats might also be lauded
as heroes.
Primal Innate Spells DC 17; 4th speak with plants
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The sunﬂower leshy
transforms into a Small ﬂower. This ability otherwise uses the eﬀects of tree shape.
Seed Spray ʚʖ (conjuration, primal) The sunﬂower leshy launches a deluge of seeds
from their head in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within
the area (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save). It gains a +2 status bonus to this damage against
dazzled creatures. The sunﬂower leshy can’t use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
FLYTRAP LESHY
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, ﬂytrap leshys get along well with other
leshys. Nonetheless, they’re among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the
most vulnerable places in the natural world with their ﬂytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of ﬂytrap leshys band together to create
amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal
defense suffuses ﬂytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between
multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight
humanoids—to a ﬂytrap leshy, though, there’s nothing strange about sharing your
innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your
home from an enemy.

ﬂytrap leshy can combine itself with an adjacent and
willing ﬂytrap leshy that is not currently aﬀected
by Amalgam. The leshy using Amalgam physically
merges with the target, restoring 3d8 Hit Points to the target. The
leshy can Sustain a Spell to continue Amalgam, but once they stop,
the target leshy takes 3d8 damage. If the target leshy dies, Amalgam ends at once
and the original leshy gains the dying condition or increases their dying condition
value by 1 if they were already dying. As long as Amalgam is sustained, the target
leshy gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, its AC increases to 21,
and it gains an additional reaction at the start of each turn.

ﬂytrap leshy transforms into a Small ﬂytrap. This ability otherwise
uses the eﬀects of tree shape.

NEWBORN LINNORMS
Almost all linnorms lead solitary
lives; they are too reprehensible for
even their own kind to tolerate for
any length of time. Most species do
not even meet to reproduce; rather,
female linnorms usually deposit a
solitary egg in a remote location,
which a wandering male linnorm
then fertilizes and places in a nook
suitable for incubation. Newborn
linnorms range in size from that of
adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls,
and their growth is rapid. Even a
juvenile linnorm is strong enough to
wreak havoc on a small settlement—
though most don’t dare to commit
such audacious pillaging, for fear of
evoking the anger of another, larger
linnorm in the area.
Melee Ȱɵ claw +31 (agile, magical, reach 15 feet), Damage 3d8+16 slashing
Melee Ȱɵ tail +31 (magical, reach 25 feet), Damage 4d6+16 bludgeoning plus Improved Grab

Breath Weapon ʚʖ (evocation, ﬁre, primal, water) The shoal linnorm exhales scalding
steam that deals 12d8 ﬁre damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 36 basic Reﬂex save). The
steam lingers until the end of the linnorm’s next turn; anyone who enters the area
or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 ﬁre damage (DC 36 Reﬂex save negates).
During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight,
turning the area into diﬃcult terrain. All creatures in the steam become concealed,
and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The shoal
linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Shoal Linnorm Venom (ﬁre, poison) Saving Throw DC 36 Fortitude; Maximum Duration
10 rounds; Stage 1 4d6 ﬁre damage and enfeebled 1 (1 round); Stage 2 6d6 ﬁre damage
and enfeebled 2 (1 round)
FJORD LINNORM
Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in
the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as
they swim up the fjords for which they’re named, they are as vile as any other of
their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their
terriﬁed crews.

OTHER NECROPHIDIUSES
Ultimately, a necrophidius’s abilities
are the result of its creators’
designs. Some have diﬀerent
immunities or have bites that deal
poison, cold, or negative damage
instead of inﬂicting paralysis. There
are even rumors of soulbound
necrophidiuses whose creators
arranged for the soul of the skull’s
donor to empower the construct.
These necrophidiuses are not only
sentient but also have the facility to
reason and even cast spells.
Necrophidius
Although the necrophidius is a mindless construct with no particular ability to
comprehend the complexities of good or evil, these sinister-looking constructs are
often crafted by evil or macabre creators seeking to imbue their guardians with a
frightening aesthetic.
Constructed from bones harvested from serpents and humans, a necrophidius
is animated by occult magic, not unlife. Each necrophidius is built from the
skeleton of a large snake, but its skull has been replaced by that of a humanoid
creature. Some death cults or particularly cruel crafters seek out the skulls of
speciﬁc individuals against whom they bear grudges to provide the head for their
necrophidius. The ﬁnal step of the construction is the alteration of the teeth and
jaws to give the creature a more serpentine visage, complete with fangs.
If a necrophidius’s creator dies, the construct follows the last series of commands
it was given. If it cannot do so, the necrophidius aimlessly wanders the area near
where it last served its creator and attacks any creatures it encounters. Some believe
that those who know the secrets of a necrophidius’s origins can command it,
provided its original creator no longer exists and no one else currently commands
it. There are also a number of reports concerning strangely aware and intelligent
necrophidiuses that roam with a purpose and track down or hunt speciﬁc living
creatures they interpret as the targets of former assassination missions.

and becomes ﬂat-footed until the end of the

DC cumulatively decreases by 1 for each save
attempted. A creature that succeeds at this save is
temporarily immune to necrophidic paralysis for 24 hours.

GRAY OOZE ADAPTABILITY
Gray oozes have shown the astounding
ability to overcome environmental
challenges by changing their qualities.
For example, some gray oozes have
adapted to fully aquatic environments,
replacing their movement with a swim
speed and gaining a paralytic poison
similar to that of gelatinous cubes.
Other gray oozes have become charged
with psychic energy, gaining the ability
to cause nearby creatures to become
confused, fascinated, or frightened for
a short time.

VERDUROUS OOZE
Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places
where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes
are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or
artiﬁcial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep
verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.

space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy to push).

OTHER PLANAR SCIONS
Two other planar scions are the
entropy-infused ganzi and their polar
opposites, the orderly aphorites,
scions of chaos and law respectively.
Eﬀect A swift gale whips up between the sylph sneak and the source of the ranged
attack, giving the sneak a +3 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the
attack misses, the wind deﬂected it. The wind can’t deﬂect unusually large or heavy
ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts).

Sneak Attack The sylph sneak’s Strikes deal 1d6 extra precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
Surprise Attacker On the ﬁrst round of combat, creatures that haven’t acted yet
are ﬂat-footed to the sylph sneak.
Wind’s Guidance When the sylph sneak attacks with a thrown weapon, the range
increment increases by 10 feet.
UNDINE
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the
briny deep ﬂows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and
lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how
much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming
communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter
case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number
dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
The undines who ﬁll these communities
are similarly diverse, bringing aspects
of multiple cultures together to
form one whole. Ship-towns are
permanent, but ﬂuid—they grow,
recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add
their ships to or remove them from the ﬂotilla. An
undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
residents coming ashore only on rare occasions
to collect wood for cookﬁres or to repair their
homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence
of these communities reﬂects the undine virtues of adaptability and
freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these ﬂoating settlements, if only
for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.

QLIPPOTH REALMS
Although it is widely accepted
that qlippoth have lost incalculable
territory in the Abyss to demonkind,
these ﬁends still control vast regions
in the deepest reaches of that plane.
Some sages suggest the troubling
possibility that perhaps qlippoth still
hold more territory of the Abyss than
demons do, but because demons are
more concerned with mortal life, we
simply interact with the layers they
control more often. For all we know,
these dour sages postulate, the
Abyss teems with endless swarms of
qlippoth that have yet to make their
move against mortal life.

THE WITCH-TREE
The ﬁrst sard was created when
the Eldest known as the Green
Mother beckoned the sky’s rage to
strike the eldest oak in her domain,
transforming the tree into a living
siege engine. This original sard still
stands sentinel in the Hanging Bower
of the First World.
Sard
An immense, gnarled, tree awoken with raw, primal power by one of the fey Eldest of
the First World, this monster—one of the legendary Tane—skitters on huge, spidery
roots and thrashes its branches as ﬁery lightning courses within its blackened bark,
a living manifestation of the violent clash between ancient forest and stormy sky.

ODDS AND ENDS
Scarecrows hold a certain liminal space
that is inhabitable by spirit creatures.
Ghosts in particular can use their
malevolent possession on a scarecrow
as if it were a living creature, using
them as vehicles to escape their site-
bound nature and so further spread
their murder and mayhem.
Scarecrow
A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow construct
is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to life. As it
animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch ﬂame, sending
fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in
its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination
of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar
materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction
makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of
battle. Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself
into a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes.
When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator’s
blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny
sliver of the creator’s soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than
enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to
follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When
a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion
of the creator’s soul never returns.

condition below 1 as long as it is in the aura’s emanation.
When a creature enters or starts its turn in the aura, it
must attempt a DC 18 Will save. Birds and other avian creatures
take a –2 circumstance penalty to this save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is then temporarily
immune for 24 hours.

scarecrow until the end of its next turn.

emanation (and dim light to the next 20 feet). If the scarecrow uses this
ability on the ﬁrst round of combat, any creature that has not acted yet is
startled and becomes ﬂat-footed against the scarecrow for 1 round. It can
suppress the light by using this action again.
Clawing Fear The scarecrow’s strikes deal an additional 1d6 mental damage to frightened
creatures.
Mundane Appearance Ȱɵ (concentrate) Until it acts, the scarecrow resembles an ordinary
scarecrow. It has an automatic result of 32 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as
an ordinary scarecrow.

SCEADUINAR CRYSTALS
Sceaduinar congregate on the great
crystalline knots of negative energy
that accrete in the Negative Energy
Plane. Sceaduinar prod treelike crystal
growths to produce dangerous items
akin to spheres of annihilation or
great structures that echo with eerie
chimes. Sceaduinar also stimulate
these aggregations of crystals to yield
other sceaduinar and similar hateful
creatures of unlife.
Sceaduinar
Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the Negative Energy
Plane, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all
life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces,
sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.
These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind.
Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part,
though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar
sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of
life that ﬁnd their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in
undead creatures.
When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in
great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the
Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for
extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a
plane where negative energy isn’t the rule doesn’t improve these creatures’
attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent
when encountered in such realms.

THE DESERT RIDER
Those rescued from death in the
burning sands often recount the
same dying vision: a strange,
silver‑eyed woman whose scarlet
silk tents stand on the back of a
colossal black scorpion, riding out
of a shattered city and leading an
army of the dead across a sea of
glass toward the world of the living.
Millennium‑old paintings on the
walls of rediscovered tombs depict
a similar desert rider. The identity of
this red‑robed woman is unknown.
Scorpion
Scorpions are frightening enough at their normal diminutive size, but when they
grow to reach or surpass the size of a human, they become absolutely terrifying.
CAVE SCORPION
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of
their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of
the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack
humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure
scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.

THE HEADLESS KING
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti
heroine named Savith in the era
before Earthfall, and now the so-called
Headless King’s body prowls aimlessly
in the Darklands. That the decapitated
god’s clerics still gain power from
worship points to Ydersius’s tenacity
and continued existence, after a
fashion. Those who seek to recover
his skull and return it to his body
hope that doing so will restore both
him and the sekmin civilization to
their full power.
Serpentfolk
Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk
were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive
today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not
quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have
diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons.
Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic
are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with
a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind,
resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall
of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos
made ﬂesh.”
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk
empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source
of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts.
Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule
having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote
reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within,
a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few
cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk
settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles,
far-ﬂung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement
to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves
to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the
practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods,
and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning
to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of
accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius,
their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the
Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are
so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially
since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young
at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that
even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss
or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely
to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk
colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the
earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies,
bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk
conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large
number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own
passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant.
A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss
question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive
on selﬁsh desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love
for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving
expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such
as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study
of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful
illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss
believes themself to have more reﬁned tastes than their peers.
YDERSIUS
The serpentfolk god is not dead, but in his decapitated
state, he might as well be. Reduced to a feral, animalistic

SKAVELING INTELLECT
As a curious side eﬀect of its
creation, a skaveling absorbs many
of the memories and thoughts of the
ghoul brains it was fed. While it was
merely an oversized animal in life,
in undeath these memories coalesce
into a strange form of intelligence
that aﬀords the skaveling the ability
to speak and reason, all the better to
serve its urdefhan masters.
Skaveling
Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that
are not true ghouls but instead are speciﬁcally crafted undead creatures. Their creators
are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant
bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the ﬂesh of ghouls—especially
brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are
ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil (Core Rulebook 551). While this poison
simply rots away the ﬂesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats
will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.
Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of
ﬂight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use
skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that
of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere
mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can
reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them,
and they never take actions in a ﬁght that would knowingly put their masters in
harm’s way.

SKRIK NETTLE HARVESTING
Skrik nettle venom is magical in
nature and deteriorates swiftly. A
character with alchemist’s tools can
harvest a single dose of skrik nettle
venom from a skrik nettle that has
been dead no longer than an hour
with a successful DC 24 Crafting
check, which transforms the ﬂuid
into a standard potion of ﬂying.
Skrik Nettle
The expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarre-
looking creatures that resemble large jellyﬁshes. A fringe of brightly colored
feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in
a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above
the First World in ﬂocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the
fey realm’s cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack
their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to ﬂoat
helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their
helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the
poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.
Skrik nettles that ﬁnd their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the
First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies
that they ﬁnd comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent.
The ﬁrst few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend
to be ﬁlled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby
creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are
somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming
the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and
does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who ﬁnd themselves
marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and
they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.

A levitating creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to
attack rolls. It can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself
and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If it’s
adjacent to a ﬁxed object or stable terrain, it can move across
the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical) or crawling
(if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). A ﬂying
creature can move normally but still increases its altitude as
appropriate from the venom. A creature that can’t ﬂy falls as
soon as it recovers from skrik nettle venom.

SKULK TREASURE
The greediness of skulks and
their easy relationship with
violence means the creatures often
accumulate a fair amount of valuable
coin and items. They prefer ﬁne
weapons above all else and jealously
protect such ﬁnds. Since clothing
inhibits their natural camouﬂage,
skulks either store this treasure in
a secure location or carry it in such
a way that their bodies block what
they are carrying from sight.
Skulk
The cowardly and lazy skulks live on the fringes of organized societies and steal
from others without a second thought. Even murder is merely another necessity,
and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and
taking what they want.
Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks
difﬁcult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of
large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically
travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger
than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see
themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a
strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared
purpose for very long.
Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around
sewers and the like, are skulks’ favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow
them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording
them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare
occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves’
guild and become sought after for difﬁcult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and
overwhelming selﬁshness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-
lasting leadership roles.
A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human.
Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent
end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of
violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who
remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles
as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for
eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one
band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after
throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to
the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate
attempt to track down such an exile.

SLUGS OF WAR
Subterranean cultures like
urdefhans and xulgaths sometimes
turn giant slugs into war beasts.
The creatures’ primitive minds make
them easy to control for anyone
who knows a few simple tactics—
mostly ways of keeping them
well-fed until just before battle and
methods of guiding them in the
right direction as they rampage.
Slug
These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through
swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat ﬂesh
or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare
entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they ﬁrst
shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth—
to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully
acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip
that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near
swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many
almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each
giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into
proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated,
and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these
eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.
Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry
weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides
of bridges, or even fortiﬁcations like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break.
Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but
instead ﬁnds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant
slugs don’t have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in
particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily
compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable,
so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.

SPECTRAL THRALLS
Specters often keep a few humanoid
thralls to torment, preventing the
agony of pain starvation, but since
they can’t minimize the negative
damage they inﬂict with their vile
touch, humanoid thralls who are too
low level generally don’t last long.
Specter
When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its
death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others—particularly
humanoids—in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can. A
specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted
sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with.
A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly
agonized and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a
release from agony through death.

obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at

them to bite their ﬂesh in order
to get their ﬁx—a tactic that often
backﬁres awfully as the spiders feed.
Spider
Spiders range dramatically in size, yet all are to some extent venomous.
DREAM SPIDER
A dream spider’s webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same
hallucinogenic compound as the creature’s toxin. Originally denizens of tropical
jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly
thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to
produce the drug known as shiver.

OTHER SPORTLEBORES
While the creature presented here
is the most common of its type,
the sportlebore is in fact an entire
family of insects that specialize in
mimicking everyday objects. Other
varieties of sportlebore include the
spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore;
the corpse-eating sportlegore; and
the sportleglug, which is so small it
can burrow into leather wineskins
and drink their contents without
the bag spilling a drop. Like the
sportlebore, most of these vermin
aren’t too dangerous as individuals
but can turn into a real problem if
their numbers are left unchecked.
Sportlebore
The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin
that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or
jerky, a sportlebore can ﬂawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by ﬂexing, contorting,
and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding
under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into
a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking
any creatures it thinks it can consume.
SPORTLEBORE
On its own, a single sportlebore functions as a hazard rather than a creature.

Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature gets a mouthful of sportlebores. It spits the
insects out and avoids further damage, but it can’t speak for 1
round, and if it was performing a verbal spellcasting action, the
spell fails and the caster wastes the action.
Failure The creature takes 4d6 piercing damage from sportlebore
bites, can’t speak for 1 round, and loses a
spell as noted under Success.
Critical Failure As failure, but
the creature is also exposed to
sportlebore infestation.

REDEEMED SPRIGGANS
A spriggan’s nature is rooted
deeply in its inability to feel joy
and pleasure, and as such, non-evil
spriggans are rare. Yet they are not
unheard of. A spriggan who manages
to turn back on their inherent
nature loses their ability to assume
enormous size, and always becomes
a hated (if not feared) exile from
their clan. Such a spriggan never
fully transforms into a gnome, but
those who embrace redemption often
discover strange new powers waiting
for them to master, such as the
ability to draw upon the First World
to heal themselves and allies, or the
power to transform into actual fey
creatures for a short period of time.
Spriggan
When the gnomes ﬁrst emigrated from the First World so many eons ago, some
found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense
of joy. Seeing only the threat of the new world and none of its wonders, these
gnomes grimly resolved to survive no matter what the cost. Their innate magic
responded to this goal by twisting them in mind and body over the course of
many generations, eventually transforming them into the creatures known today
as spriggans.
Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for
their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy
such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in
spriggan society to ﬁll the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of
positivity. Today, the best a spriggan can manage in place of positive emotions is
a muted satisfaction when they make another creature suffer.
Spriggans resemble muted, hairless gnomes with oversized, pointed ears and
an alien, feral appearance. Many of them are gaunt and haggard. Skin tones vary
across all different shades of blue, from a pale sky color to a deep midnight.
Unlike their more cheerful and optimistic kin, spriggans do not become afﬂicted
by the bleaching, a fact that many of their kind smugly hold up as proof that
their ancestors’ choice to abandon joy was the right one.
While spriggans can specialize in a wide range of skills, one feature they all
share is the capacity to transform into lumbering, hulking incarnations of their
normally small frames. By drawing upon the void left behind in their souls,
they reﬂect the anger and cruelty in their minds and physically transform into
giant versions of themselves akin to ogres in stature; however, this rage-induced
change takes a toll on their bodies. The longer a spriggan remains in giant form,
the more pain and agony they have waiting for them when, inevitably, they
revert to their true size. Yet this promise of pain does not deter a spriggan from
using their power to grow in size, for it’s only when they assume gargantuan
proportions that they can truly feel joy and satisfaction. That spriggans feel these
emotions only when they are bullying smaller creatures, ﬁghting enemies (or
even allies), or inﬂicting pain on victims speaks to the depths of their corruption.
SPRIGGAN BULLY
The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in ﬁghts, but
only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and
abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inﬂict the maximum
amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying
prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching
others ﬁght, and ﬁghting among themselves.

SPRIGGAN DISTRACTIONS
As a culture, most spriggans live for
battle and constantly patrol their
territories in hopes of encountering
trespassers to capture and victimize.
Even so, spriggans sometimes need to
relax. Since they lack the capacity for
pleasure, games, art, and similar leisure
activities are lost on them. Instead,
they ﬁll their idle time training for
combat, watching others ﬁght to the
death, crafting weapons, or plotting
against their kin for personal gain.
the eﬀect extends until the end of the following turn. When Enraged Growth ends, the
spriggan bully is fatigued for 1 hour.

SPRIGGAN WARLORD
While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors
with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan
weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional ﬁghting style for
its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords
often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, ﬁlling roles in spriggan society
akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty.
In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is
typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.

GIANT SQUID TACTICS
The giant squid attacks by lashing
out with its longest tentacles and
then rapidly pulling the prey toward
itself. While closing the distance
between them, it attacks again,
this time closing its smaller arms
around the prey. Once it has the prey
thoroughly trapped, the giant squid
tears and cuts with its beak and the
teeth-lined saw it has in the place of
a tongue.
Squid
The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a
nautical tale.
VAMPIRE SQUID
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead
inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms.
Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of
bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.

OTHER TATZLWYRMS
People in some regions claim to have
seen creatures that are just like
tatzlwyrms in most respects—a long
body, two arms, and a head—except
that they have traits that are not
of reptilian origin. Travelers on a
savanna should beware a furry,
lion-headed tatzlwyrm protecting its
cubs, while those in the mountains
might be attacked by a feathered
(but wingless) variant with the head
of an eagle.
Tatzlwyrm
Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon’s head.
Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of
intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their
ability to reason is limited and they can’t use magic. They do possess a level of
cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and
even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don’t expect to ﬁnd a
tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.
Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons,
though it’s a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as
messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due
to their smaller size), guides (when they’re familiar with a particular mountain),
and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon’s direct attention).
Tatzlwyrms don’t work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.
Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they
seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable
occasion, townsfolk reported being brieﬂy overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conﬂict
between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still
debate whether the cause of the inﬂux was the sudden change in weather or if the
creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part
of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.
When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed,
they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales’ natural
camouﬂage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching
poisonous vapor into an opponent’s face. Since this breath attack doesn’t have
much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes ﬁrst and bring them close
to their mouth.

VELSTRACS ON GOLARION
Velstracs are most often
encountered in the shadowy realm
of Nidal, where the state worship
of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced.
Indeed, many velstracs are created
from the souls of Joyful Things,
devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have
had their limbs amputated to focus
their minds on the veneration of
pain, sacriﬁce, and torment.

other creatures, such as a hero’s sword-arm or an angel’s
pinions. Eremites capture these specimens to clinically
test their true limits, then harvest specimens
and add them to their own bodies. An
eremite might attach tongues to their
hand as extra ﬁngers or a ﬁst to
the back of their neck in a horrid
“improvement.” Eremites average
7 feet tall and weigh approximately 200 pounds.
