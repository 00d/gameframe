SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit
ﬁend ﬂying through the Astral Plane.

SOLAR GENESIS
Unlike most angels, solars are
created from divine energy,
sometimes blended with good souls.
They are joined in this distinction by
the ancient empyrean angels.

a +2 status bonus to AC against evil creatures and a +2 status bonus to saves
against eﬀects from evil creatures. The bonus increases to +4 against control by
evil creatures and attacks by evil summoned creatures. When the solar or an ally
is hit by an attack from a creature in the aura, that foe must succeed at a DC 43
Will save or be blinded for 1 minute (this is an
incapacitation eﬀect). It’s then temporarily
immune for 1 minute.

Animate Weapon Ǻȓ Trigger The solar hits with a melee weapon
Strike while Animate Weapon is not already in eﬀect; Eﬀect The
solar’s weapon leaps into the air and moves with the solar as
if held with both hands. The weapon gains the eﬀects of the
dancing weapon rune for 1 minute.
Arrow of Mortality The solar doesn’t need to provide
ammunition for their bow. When they draw their
bow, they create a magical arrow of light that sheds
bright light in a 20-foot radius until the end of the
solar’s next turn. On a critical hit with the arrow, if
the target has 75 or fewer Hit Points after taking
the damage, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes
dying 1 (or, if it was already dying, increases its
dying value by 3).

Bestiary 2
Animate Dream
An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and
dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams.
In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers
ﬂee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a
supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek
similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together,
they merge into a horriﬁc form as an animate dream.
Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most
take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned
them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly
encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes
that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these
forms, animate dreams ﬁnd their way out of the Dreamlands and into the
waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a
relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.
An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and
fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the
minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link
to that individual’s dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all
manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the
victim ﬁnds it more and more difﬁcult to remain awake. In the end,
the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot
return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form
of fear and are its preferred sustenance.
An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular
nightmares, but these lesser fears aren’t as satisfying, often driving the
animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an
animate dream won’t starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent
and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often
encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue
more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also
tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown
metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a speciﬁc
nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean
waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have
similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.

# STAR ARCHON
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
HEAVENLY MOUNTAIN
Archons reside in Heaven, a plane that
appears as a single massive mountain.
Heaven is broken into seven tiers, with
most archons occupying the second
level and base of army operations,
Proelera, or the sixth level, Iudica, the
administrative heart of Heaven.

tale describe the experience in terms that might beﬁt the sight of a supernova at
the instant the star collapses in on itself.

Blinding Soul (divine, evocation, light, visual) Whenever the star archon takes slashing
damage, bright light pours from their wounds. Non-archons within 10 feet must
attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature is dazzled for 1 round. On
a critical failure, the creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds instead. The creature is then
temporarily immune for 1 round.
Explosive Rebirth (death, divine, evocation, ﬁre, good) When killed, the star archon
explodes in a blinding ﬂash of holy energy that deals 12d6 ﬁre damage and 12d6
good damage to anything in a 100-foot emanation, with a DC 40 basic Reﬂex
save. A non-archon creature that sees the explosion and critically fails its save is
permanently blinded as well. The slain star archon reincarnates 1d4 rounds later
as a shield archon (Bestiary 29).
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ A star archon can also make a Retributive Strike by throwing
its starknife, and the enemy and ally can be within 60 feet instead of 15 feet.
Speed 35 feet, ﬂy 75 feet

Archon’s Door As hound archon.
Prudent Asterism ʚʖ The star archon calculates a celestial
constellation and sends their starknife ﬂying along that
path from one foe to the next. It makes a starknife Strike
against a target within 60 feet. If the Strike hits, it can
make another Strike at a diﬀerent target within 60 feet of the ﬁrst target, and so on,
until it misses with a Strike or runs out of targets it hasn’t attacked within range of
the most recent target. The star archon can attack a given target only once per use
of this ability. These attacks don’t apply any range increment penalty, and the star
archon resolves all the attacks before increasing the multiple attack penalty.
BASTION ARCHON
The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly
uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons
converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a ﬁght that seems all
but lost, a fellow archon of signiﬁcant strength—such as a star archon—
can commit a brave act of self-sacriﬁce by dimensionally transposing
itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is
with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacriﬁce, but instead the
earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of
archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind’s greatest hope.

================================================================================
PAGE 26
================================================================================

ARMORED ARCHONS
Always ready to defend others, most
archons are never encountered out of
their suits of armor. Even those who
eschew armor, such as the bastion
archon, tend to still appear as if they
are wearing heavy protection against
the scourge of battle.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven’s Holy
Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt
that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of
sacriﬁce, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested,
and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness
upon the surrounding region.

HELLFIRE
Stinking, sulfurous hellﬁre is infused
with evil. Hellﬁre always deals a
combination of ﬁre damage and evil
damage, though the speciﬁc ratio
depends on the hellﬁre’s origin. Certain
types of hellﬁre can impose other
eﬀects on creatures as well, such as
sapping their strength or memories.

OSYLUTH (BONE DEVIL)
An osyluth is an unparalleled inquisitor that revels
in the sadism and torture for which Hell is so well
known. These devils’ charge is to seek out heresies,
both among mortals and among other ﬁends—a
commandment they uphold with unwavering
fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps
of Hell’s ﬁfth layer, Stygia; where heresies and
the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually
rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell,
they build massive, calciﬁed hives where they perform their vile
interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils
and petitioners alike.

Bestiary 2
HELLMOUTHS
While travel to and from Hell is
possible with plane shift, another
way to reach and traverse the
infernal realms is via hellmouths,
strange living portals connecting
diﬀerent layers or even diﬀerent
planes. A hellmouth takes the form
of a grimacing face, distended
maw, or other distressingly organic
aperture, and no two share the
same appearance. Most are carefully
guarded, but some new or well-hidden
hellmouths have yet to be discovered.

MAGICAL DINOSAURS
In a fantasy setting, magical eﬀects
or supernatural inﬂuences can
enhance dinosaurs by giving them
unexpected attacks, modes of
movement, or other abilities. You can
quickly create a memorable magical
beast simply by giving a dinosaur the
magical attack of another creature of
an equal level, such as a spinosaurus
gaining an acidic breath weapon akin
to that of an adult black dragon.
sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to
make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy
maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture
spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong
dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances
make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those
who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals
or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to ﬁght for the amusement of
others won’t discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones
seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus’s appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just
giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals
into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus’s potential. More
so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to ﬂeshwarping
procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance
the creatures’ viability
as effective guardians.

DOLPHINS TO THE RESCUE
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual
trait—they often come to the aid of
other creatures in distress, such as to
save a drowning person or to protect
someone from the attack of a shark.
Not every monster in this book
wants to hurt player characters—
consider having a dolphin come to
an endangered PC’s rescue if the
situation merits!
Dolphin
Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite
social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans.
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin.
They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups
called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell tales of how
they save drowning ﬁshers or kill sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.

DRAKES AND DRAGONS
Although drakes and dragons are
related to one another, little love is
lost between them, and even the
most territorial drakes know better
than to remain in a dragon’s territory
longer than they have to. In rare
cases, large rampages of drakes band
together to attack an encroaching
dragon, especially if the dragon is
young and inexperienced.
Drake
Distant cousins to dragons, drakes menace and terrorize settlements.
SHADOW DRAKE
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their
species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales
and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception
to the norm for drakes and dragons.

DRAKE LOCATIONS
While the diﬀerent species of drakes
are adapted to diﬀerent climates and

as cliﬀside or mountaintop caverns,
jungle canopies, and so on.
Creatures within the burst take 3d6 cold damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save). The explosion

DRAUGR SHIPS
When an entire ship’s crew dies
in one calamity, they might rise
simultaneously, bound together in
death. Tirelessly plaguing the seas,
these draugr crews slowly corrupt
their vessels. The cursed ships often
exhibit unsettling phenomena, such
as being able to sail against the wind
or leaving schools of dead ﬁsh in
their wake. Sea shanties tell of draugr
raiders approaching during the night,
wreathed in fog pierced only by the
green glow emanating from their eyes.
Draugr
Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of
the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed,
barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can’t speak, but
expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally
drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living
creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs
often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the
depths with even more dead.
Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative
energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the
sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a
corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it ﬁnally rises. Proximity to intelligent
life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a
shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures
don’t take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.
Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as
mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work
song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures
have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but
providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the
beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the
draugr, reafﬁrming their desire for blood and death.
More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr
captains. They’re 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments
(page 6) that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell
three times per day.

DIVERSE ELEMENTALS
The Elemental Planes are more
than expanses of sky, rock, ﬁre,

SAND MIMICS
Sand sentries have no true culture
or society of their own, but they
are endlessly fascinated with the
society and culture of humanoids
they encounter. They can shape their
appearance to mimic any similarly
sized humanoids, and although
they always remain obviously
composed of sand, they do their best
to mimic the day-to-day activities
they observe other humanoids
performing. Of course, structures
and objects sand sentries build from
sand never last, but this never seems
to stiﬂe their obsession.

MEPHIT NAMES
Perhaps because they’re so often
compelled into service by mortal
conjurers and more powerful
elementals, mephits tend to adopt long

titles and imagined or exaggerated
accomplishments to alleviate their
feelings of inadequacy. Some examples
of mephit names follow.

the Tragic Hero, One Against All

SHADOW GIANT LOCATIONS
Some shadow giants travel to the
Material Plane to serve as agents
in Nidal’s Umbral Court. Rumors of
these massive shock troops deployed
by the court’s mysterious members
are common, and such rumors often
place them in the mountains near
Cheliax and Molthune.
Protected by the Ancestors by performing a 10-minute prayer as an activity that has

Throw Rock Ȱɵ
SHADOW GIANT
Shadow giants are ﬁerce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in
perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether
the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On
the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life
as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms.
These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages
to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing
foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their
kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist,
keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in
high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter,
shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous
warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with
outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors
who show the giants the respect and deference they feel
they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants
worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are
so ﬁrmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their
Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize
them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient
religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes
of sacriﬁce and self-mutilation.

CARRION GOLEM COMPONENTS
The decaying body parts that make
up a carrion golem are of little
value in most cultures. However,
the magic used to preserve them
and infuse them with disease can
still be harnessed by unscrupulous
necromancers and other practitioners
of foul arts. Such creatures may
be willing to purchase a destroyed
carrion golem, but the processes
used to extract the power within the
pieces are diﬃcult and ineﬃcient, so
they won’t pay much.
Golems
The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity
of its crafter. Over the ages, skilled minds and hands have reﬁned the formulas
for creating speciﬁc types of golems, resulting in the development of common
forms. The secrets of creating the types of golems presented here may be
guarded within the halls of famous golemworks or the forgotten libraries of
many worlds.
GOLEM ANTIMAGIC
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each
type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions
are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing
here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell
can affect the golem.
• Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the
listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual eﬀect. If the
golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is aﬀected by a persistent
eﬀect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
• Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the
slowed condition and gain Hit Points equal to half the damage the spell would have
dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the Hit
Points listed in the parenthetical.
• Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1
for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual eﬀect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of
this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
• Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more speciﬁc spells, with the
eﬀects described in its stat block.
CARRION GOLEM
Carrion golems are foul-smelling and ﬂyswarmed amalgams of putreﬁed parts
stitched together from many different
creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion
golems only rarely are given a humanoid
form, instead appearing more twisted and
bestial in frame. As a result, some students of
golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn’t
a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these
foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits,
including their signiﬁcant immunities. What is true is
that most who craft carrion golems don’t do so out
of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but
for the golem’s ability to spread disease. The crafters
of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause
immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and
death behind them.

# SUNFLOWER LESHY
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
LESHY COMMUNITIES
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when
interacting with their own kind.
Most communities are meritocracies,
rewarding leshys who defend their
communities and help each other
succeed, and they see working together
as the best path to a successful future.
Leshy
These intelligent plant creatures maintain complex societies in remote wildernesses
and places of primal power. By working together, leshys help to defend powerful
fey and druidic sites from interloping humanoids. They often have good relations
with local fey and druidic orders but distrust most other humanoids.
A primal spell caster, often a druid, can create a leshy by binding a nature spirit
to a carefully crafted body grown from speciﬁc vegetation. The details of these
rites vary based on the type of leshy, but all are carefully guarded secrets and tend
to take place in sacred areas associated with nature or primal magic, such as a
druid circle or dryad grove.
SUNFLOWER LESHY
Sunﬂower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind.
Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a
serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their
eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they
become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant
coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts
in coloration are echoed in sunﬂower leshy art, which
can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For
example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place
of glowing lava and ﬂickering ﬂames, drawing upon
many vibrant colors, but to a sunﬂower leshy, the only
proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays,
blacks, and whites.
The more adventurous sunﬂower leshys leave their
communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of
humanoids. When interacting with humanoids,
sunﬂower leshys are some of the most likely
to act friendly and give strangers a chance to
prove their good intentions, though they remain
cautious. They’re often accompanied by other,
more powerful leshys.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The sunﬂower leshy

from their head in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within
the area (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save). It gains a +2 status bonus to this damage against
dazzled creatures. The sunﬂower leshy can’t use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
FLYTRAP LESHY
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, ﬂytrap leshys get along well with other
leshys. Nonetheless, they’re among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the
most vulnerable places in the natural world with their ﬂytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of ﬂytrap leshys band together to create
amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal
defense suffuses ﬂytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between
multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight
humanoids—to a ﬂytrap leshy, though, there’s nothing strange about sharing your
innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your
home from an enemy.

# SHOAL LINNORM
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
LINNORM LEGENDS
Creatures as powerful as linnorms
tend to spawn stories of their own,
accurate or not. Critical failure on
a check to Recall Knowledge on
linnorms might suggest that you
can avoid a linnorm’s death curse by
closing your eyes as you deliver the
fatal blow, or that rubbing poison
oak on yourself can ward oﬀ a
linnorm’s attention.
Linnorm
The powerful, serpentine beings known as linnorms may be distantly related
to the more well-known chromatic and metallic dragons, but their draconic
physiologies are where any such similarities end. Whereas true dragons boast
incredible intellectual capabilities and far-reaching plans, linnorms are driven
only by their insatiable hunger and desire to inﬂict cruelty on others. Linnorms
are exceptionally difﬁcult to outwit due to their strong wills, and it’s not wise
to try bargaining with them—when faced with one of these legendary beasts,
one’s best option is ﬂight, pure and simple. Failing that, a noble death is a viable
back-up plan.
Extremely powerful linnorms dwell in remote parts of the world. One such
creature is the legendary Fafnheir, the Father of All Linnorms, said to be the oldest
and mightiest linnorm of them all. Fafnheir’s death curse causes anyone who
would slay him to slowly erode away physically and mentally until they die, at
which point the cursed victim’s body fuels Fafnheir’s resurrection.
SHOAL LINNORM
Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither
along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek
out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer
ﬁshers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may
even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the
town’s defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt
large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred
quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich
in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the ﬁery steam that
courses through their veins.

NEWBORN LINNORMS
Almost all linnorms lead solitary
lives; they are too reprehensible for
even their own kind to tolerate for
any length of time. Most species do
not even meet to reproduce; rather,
female linnorms usually deposit a
solitary egg in a remote location,
which a wandering male linnorm
then fertilizes and places in a nook
suitable for incubation. Newborn
linnorms range in size from that of
adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls,
and their growth is rapid. Even a
juvenile linnorm is strong enough to
wreak havoc on a small settlement—
though most don’t dare to commit
such audacious pillaging, for fear of
evoking the anger of another, larger
linnorm in the area.

or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 ﬁre damage (DC 36 Reﬂex save negates).
During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight,
turning the area into diﬃcult terrain. All creatures in the steam become concealed,
and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The shoal
linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

FJORD LINNORM
Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in
the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as
they swim up the fjords for which they’re named, they are as vile as any other of
their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their
terriﬁed crews.

Like hags, spirit nagas occasionally
form small groups of their own kind.
They normally do this for mutual
protection against a greater threat
or to accomplish a goal that a single
spirit naga cannot complete on their
own. Sometimes, spirit nagas form
a coven to bring groups of cultists
together or take over a city or other
large community, and in rare cases a
spirit naga might even join a hag or
witch coven.
Lunar Naga Venom (poison, sleep) Saving Throw DC 24; Maximum Duration 6 rounds;
Stage 1 stupeﬁed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 as stage 1 (1 round); Stage 3 stupeﬁed 2 (1 round);
Stage 4 unconscious (1 round). Once a creature falls unconscious from lunar naga
venom, they remain asleep for 1d8 hours unless woken.
SPIRIT NAGA
In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place
similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives
of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they
can beneﬁt from the spirit naga’s powers without paying a heavy price—for most
who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.
Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and
corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards,
crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may
know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to
the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth
and stones there.
Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit
nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.
They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are
revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of
“civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship
of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They
often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and
rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread
the nagas’ foul inﬂuence throughout a community.

OTHER NECROPHIDIUSES
Ultimately, a necrophidius’s abilities
are the result of its creators’
designs. Some have diﬀerent
immunities or have bites that deal
poison, cold, or negative damage
instead of inﬂicting paralysis. There
are even rumors of soulbound
necrophidiuses whose creators
arranged for the soul of the skull’s
donor to empower the construct.
These necrophidiuses are not only
sentient but also have the facility to
reason and even cast spells.
Necrophidius
Although the necrophidius is a mindless construct with no particular ability to
comprehend the complexities of good or evil, these sinister-looking constructs are
often crafted by evil or macabre creators seeking to imbue their guardians with a
frightening aesthetic.
Constructed from bones harvested from serpents and humans, a necrophidius
is animated by occult magic, not unlife. Each necrophidius is built from the
skeleton of a large snake, but its skull has been replaced by that of a humanoid
creature. Some death cults or particularly cruel crafters seek out the skulls of
speciﬁc individuals against whom they bear grudges to provide the head for their
necrophidius. The ﬁnal step of the construction is the alteration of the teeth and
jaws to give the creature a more serpentine visage, complete with fangs.
If a necrophidius’s creator dies, the construct follows the last series of commands
it was given. If it cannot do so, the necrophidius aimlessly wanders the area near
where it last served its creator and attacks any creatures it encounters. Some believe
that those who know the secrets of a necrophidius’s origins can command it,
provided its original creator no longer exists and no one else currently commands
it. There are also a number of reports concerning strangely aware and intelligent
necrophidiuses that roam with a purpose and track down or hunt speciﬁc living
creatures they interpret as the targets of former assassination missions.

# SLIME MOLD
================================================================================


SLIME MOLD FUNGI
The particularly foul environments
in which slime molds dwell are
conducive to the growth of extremely
potent and dangerous mushrooms
and other fungi. A dead slime mold
can be a source of enough materials
to produce a few doses of deathcap
powder or other types of poison.
Some creatures, such as deros or
those with inherent immunity to
disease, cultivate slime molds in order
to harvest these materials.

the creature (DC 17, 1d6 acid, Escape DC 17, Rupture 3).
Weak Acid As amoeba swarm.
SLIME MOLD
A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick
layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares
a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive
system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains
perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with
disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with
a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horriﬁc disease that painfully breaks
down a victim’s ﬂesh. At ﬁrst, the disease manifests as painful rashes and
agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the ﬂesh of the affected creature
actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature’s spores continue
to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open
and release a brand new slime mold.

GRAY OOZE
These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes,
or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or
patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims
to reach down for a drink or step into what
appears to be a puddle, then lash out
with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare
and consume their hapless prey.

GRAY OOZE ADAPTABILITY
Gray oozes have shown the astounding
ability to overcome environmental
challenges by changing their qualities.
For example, some gray oozes have
adapted to fully aquatic environments,
replacing their movement with a swim
speed and gaining a paralytic poison
similar to that of gelatinous cubes.
Other gray oozes have become charged
with psychic energy, gaining the ability
to cause nearby creatures to become
confused, fascinated, or frightened for
a short time.

UNDINE
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the
briny deep ﬂows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and
lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how
much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming
communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter
case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number
dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
The undines who ﬁll these communities
are similarly diverse, bringing aspects
of multiple cultures together to
form one whole. Ship-towns are
permanent, but ﬂuid—they grow,
recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add
their ships to or remove them from the ﬂotilla. An
undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
residents coming ashore only on rare occasions
to collect wood for cookﬁres or to repair their
homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence
of these communities reﬂects the undine virtues of adaptability and
freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these ﬂoating settlements, if only
for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.

# SHOGGTI
================================================================================


QLIPPOTH AND MORTALS
As qlippoth lost territory to their
demonic rivals, they realized that the
only way to stem the tide of demonic
forces was to starve them of the
sinful souls that the Abyss uses to
spawn new demons. While qlippoth
have no concept of how they
might go about preventing sin by
changing the way mortals act, they
do understand that exterminating
mortal life would solve the problem
as well.
SHOGGTI
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims,
bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no
doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lampreylike mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its
forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

these ﬁends still control vast regions

Some sages suggest the troubling
possibility that perhaps qlippoth still
hold more territory of the Abyss than
demons do, but because demons are
more concerned with mortal life, we
simply interact with the layers they
control more often. For all we know,
these dour sages postulate, the

qlippoth that have yet to make their

OTHER RAYS
Stingrays and manta rays are among
the most common species of these
ﬁsh, but others dwell in more remote
areas. The dangerous blood ray is
an ambush predator that dwells in
murky swamp waters and drains
creature’s blood after paralyzing them
with its sting, while the immense
leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator
that has a deadly mouth capable of
swallowing small ships whole.
Ray
Rays are an unusual type of ﬁsh with wide, sail-like ﬁns and long tails, giving them
an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have
a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical
charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent
in its accuracy.
STINGRAY
Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when
threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their
toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and
unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray
is a sureﬁre way to receive a painful sting.

eat larger ﬁsh or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but
rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater
cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta
rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets.
Manta rays don’t make particularly good mounts, but some
aquatic civilizations use them to draw underwater carriages.

OTHER DEVILS
For over a decade, the legend of
the Sandpoint Devil has persisted
in western Varisia. Most hold that
it’s the fantasy of simple folk and
booze-ﬁlled bellies, but locals insist
it exists. Other creatures akin to
the Sandpoint Devil might exist
elsewhere in the world, with slight
variations on their innate spells and
the nature of their Accursed Breath.
Sandpoint Devil
While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that’s graceful and
beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a
powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid
gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs
and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature’s back bears a draconic
tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists

ODDS AND ENDS
Scarecrows hold a certain liminal space
that is inhabitable by spirit creatures.
Ghosts in particular can use their
malevolent possession on a scarecrow
as if it were a living creature, using
them as vehicles to escape their sitebound nature and so further spread
their murder and mayhem.
Scarecrow
A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow construct
is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to life. As it
animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch ﬂame, sending
fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in
its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination
of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar
materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction
makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of
battle. Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself
into a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes.
When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator’s
blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny
sliver of the creator’s soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than
enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to
follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When
a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion
of the creator’s soul never returns.

THE DESERT RIDER
Those rescued from death in the
burning sands often recount the
same dying vision: a strange,
silver‑eyed woman whose scarlet
silk tents stand on the back of a
colossal black scorpion, riding out
of a shattered city and leading an
army of the dead across a sea of
glass toward the world of the living.
Millennium‑old paintings on the
walls of rediscovered tombs depict
a similar desert rider. The identity of
this red‑robed woman is unknown.
Scorpion
Scorpions are frightening enough at their normal diminutive size, but when they
grow to reach or surpass the size of a human, they become absolutely terrifying.
CAVE SCORPION
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of
their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of
the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack
humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure
scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.

# SCYTHE TREE
================================================================================


SCYTHEWOOD
Wood harvested from a dead scythe
tree is knotted and twisted, and
often contains pockets of teeth and
bones from long-digested meals
embedded in the growth rings. While
diﬃcult to obtain and challenging
to work with, this wood is sought
out by necromancers, as it is a vital
component in creating particularly
potent necromantic wands and
staves. A single scythe tree typically
yields about 150 gp worth of viable
scythewood for such endeavors.
Scythe Tree
Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest
paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance
from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the ﬂesh, blood, and bone of
sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted
gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The
screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an
extra dimension of ﬂavor to the meal.
Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean
that they don’t need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once
food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When
a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its
bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow
into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on
to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.
Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted
branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have darkbrown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown
leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees’ disturbing mouths
remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on
the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices
are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when
discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally
ﬁnd to be insufferable and worthy of little more than
being hacked to pieces.

THE HEADLESS KING
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti
heroine named Savith in the era
before Earthfall, and now the so-called
Headless King’s body prowls aimlessly
in the Darklands. That the decapitated
god’s clerics still gain power from
worship points to Ydersius’s tenacity
and continued existence, after a
fashion. Those who seek to recover
his skull and return it to his body
hope that doing so will restore both
him and the sekmin civilization to
their full power.
Serpentfolk
Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk
were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive
today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not
quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have
diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons.
Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic
are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with
a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind,
resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall
of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos
made ﬂesh.”
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk
empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source
of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts.
Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule
having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote
reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within,
a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few
cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk
settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles,
far-ﬂung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement
to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves
to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the
practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods,
and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning
to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of
accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius,
their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the
Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are
so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially
since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young
at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that
even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss
or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely
to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk
colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the
earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies,
bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk
conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large
number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own
passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant.
A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss
question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive
on selﬁsh desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love
for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving
expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such
as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study
of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful
illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss
believes themself to have more reﬁned tastes than their peers.

The serpentfolk god is not dead, but in his decapitated
state, he might as well be. Reduced to a feral, animalistic

reason they need to hold this view. And it’s true enough that the instinctual
skill and magic of any zyss is enough to best the average human.

SHOCKER LIZARD TRAPS
Kobolds are particularly fond of using
shocker lizards in their trap designs,
although such traps rarely keep the
shocker lizards’ safety and comfort in
mind, forcing these cruel but creative
kobolds to constantly replace the
permanently restrained lizards they’ve
set up to defend their lairs.
Shocker Lizard
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard
dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their
scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning
strong enough to harm signiﬁcantly larger foes. Though they’re meek and docile
when encountered alone, shocker lizards are signiﬁcantly more aggressive in
packs, when they can amplify each other’s electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difﬁcult to domesticate because they’re
dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept
alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and
weighs 25 pounds.

Up to four shocker lizards can combine
their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards
can delay the release of their electricity until
any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes
its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create
an emanation with the combined area from all participating

SKAVELING INTELLECT
As a curious side eﬀect of its
creation, a skaveling absorbs many
of the memories and thoughts of the
ghoul brains it was fed. While it was
merely an oversized animal in life,
in undeath these memories coalesce
into a strange form of intelligence
that aﬀords the skaveling the ability
to speak and reason, all the better to
serve its urdefhan masters.
Skaveling
Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that
are not true ghouls but instead are speciﬁcally crafted undead creatures. Their creators
are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant
bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the ﬂesh of ghouls—especially
brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are
ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil (Core Rulebook 551). While this poison
simply rots away the ﬂesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats
will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.
Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of
ﬂight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use
skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that
of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere
mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can
reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them,
and they never take actions in a ﬁght that would knowingly put their masters in
harm’s way.

SKRIK NETTLE HARVESTING
Skrik nettle venom is magical in
nature and deteriorates swiftly. A
character with alchemist’s tools can
harvest a single dose of skrik nettle
venom from a skrik nettle that has
been dead no longer than an hour
with a successful DC 24 Crafting
check, which transforms the ﬂuid
into a standard potion of ﬂying.
Skrik Nettle
The expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarrelooking creatures that resemble large jellyﬁshes. A fringe of brightly colored
feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in
a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above
the First World in ﬂocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the
fey realm’s cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack
their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to ﬂoat
helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their
helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the
poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.
Skrik nettles that ﬁnd their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the
First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies
that they ﬁnd comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent.
The ﬁrst few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend
to be ﬁlled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby
creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are
somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming
the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and
does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who ﬁnd themselves
marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and
they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.

A levitating creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to

and negate this penalty for the remainder of its turn. If it’s
adjacent to a ﬁxed object or stable terrain, it can move across
the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical) or crawling
(if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). A ﬂying
creature can move normally but still increases its altitude as
appropriate from the venom. A creature that can’t ﬂy falls as
soon as it recovers from skrik nettle venom.

SKULK TREASURE
The greediness of skulks and
their easy relationship with
violence means the creatures often
accumulate a fair amount of valuable
coin and items. They prefer ﬁne
weapons above all else and jealously
protect such ﬁnds. Since clothing
inhibits their natural camouﬂage,
skulks either store this treasure in
a secure location or carry it in such
a way that their bodies block what
they are carrying from sight.
Skulk
The cowardly and lazy skulks live on the fringes of organized societies and steal
from others without a second thought. Even murder is merely another necessity,
and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and
taking what they want.
Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks
difﬁcult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of
large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically
travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger
than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see
themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a
strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared
purpose for very long.
Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around
sewers and the like, are skulks’ favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow
them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording
them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare
occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves’
guild and become sought after for difﬁcult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and
overwhelming selﬁshness, however, usually means they are unable to secure longlasting leadership roles.
A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human.
Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent
end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of
violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who
remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles
as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for
eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one
band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after
throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to
the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate
attempt to track down such an exile.

SLUGS OF WAR
Subterranean cultures like
urdefhans and xulgaths sometimes
turn giant slugs into war beasts.
The creatures’ primitive minds make
them easy to control for anyone
who knows a few simple tactics—
mostly ways of keeping them
well-fed until just before battle and
methods of guiding them in the
right direction as they rampage.
Slug
These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through
swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat ﬂesh
or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare
entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they ﬁrst
shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth—
to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully
acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip
that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near
swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many
almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each
giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into
proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated,
and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these
eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.
Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry
weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides
of bridges, or even fortiﬁcations like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break.
Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but
instead ﬁnds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant
slugs don’t have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in
particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily
compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable,
so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.

================================================================================
# SEA SNAKE
================================================================================


EATING HABITS
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals
by devouring their prey whole. After
incapacitating a creature, a snake
unhinges its jaw and consumes the
creature entirely, even if it’s more
than twice the diameter of the
snake’s body. A snake can consume
a creature of the same size as itself
or smaller, but most snakes are logy
and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snake
Snakes of some variety thrive in every non-arctic ecosystem, each with their own
particular hunting patterns and defense mechanisms.
SEA SNAKE
These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-footlong, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey.
Tales speak of massive sea snakes that swim in deeper waters and follow ships,
waiting for sailors to fall overboard or climbing the side to snatch them from the deck.

# SOUL EATER

SOUL GLUTTONS
As if soul eaters weren’t frightening

much larger variants of these
monsters, known as soul gluttons.
Appearing as roiling, inky black
clouds and possessing a half dozen
arms, soul gluttons are much deadlier
than their smaller kin and are also
much more dangerous to conjure,
as they have a disturbing knack for
wriggling out of a conjurer’s control.

Caster Link (detection, divine, divination) A conjured soul eater forms a mental link with

can drain its soul, or if the soul eater is defeated (but not destroyed) by the target, the
soul eater returns to its conjurer and tries to kill them.
Find Target (detection, divine, divination) When a soul eater is
conjured to the Material Plane to ﬁnd a speciﬁc
creature, it gains the beneﬁts of a 5th-level
locate spell that isn’t blocked by lead or
running water. The conjurer must
have seen the target and must

Requirements The soul eater is adjacent to a dying

devour the dying creature’s soul. The creature
must attempt a DC 25 Will save. A creature
that dies as a result of Drain Soul can’t be
restored to life except by a spell or ritual of 8th
level or higher. If the soul eater that used Drain
Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that
creature’s corpse and the creature has been dead no
longer than 1 minute, the creature’s soul returns to
its body and is restored to life, leaving the creature
unconscious and dying 1 but no longer doomed.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes doomed 1, or
increases its doomed value by 1 if it was already doomed.
Failure As success, but doomed 2.
Critical Failure As success, but doomed 3.
Mind-Numbing Touch (curse, divine, necromancy) When a soul eater hits a creature with
its claw Strike, the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become stupeﬁed
1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure). Further damage dealt by the soul eater increases
the stupeﬁed value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. This condition
value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night’s rest. As long as the
creature is stupeﬁed by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any doomed
value that creature might have.

When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its

thrall. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter’s
telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey
obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at
the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled
by the specter but becomes stupeﬁed 2 for 1 hour.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature remains a thrall to the
specter until the curse is removed or until the specter succumbs
to pain starvation; it can’t attempt new Will saves to recover on
its own.

SHIVER ADDICTS
Talented alchemists process dream
spider venom into an addictive drug
called shiver (Gamemastery Guide
121). Those who become addicted to
shiver may be driven in desperation
to seek out dream spiders and allow
them to bite their ﬂesh in order
to get their ﬁx—a tactic that often
backﬁres awfully as the spiders feed.
Spider
Spiders range dramatically in size, yet all are to some extent venomous.
DREAM SPIDER
A dream spider’s webs have an iridescent hue and are infused with the same
hallucinogenic compound as the creature’s toxin. Originally denizens of tropical
jungles, dream spiders have adapted well to temperate environments, particularly
thriving among the rooftops of cities where shady alchemists use their venom to
produce the drug known as shiver.

SPIRAL CENTURION GLITCHES
A spiral centurion might have one of
the following glitches.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals
only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
 Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up,
and if it Strides more than once per
round, it takes 1d10 damage.
 Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same
actions each round, regardless of
the circumstances.
Spiral Centurion
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient
and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they
resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies
take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting
down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a
password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of
time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or
a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions
besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only
staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still,
millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches
or malfunctions.

of this ability. These attacks count toward the spiral centurion’s multiple attack
penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks
are made.

OTHER SPORTLEBORES
While the creature presented here
is the most common of its type,
the sportlebore is in fact an entire
family of insects that specialize in
mimicking everyday objects. Other
varieties of sportlebore include the
spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore;
the corpse-eating sportlegore; and
the sportleglug, which is so small it
can burrow into leather wineskins
and drink their contents without
the bag spilling a drop. Like the
sportlebore, most of these vermin
aren’t too dangerous as individuals
but can turn into a real problem if
their numbers are left unchecked.
Sportlebore
The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin
that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or
jerky, a sportlebore can ﬂawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by ﬂexing, contorting,
and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding
under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into
a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking
any creatures it thinks it can consume.
SPORTLEBORE
On its own, a single sportlebore functions as a hazard rather than a creature.

OTHER SPORTLEBORES
While the creature presented here
is the most common of its type,
the sportlebore is in fact an entire
family of insects that specialize in
mimicking everyday objects. Other
varieties of sportlebore include the
spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore;
the corpse-eating sportlegore; and
the sportleglug, which is so small it
can burrow into leather wineskins
and drink their contents without
the bag spilling a drop. Like the
sportlebore, most of these vermin
aren’t too dangerous as individuals
but can turn into a real problem if
their numbers are left unchecked.
Sportlebore
The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin
that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or
jerky, a sportlebore can ﬂawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by ﬂexing, contorting,
and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding
under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into
a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking
any creatures it thinks it can consume.
SPORTLEBORE
On its own, a single sportlebore functions as a hazard rather than a creature.

REDEEMED SPRIGGANS
A spriggan’s nature is rooted
deeply in its inability to feel joy
and pleasure, and as such, non-evil
spriggans are rare. Yet they are not
unheard of. A spriggan who manages
to turn back on their inherent
nature loses their ability to assume
enormous size, and always becomes
a hated (if not feared) exile from
their clan. Such a spriggan never
fully transforms into a gnome, but
those who embrace redemption often
discover strange new powers waiting
for them to master, such as the
ability to draw upon the First World
to heal themselves and allies, or the
power to transform into actual fey
creatures for a short period of time.
Spriggan
When the gnomes ﬁrst emigrated from the First World so many eons ago, some
found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense
of joy. Seeing only the threat of the new world and none of its wonders, these
gnomes grimly resolved to survive no matter what the cost. Their innate magic
responded to this goal by twisting them in mind and body over the course of
many generations, eventually transforming them into the creatures known today
as spriggans.
Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for
their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy
such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in
spriggan society to ﬁll the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of
positivity. Today, the best a spriggan can manage in place of positive emotions is
a muted satisfaction when they make another creature suffer.
Spriggans resemble muted, hairless gnomes with oversized, pointed ears and
an alien, feral appearance. Many of them are gaunt and haggard. Skin tones vary
across all different shades of blue, from a pale sky color to a deep midnight.
Unlike their more cheerful and optimistic kin, spriggans do not become afﬂicted
by the bleaching, a fact that many of their kind smugly hold up as proof that
their ancestors’ choice to abandon joy was the right one.
While spriggans can specialize in a wide range of skills, one feature they all
share is the capacity to transform into lumbering, hulking incarnations of their
normally small frames. By drawing upon the void left behind in their souls,
they reﬂect the anger and cruelty in their minds and physically transform into
giant versions of themselves akin to ogres in stature; however, this rage-induced
change takes a toll on their bodies. The longer a spriggan remains in giant form,
the more pain and agony they have waiting for them when, inevitably, they
revert to their true size. Yet this promise of pain does not deter a spriggan from
using their power to grow in size, for it’s only when they assume gargantuan
proportions that they can truly feel joy and satisfaction. That spriggans feel these
emotions only when they are bullying smaller creatures, ﬁghting enemies (or
even allies), or inﬂicting pain on victims speaks to the depths of their corruption.
SPRIGGAN BULLY
The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in ﬁghts, but
only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and
abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inﬂict the maximum
amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying
prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching
others ﬁght, and ﬁghting among themselves.

SPRIGGAN DISTRACTIONS
As a culture, most spriggans live for
battle and constantly patrol their
territories in hopes of encountering
trespassers to capture and victimize.
Even so, spriggans sometimes need to
relax. Since they lack the capacity for
pleasure, games, art, and similar leisure
activities are lost on them. Instead,
they ﬁll their idle time training for
combat, watching others ﬁght to the
death, crafting weapons, or plotting
against their kin for personal gain.

GIANT SQUID TACTICS
The giant squid attacks by lashing
out with its longest tentacles and
then rapidly pulling the prey toward
itself. While closing the distance
between them, it attacks again,
this time closing its smaller arms
around the prey. Once it has the prey
thoroughly trapped, the giant squid
tears and cuts with its beak and the
teeth-lined saw it has in the place of
a tongue.
Squid
The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a
nautical tale.
VAMPIRE SQUID
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead
inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms.
Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of
bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.

================================================================================


STYGIRA GEMS
The gem a stygira carries does not
need to be particularly valuable,
but some stygiras prefer to use
more expensive gems as an
aﬀectation. More powerful stygiras
have developed methods of using
particularly expensive gems to
enhance their gem gaze ability,
allowing some to charm those they
gaze upon, light them on ﬁre, or even
aﬄict them with crippling poison.
Stygira
Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures
command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the
subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even
gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware
of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient
empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left
behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean
mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.
Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the
stony, scarred ﬂesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through
their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these ﬂashing glimpses, so
they keep to their caves during the day and
wander into the world above only after
nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out
unwary travelers or explorers to capture and
reduce them down to the base chemicals and
supernatural humors the stygiras require to
infuse gemstones with the capacity to give
them sight and magical power.

The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or become frightened 1
(frightened 2 on a critical failure).
Stone Curse (curse, primal, transmutation) Wounds dealt by the stygira’s
claws leave the ﬂesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from
them dark gray. Each time a creature is damaged by the stygira’s claw
Strike, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become permanently
slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its ﬂesh stiﬀens like stone. If
a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the stygira’s claw Strike and
fails the saving throw against stone curse, it is petriﬁed. A creature
that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving
throw to remove the eﬀects of stone curse, even if it has

OTHER TATZLWYRMS
People in some regions claim to have
seen creatures that are just like
tatzlwyrms in most respects—a long
body, two arms, and a head—except
that they have traits that are not
of reptilian origin. Travelers on a
savanna should beware a furry,
lion-headed tatzlwyrm protecting its
cubs, while those in the mountains
might be attacked by a feathered
(but wingless) variant with the head
of an eagle.
Tatzlwyrm
Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon’s head.
Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of
intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their
ability to reason is limited and they can’t use magic. They do possess a level of
cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and
even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don’t expect to ﬁnd a
tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.
Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons,
though it’s a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as
messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due
to their smaller size), guides (when they’re familiar with a particular mountain),
and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon’s direct attention).
Tatzlwyrms don’t work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.
Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they
seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable
occasion, townsfolk reported being brieﬂy overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conﬂict
between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still
debate whether the cause of the inﬂux was the sudden change in weather or if the
creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part
of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.
When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed,
they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales’ natural
camouﬂage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching
poisonous vapor into an opponent’s face. Since this breath attack doesn’t have
much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes ﬁrst and bring them close
to their mouth.

Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The sacristan
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against staggering servitude. In addition, if the creature was
already stunned, on a failed save its revulsion toward the sacristan’s presence causes
it to be stupeﬁed 2 for 1 minute. After attempting this save, the creature is then
temporarily immune until the start of the sacristan’s next turn.
Shadow Scream ̂ˬ (aura, concentrate, darkness, divine, evocation, mental, sonic)
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The sacristan opens their mouth to unloose
the wailing howls and mind-twisting darkness of the Shadow Plane.
This creates a 30-foot emanation of darkness and wailing sounds
around the sacristan. Creatures with darkvision can’t see through
this darkness. The sacristan can Sustain Shadow Scream for up
to 1 minute. Non-velstrac creatures in the area when the ability is
used, as well as those who enter or start their turn in the area, must
attempt a DC 28 Will save.

INTERLOCUTOR
Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of

new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal.
Each interlocutor structures their individual
appearance carefully, but all are towering,
multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest
limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they
can ﬁnd. They continually search for new
material to graft to their forms, and their slain
foes are rarely found intact, as little is
more valuable to interlocutors than a
powerful opponent’s legs, eyes, or even
brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall
and weigh approximately 800 pounds.
