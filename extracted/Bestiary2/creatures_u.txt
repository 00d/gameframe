Sneak Attack The sylph sneak’s Strikes deal 1d6 extra precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
Surprise Attacker On the ﬁrst round of combat, creatures that haven’t acted yet
are ﬂat-footed to the sylph sneak.
Wind’s Guidance When the sylph sneak attacks with a thrown weapon, the range
increment increases by 10 feet.
UNDINE
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the
briny deep ﬂows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and
lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how
much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming
communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter
case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number
dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
The undines who ﬁll these communities
are similarly diverse, bringing aspects
of multiple cultures together to
form one whole. Ship-towns are
permanent, but ﬂuid—they grow,
recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add
their ships to or remove them from the ﬂotilla. An
undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
residents coming ashore only on rare occasions
to collect wood for cookﬁres or to repair their
homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence
of these communities reﬂects the undine virtues of adaptability and
freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these ﬂoating settlements, if only
for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.

VANDALS OF CHAOS
Those who seek secret knowledge
beyond their means to purchase can
bargain with akizendris to provide
them with rare tomes in exchange
for delivering the immersed akizendri
into a library via another book. From
there, the akizendri can vandalize
books to its heart’s content without
being detected.
Protean
Proteans are manifestations of chaos made ﬂesh, natives of the Maelstrom that
embody the primeval potency of entropy in their serpentine forms. They follow
a loose, confusing, and ever-shifting caste system and form choruses based on
malleable and evanescent shared philosophies.
WARPWAVES
Many proteans can use the forces of chaos to distort reality in their foes’ minds,
creating mental ripples called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw
and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the
speciﬁc effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect
lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave
effect already affecting a creature.

AKIZENDRI
Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and
altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions
and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with
elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows
into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.
Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing
insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages.
Libraries in such places as Heaven, Axis, and Hell are especially keen to avoid
such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every
akizendri in existence.

Entropy Sense (divination, divine, prediction) An akizendri can anticipate the most
likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of
chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the akizendri the ability to sense
creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of nondetection or
that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via
entropy sense.

change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the akizendri takes
acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that
damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage
of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type),
whichever comes first.

MINOS-PASHAT
The ﬁrst urdefhans were unleashed
into the depths of Golarion’s
Darklands in the vault of Minos-
Pashat, a nation-sized cavern riddled
with maze-like tangles of stalactites,
stalagmites, and ﬁssures.
Urdefhan
The violent warmongers, occultists, and poisoners known as urdefhans dwell
within the Darklands. They were created in eons past by the mysterious First
Horsemen of the Apocalypse to serve as agents of the end times within the
Material Plane. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the
wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their ﬁendish lieges,
urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill.
While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is
where their similarities to surface ancestries end. Their visages are horriﬁc, with
transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming
bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This, combined with
their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that
these beings are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living ﬂesh and
blood. When an urdefhan’s life comes to an end, their ﬂesh quickly curdles and
then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the ﬂesh of other
creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a
disappointment, for once they’re dead, their chances to kill will
ﬁnally come to an end.
Urdefhans’ primary concern is death and how to inﬂict it
in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond
this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only
tangentially with matters such as formal modes of
warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When
an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence,
their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense
of self-preservation that ensures they survive
long enough to spread the “blessings” of their
daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new
weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic,
all in preparation for the next inevitable conﬂict.
URDEFHAN WARRIOR
From the moment they are born, urdefhans are prepared for war. Urdefhan
warriors are among the least powerful urdefhans one might encounter outside of
their eerie underground cities.

RHOKA SWORDS
The rhoka sword is the preferred
weapon of urdefhan soldiers,
though all urdefhans
know how to wield these
instruments of war. These
uncommon advanced
weapons cost 4 gp, deal 1d8
slashing damage, have 2 Bulk,
and require 1 hand to use. Rhoka
swords are in the sword group and
have the deadly d8 and two-hand
1d10 traits.
Ravenous Attack ʚʖ The urdefhan makes one rhoka sword Strike and one jaws Strike
against a single creature. Its multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks.
Wicked Bite Ȱɵ Requirements The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its
last action; Eﬀect The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature’s
ﬂesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses
one of two options, each of which requires a DC 20 Fortitude save.
If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suﬀers both eﬀects,
using the same save result for both.
•	 Drain Blood The urdefhan drinks some of the creature’s blood. On a
failed save, the creature is drained 1 and the urdefhan regains 5 HP
(or, on a critical failure, it’s drained 2 and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).
•	 Drain Vitality (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the
creature’s vital essence. The creature becomes enfeebled 1 for 1 hour
on a failed save (or enfeebled 2 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
URDEFHAN TORMENTOR
Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably
unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of
Abaddon’s Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity.
With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons
into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to
stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.

allies into a fanatical frenzy. Each ally that hears the call
gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and
saving throws, and takes a –1 status penalty to AC. Aﬀected
allies must use at least one of their actions to Strike each round, if
they are able (even if it means attacking an ally, object, or thin
air). This lasts for 2d4 rounds.

BUILDING A VRYKOLAKAS
Like vampires (Bestiary 318–321),
vrykolakas can infect victims with
their twisted form of vampirism,
transforming practically any living
monster into one of these undead
horrors. You can build a new
vrykolakas from the ground up
using the standard monster creation
rules, which were used to create
the vrykolakas spawn, vrykolakas
master, and vrykolakas ancient, or
you can use the guidelines presented
under Creating a Vrykolakas to
turn an existing creature (even a
player character!) into a vrykolakas,
adjusting the monster as you see ﬁt.
In either case, speciﬁc vrykolakas
abilities like negative healing, Feral
Corruption, and Drink Blood work
the same.
Vampire, Vrykolakas
Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as
vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. They spread
suffering and death among all who cross their paths, punishing all who remind
them of those who failed to properly lay their bodies and souls to rest.
CREATING A VRYKOLAKAS
You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil.
•	 Increase AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
•	 Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed.
•	 Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability
can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
BASIC VRYKOLAKAS AbILITIES
If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that speciﬁcally come
from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented
its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to
adjust abilities that conﬂict with the vrykolakas’ theme. All vrykolakas gain the
following abilities.
Darkvision
Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking.
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Feral Corruption Ȳ˓ (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession)
Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet;
Eﬀect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn’t destroyed when it reaches 0
HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must
attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level from the Spell DC and
Spell Attack Roll table on page 66 of the Gamemastery Guide). On a failure, the animal
is possessed. This has the eﬀects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of
days equal to the vrykolakas’s level. This possession can’t be counteracted with magic
(though remove curse works against it normally).
If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a diﬀerent
animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no
animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.
A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound
below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery,
its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host.
Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After
1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn’t been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas
rises in a new body that’s identical to its previous one, formed from the animal’s remains.
Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities.
•	 Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It
must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours,
during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to
this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this
host animal can’t return to the burial site before the possession eﬀect ends, the
vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal.
•	 Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can’t use its Feral
Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.
Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed.
Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing
damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature’s level on
the Strike Damage table found on page 65 of the Gamemastery Guide.

VRYKOLAKAS HABITS
Most vrykolakas have curious
aﬀectations, such as a compulsion
to knock on a door before
entering or calling out the name
of the person within. If the person
answers, the vrykolakas then tries
to hunt and slay them within 3 days.
Others have an aﬃnity for speciﬁc
types of animals, always preferring
to charm or possess them, or have
an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi
vampire, however, for a vrykolakas
these habits are merely sadistic
games or personal preferences, not
mystical compulsions.
Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs
Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink
Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table
found on page 65 of the Gamemastery Guide.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas’ last action was a
successful fangs Strike; Eﬀect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to
drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC.
On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal
to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking
Blood from a creature that’s already drained doesn’t restore any HP to the vampire,
but it increases the creature’s drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also
consume blood that’s been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP
from doing so.
The target creature’s drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood
transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and suﬃcient blood or
a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.
Rend Ȱɵ The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.
VRYKOLAKAS MASTER AbILITIES
Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their
victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or
higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who
have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master
inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, wargs,
werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders
to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can’t communicate back.
Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the
area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague.
Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened
to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as
divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level (Gamemastery Guide 66).
Bubonic Plague (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the
vrykolakas’s level [Gamemastery Guide 66]); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 day);
Stage 2 enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes
1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day)
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas
master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the eﬀects
of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but
gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form.
Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to
0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas
spawn (page 276) by donating some of its own blood to the
creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas
spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created
them, but they are not under its control and typically wander
oﬀ on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation.
Dominate
Animal
Ȱɵ
(divine,
enchantment,
incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can
cast dominate at will as a divine innate
spell that aﬀects only animals. The save
DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas’s
level (Gamemastery Guide 66), and a
creature that succeeds is immune to
that vrykolakas’s Dominate Animal
for 24 hours. Destroying the
vrykolakas ends the eﬀect, but

DEBASED AND DISTORTED
Vrykolakas are corrupted bestial
versions of their appearance in life,
and are emaciated and pockmarked
with disease. Their spines are bent
in a perpetual hunch. While some
vrykolakas can cloak themselves
in a semblance of living ﬂesh, their
fragmented memories often cannot
accurately recreate their former
appearance or persona. They may not
recognize former family and friends
(and vice versa), but those they
do remember are marked as their
favored victims.
reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to
saving throws against the vrykolakas’s Feral Possession.
Drink Blood As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.
VRYKOLAKAS SPAWN
Vrykolakas unleash their spawn upon the world to spread terror, plague, and
suffering and to draw attention away from their masters.
