Bestiary 2
Ahuizotl
The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous
cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-ﬁngered paws
supplemented by a ﬁfth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and
stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the
cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl’s macabre habit of feeding on a victim’s
eyes, ﬁngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated.
Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist
ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact
that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual ﬂesh of its victims, instead depositing
their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure
to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely
possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread
fear and despair.
An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating
simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an
extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of
cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature’s vision. Yet despite their bestial
appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser
than most. Although they don’t form societies of their own, they have been
known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found
small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman
of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to
an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.

AHUIZOTL ALLIES
An ahuizotl is unexpectedly
canny in how it handles potential
competitors in its territory, and
when presented with fellow
predators capable of conversation,
it sometimes brokers alliances. Willo’-wisps are particular favorites as
allies, as they can lure prey into the
ahuizotl’s clutches and feast on the
anguish later when the mutilated
corpse is discovered.

Akata
An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes,
a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast,
as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but
it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.
When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into
a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal—the skymetal noqual. An akata can
hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though
it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a
few minutes’ time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void
of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts
with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring
ﬁght among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then
animates the corpse—now a void zombie (page 288)—which shambles about of
its own accord.

Str +4, Dex +2, Con +4, Int –4, Wis +3, Cha +0
Hibernation After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete resin that
encases it in a noqual cocoon. The cocoon has Hardness 9, 40 HP, and a
Broken Threshold of 18. It has resistance 5 to damage from magical
sources. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata can’t be
harmed, and it doesn’t need to eat or drink. While inside the
cocoon, the akata gains lifesense 30 feet. The akata remains
in a state of hibernation until it is exposed to extreme
heat or senses a living creature, at which point it can
burst free of its cocoon in 1d4 minutes.
No Hearing An akata has no auditory senses. It is
immune to auditory eﬀects, automatically
critically fails Perception checks that
require it to hear, and takes a –2
status penalty to Perception checks
(but not initiative rolls) that involve
sound but also rely on other senses.

NOQUAL COCOONS
An akata’s noqual cocoon, despite
its crystalline appearance, is in fact
made of a rare skymetal with a glassy
green sheen. Noqual is as easy to
work as iron but much lighter, and
it is valued for its magic-resistant
qualities, but the noqual from an
akata’s cocoon is very low quality and
can’t be used as a crafting material.

Angel
Angels are benevolent messengers who aid good forces in the ﬁght against evil.
Each angel has a special aura that assists in their individual tasks, and each angel
delivers certain types of messages and performs other duties for the angelic
hosts. While most angels live in the enlightened realm of Nirvana, some serve
the forces of Heaven and Elysium, especially in the case of the angel empyreal
lords within those two realms. Angels organize themselves into choirs depending
on their ranks and roles.
MOVANIC DEVA (GUARDIAN ANGEL)
Movanic devas are stewards of the ﬂow of good creatures’ souls through the cycle
of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels
arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a speciﬁc
connection with a creature’s vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most
concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives,
so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva
leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of
their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within
animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent
as well, thus increasing the ﬂow of goodness into the afterlife. They also
spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy
Plane, seeking to contain signiﬁcant threats to life.

don’t attack the movanic deva or the deva’s allies unless
they are controlled or otherwise forced to attack.

Dispelling Field ʚʖ (divine, transmutation) Frequency once per

magic eﬀects on allies within its aura of vitality to protect them
from malevolent forces. The movanic deva attempts a counteract
check against as many spell eﬀects aﬀecting allies in the area as it
wishes with a +19 counteract modiﬁer and a counteract level of 4,
rolling once for the selected eﬀects.
Flaming Armaments (divine, transmutation) When a movanic deva wields
a weapon, that weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming rune.
THE GIFT OF SAPIENCE
When a movanic deva awakens an
animal, the animal becomes neutral
good and is well-disposed toward
the deva, but the deva understands
that free will is an important part of
life. While the deva provides enough
support and guidance to the animal
to help it adjust to its newly sapient
world view, not all animals awakened
in this way remain on the path of good.

Ankou
Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even the Eldest—
the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey
rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied
threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak
aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic
whisper directly into a victim’s mind. While an ankou’s body is made of strange,
ﬂeshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-
sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical
ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.
While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are
left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In
some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have
been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge
their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!

Shadow Doubles Ȱɵ to ̂ˬ (illusion, occult, shadow)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect For each action spent to
use this ability, the ankou creates one shadowy duplicate
of themself anywhere within 60 feet of themself.
Shadow doubles have the same statistics as an ankou,
but they have the summoned trait, have 84 Hit Points,
can’t use Shadow Doubles or innate spells, and have
an attack bonus of +25 for their Strikes. A shadow
double that attempts a saving throw against
a light eﬀect can’t get a result better than
failure. Each double remains for 1 round,
until it’s reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until
it moves further than 120 feet from the
ankou, whichever comes ﬁrst. Each round thereafter, the ankou can spend a single
action that has the concentrate trait to extend the duration of surviving duplicates by
1 round, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. The ankou can see through the eyes of
all of the shadow doubles at once. A character who Seeks can identify an ankou as
real or a shadow double with a successful DC 39 Perception check.
Sneak Attack An ankou’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to
flat-footed creatures.
ANKOU GUILDS
The most dangerous ankous are
those who have rebelled against their
masters. Ankous of this nature are
more powerful, gathering others to
form deadly “guilds” of assassins that
pursue common goals in the most
dangerous parts of the First World.

ANT HIVES
Giant ants form vast underground
colonies, excavating deep burrows
or infesting existing caverns. Ants
are omnivorous and cultivate fungus
farms, but they are happy to eat
whatever presents itself. Humanoids
and their domesticated animals are
easy fuel for the insectile machinery
of their hives. Worker ants lack the
sting of their warrior cousins, while
elite drones ﬂy on gossamer wings
(ﬂy Speed of 30 feet) to seek new
food sources for their queen.

Ants are industrious insects that aid the natural processes of decay and renewal.

Giant ants are much like their smaller kin in their industrious habits, though
growing to the size of ponies makes them much deadlier.

Aolaz
Aolazes are great beasts carved from stone and metal and magically imbued with
the essence of life. The exact means of their creation is a long-lost secret, and
they are so rare that scholars have little opportunity to study active specimens.
The best-known aolazes are museum pieces or battleﬁeld relics destroyed or
deactivated centuries ago, though fragmented records suggest that many more
were made and might remain, yet to be unearthed.
Most aolazes are built in the shape of great land-bound beasts, such as elephants,
rhinoceroses, or dinosaurs. Regardless of the speciﬁc creature an aolaz has been
constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations
are—it’s imbued with the magical ability to pursue across
water and even through the air. Few can escape an
aolaz’s wrath once it is earned.

made within 1,000 feet as though it were
only 5 feet away from the source of the

though it were only 30 feet away from the source

Ultrasonic Blast. It can make foot Strikes while rolling, but only as
part of a Trample. The aolaz can use this action again to unroll and
resume its standing form.
Trample ʚʖ Huge or smaller, foot, DC 40
Ultrasonic Blast Ȱɵ (arcane, evocation, sonic) The aolaz releases a
tremendous blast of sonic energy from its trunk in a 150-foot line,
dealing 12d10 sonic damage. The frequency of this sound is such
that it is completely imperceptible to humanoids, but the damage it
wreaks is all too evident. Each creature in the area must attempt
a DC 40 Fortitude save. The aolaz can’t use Ultrasonic Blast again
for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.

Critical Failure The creature takes double

JISTKAN BEHEMOTHS
Thousands of years ago, the Jistka
Imperium mastered the art of
construct creation, and the aolaz
represents the height of its craft.
The Jistkans used primal magic
to imbue their constructs with
spirits of nature. However, when
Jistkan creators turned to the outer
planes, and to ﬁends in particular,
as a source to power even greater
constructs, they unknowingly
orchestrated their own doom.

Archon
Tireless agents of Heaven, archons embody virtues and strive to guide mortals
while battling the evil forces of the ﬁendish realms. Heaven’s seven-tiered
mountain is generally known as a place of contemplation and philosophy,
as exempliﬁed by the ﬁfth level, Illumis. But the archon denizens of Heaven’s
threshold and the second level, Proelera, concern themselves with defense and
mustering armies for the endless battles against Hell and the Abyss. However,
whereas devils and demons take pleasure in harming the innocent, Heaven’s
wardens reserve their blades for only the truly wicked and irredeemable. Among
mortals, they prefer to guide and nurture a rule of law that looks out for the
weak and powerless, leading mortal agents to overcome mortal threats rather
than solving those threats themselves.
HOUND ARCHON
Among the rank-and-ﬁle soldiers of Heaven’s armies, few individuals are more
dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments
of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar
level along Heaven’s grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for
evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon’s
role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with
protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.

Archon’s Door Once per day, if an archon sees another creature cast
dimension door, the archon can use dimension door (heightened to
5th level) within 1 round to attempt to follow that creature to the
maximum distance of the archon’s dimension door. If the archon’s
dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the
same distance and direction from the creature as before either
creature used dimension door.
Change Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
polymorph,
transmutation) A hound archon can take the appearance
of any canid animal of Small to Large size. This doesn’t
change their Speed or the attack and damage bonuses
for their Strikes, but if the canid’s bite attack has the
Knockdown ability, then the hound archon’s bite
attack gains that ability while they are in that form.
Diligent Assault ʚʖ The hound archon carefully
makes one greatsword Strike and one jaws Strike
in any order. These attacks count toward the
hound archon’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
ARCHON EVOLUTIONS
When a spirit becomes an archon,
they usually start as a lantern archon,
the lowliest of archonkind. As they
perform noble deeds and bolster their
pureness of heart, an archon evolves

stages or remaining in others for long
spans of time, depending on their
particular strengths and personality.

ATHACH TREASURE
Athachs are infamously greedy, but
the distrustful creatures have a unique
way of hiding gems and shiny metal.
When an athach ﬁnds items such
as coins and jewelry, they crush the
valuable metal into a lumpy ball about
the size of an apple and then swallow
it. When not tormenting humans, the
athach regurgitates these lumps and
plays with them. Any of these lumps
found lying about an athach’s lair are
likely coated in the giant’s toxic drool.
Athach
The towering and brutish giants known as athaches are reviled for both their
monstrosity and their cruelty. Beyond an athach’s ﬁlthy habits, this giant is made
stranger by the gangly third arm that protrudes from their torso and ends in a
twitching, long-ﬁngered claw. Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach’s
upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that
is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach’s fangs.
Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and
they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does
not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of
settled territories until they ﬁnd a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to
target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair
in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch
their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and
torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes
on a ﬁnal rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature
they can ﬁnd. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape,
forcing these terriﬁed victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading
word of the athach’s fearsomeness.

VARISIAN NURSERY RHYME
Is the attic whispering?
Are we safe below?
Do you think he’s listening?
Is that his shadow?
Do you hear him waking,
Up above the stairs?
Do you hear him weeping?
Is he really there?
Can you say “I’m speaking?”
Are you saying naught?
Is it you who’s weeping?
Is it you he’s caught?
Attic Whisperer
Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the pained wrath of
an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of their caretakers.
Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in
a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of
blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles. To give themselves
the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with a small animal’s skull.
Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old inﬁrmaries, orphanages, and other
such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades
in hopes that they might one day ﬁnd a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness.
When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches
by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers
intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from
living creatures as their dark impulses take over.

GOLDEN GUARDIAN
While wholly carnivorous,
aurumvoraxes are known for gnawing
on metals (particularly gold and
copper), though whether they do this
to sharpen their teeth or because of
some nutritional need is unknown.
Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for
thousands of feet dug into the rock,
often following veins of ores and
winding deep into the earth. Mining
dwarves love the creatures’ fondness
for eating rust monsters. Those who
keep aurumvoraxes for protection call
them golden guardians.
Aurumvorax
Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight
legs, using their terriﬁc strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone.
A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for
its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very
strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery
or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the
shiny black of seasoned iron.
Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving
out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are
irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear
aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold
pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births,
and their mothers are ﬁercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous
proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts
of rage.

Melee Ȱɵ jaws +21, Damage 2d10+12 piercing plus Grab
Melee Ȱɵ claw +21 (agile), Damage 2d8+12 slashing plus Grab
Bleeding Critical When an aurumvorax scores a critical hit,
the target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
Gnaw Metal Ȱɵ The aurumvorax makes a jaws Strike against
a creature it has grabbed. If the attack hits, the target
is knocked prone if it is Medium or smaller. In addition, if
the target is wearing armor with Hardness 10 or lower, the
armor becomes broken. If this Strike
breaks a creature’s armor or damages
a creature that is unarmored or wearing
broken armor, the target also takes 1d6
persistent bleed damage. This Strike
doesn’t further damage armor that’s
already broken.
Rapid Rake ʚʖ The aurumvorax makes
four claw Strikes against a creature it
has grabbed. Each attack counts toward
the
aurumvorax’s
multiple
attack
penalty, and the
multiple
attack
penalty increases
with each attack.

BRALANI CONTESTS
Bralanis enjoy inventing games and
contests and adding new twists to
popular sports rather than following
familiar rules. Speed often features
somewhere in bralani games, whether
it be physical speed or quickness of
wit. It is not uncommon for bralanis
to seek the input of young children,
encouraging adults to draw inspiration
from a child’s creativity rather than
allowing themselves to settle into
comfortable and repetitive patterns.
Azata
Azatas embrace the love of life and the ﬁght to retain individuality and choice.
BRALANI (WIND AZATA)
Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to
test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of
good‑natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conﬂict also extends
to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure
that neither side’s desires are crushed by the other’s and work as mediators when
needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are
going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures.
They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.

spend 1 minute to bless willing creatures within
100 feet who are about to participate in a
contest. This blessing lasts 24 hours.
If a blessed creature cheats or uses
the contest to harm another,
the creature grows visibly ill,
becoming sickened 1 and unable to remove this condition for
the duration or until they withdraw from the competition. At
the end of the contest, participants
who competed fairly ﬁnd it easier

CLOUD DRAGON
At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing
more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range
in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and
rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest
mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they’re at home.
Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they ﬂy over from great
heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique
their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something
on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are
not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something
they desire off the ground and ﬂy away with it as they are to bargain fairly.
A cloud dragon’s ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the
complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are

ZANEMBIS
While most cloud dragons prefer
solitude and avoid confrontations,
Zanembis is an excellent example of
how failed dragonslaying attempts
can create problems. Previously
content to dwell atop Angel Peak in
the Mindspin Mountains, this cloud
dragon has grown vengeful and
violent in the wake of unexpected and
unjustiﬁed attacks on his lair.
creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other
true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon’s
penchant for living in the moment is not a personality ﬂaw—they’re more than
capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won’t make foolish
choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have
little interest in worrying about the future and are as conﬁdent in their ability to
handle tomorrow’s problems as they are today’s.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural
result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended
periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather
a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a
cloud dragon, a diversiﬁed hoard is a perfect hoard.

PRIMAL DRAGON RELIGION
While religious primal dragons
sometimes worship Apsu or Dahak
(which dragon god they favor
depends on their stance on good
or evil), most prefer to worship
elemental divinities.
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The dragon breathes a thundercloud
that deals 20d6 electricity damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 41 basic Reﬂex save). This
cloud remains in the area for 1d4 rounds, with the eﬀects of obscuring mist. A creature
that ends its turn inside of the cloud takes 10d6 electricity damage (DC 41 basic Reﬂex
save). The cloud dragon can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Cloud Form Ȱɵ As adult cloud dragon
Cloud Walk As young cloud dragon.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ As young cloud dragon.
Draconic Momentum As young cloud dragon.
Thundering Bite An ancient cloud dragon’s jaws Strike creates a deafening clap of
thunder when it damages a foe. A creature that takes damage from the dragon’s
jaws Strike must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute (or
permanently on a critical failure).
CRYSTAL DRAGON
Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant
hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of
great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily
angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures
when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered
and prone to ﬁnding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions
are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of
sudden interruptions or distractions.
Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate
environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations
mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some
part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there
are always plenty of reﬂective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own
appearance. These range from crystals to reﬂecting pools to ﬁnely crafted mirrors,
which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or
magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.
Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections
or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make
friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to ﬁnd evil creatures uncouth
and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could
become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature’s capacity
for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that
crystal dragons hunger for).

SHARDIZHAD
Still a relatively young crystal
dragon, Shardizhad has already
made a name for herself in the city
of Wati in Osirion. She has taken
on a somewhat unusual role as a
shopkeeper in that city’s necropolis,
where she’s eager to trade magic
items she’s collected for more gems
and valuable stones.
this aura’s emanation are dazzled. Each creature that ends its turn in the emanation
must succeed at a DC 34 Will saving throw or be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical
failure). Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is temporarily immune to the stunning
eﬀect for 1 minute. The crystal dragon can turn this aura on or oﬀ using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait, and it can choose not to aﬀect allies.
Reﬂect Spell Ǻȓ Trigger The crystal dragon is targeted by a ranged spell attack roll;
Eﬀect The crystal dragon adjusts a wing to try to reﬂect the spell and gains a +4
circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the spell
is reﬂected back at the caster, who must roll a second ranged spell attack roll against
their own AC to determine if the spell hits them instead.
Twisting Tail Ǻȓ As young crystal dragon.
Speed 60 feet, burrow 40 feet, ﬂy 140 feet

crystals that deals 17d6 piercing damage in
a 50-foot cone (DC 38 basic Reﬂex save).

MAGMA DRAGON
Magma dragons have a reputation
among other dragons for being
unpredictable
and
brash.
Their
temperament and tendency for violent
outbursts ensure that the typical
magma dragon lives a solitary life,
with hatchlings often bickering or
ﬁghting to establish dominance among
themselves before they leave the nest.
A magma dragon always has a reason
for their outbursts and can always justify
their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely
feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically
active mountains or deep underground amid
vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all
true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards
of treasure, but the nature of their searing
lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to
metals, gems, and items capable of resisting
the heat of a volcano’s core.

UMBRAL DRAGON
While the other primal dragons
hail from the Elemental Planes, the
cruel and unceasingly malicious
umbral dragons originate in the
depths of the Shadow Plane.
Their sleek black scales and
serpentine grace allow them to
strike from hiding, and they are
known for playing with their
prey before ﬁnally ﬁnishing
it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome
appetites prefer the necrotic ﬂesh of undead creatures
to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of
accidental beneﬁt to nearby humanoid societies,
but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures
for the taste, rather than out of any desire to
protect others from the undead. The beneﬁt
is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons
exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to

be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite
meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced
with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons ﬂee into
the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk
their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by
loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have
a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek
to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down
through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they’ve fed upon.

DRAGONFLY SPECIES
While dragonﬂies come in many
colors, the diﬀerences between
species sometimes extend beyond
aesthetic variation. Giant blue
dragonﬂies are larger toxic versions
of the insects with a numbing bite
that boggards use to craft poisons.
Cave dragonﬂies are slower but
stronger variants that dwell in large
cavern systems. The legendary
storm dragonﬂies are truly immense
creatures that can use their powerful
wings to stun foes.
Dragonfly
Dragonﬂies hunt with a combination of agile power and deadly speed. In their
early life stages these insects are entirely aquatic predators, but they take to the air
once they’ve molted. Most live around bodies of water suitable for spawning, but
giant dragonﬂies have been known to ﬂy many miles when on the hunt. Though
their gossamer wings and colorful bodies are beautiful at ﬁrst glance, an unwary
adventurer lured in by the display runs a very real risk of becoming lunch.
GIANT DRAGONFLY NYMPH
The aquatic, wingless offspring of dragonﬂies are called dragonﬂy nymphs. Giant
dragonﬂy nymphs can be several feet in length and mostly hunt in shallow waters,
eating carrion and ambushing living creatures with their fully grown counterparts.
They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct to eat as
much as possible to sustain their growth.

MOCK CHORUSES
Azuretzis form mock choruses in
emulation of their more powerful
kindred, aping the shifting
philosophies of proper choruses. While
mischievous or outright malevolent
to hostile or lawful creatures,
they interact amiably with chaotic
creatures, who run the risk of being
promptly followed–willingly or not–by
a serpentine gaggle of self-appointed
understudies.
The akizendri is immune to polymorph eﬀects unless it is a willing target. If blinded
or deafened, the akizendri automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new
sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet, swim 25 feet; freedom of movement
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +12 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 2d8+3 piercing plus 1d4 chaotic
and garbled thoughts
Melee Ȱɵ tail +12 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 2d6+3 bludgeoning plus 1d4 chaotic
and Grab
Divine Innate Spells DC 20, attack +12; 3rd glyph of warding, secret page; 1st detect
alignment (at will, lawful only); Cantrips (2nd) acid splash, daze, ghost sound, mage
hand, sigil; Constant (4th) freedom of movement
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The akizendri takes
on the appearance of any Small or smaller creature. This doesn’t change its Speed or
its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type
its Strikes deal.
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+3 bludgeoning, DC 20
Garbled Thoughts (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A creature hit by the akizendri’s
bite Strike must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is also confused for 1 round.
Text Immersion (divine, transmutation) When the akizendri casts
secret page, it can physically immerse itself in the text, changing
the message of the text in the process. It can exit the book
at any point by Dismissing secret page, at which point it
appears in a space adjacent to the text. If it does so to
begin combat, it rolls a Deception check for initiative. As
long as it remains immersed in the text, the akizendri
has no body. It can communicate telepathically with
a creature as long as the creature touches the book
or scroll that contains the secret page. It can sense
nearby creatures using its entropy sense, but not in any
other way, nor can it use any attack, manipulate, or
move actions or speak aloud. If the object it is
immersed in is destroyed, the akizendri reappears
in an adjacent square and is stunned 1.
AZURETZI
Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures
with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant
blue scales with mottled purple and pink
highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic
approximation of leering, laughing faces.
The Maelstrom’s chaotic forces spawn
these small proteans from a variety of
sources: physical mating between older
azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion
of bestial naunets, and possibly from
mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may
just be confusing putative mortal memories
with experiences gained from games of
mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by
any rational, self-consistent rules.
Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos,
particularly in the form of mockery and
parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting
a target’s features into a laughingstock.

Only powerful magic can

form. Most prominent among
these is the massive planar

Mocking Touch ʚʖ (abjuration, divine)
Requirement The azuretzi is not currently using Mocking Touch on a
spell; Eﬀect The azuretzi mocks a creature’s magical ability with
a touch. The azuretzi must attempt a Thievery
check against the target’s Will DC.
Critical Success The azuretzi chooses
one spell of up to 3rd level
that the target creature has
available to cast. The azuretzi
gains that spell as a mock
divine innate spell, and it
can cast that spell once as an
innate divine spell using its own
DC and spell attack. It must do so
before 24 hours pass or the mock spell is
lost. The creature touched cannot cast the mock
spell until the azuretzi casts it ﬁrst or the 24 hour
period passes, whichever comes ﬁrst.
Success As critical success, but the azuretzi has 1 hour

IMENTESH
The loquacious proteans known as imenteshes serve as missionaries, spies, and
heralds of chaos to further the protean goal of reality’s dissolution. Imenteshes
are cunning, curiously diplomatic, and profoundly whimsical. They travel
beyond the Maelstrom for their work, frequently adopting extravagant
personal attire and decorations that often border upon the garish, all to curry
favor with less chaotic beings.

VELSTRAC DIVINITIES
The most powerful velstracs are
unique divinities known collectively
as velstrac demagogues—powerful
creatures worshipped by those
mortals who seek to experience
agonizing new revelations and
gain power by enhancing the body
through pain.
OSTIARIUS
Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the Shadow
Plane and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world
of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs—
from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of
the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and
they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found
in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals
range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.

Perception +15; greater darkvision, painsight, sense portal
Languages Common, Infernal, Shadowtongue; telepathy 100 feet
Skills Acrobatics +13, Deception +12, Diplomacy +12, Intimidation +16,
Religion +11, Torture Lore +11
Str +0, Dex +4, Con +2, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +5
Painsight (divination, divine) As augur.
Sense Portal (divination, divine) The ostiarius always knows the
direction and distance to the closest portal between the Shadow
Plane and the Material Plane. This sense functions only on
these two planes.
AC 21; Fort +9, Ref +15, Will +13; +1 status to all saves vs. magic
HP 67, regeneration 5 (deactivated by good or silver);
Immunities cold; Weaknesses good 5, silver 5
Whispering Wounds (aura, divine, enchantment, mental,
visual) 30 feet. When a creature ends its turn in the aura,
it hears the wounds on the ostiarius’s body whisper obscene
truths. The creature must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become
sickened 1.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ claw +13 (agile, evil, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 2d6+2
slashing plus 2d6 persistent bleed
Divine Innate Spells DC 24; 3rd enthrall, wanderer’s guide; 2nd
calm emotions (at will), darkness, silence; Cantrips (3rd) shield
Rituals DC 22; inveigle
Compel Courage Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, emotion, enchantment,
linguistic, mental) The ostiarius inspires their willing allies and
themself by whispering words of courage from their wounds.
The ostiarius and their allies in a 50-foot emanation gain a +1
status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear eﬀects.
The ostiarius can Sustain Compel Courage. Non-velstracs who accept this
compelled courage ﬁnd bleeding wounds opening on their own bodies to
whisper in thanks. They take 1 persistent bleed damage and can’t attempt
a ﬂat check to end this damage as long as they’re compelled.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The ostiarius
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against whispering wounds. In addition, if the creature was
already sickened and fails its save, the creature is fascinated by the ostiarius and
can’t use hostile actions. This fascination lasts for 1 round or until the ostiarius takes
any hostile action against the creature or the creature’s allies. Whether the creature
succeeds at or fails the save, it is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
EVANGELIST
Evangelists, the velstracs’ unofﬁcial ambassadors, roam the farthest reaches
of the planes to spread the word of their kind’s abhorrent belief in perfection
through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the
