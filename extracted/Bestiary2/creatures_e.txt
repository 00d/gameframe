# ELASMOSAURUS
================================================================================


OTHER AQUATIC REPTILES
The elasmosaurus is but one of
many types of aquatic reptiles found
in primeval oceans or lost worlds.
Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are
almost ﬁshlike in appearance.
Others, such as the mosasaurus,
are truly massive beasts capable of
killing and eating whales.
Elasmosaurus
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and
seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar
locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies
underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to
their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An
elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for
even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote
lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are
mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with
near‑humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem
to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it’s theorized that a typical water
orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both
to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions,
those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds
to speciﬁc regions. As a result, it’s not unheard of for a wandering specimen to
ﬁnd its way to coastal waters. Those that do often ﬁnd the ports of small towns
or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by
coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward
elasmosaurus like this ﬁnds its way into a city’s
sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become
the stuff of urban legends.

Long Neck An elasmosaurus’s long neck allows it to interact with the surface while
its body remains submerged underwater. While submerged no deeper than 15 feet
underwater, an elasmosaurus can still stick its head up to breathe. An elasmosaurus
gains cover against attacks made against creatures who are above the water’s
surface while it is underwater, even if its head is above the surface.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Jaws only.

Melee Ȱɵ jaws +17 (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+10 piercing plus Grab
Melee Ȱɵ paddle +17, Damage 2d6+10 bludgeoning
Drag Below Ȱɵ (attack) The elasmosaurus attempts an Athletics check against a
grabbed foe’s Fortitude DC. If the elasmosaurus succeeds, the foe is forcibly moved
5 feet toward the elasmosaurus’s body. If the elasmosaurus
critically succeeds, the foe is moved 10 feet towards the
elasmosaurus’s body.
Thrashing Retreat ʚʖ A swimming
elasmosaurus thrashes the area
around it as it attempts to ﬂee.
It makes two paddle Strikes, each
of which must be against
separate
targets,
and
each of which takes the
normal multiple attack penalty. It then Swims up
to its swim Speed. This Swim does not trigger
reactions based on movement.

DIVERSE ELEMENTALS
The Elemental Planes are more
than expanses of sky, rock, ﬁre,
and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and
storms ﬂoat through the Plane of Air.
The Plane of Earth includes verdant
groves, shining metal and crystal,
and irradiated wastelands. The Plane
of Fire features magma, suﬀocating
smoke, and radiant ﬁrelight. Amid the
endless sea of the Plane of Water are
pockets of ooze and brine, plus the
otherworldly environs of the deep.
Elemental, Air
Some elementals embody aspects of air such as smoke, lightning, and fog.
SPARK BAT
Spark bats congregate around volatile weather in the Plane of Air.

SAND SENTRY
Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and
featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace.
The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area
of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles,
making them well suited for long-term service.

================================================================================
PAGE 110
================================================================================

SAND MIMICS
Sand sentries have no true culture
or society of their own, but they
are endlessly fascinated with the
society and culture of humanoids
they encounter. They can shape their
appearance to mimic any similarly
sized humanoids, and although
they always remain obviously
composed of sand, they do their best
to mimic the day-to-day activities
they observe other humanoids
performing. Of course, structures
and objects sand sentries build from
sand never last, but this never seems
to stiﬂe their obsession.

FIRE ELEMENTAL TREASURE
Often, nothing remains after
defeating a ﬁre elemental but a pile
of ashes and the fading smell of
smoke. But sometimes, fragments
of their elemental power remain
behind. At the GM’s discretion, a ﬁre
elemental can leave behind ashes,
lumps of charcoal, or ever-smoldering
cinders that are valuable components
for the construction of ﬁre-themed
magic items.
Elemental, Fire
Fire elementals sometimes incorporate burning materials into their being, or
possibly superheated materials such as molten rock or searing smoke.
EMBER FOX
Ember foxes resemble their canid namesakes, save for the ﬂames that make their
fur and the tips of their long whiskers ﬂicker and glow.

Bestiary 2
PSYCHOPOMP TRAITORS
Some psychopomps view their task
of sorting souls as ultimately hollow
and meaningless, since the multiverse
itself must one day end. Eons ago,
these rebels shirked their duties
and ﬂed to the empty corners of
the planes, becoming a new type of
evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils
feed on mortal fears, particularly
fears of death, and enjoy tormenting
those who must die. Psychopomps
generally leave these malcontents
alone, except when sahkils interfere
with the proper ﬂow of souls.
Psychopomp
Many psychopomps are intimately involved with the Boneyard’s massive
bureaucracy. Few pursue mercy, justice, or personal gain; their duties to Pharasma
and her Boneyard are supreme. Nevertheless, individual psychopomps interpret
their duties in different ways, which might put them in conﬂict with mortals or even
with each other.
ESOBOK
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of
the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around
their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with
those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their
business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when snifﬁng out
threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they’re among the least
intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats.
The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won’t do so twice.

Wrench Spirit Ȱɵ (attack, divine, incapacitation, necromancy) Requirement
A creature is grabbed by the esobok’s jaws; Eﬀect The esobok releases
the target from the Grab but wrenches its spirit free as it does so. The creature
must attempt a DC 20 Will save. Creatures without souls (such as most constructs)
and creatures whose bodies and souls are one (such as most celestials, ﬁends, and
monitors) that roll a failure or critical failure on the save get a success instead.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The target is stunned 1.
Failure The esobok wrenches the target’s soul from its body
into its jaws. Mindless undead creatures of level 2 or lower are
destroyed, other undead creatures are stunned for 1 round, and all
other creatures are paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a creature
paralyzed by this eﬀect can attempt a new save to end the eﬀect. The
paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws Strike or speaks.
Critical Failure As failure, but as long as a creature is stunned or paralyzed, it is
also stupeﬁed 2.

PSYCHOPOMP FOES
Psychopomps’ greatest enemies are
creatures that devour or steal souls,
such as astradaemons and night
hags. Their other opponents include
necromancers, proteans, and those
who have unnaturally extended their
lifespan, such as liches.
CATRINA
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these
souls, helping to convince them of the ﬁnality of their fate to ease a spirit’s passing.
Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can’t accept their death. They
perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion
for a mortal’s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help
an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright ﬂowers and colorful dresses,
giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most
catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and
carry garlands of ﬂowers.

SOLIFUGID BURROWS
Most species of solifugid lay their
eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t
eat while guarding her eggs, and
thus ﬁghts even more aggressively
against any creatures she deems
potential threats to her brood. The
bodies of wayward adventurers often
litter such burrows, though this does
little to deter other fortune-hunters
from trying their luck in such
treasure-laden nests.
Solifugid
These monstrous vermin have six legs and two large feeding appendages easily
mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders,
sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders
nor scorpions.
GIANT SOLIFUGID
The smallest of giant solifugids are still large enough to harry desert traders and
their mounts.

DESPICABLE ORIGINS
Velstracs originated with the ﬁrst
debased thoughts of mortals, which
divine beings found so deplorable
that they locked all velstracs away
in Hell. It wasn’t long, however,
before the newly formed beings
escaped their infernal prison to the
Shadow Plane.
Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal ﬂesh-sculptors or serving as
wardens of horriﬁc dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may
serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for
mortal’s souls or choice mortal ﬂesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans,
although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh
350 pounds or more.

Unnerving Gaze (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. When a
creature ends its turn in the aura, it sees the face of a departed loved one in place

frightened 2 (frightened 3 on a critical failure).
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ chain +17 (disarm, evil, magical, reach 10 feet, trip), Damage
2d8+7 piercing plus 1d6 persistent bleed and impaling chain
Animate Chains (divine, transmutation) Chains in the evangelist’s
vicinity sprout barbs and writhe menacingly. The evangelist can
make chain Strikes against any creature that is adjacent to an
unattended chain within 20 feet, in addition to those within the
reach of the evangelist’s chain Strike.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual)
The evangelist stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The
target must immediately attempt a Will save against unnerving
gaze. In addition, if the creature was already frightened, on a failed
save, the evangelist is concealed from the creature for as long as the
creature remains frightened. After attempting this save, the creature
is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist’s next turn.
Impaling Chain When the evangelist critically hits with a chain Strike,
the target is impaled and anchored in place, becoming grabbed by
the chain. The creature is unable to recover from persistent bleed
damage until it gets free (DC 25 Escape).
SACRISTAN
Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures
whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken
by the velstracs’ torments. These unfortunates are
assembled from scrap metal, nerveless ﬂesh, and
bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic
pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans
are empowered by a miniature gateway to the
Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending
their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and
windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in
appearance but are the size of maimed humans.
Their features are redundant or absent and they are
wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.

================================================================================
PAGE 284
================================================================================

THE SHADOW FORGE
Many velstracs outsource the forging
of their chains to unique velstracs
known as almoners. These six-armed,
legless humanoids toil endlessly at
a great burning foundry called the
Shadow Forge. Almoners operate
under mysterious strictures, and are
just as likely to turn a velstrac away
empty-handed as not.

DEADLY WHIPS
Canny adventurers can harvest a
defeated violet fungus’s tentacles and
use them as whips. The whips inﬂict
violent rot (with the same eﬀects
and DC as in the violet fungus’s
stat block) on anything they touch,
including the wielder, although metal
gloves such as gauntlets can protect
against the poison. Such whips can be
used for 1 hour before they degrade
and become useless.
Violet Fungus
At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and
sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer—
once whip-like tentacles dripping with ﬂesh-rotting venom slither out from the
fungus’s cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool
become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the
clutches of this monstrous fungus’s tentacles, since violet fungi are practically
synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
Anyone who has ever braved the world’s caves for an extended period of
time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as
drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush
with this vicious plant’s cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean
trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch
game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands
peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths
in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a
ﬁrst line of defense.
