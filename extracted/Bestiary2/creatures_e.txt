# ELASMOSAURUS
================================================================================


OTHER AQUATIC REPTILES
The elasmosaurus is but one of
many types of aquatic reptiles found
in primeval oceans or lost worlds.
Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are
almost ﬁshlike in appearance.
Others, such as the mosasaurus,
are truly massive beasts capable of
killing and eating whales.
Elasmosaurus
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and
seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar
locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies
underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to
their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An
elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for
even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote
lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are
mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with
near‑humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem
to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it’s theorized that a typical water
orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both
to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions,
those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds
to speciﬁc regions. As a result, it’s not unheard of for a wandering specimen to
ﬁnd its way to coastal waters. Those that do often ﬁnd the ports of small towns
or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by
coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward
elasmosaurus like this ﬁnds its way into a city’s
sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become
the stuff of urban legends.

Long Neck An elasmosaurus’s long neck allows it to interact with the surface while
its body remains submerged underwater. While submerged no deeper than 15 feet
underwater, an elasmosaurus can still stick its head up to breathe. An elasmosaurus
gains cover against attacks made against creatures who are above the water’s
surface while it is underwater, even if its head is above the surface.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Jaws only.
Speed 5 feet, swim 35 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +17 (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+10 piercing plus Grab
Melee Ȱɵ paddle +17, Damage 2d6+10 bludgeoning
Drag Below Ȱɵ (attack) The elasmosaurus attempts an Athletics check against a
grabbed foe’s Fortitude DC. If the elasmosaurus succeeds, the foe is forcibly moved
5 feet toward the elasmosaurus’s body. If the elasmosaurus
critically succeeds, the foe is moved 10 feet towards the
elasmosaurus’s body.
Thrashing Retreat ʚʖ A swimming
elasmosaurus thrashes the area
around it as it attempts to ﬂee.
It makes two paddle Strikes, each
of which must be against
separate
targets,
and
each of which takes the
normal multiple attack penalty. It then Swims up
to its swim Speed. This Swim does not trigger
reactions based on movement.

DIVERSE ELEMENTALS
The Elemental Planes are more
than expanses of sky, rock, ﬁre,
and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and
storms ﬂoat through the Plane of Air.
The Plane of Earth includes verdant
groves, shining metal and crystal,
and irradiated wastelands. The Plane
of Fire features magma, suﬀocating
smoke, and radiant ﬁrelight. Amid the
endless sea of the Plane of Water are
pockets of ooze and brine, plus the
otherworldly environs of the deep.
Elemental, Air
Some elementals embody aspects of air such as smoke, lightning, and fog.

SAND MIMICS
Sand sentries have no true culture
or society of their own, but they
are endlessly fascinated with the
society and culture of humanoids
they encounter. They can shape their
appearance to mimic any similarly
sized humanoids, and although
they always remain obviously
composed of sand, they do their best
to mimic the day-to-day activities
they observe other humanoids
performing. Of course, structures
and objects sand sentries build from
sand never last, but this never seems
to stiﬂe their obsession.

HP 94; Immunities bleed, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Glass Armor When the sand sentry takes ﬁre or lightning damage, its outer layer of sand
fuses into sheets of hardened glass for 1 minute. This increases the sand sentry’s AC to
26 and grants it resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, force, piercing, and slashing
damage. A sand sentry can’t use earth glide while glass armor is active.

Blinding Sand When the sand sentry critically hits with a ﬁst Strike, the target is blinded
for 1 round.
GRANITE GLYPTODONT
This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back
and a ﬂail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with
all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the ﬂesh of those it
calciﬁes, as if the mere proximity of ﬂesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.

Speed 30 feet, burrow 20 feet; earth glide
Melee Ȱɵ  tail +20 (forceful, reach 10 feet, versatile piercing), Damage 2d12+9
bludgeoning plus calciﬁcation
Calciﬁcation (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) A blow from a granite
glyptodont’s tail hardens the ﬂesh of the creature struck. The target must
succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or become slowed 1 (or
slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves
against calciﬁcation increase the value of the
slowed condition. Once a creature’s actions are
reduced to 0 by calciﬁcation, that creature
becomes petriﬁed. If the creature isn’t
petriﬁed, the slowed conditions end once 1
minute passes without the creature failing a
save against calciﬁcation.
Every 24 hours after it was petriﬁed,
the creature can attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it
becomes ﬂesh again, but is slowed 1 for
the next 24 hours. On a critical success,
the creature recovers and isn’t slowed.
On a failure, the creature remains
petriﬁed, but can try again in 24 hours.
On a critical failure, the petriﬁcation
is permanent, and the creature can’t
attempt any more saves.
Earth Glide As living boulder.

PSYCHOPOMP FOES
Psychopomps’ greatest enemies are
creatures that devour or steal souls,
such as astradaemons and night
hags. Their other opponents include
necromancers, proteans, and those
who have unnaturally extended their
lifespan, such as liches.
CATRINA
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these
souls, helping to convince them of the ﬁnality of their fate to ease a spirit’s passing.
Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can’t accept their death. They
perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion
for a mortal’s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help
an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright ﬂowers and colorful dresses,
giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most
catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and
carry garlands of ﬂowers.

Calming Presence (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation) 30 feet. A
creature that begins its turn within the area must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to calming
presence for 24 hours.
Success The creature’s attack rolls take a –1 status penalty for 1 round.
Failure Any emotion eﬀects that would aﬀect the creature are suppressed and the
creature can’t use hostile actions. If the creature is subjected to hostility from any
other creature, it ceases to be aﬀected by calming presence and is temporarily
immune to calming presence for 24 hours.
Critical Failure As failure, but hostility doesn’t end the eﬀect.

Compel Condemned Ȱɵ (divine, enchantment, incapacitation,
mental) The catrina telepathically compels a creature
within 30 feet to approach and allow the catrina to kiss
them, in preparation for using Kiss of Death. The target
must attempt a DC 22 Will save.
Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune
to Compel Condemned for 24 hours.
Failure The creature must spend each of its actions to move closer to the catrina as
quickly as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the compelled creature is
adjacent to the catrina, it stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature takes any damage,
the eﬀect ends and the creature is temporarily immune to Compel Condemned for
24 hours. This eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but if the catrina uses this ability again on
subsequent rounds, it extend the duration by 1 round for all aﬀected creatures.
Critical Failure As failure, but damage does not end the eﬀect.
Kiss of Death ʚʖ (death, divine, manipulate, necromancy) The catrina gives a long,
passionate kiss to an unconscious or willing creature, dealing 3d6 negative damage.
Any creature damaged by the same catrina’s Kiss of Death for 3 consecutive rounds
becomes unconscious and is dying 1.
Spirit Touch As esobok.

SOLIFUGID BURROWS
Most species of solifugid lay their
eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t
eat while guarding her eggs, and
thus ﬁghts even more aggressively
against any creatures she deems
potential threats to her brood. The
bodies of wayward adventurers often
litter such burrows, though this does
little to deter other fortune-hunters
from trying their luck in such
treasure-laden nests.
Solifugid
These monstrous vermin have six legs and two large feeding appendages easily
mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders,
sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders
nor scorpions.

The smallest of giant solifugids are still large enough to harry desert traders and
their mounts.

THE SHADOW FORGE
Many velstracs outsource the forging
of their chains to unique velstracs
known as almoners. These six-armed,
legless humanoids toil endlessly at
a great burning foundry called the
Shadow Forge. Almoners operate
under mysterious strictures, and are
just as likely to turn a velstrac away
empty-handed as not.

Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The sacristan
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against staggering servitude. In addition, if the creature was
already stunned, on a failed save its revulsion toward the sacristan’s presence causes
it to be stupeﬁed 2 for 1 minute. After attempting this save, the creature is then
temporarily immune until the start of the sacristan’s next turn.
Shadow Scream ̂ˬ (aura, concentrate, darkness, divine, evocation, mental, sonic)
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The sacristan opens their mouth to unloose
the wailing howls and mind-twisting darkness of the Shadow Plane.
This creates a 30-foot emanation of darkness and wailing sounds
around the sacristan. Creatures with darkvision can’t see through
this darkness. The sacristan can Sustain Shadow Scream for up
to 1 minute. Non-velstrac creatures in the area when the ability is
used, as well as those who enter or start their turn in the area, must
attempt a DC 28 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is
unaﬀected and is then temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is deafened for 1 round.
Failure The creature is confused and deafened for
1 round.
Critical Failure The creature takes 20 mental damage,
and is confused and deafened for 1 round.
INTERLOCUTOR
Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of
the velstracs, carving away ﬂesh and replacing it with
new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal.
Each interlocutor structures their individual
appearance carefully, but all are towering,
multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest
limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they
can ﬁnd. They continually search for new
material to graft to their forms, and their slain
foes are rarely found intact, as little is
more valuable to interlocutors than a
powerful opponent’s legs, eyes, or even
brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall
and weigh approximately 800 pounds.

DEADLY WHIPS
Canny adventurers can harvest a
defeated violet fungus’s tentacles and
use them as whips. The whips inﬂict
violent rot (with the same eﬀects
and DC as in the violet fungus’s
stat block) on anything they touch,
including the wielder, although metal
gloves such as gauntlets can protect
against the poison. Such whips can be
used for 1 hour before they degrade
and become useless.
Violet Fungus
At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and
sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer—
once whip-like tentacles dripping with ﬂesh-rotting venom slither out from the
fungus’s cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool
become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the
clutches of this monstrous fungus’s tentacles, since violet fungi are practically
synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
Anyone who has ever braved the world’s caves for an extended period of
time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as
drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush
with this vicious plant’s cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean
trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch
game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands
peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths
in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a
ﬁrst line of defense.
