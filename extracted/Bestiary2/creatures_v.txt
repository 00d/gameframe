PRIMORDIAL VERANALLIA
In the deepest reaches of Elysium,
the eldest of veranallias roam. These
beings concern themselves with
transformations that take place over
the course of millennia, as well as
changes in the climates of entire
worlds. Primordial veranallias have
an array of unique powers that
can aﬀect the area for many miles
around them, from turning deserts
into glass to triggering earthquakes.
VERANALLIA (REBIRTH AZATA)
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely
interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings ﬁnd their nature hard to
comprehend, but those who secure their aid ﬁnd them powerful allies. The lower
half of a veranallia’s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying
cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body
appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain
consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and
destruction alike. The world around them overﬂows with an abundance of
vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction,
they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life.
They trigger forest ﬁres in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels,
and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

Eﬀect The veranallia spends a minute to
encase a creature that has been dead for
no more than a year in a cocoon. After 24
hours, the creature is restored to life, and
the cocoon explodes in a shower of colorful
blossoms. If the veranallia’s chooses, Rebirth can change the
creature’s ancestry or heritage, typically into an aasimar.

TRAINED DIGGERS
Kobolds and others who dwell in
underground warrens know the
value of having a few trained giant
badgers in their lair, since when
their digging habits are supervised
and directed, they can excavate new
tunnels and chambers with ease. Of
course, the fact that giant badgers
ﬁnd kobolds and others who dwell
in underground warrens delicious
means that relying on such trained
diggers can be a risky endeavor. A
giant badger trained for use as a
digger or a guardian tends to only
obey the commands of one master,
and even then they can be prone
to unpredictable outbursts for no
reason other than pique.
Badger
The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally
ﬁerce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
BADGER
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A
threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically ﬁghts
until slain.

GIANT BADGER
The violent, territorial giant badger is a relentless predator. An obligate carnivore,
its prey ranges from rabbits to deer, livestock, and even the occasional traveler or
adventurer. A giant badger’s claws are sharp and strong enough to carve tunnels from
solid rock. They typically stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 500 pounds.

The giant badger enters a state of pure
rage that lasts for 1 minute, until there
are no enemies it can perceive, or until it
falls unconscious, whichever comes ﬁrst.
While raging, the giant badger has AC 17,
its jaws Strike deals 1d8+8 damage,
and its claw Strike deals 1d6+6
damage. While raging, the giant
badger also can’t use actions
that have the concentrate
trait except for Seek.
After it has stopped

can’t
use
Badger Rage again for
1 minute.

LENG
Known variously as the Nightmare
Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams,
the frozen Plateau of Leng looms
physically and spiritually above the
Dreamlands. Both a part of that
dimension and a corruption of it, Leng
is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors
and ruled by the horrors’ ancient gods.
Denizen of Leng
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent
humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond
the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
dress themselves in ﬂowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the ﬁerce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even
higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests,
laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare
Realm with cold malice.

No Breath Denizens of Leng don’t need to breathe.
Planar Fast Healing A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng
at all times, and when away from Leng, they have fast healing 5.
They lose this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections
do not function. If killed, their body dissolves into nothingness
in 1d4 rounds, leaving behind their equipment. A slain denizen
reforms in Leng; they can be permanently killed only when
their planar fast healing doesn’t function.

message, read aura; Constant (4th) tongues
Debilitating Bite (curse, occult) A creature that takes damage
from a denizen’s bite must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save
or become clumsy 1. Each time a target fails an additional
save against this ability, the condition value increases by 1
(to a maximum of clumsy 4). This condition value decreases
by 1 every 24 hours.
Leng Ruby (enchantment, occult) Many denizens of Leng carry
strange rubies mined from quarries in Leng. As long as a creature
holds a Leng ruby that it willingly accepted as a gift or payment
from a denizen of Leng, any denizen of Leng can target that
creature with outcast’s curse, phantom pain, or mind reading at
a range of 1 mile, and the bearer uses an outcome one
degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw
against outcast’s curse.

GREMLIN FAITH
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes
drawn to the worship of archdevils,
though not in an orthodox fashion.
Dispater is revered as the archdevil
of cities—playgrounds to engage in
thievery and sabotage. Mammon is
worshipped as the bringer of wealth
and protector of gremlin warrens
that, like his domain of Erebus,
are dark and trap-ﬁlled. Neutral
evil gremlins have been known to
worship Norgorber in his aspect as a
patron of thieves, but pugwampis in
particular prefer to worship gnolls (or
at least, worship whoever the local
gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins
often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord
of illusions, knives, and traps. Those
that retain a connection to the First
World may swear allegiance to the
Lantern King, Eldest of laughter,
mischief, and transmutation.
Rusting Grasp ʚʖ (primal, transmutation) Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The vexgit
makes a +9 spell attack against a creature or unattended object. If they succeed,
the vexgit deals 1d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is
wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If they hit an unattended metal item, the
item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses Shield Block with a metal
shield against this attack, the shield is automatically broken, but no other item is
rusted on that attack.
Speedy Sabotage When a vexgit succeeds or critically succeeds at a check to Disable a
Device, they gain an additional success toward disabling a complex device.
NUGLUB
The “towering” hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though
they’re not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black,
oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy
killing with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend
long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of
sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy
building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims
consider familiar, such as front doors and the ﬂoors around beds. If someone else
gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.
In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to
envy on the part of the nuglubs, who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ﬁt armor on their twisted
bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over
them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend
upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.
Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to
violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is
more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.

VERDUROUS CONGREGATION
When verdurous oozes gather in
suﬃcient number, they can merge
together into conjoined forms.
These enlarged blobs develop red
and white connecting vessels that
pulse hideously as thick, green ﬂuid
moves within them. While conjoined,
the oozes move as one creature.
Their usual enliven foliage and
sleep gas auras double in size, and
they become even more aggressive,
feeding voraciously on any metal or
ﬂesh they can ﬁnd.
Constrict Ȱɵ 2d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 24
Sleep Gas ʚʖ (incapacitation, mental, poison, sleep) The verdurous ooze adjusts its aura
of supernatural vapors to aﬀect living creatures within a 20-foot emanation, forcing
them to attempt a DC 24 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and becomes temporarily immune to Sleep
Gas for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes
up automatically.
Critical Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 hour, it
wakes up automatically.
Verdurous Ooze Acid A verdurous ooze’s acid damages only metal and ﬂesh—not bone,
stone, or other materials.
CARNIVOROUS BLOB
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the
stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto
unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant
for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When
a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it
lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming
every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until
it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at
which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping
food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way
to defeat it. The blob’s ability to split into smaller
oozes that might stay hidden after a ﬁght means it can
be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.

creature is the target of this Reactive Strike.

Carnivorous Blob Acid A carnivorous blob’s acid damages
only ﬂesh—not bone, stone, wood, or other materials—
but is nonetheless devastating. Whenever a creature
takes damage from this acid, it must succeed at a
DC 33 Fortitude save or become drained 1 (drained 2
on a critical failure). On each subsequent failure, the
drained condition value increases by 1 (or by 2 on a
critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.

PSYCHOPOMP COURTS
Psychopomps rarely oppose
celestials or ﬁends. In fact, they
frequently host such creatures in
the Boneyard, particularly in the
sprawling psychopomp courts where
these outsiders petition for one
soul or another to be remanded to
their jurisdiction. Complicated cases
are judged by yamarajes, while the
thorniest or most politically delicate
are handed by Pharasma herself.
YAMARAJ
The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose
wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma
herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an
emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the
senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly
individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in
their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.

MYTHOLOGICAL ORIGINS
The vrykolakas (pronounced
“vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead
creature from Greek folklore. These
revenants appear as humans come
back after death to complete some
task left undone before they can
peacefully rest. Many are vengeful
and murderous, but some are simply
attempting to return to their former
lives, like a shoemaker rising from
the grave to mend his children’s
shoes, carry water, and chop
ﬁrewood. The Pathﬁnder version of
this creature is more associated with
a feral form of vampire.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) When Drinking Blood, the vrykolakas master
regains 19 HP.
Rend Ȱɵ claw

after it makes both attacks. If it hits with both claws,
the target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
Steal Breath ʚʖ (manipulate) Requirements The

creature; Eﬀect The vrykolakas ancient steals
the creature’s breath. The unconscious creature
begins suﬀocating, can’t be awakened for 1
round, and must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude
save. If a creature is targeted with this
ability in consecutive rounds, the save DC
decreases by 2 each round after the ﬁrst.
Critical
Success
The
target
immediately awakens and is then
temporarily immune to Steal
Breath for 24 hours.
Success The target is unaﬀected.
Failure The target takes
1d10 damage.
Critical Failure The target
is reduced to 0 HP and
becomes dying 1.

AGENTS OF EMPTY DEATH
Vampiric mists are linked to the
will-o’-wisp, another notorious
swamp-dwelling, vaporous predator,
in that both of these entities are
often encountered in areas where
the Outer God Nhimbaloth has
brushed close to the world. Often,
the wounds on a corpse fed upon by
a vampiric mist bear Nhimbaloth’s
mark: a cluster of seven perfectly
spaced punctures through which the
victim’s blood has been drained.
Vampiric Mist
Though they’re often mistaken for vampires in gaseous form or an unusual type
of air elemental, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an
amorphous body that consists as much of ﬂuid as it does of air, these creatures
dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat
isn’t as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas,
as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While
blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these
sadistic monsters vastly prefer the ﬂavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures.
Like will-o’-wisps, vampiric mists ﬁnd that fear ﬂavors the blood, though they
gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.
Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They
sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working
together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they
approach with great creativity. The mists’ propensity for taking on vague, skeletal
forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and
fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric
mists enjoy using this common misconception
to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish
tactics—such as tricking spellcasters
into attempting to use positive
energy against them as if they
were undead monsters.

FORBIDDEN ARMOR
After a devastating battle with a
vaspercham, many legendary heroes
have tried to forge armor or weapons
from the magical shell of the sea
beast, but all have failed because of
the powerful curse that suﬀuses the
opaline material. If one were able to
dispel the curse of a vaspercham’s
shell—or somehow twist the curse
to their own beneﬁt—they would be
able to craft an incredible suit of
spell-reﬂecting plate mail.
Vaspercham
The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and
destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new
home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A
vaspercham’s physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard
to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a
vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best
a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature
recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.

Success The spell is unaﬀected, but if the spell allows a saving throw, the vaspercham
gains a +1 circumstance bonus to save against it.
Failure If the spell has a target and there are one or more viable targets within its
range, the spell’s target changes, determined randomly by the GM. If there is no
other possible target within range or the spell has no target, the spell is disrupted.

A MORTAL NAME
Some mortals refer to velstracs
as “kytons,” a misattribution that
the velstracs tolerate with cold
amusement. The term “kyton” denotes
a master or virtuoso among their kind,
and these ﬁends enjoy being labeled
as masters of their horrid paths of
perfection through agony.
Velstrac
The search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation is the horrifying
preoccupation of the shadow-dwelling ﬁends known as velstracs. They transcend
their stoic detachment only when inﬂicting pain and terror upon their victims,
practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back
on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending
such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as
emotionless tormentors who inﬂict sadistic suffering. These ﬁends claim to
seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don’t recognize any
reﬁnement that doesn’t require the painful excision of the ﬂesh or spirit.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic
mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane. They take on forms that
suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros
of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps
the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through
untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.
AUGUR
These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are
the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single
eye, from which they can see the horrors inﬂicted by other velstracs, who train
the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and
weigh 30 pounds.

VIPER VINE POLLEN
While viper vine pollen degrades
quickly after it is harvested carefully
from the plant, a character who has
a set of alchemical tools can gather
and preserve 1d6 doses of pollen
with a successful DC 33 Crafting
or Nature check and 10 minutes
of work. A single dose of viper
vine pollen is worth 300 gp as raw
materials for crafting any alchemical
or magical item that creates an
incapacitation eﬀect.
Viper Vine
A voracious, ﬂesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom
arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the
approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it
rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that
releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine
can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect
is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.
Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than
through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion
and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form
of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and
make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly
large or dangerous-looking.
The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially
devoured remains of victims. It’s not unusual to ﬁnd the rotting corpses of wild
animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant’s immediate vicinity,
along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A
viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier,
preferring to hunt fresh meat.

turn in the area must attempt a DC 33 Will save or be captivated. The
viper vine can’t use Captivating Pollen for 1d4 rounds.

it must spend each of its actions
to move closer to the viper vine as

NON-EVIL UNDEAD
Void zombies are unusual in that
their animating negative force is
provided by a living parasite that
survives within their corpses,
controlling their nervous systems
for defense and to hunt food. As
such, the soul of a person who
succumbs to an akata’s void death
is not bound to its rotting corpse at
all and travels on to judgment in the
Boneyard unimpeded. Nevertheless,
most worshippers of Pharasma
and crusaders against undeath
still consider void zombies to be
anathema and ﬁght to destroy them.
Void Zombie
A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an akata’s void death afﬂiction
(page 13). This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the
deceased creature’s brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the
corpse’s mouth to drink blood from its victims.
A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and
the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural
end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie ﬁnds a secluded place to vomit
forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva
metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the
corpse as its ﬁrst meal.
The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by
necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien,
not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that
a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata
within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies,
has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other
names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,”
or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace
name has proven difﬁcult to shed.
The driving force behind a void zombie’s violence rises from
the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel
for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often
to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted
within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best,
one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a
captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall (page 301)
in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two—
after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic
outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly
violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct
comparisons of the two creatures particularly difﬁcult, or even
dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk
thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of
this strange behavior.

4d6 acid damage per round. On any round in which the void zombie takes
damage due to its salt water weakness, the larval akata retreats to the depths

LOCAL ORMS
People who live by the lakes
inhabited by legendary water
orms have a tendency to give local
lake monsters names that sound
somewhat homey or even adorable.
As a result, such creatures are often
regarded as local mascots or good-
luck charms—particularly in lakeside
settlements that depend on ﬁshing
as a signiﬁcant income source.
Water Orm
Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always ﬁnd their way
into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of
respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of ﬁshers claiming to have
spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and
gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and
linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability
to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid
contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling
curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm
sightings usually occur when they can’t help but to rise up to the surface to take
a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or ﬂoating
on the water’s surface.
These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even
centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes
without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water
without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty
lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to
their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes
missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the
local water orm is responsible, leading to
folk tales that caution residents against
venturing out alone near the water.
While
most
water
orms
are
described as serpentine or long-necked
reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely
elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea
horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.

Slow Metabolism A water orm can go for 10 years without
feeding. Beyond this limit, the water orm’s hunger causes it to
become slowed 1, but doesn’t otherwise impact its lifespan. A
water orm that’s slowed as a result of starvation can remove
this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.
Undetectable (abjuration, primal) A water orm automatically tries to
counteract any detection, revelation, or scrying divination attempted against it,
using its Stealth modiﬁer for the counteract check.

orm can remain in this form for 8 hours, but it can’t enter salt water when using this
ability. A water orm can return to its normal form using a single action which has the
