================================================================================


PRIMORDIAL VERANALLIA
In the deepest reaches of Elysium,
the eldest of veranallias roam. These
beings concern themselves with
transformations that take place over
the course of millennia, as well as
changes in the climates of entire
worlds. Primordial veranallias have
an array of unique powers that
can aﬀect the area for many miles
around them, from turning deserts
into glass to triggering earthquakes.
VERANALLIA (REBIRTH AZATA)
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely
interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings ﬁnd their nature hard to
comprehend, but those who secure their aid ﬁnd them powerful allies. The lower
half of a veranallia’s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying
cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body
appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain
consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and
destruction alike. The world around them overﬂows with an abundance of
vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction,
they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life.
They trigger forest ﬁres in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels,
and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

Eﬀect The veranallia spends a minute to
encase a creature that has been dead for
no more than a year in a cocoon. After 24
hours, the creature is restored to life, and
the cocoon explodes in a shower of colorful
blossoms. If the veranallia’s chooses, Rebirth can change the
creature’s ancestry or heritage, typically into an aasimar.

Bestiary 2
TRAINED DIGGERS
Kobolds and others who dwell in
underground warrens know the
value of having a few trained giant
badgers in their lair, since when
their digging habits are supervised
and directed, they can excavate new
tunnels and chambers with ease. Of
course, the fact that giant badgers
ﬁnd kobolds and others who dwell
in underground warrens delicious
means that relying on such trained
diggers can be a risky endeavor. A
giant badger trained for use as a
digger or a guardian tends to only
obey the commands of one master,
and even then they can be prone
to unpredictable outbursts for no
reason other than pique.
Badger
The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally
ﬁerce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
BADGER
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A
threatened badger can swiftly become a ferocious combatant that typically ﬁghts
until slain.

VROLIKAI NEWCOMERS
When vrolikais ﬁrst manifest on the
Abyss, they have no base of power and
are, despite their abilities, relatively
defenseless from denizens even more
powerful than themselves. As a result,
most rely upon stealth and patience
for their ﬁrst few centuries while
they build up a network of minions
and establish their own Abyssal
fortiﬁcations before they turn their
attentions back to the Material Plane.

Black Flame Knives A vrolikai can manifest
a dagger-shaped blade of what looks
like crystallized black ﬂame in each of
their four hands. These weapons function as
+2 greater striking daggers, although they fade away
into nothingness 1 minute after a vrolikai no longer carries them.
Consume Death Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, necromancy, visual) As
nabasu, but the vrolikai does not have starvation vulnerability.
Focused Flames ʚʖ The vrolikai attacks a single target with
all of its black ﬂame knives. The demon makes a black
ﬂame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the
vrolikai deals the damage from a black ﬂame
knife Strike to the target, plus an additional
2d6 negative damage for every black ﬂame
knife they wield beyond the ﬁrst (typically
6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack,
the vrolikai deals the damage from one black
ﬂame knife to the target, though they still
miss completely on a critical failure. On a
critical hit, the victim becomes drained 2 as
the focused attack drains pure life essence
as well as damage. This counts toward the
vrolikai’s multiple attack penalty as a number
of attacks equal to the number of black ﬂame
knives the demon wields.
Mindwarping (emotion, enchantment, mental)
The sting of a vrolikai is mind-warping. A creature struck
must attempt a DC 44 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute.
Failure The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1. Further failed
saves against mindwarping increase the condition value
by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature also
becomes confused for 1 minute.
Stolen Death As nabasu.

LENG
Known variously as the Nightmare
Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams,
the frozen Plateau of Leng looms
physically and spiritually above the
Dreamlands. Both a part of that
dimension and a corruption of it, Leng
is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors
and ruled by the horrors’ ancient gods.
Denizen of Leng
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent
humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond
the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
dress themselves in ﬂowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the ﬁerce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even
higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests,
laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare
Realm with cold malice.

Bestiary 2
GREMLIN MINIONS
Most know better than to employ
gremlins, so when the fey creatures
live side-by-side with others, it’s often
as parasites and unwelcome guests.
Imaginative and sinister folk who ﬁnd
themselves infested sometimes catch
the gremlins and release them in the
homes of their enemies.
Gremlin
The mischievous fey known as gremlins seem to come in endless varieties with
differing appearances. Preferring to destroy rather than to build, gremlins almost
never construct their own homes, instead infesting tunnels and abandoned buildings.
They augment these lairs with cruel traps, and sometimes trained animals (often
ones considered pests by humanoids). Gremlin lairs are generally near a city or
village (whether on the surface or in the Darklands) that provides them with a ready
source of food, trap-building materials, and, of course, victims for entertainment.
There is little difference in appearance between male and female gremlins, and
many observers wrongly assume that they are single-gender or genderless. Gremlins
are proliﬁc breeders, and a handful can quickly become a mob. Young gremlins are
raised communally—a necessity, as they exhibit the urge to cause mischief from
birth. They grow quickly and reach full size in a matter of weeks.
VEXGIT
These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that
clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the
works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An
individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or
remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become ﬁlled
with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding
violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.
Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and
other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they’re unable
to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a
maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.
Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger
groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with
additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained
giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in
vexgit lairs.

hour; Eﬀect The vexgit creates a snare of their level or
lower that normally takes 1 minute to craft at no cost.
A single vexgit can maintain one gremlin snare at
a time—if they create a new snare, the previously
created one vanishes.

================================================================================
PAGE 136
================================================================================

GREMLIN FAITH
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes
drawn to the worship of archdevils,
though not in an orthodox fashion.
Dispater is revered as the archdevil
of cities—playgrounds to engage in
thievery and sabotage. Mammon is
worshipped as the bringer of wealth
and protector of gremlin warrens
that, like his domain of Erebus,
are dark and trap-ﬁlled. Neutral
evil gremlins have been known to
worship Norgorber in his aspect as a
patron of thieves, but pugwampis in
particular prefer to worship gnolls (or
at least, worship whoever the local
gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins
often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord
of illusions, knives, and traps. Those
that retain a connection to the First
World may swear allegiance to the
Lantern King, Eldest of laughter,
mischief, and transmutation.
Rusting Grasp ʚʖ (primal, transmutation) Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The vexgit
makes a +9 spell attack against a creature or unattended object. If they succeed,
the vexgit deals 1d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is
wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If they hit an unattended metal item, the
item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses Shield Block with a metal
shield against this attack, the shield is automatically broken, but no other item is
rusted on that attack.
Speedy Sabotage When a vexgit succeeds or critically succeeds at a check to Disable a
Device, they gain an additional success toward disabling a complex device.
NUGLUB
The “towering” hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though
they’re not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black,
oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy
killing with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend
long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of
sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy
building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims
consider familiar, such as front doors and the ﬂoors around beds. If someone else
gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.
In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to
envy on the part of the nuglubs, who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ﬁt armor on their twisted
bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over
them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend
upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.
Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to
violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is
more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.

# VERDUROUS OOZE
================================================================================

Constrict Ȱɵ 1d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 21
Gray Ooze Acid A gray ooze’s acid damages only metal and organic materials, not stone.
VERDUROUS OOZE
Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places
where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes
are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or
artiﬁcial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep
verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.

Motion Sense As amoeba swarm.
AC 12; Fort +17, Ref +8, Will +10
HP 157; Immunities acid, critical hits, mental, piercing, precision,
slashing, unconscious, visual
Corrosive Surface A creature that hits a verdurous ooze with a
metal weapon or unarmed attack must attempt a DC 21 Reﬂex
save. On a failure, the weapon or creature takes 2d4 acid damage
(after dealing damage to the ooze as normal). Thrown weapons
take this damage automatically with no save.
Enliven Foliage (aura, primal, transmutation) 20 feet. The verdurous
ooze constantly emits supernatural vapors that cause nearby plants
to grow rapidly and writhe and grasp at anything and everything
within the emanation. This area becomes diﬃcult terrain for
non–verdurous ooze creatures. When a creature starts its
turn in this aura, it must succeed at a DC 21 Reﬂex save
or take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds
until it leaves the emanation.
Split When a verdurous ooze that has 10 or more
HP is hit by an attack that would deal piercing or
slashing damage, it splits into two identical oozes,
each with half the original’s HP. One ooze is in the
same space as the original, and the other is in an adjacent,
unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it
automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to ﬁll a
space (the GM decides if an object or creature is too big or heavy to push).
Speed 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ pseudopod +15, Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid and Grab

================================================================================
PAGE 196
================================================================================

VERDUROUS CONGREGATION
When verdurous oozes gather in
suﬃcient number, they can merge
together into conjoined forms.
These enlarged blobs develop red
and white connecting vessels that
pulse hideously as thick, green ﬂuid
moves within them. While conjoined,
the oozes move as one creature.
Their usual enliven foliage and
sleep gas auras double in size, and
they become even more aggressive,
feeding voraciously on any metal or
ﬂesh they can ﬁnd.
Constrict Ȱɵ 2d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 24
Sleep Gas ʚʖ (incapacitation, mental, poison, sleep) The verdurous ooze adjusts its aura
of supernatural vapors to aﬀect living creatures within a 20-foot emanation, forcing
them to attempt a DC 24 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and becomes temporarily immune to Sleep
Gas for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes
up automatically.
Critical Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 hour, it
wakes up automatically.
Verdurous Ooze Acid A verdurous ooze’s acid damages only metal and ﬂesh—not bone,
stone, or other materials.
CARNIVOROUS BLOB
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the
stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto
unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant
for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When
a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it
lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming
every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until
it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at
which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping
food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way
to defeat it. The blob’s ability to split into smaller
oozes that might stay hidden after a ﬁght means it can
be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.

# VANTH
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
VANTH SCYTHES
Vanths’ favored weapon is the scythe,
a choice that even further adds to
their fearsome appearance and can
lead to unfortunate associations with
the Grim Reaper or Urgathoa among
more superstitious mortals. Vanths
ﬁnd such comparisons to be ignorant
at best or insulting at worst. Some
vanths infuse their scythes with
diﬀerent qualities, such as cold iron
or silver, depending on the nature of
their most common enemies.
VANTH
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as
vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask
resembling a vulture’s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to ﬁght against those who
would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to
the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war,
vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any
emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.

A vanth’s scythe is its symbol of
oﬃce and gains a measure of its
personal power. This scythe becomes
a +1 scythe and is treated as if it were
adamantine while the vanth wields it. A
vanth whose scythe is taken or destroyed
can infuse a new one with an hour of work.
Spirit Touch As esobok, but 2d6.
Vanth’s Curse ʚʖ (curse, divine, enchantment,
misfortune) Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The
vanth bestows a curse on a creature by touching it with its scythe.
The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected and is temporarily
immune to Vanth’s Curse for 24 hours.
Success The target feels a momentary shudder of doom and is
stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute by the distracting sensation.
Failure The target becomes morose and glum as it accepts its own inevitable fate. For
1 hour, the target is stupeﬁed 2. Each time the target gains the dying condition, the
stupeﬁed condition value increases by 1, to a maximum value of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the eﬀect is permanent.

PSYCHOPOMP COURTS
Psychopomps rarely oppose
celestials or ﬁends. In fact, they
frequently host such creatures in
the Boneyard, particularly in the
sprawling psychopomp courts where
these outsiders petition for one
soul or another to be remanded to
their jurisdiction. Complicated cases
are judged by yamarajes, while the
thorniest or most politically delicate
are handed by Pharasma herself.
YAMARAJ
The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose
wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma
herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an
emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the
senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly
individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in
their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.

# VAMPIRE SQUID
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
GIANT SQUID TACTICS
The giant squid attacks by lashing
out with its longest tentacles and
then rapidly pulling the prey toward
itself. While closing the distance
between them, it attacks again,
this time closing its smaller arms
around the prey. Once it has the prey
thoroughly trapped, the giant squid
tears and cuts with its beak and the
teeth-lined saw it has in the place of
a tongue.
Squid
The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a
nautical tale.
VAMPIRE SQUID
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead
inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms.
Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of

ends its turn in the area must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become sickened 1.
GIANT SQUID
Dwelling deep within the oceans, this huge cephalopod grows up to 45 feet in
length and can weigh up to 600 pounds. Its arms and tentacles are lined with
hundreds of hooks and suckers, allowing it to seize its prey with ease.

vrykolakas can cloak themselves
in a semblance of living ﬂesh, their
fragmented memories often cannot
accurately recreate their former
appearance or persona. They may not
recognize former family and friends
(and vice versa), but those they
do remember are marked as their
favored victims.

MYTHOLOGICAL ORIGINS
The vrykolakas (pronounced
“vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead
creature from Greek folklore. These
revenants appear as humans come
back after death to complete some
task left undone before they can
peacefully rest. Many are vengeful
and murderous, but some are simply
attempting to return to their former
lives, like a shoemaker rising from
the grave to mend his children’s
shoes, carry water, and chop
ﬁrewood. The Pathﬁnder version of
this creature is more associated with
a feral form of vampire.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) When Drinking Blood, the vrykolakas master
regains 19 HP.
Rend Ȱɵ claw
VRYKOLAKAS ANCIENT
Vrykolakas ancients are the sinister overlords of their kind, stealing blood, breath,
and life to feed their immortal hunger.

AGENTS OF EMPTY DEATH
Vampiric mists are linked to the
will-o’-wisp, another notorious
swamp-dwelling, vaporous predator,
in that both of these entities are
often encountered in areas where
the Outer God Nhimbaloth has
brushed close to the world. Often,
the wounds on a corpse fed upon by
a vampiric mist bear Nhimbaloth’s
mark: a cluster of seven perfectly
spaced punctures through which the
victim’s blood has been drained.
Vampiric Mist
Though they’re often mistaken for vampires in gaseous form or an unusual type
of air elemental, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an
amorphous body that consists as much of ﬂuid as it does of air, these creatures
dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat
isn’t as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas,
as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While
blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these
sadistic monsters vastly prefer the ﬂavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures.
Like will-o’-wisps, vampiric mists ﬁnd that fear ﬂavors the blood, though they
gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.
Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They
sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working
together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they
approach with great creativity. The mists’ propensity for taking on vague, skeletal
forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and
fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric
mists enjoy using this common misconception
to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish
tactics—such as tricking spellcasters
into attempting to use positive
energy against them as if they
were undead monsters.

FORBIDDEN ARMOR
After a devastating battle with a
vaspercham, many legendary heroes
have tried to forge armor or weapons
from the magical shell of the sea
beast, but all have failed because of
the powerful curse that suﬀuses the
opaline material. If one were able to

Vaspercham
The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and
destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new
home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A
vaspercham’s physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard
to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a
vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best
a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature
recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.

A MORTAL NAME
Some mortals refer to velstracs
as “kytons,” a misattribution that
the velstracs tolerate with cold
amusement. The term “kyton” denotes
a master or virtuoso among their kind,
and these ﬁends enjoy being labeled
as masters of their horrid paths of
perfection through agony.
Velstrac
The search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation is the horrifying
preoccupation of the shadow-dwelling ﬁends known as velstracs. They transcend
their stoic detachment only when inﬂicting pain and terror upon their victims,
practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back
on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending
such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as
emotionless tormentors who inﬂict sadistic suffering. These ﬁends claim to
seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don’t recognize any
reﬁnement that doesn’t require the painful excision of the ﬂesh or spirit.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic
mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane. They take on forms that
suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros
of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps
the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through
untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.
AUGUR
These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are
the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single
eye, from which they can see the horrors inﬂicted by other velstracs, who train
the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and
weigh 30 pounds.

DEADLY WHIPS
Canny adventurers can harvest a
defeated violet fungus’s tentacles and
use them as whips. The whips inﬂict
violent rot (with the same eﬀects
and DC as in the violet fungus’s
stat block) on anything they touch,
including the wielder, although metal
gloves such as gauntlets can protect
against the poison. Such whips can be
used for 1 hour before they degrade
and become useless.
Violet Fungus
At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and
sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer—
once whip-like tentacles dripping with ﬂesh-rotting venom slither out from the
fungus’s cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool
become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the
clutches of this monstrous fungus’s tentacles, since violet fungi are practically
synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
Anyone who has ever braved the world’s caves for an extended period of
time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as
drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush
with this vicious plant’s cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean
trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch
game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands
peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths
in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a

VIPER VINE POLLEN
While viper vine pollen degrades
quickly after it is harvested carefully
from the plant, a character who has
a set of alchemical tools can gather
and preserve 1d6 doses of pollen
with a successful DC 33 Crafting
or Nature check and 10 minutes
of work. A single dose of viper
vine pollen is worth 300 gp as raw
materials for crafting any alchemical
or magical item that creates an
incapacitation eﬀect.
Viper Vine
A voracious, ﬂesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom
arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the
approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it
rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that
releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine
can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect
is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.
Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than
through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion
and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form
of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and
make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly
large or dangerous-looking.
The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially
devoured remains of victims. It’s not unusual to ﬁnd the rotting corpses of wild
animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant’s immediate vicinity,
along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A
viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier,
preferring to hunt fresh meat.

NON-EVIL UNDEAD
Void zombies are unusual in that
their animating negative force is
provided by a living parasite that
survives within their corpses,
controlling their nervous systems
for defense and to hunt food. As
such, the soul of a person who
succumbs to an akata’s void death
is not bound to its rotting corpse at
all and travels on to judgment in the
Boneyard unimpeded. Nevertheless,
most worshippers of Pharasma
and crusaders against undeath
still consider void zombies to be
anathema and ﬁght to destroy them.
Void Zombie
A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an akata’s void death afﬂiction
(page 13). This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the
deceased creature’s brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the
corpse’s mouth to drink blood from its victims.
A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and
the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural
end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie ﬁnds a secluded place to vomit
forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva
metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the
corpse as its ﬁrst meal.
The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by
necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien,
not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that
a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata
within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies,
has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other
names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,”
or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace
name has proven difﬁcult to shed.
The driving force behind a void zombie’s violence rises from
the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel
for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often
to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted
within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best,
one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a
captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall (page 301)
in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two—
after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic
outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly
violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct
comparisons of the two creatures particularly difﬁcult, or even
dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk
thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of
this strange behavior.

4d6 acid damage per round. On any round in which the void zombie takes

of the void zombie’s body, causing the void zombie to become slowed 1 until

LOCAL ORMS
People who live by the lakes
inhabited by legendary water
orms have a tendency to give local
lake monsters names that sound
somewhat homey or even adorable.
As a result, such creatures are often
regarded as local mascots or goodluck charms—particularly in lakeside
settlements that depend on ﬁshing
as a signiﬁcant income source.
Water Orm
Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always ﬁnd their way
into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of
respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of ﬁshers claiming to have
spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and
gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and
linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability
to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid
contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling
curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm
sightings usually occur when they can’t help but to rise up to the surface to take
a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or ﬂoating
on the water’s surface.
These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even
centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes
without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water
without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty
lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to
their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes
missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the
local water orm is responsible, leading to
folk tales that caution residents against
venturing out alone near the water.
While
most
water
orms
are
described as serpentine or long-necked
reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely
elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea
horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.
