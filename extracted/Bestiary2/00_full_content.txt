INTRODUCTION
APPENDIX
Welcome to Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2! Inside this tome of
creatures, you’ll ﬁnd ﬁckle fey and grotesque ﬁends,
legendary beasts and powerful animals, new allies to
interact with and horrid monsters to hunt down. This
book details hundreds of new creatures, expanding upon
the myriad monsters introduced in the ﬁrst Pathﬁnder
Bestiary volume.
To use this book, you need the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, which contains the rules of the game and gives
you further understanding of each creature’s rules and
its place in the world. Using both of these books allows
you as the Game Master (or GM) to create stories of
grand adventure and populate them with fearsome foes,
possible allies, and friendly guides.
Most of the sections of this book describe a creature or
a group of related creatures, present their game statistics,
illustrate their place within the game world, and provide
details about their behavior or society.
In this introduction, you can ﬁnd advice on how
to play these creatures in the game, including how to
read and use their statistics, advice on roleplaying their
interactions with player characters, and guidance on
adjusting creature statistics to ﬁt the needs of your setting.
Lastly, the appendix in the back of the book contains
sections that provide information about frequently used
monster abilities, creature traits, new rituals, uncommon
languages, and lists of monsters sorted by type and level.
Playing Creatures
While the other players portray their characters, you
as the Game Master get to play everyone else. This
section provides the basics for using the creatures in this
book. It guides you through the process of reading and
understanding the creatures’ statistics so the creature can
either provide a threat or serve as an ally in and out of
combat. It also provides general advice for roleplaying
creatures to help provide more depth to the creatures in
your game’s world.
READING CREATURE STATISTICS
Each creature’s rules appear in a stat block, with a
structure similar to those of feats, spells, and magic items.
Because creatures have more abilities than those game
elements, however, their statistics include more entries,
many of which have special formats.
A creature’s traits line sometimes begins with a rarity;
if the creature’s rarity is common, no rarity is listed. The
next entry is its alignment, which is given as a one- or
two-letter abbreviation (LG for lawful good, N for neutral,
CE for chaotic evil, and so on); these abbreviations are
listed comprehensively on page 307. Next is the creature’s
size (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan).
Any other traits are then listed. The traits appearing in
Introduction
this book, including some traits from the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, can be found in Creature Traits on page 304.
Actions and activities the creature can use have the
appropriate icons next to those abilities’ names noting
how many actions they require. A creature always has the
requisite proﬁciency ranks or other abilities required to use
what’s listed in its stat block. For instance, a spellcasting
creature can perform the Cast a Spell activity, and a
creature is never untrained with any of its items.
Some abilities are abbreviated in stat blocks and
described in full in the Ability Glossary on pages 304–306.
CREATURE NAME
LEVEL
RARITY TRAIT
ALIGNMENT ABBREVIATION
SIZE
OTHER TRAITS
Perception The creature’s Perception modiﬁer is listed here,
followed by any special senses.
Languages The languages for a typical creature of that kind are
listed here, followed by any special communication abilities.
If a creature lacks this entry, it cannot communicate with or
understand another creature through language.
Skills The creature is trained or better in these skills. For
untrained skills, use the corresponding ability modiﬁer.
Ability Modiﬁers The creature’s ability modiﬁers are listed here.
Items Any signiﬁcant gear the creature carries is listed here.
Interaction Abilities Special abilities that aﬀect how a creature
perceives and interacts with the world are listed here.
AC, followed by any special bonuses to AC; Saving Throws
A special bonus to a speciﬁc save appears in parentheses
after that save’s bonus. Any special bonuses to all three
saving throws against particular types of eﬀects are listed
after the three saves.
HP, followed by automatic abilities that aﬀect the creature’s
Hit Points or healing; Immunities; Weaknesses; Resistances
Any immunities, weaknesses, or resistances the creature
has are listed here.
Automatic Abilities The creature’s auras, any abilities that
automatically aﬀect its defenses, and the like are listed here.
Reactive Abilities Free actions or reactions that are usually
triggered when it’s not the creature’s turn are listed here.
Speed, followed by any other Speeds or movement abilities.
Melee Ȱɵ (traits; some weapon traits, such as deadly, include
their calculations for convenience) The name of the weapon
or unarmed attack the creature uses for a melee Strike,
followed by the attack modiﬁer and traits in parentheses.
If a creature has any abilities or gear that would aﬀect its
attack modiﬁer, such as a weapon with a +1 weapon potency
rune, those calculations are already included, Damage
amount and damage type, plus any additional eﬀects (this
entry is Eﬀect if the Strike doesn’t deal damage).
Ranged Ȱɵ As Melee, but also lists range or range increment
with traits, Damage as Melee.
Spells The entry starts with the magical tradition and
whether the spells are prepared or spontaneous, followed

================================================================================
PAGE 7
================================================================================

Bestiary 2
by the DC (and attack modiﬁer if any spells require spell
attack rolls). Spells are listed by level, followed by cantrips.
A spell prepared multiple times lists the number of times
in parentheses—for example, “(×2).” Spontaneous spells list
the number of spell slots after the spell level.
Innate Spells These are listed like other spells, but can also
include constant, at-will, and focus spells. If the creature
has a focus spell as an innate spell, it works like other innate
spells with listed uses, rather than costing Focus Points.
Spells that can be used an unlimited number of times list
“(at will)” after the spell’s name. Constant spells appear at
the end, separated by level. Rules for constant and at-will
spells appear on page 342 in the Ability Glossary.
Focus Spells If a creature has focus spells, this entry lists the
spells’ level, the Focus Points in the creature’s focus pool, the
DC, and those spells.
Rituals Any rituals the creature can cast appear here.
Oﬀensive or Proactive Abilities Any actions, activities, or
abilities that automatically aﬀect the creature’s oﬀense, as
well as free actions or reactions that are usually triggered
on the creature’s turn, appear here in alphabetical order.
ROLEPLAYING CREATURES
Whether it’s an adversary or a potential ally, a creature
might have a very different worldview than the PCs. When
roleplaying creatures, think about how they experience
the world differently due to their senses, physiology, and
habitat. Each creature entry in this book gives you some
context about the creature’s worldview, motivations,
ecology, and societies. Many sections have sidebars that
provide relevant facts about creatures (labeled with the
icons listed in the Sidebar Icons section on page 7). You can
use the information in each creature entry as cues on how
to roleplaying the creature in and out of combat. These
cues can be as simple as a difference in idioms (perhaps
saying “in the other tentacle” rather than “on the other
hand”) and as complex as determining motivations, hopes,
and dreams for an individual creature. Understanding a
creature you’re playing also informs what tactics they’ll
use, as well as whether they are willing to surrender or ﬂee
when things don’t go their way.
Adjusting Creatures
Sometimes you might need to customize a creature based
on the needs of your story or the narrative circumstances as
your story unfolds. This section guides you through some
basic strategies you can use to adjust creatures. It includes
quick adjustments you can make to a creature to alter its
level. You might also need to adjust a creature’s languages
or gear, or know its proﬁciency ranks in skills or Perception.
COMBAT POWER
The creatures presented in this book have appropriate
statistics for their levels. In many cases, you can make
relatively minor adjustments, called elite and weak
adjustments, to their statistics to make them function 1 level
higher or lower than presented.
Elite and weak adjustments work best with creatures
that focus on physical combat. These adjustments
overstate the normal numerical gains the creature would
make from increasing its level to make up for the lack
of new special abilities. As such, when applied multiple
times to the same creature, these adjustments cause its
statistics to become less accurate for the creature’s level.
These adjustments have a greater effect on the power
level of low-level creatures; applying elite adjustments to
a level –1 creature gives you one closer to 1st level, and
applying weak adjustments to a 1st-level creature gives
you one whose level is closer to –1.
Creatures that cast spells or rely on noncombat abilities
typically need speciﬁc adjustments to those spells or abilities.
ELITe ADJUSTMeNTS
Sometimes you’ll want a creature that’s just a bit more
powerful than normal so that you can present a challenge
that would otherwise be trivial, or show that one enemy
is stronger than its kin. To do this quickly and easily,
apply the elite adjustments to its statistics as follows:
• Increase the creature’s AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs,
saving throws, Perception, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
• Increase the damage of its Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 2. If the creature has limits on how many
times or how often it can use an ability (such as a
spellcaster’s spells or a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 4 instead.
• Increase the creature’s Hit Points based on its starting
level (see the table below).

WeaK ADJUSTMeNTS
Sometimes you’ll want a creature that’s weaker than
normal so you can use a creature that would otherwise
be too challenging, or show that one enemy is weaker
than its kin. To do this quickly and easily, apply the weak
adjustments to its statistics as follows.
• Decrease the creature’s AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs,
saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
• Decrease the damage of its Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 2. If the creature has limits on how many
times or how often it can use an ability (such as a
spellcaster’s spells or a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
decrease the damage by 4 instead.
• Decrease the creature’s HP based on its starting level.

INTRODUCTION
APPENDIX
LANGUAGES
The languages listed in a creature’s entry are what a typical
creature of that type knows. However, you might want to
vary these based on the speciﬁc creature. For instance, if
a creature is interested in speaking with or understanding
the people in its region, it would most likely know the
language those people speak. This language is most often
Common, but you can give it a more appropriate language
depending on what region the creature lives in (such as
Undercommon if the creature lives in the Darklands).
Beings from other planes are unlikely to know any
languages from the Material Plane unless they frequently
travel there. If such a creature knows a mortal language,
then that creature likely is interested in communicating
with mortals. This language is most often Common,
although keep in mind that such a creature should speak
Common only if it speciﬁcally travels to or studies your
campaign’s world and region above others.
The languages in Pathﬁnder can be found on page 65 of
the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook and in the New Languages
section of this book (page 348).
GEAR
Some creatures rely on gear, like armor and weapons. You
might need statistics for such a creature that doesn’t have
its gear. For example, a creature could be Disarmed, it
might be ambushed while it’s out of its armor, or one of its
worn magic items could be disabled with dispel magic. In
most cases, you can simply improvise, but if you want to be
more exacting, use these guidelines for weapons and armor.
If a creature loses its weapon, it might draw another
weapon or use an unarmed attack. If it uses a Strike it
doesn’t have listed in its stat block, ﬁnd a Strike entry
for the creature that most closely matches the substitute,
reduce the attack modiﬁer by 2, and use the damage
dice for the new Strike. If the creature needs to make an
unarmed attack and doesn’t have one listed in its stat
block, it uses the statistics for a ﬁst (Core Rulebook 280).
If the creature loses a weapon with a weapon potency rune,
you usually should reduce the attack modiﬁer by 2 plus the
bonus granted by the weapon’s potency rune for the new
weapon. For example, if the creature is Disarmed of its
+1 mace, then you would reduce the attack modiﬁer by 3
instead of 2 for the new Strike.
If a creature doesn’t have its
armor, ﬁnd the armor in its
Items entry and reduce
the creature’s AC by that
armor’s item bonus (Core Rulebook 275). If the armor has
a potency rune, increase the reduction as appropriate; for
example, if the creature has a suit of +2 chain mail in its
statistics, and the characters catch the creature without its
armor, you would reduce the creature’s AC by 6 instead of
4. If the armor has a resilient rune, reduce the creature’s
saves based on the rune’s type (1 for resilient, 2 for greater
resilient, or 3 for major resilient).
SKILLS, PERCEPTION, AND PROFICIENCY
In some situations, such as when a creature is trying to
Disable a PC’s snare, you need to know the creature’s
proﬁciency rank. Creatures are trained in the skills listed in
their stat blocks. Because monsters aren’t created using the
same rules as PCs, they are untrained in skills that aren’t
listed. A creature usually has expert proﬁciency in its listed
skills around 5th level, master proﬁciency around 9th level,
and legendary proﬁciency around 17th level. A creature
might need a certain proﬁciency rank in Perception to detect
certain things. Many creatures have expert proﬁciency in
Perception, and improve to master proﬁciency around 7th
level and legendary proﬁciency around 13th level.
At your discretion, creatures with world-class aptitude for
a particular skill or in Perception, such as a doppelganger
with Deception, might have a higher rank in that skill
or Perception.

Bestiary 2
Aeon
Aeons are paragons of law above all else. True aeons embody opposing concepts
or forces and are tasked with maintaining balance between those two things,
while inevitables are living constructs that enforce laws both mortal and divine.
THELETOS
Theletoses maintain the balance between fate and free will. A theletos is a roughly
spherical mass of crystals from which emerge four limbs, each split at the elbow
and ending in three-ﬁngered hands. A pair of crystalline tentacles also emerges
from its body. Those who have been damaged by a theletos’s tentacles describe a
disorienting dilemma as they simultaneously feel forced to make a single choice
while also being overwhelmed by the endless options available to choose from.
Theletoses are more likely than most aeons to interfere in non-aeon societies,
particularly in regions with draconian laws. Their involvement is twofold; a
theletos concerns itself with both the freedom of individuals and the laws that
restrict these individuals, even (or especially) when the two are in opposition.

Envisioning When a theletos conveys information, it does so wordlessly through psychic
projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all
creatures regardless of whether they have a language. The meaning to non-aeons can be
vague and is often mysterious. A theletos can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly
with any other aeon on the same plane.

Fate Drain (curse, divine, mental) A creature
damaged by the theletos’s tentacle must
succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1. As long as the creature is stupeﬁed, it can
no longer beneﬁt from fortune eﬀects. If the target fails additional
saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a
maximum of stupeﬁed 4). This condition value decreases by 1
every 24 hours.
Wrath of Fate ʚʖ (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) The
theletos releases a 60-foot cone of energy from its center.
Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with
the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in
store for them and lack of clear pathways to
these potential futures. They must succeed at
MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
Theletoses care little for the individuals
and societies they manipulate, only
that balance between freedom and
fate is maintained. A theletos might
help a creature who has lost their
freedom escape, but it may also force
those who swore to perform an unjust
duty to stick to their word. If its plans
are thwarted, a theletos doesn’t seek
revenge, but instead looks for other
ways to redress the balance.

================================================================================
PAGE 10
================================================================================

a DC 26 Will save or be slowed 1 indeﬁnitely. An aﬀected creature can choose to roll
twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.
ZELEKHUT
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical
centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back.
Instead of hands, the zelekhut’s arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with
electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities,
the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active
ﬂight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse’s
most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut’s quarry are as
famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in
enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own
or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While
hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a
dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn’t shift a single hoof to capture a
corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand
that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the
zelekhut’s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments
and track down those who seek to ﬂee their punishment.

The
zelekhut makes two
chain Strikes, each
targeting a diﬀerent
creature. Each Strike counts toward the zelekhut’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has
made both attacks. If the zelekhut subsequently uses the Knockdown action, it aﬀects
all creatures it hit with Double Attack.
PARADOX AND UNITY
To mortals, aeons sometimes
seem to combine elements that
are fundamentally incompatible,
whether it’s an aeon combining
opposing concepts, or axiomites and
inevitables mixing the organic with
the mathematical or mechanical.
Aeons see no paradox in this, but
rather claim it is an expression of the
underlying unity of all things.

MARUT
A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artiﬁcially extending
their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and
vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth,
use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on
the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable
pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target
is dead.
Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move
with the deliberate grace of a creature made of ﬂesh and bone. A marut never
rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though
able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.

Final End The marut is anathema to beings that unnaturally
extend their existence, including undead. Its ﬁsts bypass such
creatures’ resistances to damage and apply the creatures’ highest weakness to
damage. If a marut kills a creature that rejuvenates, like a lich or ghost, it always
knows that the creature isn’t fully defeated.
Fists of Thunder and Lightning (divine, evocation, incapacitation) Each time the
marut makes a ﬁst Strike, it chooses either lightning or thunder. If it chooses
lightning, the attack deals an additional 2d12 electricity damage and the
target must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 minute. If it
chooses thunder, the attack deals an additional 3d8 sonic damage and the target
must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute.
BYTHOS
The bythos is a guardian of space and time, and at all times seeks out
those who misuse planar and temporal magic. A bythos is a roughly
humanoid creature with four arms and a body made of swirling clouds
and mist. Despite its appearance, its body feels like dry stone. A bythos
seeks out paradoxes caused by irresponsible planar or dimensional
travelers and repairs breaches where the barriers between planes have
become thin or damaged. If the mortals responsible remain in the area
and cannot be convinced to cease their activities, the bythos has no
qualms about removing them. Using its ability to manipulate time, a
bythos might cause an opponent to quickly die of old age as time
speeds up around them, or cause a target to disappear from
time and space.
PSYCHOPOMP ALLIES
The mandate of marut inevitables
is similar to that of psychopomps.
Generally, the practical psychopomps
are content to let an unyielding
marut complete its mission and
swoop in afterward to ensure the
work has been done, but occasionally,
they may work together.

GUARDIANS OF TIME
Bythos aeons have no innate ability
to directly enter the mysterious
Dimension of Time, but many know
of the hidden routes in the Great
Beyond one can use to travel to this
strange realm. A bythos prefers to
destroy those who seek entrance to
the Dimension of Time rather than
risk the knowledge of how to reach it
spreading too far.

Ahuizotl
The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous
cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-ﬁngered paws
supplemented by a ﬁfth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and
stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the
cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl’s macabre habit of feeding on a victim’s
eyes, ﬁngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated.
Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist
ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact
that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual ﬂesh of its victims, instead depositing
their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure
to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely
possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread
fear and despair.
An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating
simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an
extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of
cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature’s vision. Yet despite their bestial
appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser
than most. Although they don’t form societies of their own, they have been
known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found
small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman
of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to
an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.

AHUIZOTL ALLIES
An ahuizotl is unexpectedly
canny in how it handles potential
competitors in its territory, and
when presented with fellow
predators capable of conversation,
it sometimes brokers alliances. Willo’-wisps are particular favorites as
allies, as they can lure prey into the
ahuizotl’s clutches and feast on the
anguish later when the mutilated
corpse is discovered.

Akata
An akata is a hairless, blue-skinned quadruped with fearsome jaws, glowing eyes,
a pair of thin tails, and a mane of writhing tentacles. It is a strangely silent beast,
as it lacks the lungs and vocal chords necessary to vocalize. It also lacks ears, but
it has heightened visual and olfactory senses.
When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into
a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal—the skymetal noqual. An akata can
hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though
it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a
few minutes’ time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void
of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts
with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring
ﬁght among themselves until one proves the strongest. The surviving akata then
animates the corpse—now a void zombie (page 288)—which shambles about of
its own accord.

Hibernation After 3 or more days without eating, an akata can secrete resin that

Broken Threshold of 18. It has resistance 5 to damage from magical
sources. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata can’t be
harmed, and it doesn’t need to eat or drink. While inside the
cocoon, the akata gains lifesense 30 feet. The akata remains
in a state of hibernation until it is exposed to extreme
heat or senses a living creature, at which point it can
burst free of its cocoon in 1d4 minutes.
No Hearing An akata has no auditory senses. It is
immune to auditory eﬀects, automatically
critically fails Perception checks that
require it to hear, and takes a –2
status penalty to Perception checks
(but not initiative rolls) that involve
sound but also rely on other senses.

NOQUAL COCOONS
An akata’s noqual cocoon, despite
its crystalline appearance, is in fact
made of a rare skymetal with a glassy
green sheen. Noqual is as easy to
work as iron but much lighter, and
it is valued for its magic-resistant
qualities, but the noqual from an
akata’s cocoon is very low quality and
can’t be used as a crafting material.

Angel
Angels are benevolent messengers who aid good forces in the ﬁght against evil.
Each angel has a special aura that assists in their individual tasks, and each angel
delivers certain types of messages and performs other duties for the angelic
hosts. While most angels live in the enlightened realm of Nirvana, some serve
the forces of Heaven and Elysium, especially in the case of the angel empyreal
lords within those two realms. Angels organize themselves into choirs depending
on their ranks and roles.
MOVANIC DEVA (GUARDIAN ANGEL)
Movanic devas are stewards of the ﬂow of good creatures’ souls through the cycle
of life and death, from the point a creature is born to the day it dies. These angels
arise from the souls of stalwart nurturers and protectors, and share a speciﬁc
connection with a creature’s vital essence—its life force. Movanic devas are most
concerned with guiding and protecting good creatures during their mortal lives,
so once a soul has passed into the River of Souls, the movanic deva
leaves its protection to the soul angels, or monadic devas. As part of
their stewardship over good creatures, movanic devas can waken within
animals a level of sapience to allow them to become kindly and benevolent
as well, thus increasing the ﬂow of goodness into the afterlife. They also
spend time patrolling the Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy
Plane, seeking to contain signiﬁcant threats to life.

wishes with a +19 counteract modiﬁer and a counteract level of 4,
rolling once for the selected eﬀects.
Flaming Armaments (divine, transmutation) When a movanic deva wields
a weapon, that weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming rune.
THE GIFT OF SAPIENCE
When a movanic deva awakens an
animal, the animal becomes neutral
good and is well-disposed toward
the deva, but the deva understands
that free will is an important part of
life. While the deva provides enough
support and guidance to the animal
to help it adjust to its newly sapient
world view, not all animals awakened
in this way remain on the path of good.

WHAT IS A DEVA?
Three types of devas exist among
the angelic host, all of which serve
as angelic “ﬁeld agents.” Of the types
of angels, devas are the ones most
likely to be encountered dwelling
somewhere other than Nirvana, as
these angels focus their work on
cultivating and protecting goodness
in mortal souls, be they living or dead.
MONADIC DEVA (SOUL ANGEL)
Monadic devas stand vigil along the River of Souls as it passes from the mortal
realm into the Ethereal Plane. Those who seek to ﬁsh souls out for their own use
stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas
ﬁght. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of
Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts.
Monadic devas often ﬁnd their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps,
and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between
their views on a soul’s inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs
220 pounds.

target within 40 feet takes 5d10 good damage and must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save.

Solid Blow (divine, evocation, force) When a monadic deva hits a target for the second
time during its turn with its mace, it deals an additional 2d12 force damage as its
weapon shimmers with ripples of power.
PLANETAR (JUSTICE ANGEL)
The beings of righteous fury known as planetars are known to be the least patient
of angels. They exist to destroy evil that cannot be redeemed, and they often
leave prolonged dialogue to other angels. Of course, no planetar ignores the
importance of diplomacy, but they know that others among the angelic
hosts are better suited to that task, while they focus on the larger picture.
In angelic armies, planetars serve as commanders or generals. They
stand at least 9 feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.

SOLAR (ARCHANGEL)
Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just
below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right
hand of a deity or champion a cause that beneﬁts an
entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but
not all—they can adopt more unusual forms as needed.
A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500
pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to
ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.
Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them
are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit

Animate Dream
An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and
dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams.
In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers
ﬂee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a
supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek
similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together,
they merge into a horriﬁc form as an animate dream.
Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most
take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned
them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly
encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes
that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these
forms, animate dreams ﬁnd their way out of the Dreamlands and into the
waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a
relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.
An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and
fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the
minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link
to that individual’s dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all
manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the
victim ﬁnds it more and more difﬁcult to remain awake. In the end,
the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot
return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form
of fear and are its preferred sustenance.
An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular
nightmares, but these lesser fears aren’t as satisfying, often driving the
animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an
animate dream won’t starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent
and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often
encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue
more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also
tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown
metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a speciﬁc
nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean
waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have
similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.

Ankou
Ankous are shadowy killers who serve powerful fey creatures, or even the Eldest—
the demigods of the First World. Amid the courts of the Eldest or of powerful fey
rulers, these sinister assassins lurk overhead as they await the call to action—implied
threats akin to deadly weapons hung as decor in a royal hall. Ankous never speak
aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic
whisper directly into a victim’s mind. While an ankou’s body is made of strange,
ﬂeshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razorsharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical
ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.
While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are
left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In
some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have
been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge
their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!

Shadow doubles have the same statistics as an ankou,
but they have the summoned trait, have 84 Hit Points,
can’t use Shadow Doubles or innate spells, and have
an attack bonus of +25 for their Strikes. A shadow
double that attempts a saving throw against
a light eﬀect can’t get a result better than
failure. Each double remains for 1 round,
until it’s reduced to 0 Hit Points, or until
it moves further than 120 feet from the
ankou, whichever comes ﬁrst. Each round thereafter, the ankou can spend a single
action that has the concentrate trait to extend the duration of surviving duplicates by
1 round, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. The ankou can see through the eyes of
all of the shadow doubles at once. A character who Seeks can identify an ankou as
real or a shadow double with a successful DC 39 Perception check.
Sneak Attack An ankou’s Strikes deal an additional 2d6 precision damage to
flat-footed creatures.
ANKOU GUILDS
The most dangerous ankous are
those who have rebelled against their

pursue common goals in the most

Aolaz
Aolazes are great beasts carved from stone and metal and magically imbued with
the essence of life. The exact means of their creation is a long-lost secret, and
they are so rare that scholars have little opportunity to study active specimens.
The best-known aolazes are museum pieces or battleﬁeld relics destroyed or
deactivated centuries ago, though fragmented records suggest that many more
were made and might remain, yet to be unearthed.
Most aolazes are built in the shape of great land-bound beasts, such as elephants,
rhinoceroses, or dinosaurs. Regardless of the speciﬁc creature an aolaz has been
constructed to resemble, it is not bound to walk the earth like its inspirations
are—it’s imbued with the magical ability to pursue across
water and even through the air. Few can escape an

wreaks is all too evident. Each creature in the area must attempt

as a source to power even greater

Archon
Tireless agents of Heaven, archons embody virtues and strive to guide mortals
while battling the evil forces of the ﬁendish realms. Heaven’s seven-tiered
mountain is generally known as a place of contemplation and philosophy,
as exempliﬁed by the ﬁfth level, Illumis. But the archon denizens of Heaven’s
threshold and the second level, Proelera, concern themselves with defense and
mustering armies for the endless battles against Hell and the Abyss. However,
whereas devils and demons take pleasure in harming the innocent, Heaven’s
wardens reserve their blades for only the truly wicked and irredeemable. Among
mortals, they prefer to guide and nurture a rule of law that looks out for the
weak and powerless, leading mortal agents to overcome mortal threats rather
than solving those threats themselves.
HOUND ARCHON
Among the rank-and-ﬁle soldiers of Heaven’s armies, few individuals are more
dependable and truer to the cause than the noble hound archons, embodiments
of the virtue of diligence. Unlike horned archons, who perform at a similar
level along Heaven’s grand hierarchy, hound archons do not scout ahead for
evil or perform reconnaissance missions in hostile territory. A hound archon’s
role is as a soldier in the heart of battle or, occasionally, as a sentinel tasked with
protecting a particular strategic location or holy site.

dimension door has enough distance, the archon appears the
same distance and direction from the creature as before either
creature used dimension door.

for their Strikes, but if the canid’s bite attack has the
Knockdown ability, then the hound archon’s bite
attack gains that ability while they are in that form.
Diligent Assault ʚʖ The hound archon carefully
makes one greatsword Strike and one jaws Strike
in any order. These attacks count toward the
hound archon’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
ARCHON EVOLUTIONS
When a spirit becomes an archon,
they usually start as a lantern archon,
the lowliest of archonkind. As they
perform noble deeds and bolster their
pureness of heart, an archon evolves
into greater forms, possibly skipping
stages or remaining in others for long
spans of time, depending on their
particular strengths and personality.

INSTRUMENTS OF WAR
A trumpet archon’s magical
instrument is no mere piece of
brass; each of these immaculately
crafted horns is said to be crafted
in Heaven’s blessed forges and
infused with the voices of a thousand
angels. Only archons can truly
play such trumpets—mortals lack
the power necessary to create
trumpet archons’ iconic clarion
calls, but can still play them as
virtuoso instruments.
TRUMPET ARCHON
Trumpet archons are messengers, emissaries, and storytellers­—embodiments of
the virtue of kindness. They use stories and allegories to prevent bloodshed, and
among all archons they are the most likely to work together with angels, perhaps
leading to the similarities in their forms. When diplomacy is impossible, trumpet
archons rally the righteous to battle—one reassuring glance from a trumpet archon
is often all it takes to instill a shaken ally with resounding courage once again.

STAR ARCHON
Embodiments of the virtue of prudence, star

and in times of war as the tacticians, strategists, and
generals of archon armies. Star archons burn with the glory
and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are
as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and
unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather
than on battleﬁelds, star archons are ﬁerce opponents when motivated to enter

Prudent Asterism ʚʖ The star archon calculates a celestial
constellation and sends their starknife ﬂying along that
path from one foe to the next. It makes a starknife Strike
against a target within 60 feet. If the Strike hits, it can
make another Strike at a diﬀerent target within 60 feet of the ﬁrst target, and so on,
until it misses with a Strike or runs out of targets it hasn’t attacked within range of
the most recent target. The star archon can attack a given target only once per use
of this ability. These attacks don’t apply any range increment penalty, and the star
archon resolves all the attacks before increasing the multiple attack penalty.
BASTION ARCHON
The mightiest of archon-kind form in the heat of battle from incredibly
uncommon circumstances. When a gathering of lantern archons
converges into a gestalt in order to defend allies in a ﬁght that seems all
but lost, a fellow archon of signiﬁcant strength—such as a star archon—
can commit a brave act of self-sacriﬁce by dimensionally transposing
itself with the gestalt. If the circumstances are just right and luck is
with the archons, the result is not a glorious sacriﬁce, but instead the
earth-rocking emergence of a bastion archon. In this way, the lowliest of
archons—the lanterns—can, in an instant, become their kind’s greatest hope.

ARMORED ARCHONS
Always ready to defend others, most
archons are never encountered out of
their suits of armor. Even those who
eschew armor, such as the bastion
archon, tend to still appear as if they
are wearing heavy protection against
the scourge of battle.
Bastion archons are massive beings made of the very stone of Heaven’s Holy
Mountain, with their visages obscured by a blinding light surrounding the gestalt
that originally formed the bastion. Tireless in their embodiment of the virtue of
sacriﬁce, a bastion archon almost always protects the area where they manifested,
and even when they are destroyed they leave an indelible mark of righteousness
upon the surrounding region.

ASSASSIN WINE
The berries of an assassin vine are
something of an acquired taste to
most, but the process of aging the
berries into wine can remove the
unpleasant aftertaste—provided the
berries are harvested from a living
vine. After the vine’s death, toxins in
the plant quickly seep into its berries,
making them unsuitable for harvest,
and as a result, assassin vine wine is a
dangerous delicacy to prepare. Those
who master the art, though, ﬁnd that
the proceeds can more than cover
the cost of having to periodically hire
adventures to help curtail an unruly—
and—hungry vineyard.
Assassin Vine
The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than
consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey
and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the
carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying ﬂesh. Although an assassin
vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its
root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat
changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its
learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.
As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area
for as long as it has sufﬁcient prey. Though most often found along woodland
trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements,
poorly tended ﬁelds, and vineyards. While assassin vines can’t be trained in the
classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures
like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians
for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to
make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while
simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines’ victims are removed to
keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy
approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.
Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller
vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10
feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches
or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear
small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump,
blood‑red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant
iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.

ATHACH TREASURE
Athachs are infamously greedy, but
the distrustful creatures have a unique
way of hiding gems and shiny metal.
When an athach ﬁnds items such
as coins and jewelry, they crush the
valuable metal into a lumpy ball about
the size of an apple and then swallow
it. When not tormenting humans, the
athach regurgitates these lumps and
plays with them. Any of these lumps
found lying about an athach’s lair are
likely coated in the giant’s toxic drool.
Athach
The towering and brutish giants known as athaches are reviled for both their
monstrosity and their cruelty. Beyond an athach’s ﬁlthy habits, this giant is made
stranger by the gangly third arm that protrudes from their torso and ends in a
twitching, long-ﬁngered claw. Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach’s
upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that
is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach’s fangs.
Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and
they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does
not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of
settled territories until they ﬁnd a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to
target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair
in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch
their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and
torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes
on a ﬁnal rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature
they can ﬁnd. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape,
forcing these terriﬁed victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading
word of the athach’s fearsomeness.

Is the attic whispering?
Are we safe below?
Do you think he’s listening?

Do you hear him weeping?
Is he really there?
Can you say “I’m speaking?”
Are you saying naught?
Is it you who’s weeping?
Is it you he’s caught?
Attic Whisperer
Beware the haunting sobs of the attic whisperer, for they carry the pained wrath of
an abandoned child who perished due to the neglect or absence of their caretakers.
Animated by loneliness, the embittered spirit binds itself to the material world in
a body made of bits and oddments of a lost childhood—wooden blocks, scraps of
blankets, ratty dolls, buttons, carved trinkets, and glass marbles. To give themselves
the semblance of a head, they top their patchwork bodies with a small animal’s skull.
Attic whisperers most frequently lurk in old inﬁrmaries, orphanages, and other
such institutions where children were forgotten, and they lay dormant for decades
in hopes that they might one day ﬁnd a playmate to ease their eternal loneliness.
When they sense the living, attic whisperers attempt to lure them into their clutches
by calling out to them using the voice of a small child. Though attic whisperers
intend only to play with those they encounter, they drain the breath and voice from
living creatures as their dark impulses take over.

GOLDEN GUARDIAN
While wholly carnivorous,
aurumvoraxes are known for gnawing
on metals (particularly gold and
copper), though whether they do this
to sharpen their teeth or because of
some nutritional need is unknown.
Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for
thousands of feet dug into the rock,
often following veins of ores and
winding deep into the earth. Mining
dwarves love the creatures’ fondness
for eating rust monsters. Those who
keep aurumvoraxes for protection call
them golden guardians.
Aurumvorax
Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight
legs, using their terriﬁc strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone.
A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for
its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very
strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery
or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the
shiny black of seasoned iron.
Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving
out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are
irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear
aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold
pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births,
and their mothers are ﬁercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous
proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts
of rage.

the target is wearing armor with Hardness 10 or lower, the
armor becomes broken. If this Strike

BRALANI CONTESTS
Bralanis enjoy inventing games and
contests and adding new twists to
popular sports rather than following
familiar rules. Speed often features
somewhere in bralani games, whether
it be physical speed or quickness of

to seek the input of young children,

from a child’s creativity rather than
allowing themselves to settle into
comfortable and repetitive patterns.

BRALANI (WIND AZATA)
Bralanis embody the freedom of fair competition, embracing opportunities to
test their skills against worthy foes and bring mortals together with the thrill of
good‑natured sports and contests. Their interest in constructive conﬂict also extends
to higher stakes, such as diplomatic negotiations. In these cases, bralanis ensure
that neither side’s desires are crushed by the other’s and work as mediators when
needed. They believe in friendly contests to diffuse tension. When discussions are
going well, bralanis step back, allowing the participants to shape their own futures.
They delight in sailing through violent storms as wind, basking in the raw energy.

PRIMORDIAL VERANALLIA
In the deepest reaches of Elysium,
the eldest of veranallias roam. These
beings concern themselves with
transformations that take place over
the course of millennia, as well as
changes in the climates of entire
worlds. Primordial veranallias have
an array of unique powers that
can aﬀect the area for many miles
around them, from turning deserts
into glass to triggering earthquakes.
VERANALLIA (REBIRTH AZATA)
Veranallias represent the freedom of life to grow, change, and adapt. They rarely
interact directly with non-azatas, as most other beings ﬁnd their nature hard to
comprehend, but those who secure their aid ﬁnd them powerful allies. The lower
half of a veranallia’s body is made of vegetation that constantly repeats a dizzying
cycle of sprouting, blooming, thriving, and wilting. The upper half of their body
appears as that of a humanoid of any gender—it is rare for a veranallia to remain
consistent in their gender for more than a few seasons at a time.
Veranallias transform the landscape in their wake, bringing creation and
destruction alike. The world around them overﬂows with an abundance of
vegetation, with plenty of food for nearby animals, and when they bring destruction,
they do so without cruelty, as it is sometimes necessary to make room for new life.
They trigger forest ﬁres in woodlands before dry brush piles up to dangerous levels,
and bring bitter winters to areas plagued with parasites that thrive in hot weather.

TRAINED DIGGERS
Kobolds and others who dwell in
underground warrens know the
value of having a few trained giant
badgers in their lair, since when
their digging habits are supervised
and directed, they can excavate new
tunnels and chambers with ease. Of
course, the fact that giant badgers
ﬁnd kobolds and others who dwell
in underground warrens delicious
means that relying on such trained
diggers can be a risky endeavor. A
giant badger trained for use as a
digger or a guardian tends to only
obey the commands of one master,
and even then they can be prone
to unpredictable outbursts for no
reason other than pique.
Badger
The burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. All badgers are naturally
ﬁerce and tenacious, and their squat stature belies their strength and speed.
BADGER
The typical badger has dark, brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
particularly on the head, giving it a striped mask of fur around its eyes. A

strive to give their lairs a gothic
beauty rather than allowing them to
get run down and ﬁlthy.
Baobhan Sith
Undeath is rare in the fey realm of the First World, for that plane’s infusion with the
raw power of life makes undead uncomfortable at best. Yet a few fey have adopted
the vile practices and habits of notorious undead while still being living themselves,
as seen in the blood-drinking habits of the murderous baobhan sith.
A baobhan sith avoids confrontations when outnumbered, and although
territorial, they won’t reveal their true nature to larger groups. They prefer to drink
blood from victims they ﬁnd attractive, and they avoid drinking blood from animals
and beasts entirely, as they consider such activities to be uncultured.

Basidirond
The basidirond, also called a mindfrond, is a fungal creature that crawls about on
woody tendrils. The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral‑rich
moisture—whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood—for sustenance. It uses
hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to
a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for
consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs
nearly 300 pounds when saturated.

DRACONIC HERITAGE
A dracolisk’s favored dwelling place
most closely resembles that of its
dragon parent: black dracolisks
prefer marshlands, blue dracolisks
favor deserts and warm hills, green
dracolisks temperate or warm forests,
red dracolisks warm mountains and
deep caverns, and white dracolisks
glaciers and frozen landscapes.
Basilisk, Dracolisk
Dracolisks are rare magical crossbreeds of chromatic dragons and basilisks. None
now know how they ﬁrst came to be, but they have proven viable and can breed
with one another as well as with basilisks. While a dracolisk appears much like
a young true dragon of its parent type, its eight legs are an immediate indication
that it is something more. Its coloration varies, depending on the nature of its
draconic ancestry, though it’s lighter on its underside and darker near its wing
tips. A typical dracolisk is 15 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.

VENGEFUL BEASTS
Polar bears have been known to take
special interest in those who have
vexed or wounded them, sometimes
following individual hunters back
to their villages and stalking them
exclusively for several days. This
could happen because the hunter
killed the bear’s mate or one of its
cubs, or took prey that the polar
bear had been stalking. Polar bears
engaged in such behavior have even
ignored easier prey to focus intently
on the chosen target.
Bear
Determined foragers and persistent predators, bears spend much of each year
either preparing for hibernation, recovering from hibernation, or taking care of
young following a successful opportunity to mate.
BLACK BEAR
Contrary to the name, black bears can be cinnamon or even blond in coloration,
depending on which hue is most beneﬁcial for surviving in their local environment.
Regardless of their coloration, they are opportunistic eaters who gain sustenance
from berries and nuts just as often as from ﬁsh and smaller mammals. They
steal food when they ﬁnd it, including from humanoid camps. Although they are
predators, black bears are more timid than other bears. Unless defending themselves
or their young, black bears often avoid conﬂict or ﬁght only until they can retreat.

ADAPTIVE HUNTERS
Though it doesn’t happen often due
to their ability to shift planes, some
bebiliths ﬁnd themselves trapped on
other planes either through magical
binding or subjugation to beings of
great power. While trapped away
from their favored prey, a bebilith’s
hungers can shift. In such cases, the
creature’s penetrating strikes can
adapt—a bebilith trapped in Elysium,
for example, might become a hunter
of azatas, and its Penetrating Strike
would count as cold iron and evil
instead so that it could target
traditional azata weaknesses.
Bebilith
While demons control much of the Abyss, even they are hunted in the wilder
regions of this horriﬁc plane. The most notorious of these predators—though not
the deadliest—is the bebilith. These ﬁends resemble elephant-sized spiders with
glowing eyes, barbed chitin, and a fanged maw dripping caustic ﬂuid.
Many demons and planar travelers have underestimated bebiliths’ devious
intellects, believing them to be little more than oversized vermin. Bebiliths take
advantage of this, ambushing foes with unexpected tactics. While they lash out
at any creatures they encounter, they take great pleasure in chewing on demonic
ﬂesh. Qlippoth are the only creatures bebiliths never consume.

HATRED OF DRAGONS
Some scholars have speculated
that behirs are somehow related to
blue dragons, citing their reptilian
features, lightning breath, and ability
to speak the Draconic language,
but such scholars would do well
to keep such opinions from behirs
they encounter in the ﬁeld. Nothing
infuriates a behir faster than likening
it to a dragon!
Behir
The behir is a massive, serpentine beast with never fewer than a dozen short
legs, each ending in three hooked talons. A behir can live to 80 years, but most
perish far younger to violence. Fully grown, a behir is 40 feet long and weighs
4,000 pounds.

deals 9d6 electricity damage in an 60‑foot line (DC 27 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t use
Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Claw Storm ̂ˬ The behir Strides up to its Speed, during which it can
walk on air as if it were solid ground, ascending or descending at
up to a 45-degree angle. It can make up to four claw
Strikes at any point during this movement,
each against a diﬀerent target
within reach, and it deals an
extra 1d6 electricity damage
with each Strike. These attacks
count toward the behir’s multiple
attack penalty, but the multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until
after the behir makes all of its attacks.
If the behir moves half its Speed or less
during a Claw Storm, that movement doesn’t
trigger reactions. The behir can’t use Claw
Storm if it has a creature wrapped in its coils.
At the end of Claw Storm, it drifts downward up
to 60 feet to the ground, landing softly and taking
no damage from the fall. If it descends further
than 60 feet, it takes damage normally
from the remaining fall.

SIGNAL LIGHTS
To communicate at a distance,
blindheims ﬂash their eye lights in
speciﬁc patterns. This is instinctual,
not truly a language, and blindheims
are incapable of inventing new
signals. Some underground explorers
use lanterns to ape these signals.
Two Quick Flashes: Danger!
Long Pulse: All is safe.
Two Long Pulses: Captured food.
Very Long Pulse: Come here.
Rapid Strobing: Let’s mate!
Intermittent Quick Flashes: Excited!
One Long Flash, then Darkness: Sad.
Blindheim
Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids
with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all
times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers
them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their
lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or
ﬁsh. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When
they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, ﬂashing their eyes to
facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using
their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures
they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and
using its light to chase ﬁsh to the surface, while another up above snatches them
up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.
Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to
underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of
fungus to eat, a few ﬁsh swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water
from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when
ﬁrst born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining,
and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.
It’s not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples ﬁnd the
creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars
use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims’ heads
and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They
sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack
darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for
some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known
to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the
ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care
of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.

BLINK DOG SAGES
In every blink dog pack, the wisest
and most intelligent member of
the pack is chosen by the alpha to
act as the pack’s sage. The sage is
charged with maintaining the longrunning oral histories and tales of
the pack, to bind all packs together
in one story that spans centuries.
The sage often has a closer bond to
the mysteries and hidden paths of
magic than the average blink dog, a
result of their advanced years. They
counsel the alpha on all matters
pertaining to the stars, omens,
tactics, and even diplomacy.
Blink Dog
At ﬁrst glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines
with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that
dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog’s inherent intelligence, but
also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the
sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most
humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the
hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures—particularly those that dwell
in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.
Unless acting in concert with speciﬁc allies who have proven that their goals
are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs
are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out.
But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and
lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for
extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between
the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink
to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that
might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream
of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog,
this constant state of ﬂux is as natural as breathing.
Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called
an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted
pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of
blink dog society. They are ﬁercely loyal, defending
the pack or creatures they befriend to the
death and maintaining oaths handed
down from litter to litter. Though
different packs hold different traditions
and oaths, their connection through
the tales and stories told among their
kind and the shared experience of the
movement of stars above weave all blink
dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through
their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for
celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars,
and read omens from unusual
stellar
conjunctions.
These
celestial signs are woven into
blink dogs’ lifeways; their names
contain a reference to the speciﬁc
constellation under which they were born, and a pack’s sage
watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is
old enough for their ﬁrst hunt.

BLODEUWEDDS AND NYMPHS
Nymphs often think of blodeuwedds
as uncouth or too wild, while the
reverse holds true for blodeuwedds,
who consider nymphs to be spoiled
and pampered “princesses” who
take the beautiful parts of the world
in which they dwell for granted. It
speaks volumes to blodeuwedds’
strength of personality that they
don’t let these bitter emotions
control them. Very few of their kind
drift into actual evil—yet likewise,
very few of them display the
kindness that nymphs do.
Blodeuwedd
The mysterious blodeuwedds dwell in those parts of the world where the
boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World have worn thin, or
around portals between the two planes. Their link with such regions of the natural
world is so strong that it rivals the bond shared between nymphs and places of
great natural beauty, yet none would look upon a blodeuwedd and mistake them
for something as elegant as a nymph.
Although blodeuwedds share certain traits with nymphs, their role as guardians
of the pathways between this world and the First World prevents them from
forming as powerful a magical bond with the natural world. Never truly a part
of either reality yet forced to keep watch over both, blodeuwedds tend to grow
cynical and sharp-tongued toward any who would seek travel from one realm to
the other, regardless of their actual goals.

Bodak
When a living, sentient humanoid is exposed to an extreme expression of
supernatural evil, the experience can irrevocably damn the victim, crushing their
mind and ripping out their soul in an appalling, unholy transformation that results
in a creature that’s anathema to life—the bodak.
The shreds of physicality that survive this absolute corruption serve only to
enhance the humanoid’s profoundly disturbing appearance. The bodak’s body
is horriﬁcally twisted, as though it’s locked in a convulsion of agony and terror.
Its desiccated and hairless ﬂesh bears an otherworldly, pearlescent sheen, strung
taut across a malformed skeleton that reduces its gait to a slow shamble. But
most disturbing of all are its eyes, set in a
drooping, melted visage with scant remains of
its former facial structure. These eyes, sunken
deep into their sockets, nevertheless glow with an
unholy light, stare with unremitting malevolence,
and constantly weep noxious vapor.
Fragmented memories of a prior existence ﬁltered
through a vengeful hatred of the living lead the bodak to
try to return to those places it once knew. If successful,
it assaults former friends, acquaintances, and loved
ones with its murderous gaze and an incomprehensible
torrent of gibberish laced with vile curses, accusations, and
threats—an assault that often leads to the victims rising as
newly formed bodaks themselves.

temporary Hit Points equal to 5 times the value of the drained condition the target

BODAK CREATION
The rarity of the events that create
bodaks ensure that most of these
abominations were humanoids slain
by another bodak’s gaze. Yet bodaks
can also be brought into being by
a rare version of the create undead
ritual. This horriﬁc ritual emulates an
encounter of absolute, supernatural
evil, and so the spell must begin
when the subject is alive and located
on one of the evil Outer Planes.

Bog Strider
The insectile bog striders call themselves seshes, but they take no offense at those
who use the more common vernacular to refer to them. They resemble upright
water striders with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. Bog striders
can move about on water like solid ground, chasing down prey or ﬂeeing from
predators across the water. They rarely leave the swampy rivers and lakes they
call home. Bog striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.
A bog strider’s diet consists almost entirely of meat, but they prefer to feed
only on animals, as they consider the consumption of the ﬂesh of any sapient
creature a taboo.
In sesh society, each individual is expected to serve equally in all efforts to
ensure the society’s survival against the more aggressive creatures often found
in or near their swampland homes. In addition, each member of the community
is expected to develop a skill that contributes to the community’s prosperity,
and by extension, the continued survival of the species. Traditionally, female
bog striders are builders and artisans while males are hunters and gatherers, but
often such roles aren’t limited to a single gender, as every member of a small
community pitches in to help as they can.

a hit, the target is ﬂat-footed and takes a
–10‑foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds.
On a critical hit, the creature is instead
restrained. The DC to Escape the net is 16. A
creature adjacent to the target can Interact
with the net to remove it from the target.
Water Sprint ̂ˬ The bog strider Strides
up to three times in a straight line across
smooth water. They can make a single
Strike against a creature at the end of
this movement.
Water Stride The bog strider can stand
and move on the surface of water
or other liquids without
falling through. The bog
strider can go underwater if
they wish, but they must
Swim to do so.
TREMOR TAPPING
Seshes can communicate with other
bog striders via wavesense by
tapping at a water surface they’re
standing upon. Other creatures with
wavesense can detect these tappings,
but understanding them is typically
beyond non-seshes. A GM might
allow a character who has wavesense,
can speak Aquan, and spends a
signiﬁcant amount of time living
among bog striders to understand
tremor tapping or to communicate via
this unusual method.

BROWNIE BARGAINS
As they are not a monolithic group
of fey and often have their own
proclivities, it’s sometimes hard to
predict what might attract a brownie
or ensure their aid. One of the more
commonly thought gifts is a saucer
of milk or cream, though brownies
seem to enjoy other edible treats.
Some farmers have reported success
in leaving shiny but inconsequential
knickknacks like buttons, polished
and painted stones, smoothed glass,
thimbles, or silver ﬂatware. The
whims of some brownies shift, so
someone who wants to retain the
services of a brownie should vary
the gifts they leave for these elusive
fey creatures.
Brownie
Brownies make their homes in the trunks of hollow trees, small earthy burrows,
and even under porches or within the crawl spaces of farmhouses. Often attired in
clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with
pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled
with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might
call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for
example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems
as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally—certainly they
do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There’s often no swifter way
to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2
feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.
When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to
confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape.
Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a paciﬁst
nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult.
Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a
hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their “ﬁnal trick,” reserving their use
for the direst of circumstances.
Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through
work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from
a farmer’s orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might
eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash
the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while
avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually ﬁnds
this a beneﬁcial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and
sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home
clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators.
Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one.
Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.

VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

Cold Healing Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold
damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the
cold eﬀect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments (Core Rulebook
518), calathgars gain fast healing 1.
Mold Mulch When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays
and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold
if it was killed by ﬁre damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute,
during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its
turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn
in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an
hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot
square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points,

CALIGNI SLAYER TRINKETS
Slayers obsess over magical trinkets,
coveting them above all else.
They often have a consumable or
permanent item of use in combat,
such as a scroll, wand, or talisman.
Unfortunately, their incessant
tinkering and ﬁddling often leaves
their treasures broken or depleted.
Caligni Slayer
Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other
calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken
merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger.
Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with
their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied
the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience.
Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer’s hunger appears at the moment of
their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless
implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis’ deaths, consuming
the body itself in a ﬁnal attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe
with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 51), ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own.
For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the
talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too
ambitious can become a brave sacriﬁce in battle, for the good of the enclave.
In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers
and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet
another source of slayers’ envy and resentment.

CARBUNCLE CHATTER
“A lizard with an apple-sized
gem sticking out of its forehead?
Wishful thinking!”
“Carbuncles are real! I almost
caught one, but even though it
could barely walk, its magic allowed
it to escape my clutches.”
“Their mind control powers could
make them useful familiars, but if
you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
“My advice is to stay away from
these pests. They drink your hopes
and aspirations through their horns,
leaving you empty except for bad
luck and bellyaches.”

You’d better leave your self-respect

Carbuncle
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than
that of the lowly carbuncle. At ﬁrst glance, carbuncles appear to be little more
than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and
the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although
rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure‑alls to
potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle’s horn
is merely a highly reﬂective growth, not unlike a ﬁngernail.

FISHER FILAMENTS
A cave ﬁsher can rapidly produce
a cord from a gland at the back of
its throat. This ﬁlament resembles
a semi-transparent silk rope and is
coated with an adhesive that traps
prey that comes in contact with it.
When reeling in its prey, the cave
ﬁsher consumes the ﬁlament as well,
slurping it up like a noodle.
A severed ﬁlament can be
harvested for use as rope. The
adhesive dries after about 10
minutes. A harvested ﬁlament gland
can’t produce new ﬁlaments, but
it can be used as 25 gp worth of
raw materials for creating potent
adhesives, such as sovereign glue.
Cave Fisher
Cave ﬁshers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground
structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave ﬁsher
excretes thin, tough, and very sticky ﬁlaments at its prey with lightning speed
to capture it.
A cave ﬁsher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything
smaller than a rat isn’t much of a meal for it. When a cave ﬁsher captures such
a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract
larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its ﬁlament doesn’t last long, the ﬁsher
frequently needs to eat one ﬁlament and excrete a new one. The ﬁlaments are
translucent and can be hard to see when they’re still and in darkness.
Cave ﬁshers hatch with the ability to excrete ﬁlaments, but they molt many
times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They
often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.

even suspending the target vertically if necessary. The cave ﬁsher attempts an
Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the cave ﬁsher
pulls the creature 15 feet closer to it (30 feet closer on a critical success).
Sticky Filament Any creature hit by the cave ﬁsher’s sticky ﬁlament is grabbed.
The cave ﬁsher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its ﬁlament, but it
automatically releases the creature if the cave ﬁsher moves beyond the ﬁlament’s
60-foot length. The cave ﬁsher can use only one ﬁlament at a time, and it can
sever the ﬁlament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The
ﬁlament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it.
This doesn’t deal any damage to the cave ﬁsher itself. The ﬁlament has AC 17, and
its Escape DC is 19.

CHOKER TRINKETS
A choker’s nest is small and conﬁned,
as the choker prefers. It doesn’t tidy
its nest, so everything from animal
bones to valuable treasures might
be within, compacted into one mass.
A choker in the wilderness might
have a few remnants of society taken
from victims who wandered through.
These remnants can include candles,
maps, or animal traps. Chokers in
cities have stolen goods appropriate
to their location: books and scrolls if
a library or wizard’s college is nearby,
steins and pillows near a tavern, or
ﬁshhooks and shipping manifests near
a dock, for example. Chokers almost
never have edible or drinkable items,
as they prefer to consume these
“delicacies” themselves—even magical
potions and alchemical items.
Choker
With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves,
rocky ﬁssures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little
aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that
wander off from their packs or communities. A choker’s long, spongy arms are
ﬂexible but deceptively strong. The ﬁngers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with
spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically
strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude
tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker
tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that
encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the
products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it just results in chokers
that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated,
such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.
Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned
structures. These chokers stalk at night, ﬂopping across rooftops, tapping at
windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An
urban choker that ﬁnds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who
is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the
products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items,
from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one
item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to ﬁnd a larger nest to
accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.

against the grabbed or restrained creature’s Fortitude DC, the choker redirects the
attack to that creature, and the attacker compares its attack roll result against
the new target’s AC.
The choker must move the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The
creature must also be moved within the attacker’s reach against a
melee attack or into a space between itself and the attacker
against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability
to make the attacker target itself, even if it’s grabbing or

WINGED CHUPACABRAS
Some chupacabras are mutants
with large reptilian wings and have
been known to carry oﬀ goats or
even children. A winged chupacabra
has a ﬂy Speed of 50 feet. Other
chupacabras grow much larger, up to
Medium sized, and can stand eye to
eye with a full-grown human. These
chupacabras have elite adjustments
to their statistics and deal 2d6+5
damage with their jaws Strikes.
Chupacabra
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras
prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching
potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most
often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly
reﬂective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.
Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats),
and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood‑drained
husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their
naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the
worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.
A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip
of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and
lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only
during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that
hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless
prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.
Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known
to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well
together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and
otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers
or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of
such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common
often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra
capabilities or motive—and a few of the claims, such as that some
chupacabras can ﬂy, are all too true.

COCKROACH SPECIES
Beyond the common giant cockroach,
other ﬂesh-eating cockroaches
exist throughout the world. These
variations include the giant hissing
cockroach, the noxious venomroach,
the huge spitting cockroach (which
can incapacitate enemies from a
distance), the aggressive sawback
cockroach, and the mysterious and
rare dragonroach.
Cockroach
Generally seen more as a nuisance than a personal danger, cockroaches inhabit
most reaches of the world. They are scavengers who live off the detritus of
the natural world and from those that inhabit it. These maligned insects can
survive weeks without eating, and most of their meals consist of organic
waste that would otherwise overwhelm an ecosystem, particularly in their
preferred urban environments. Though a typical cockroach presents virtually
no threat, they can become dangerous in large groups, and some species grow
particularly large.
GIANT COCKROACH
Cockroaches are communal creatures, rarely setting out on their own unless
they are searching for food. If an adventurer encounters a single giant cockroach
while exploring, they had best take precautions against others, as there is likely
an entire colony nearby.

COCKROACH SWARM
While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a
disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming,
where hundreds or even thousands of the
insects scurry out of their hiding places in
a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces
on thousands of skittering legs. Given how
disgusting many ﬁnd cockroaches to be,
encountering such a swarm can be alarming
to even the most seasoned adventurers. The
creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast
to the insects’ normally skittish and harmless nature,
as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures
that provoked them and harry them with
thousands of stinging bites.

OTHER COUATLS
The quetz couatl presented here is
the most common of its kind, and
while most adventurers and scholars
refer to them simply as “couatls,”
other kinds exist as well, such as
the ﬁerce xiuh couatl, the nomadic
auwaz couatl, the wise mix couatl,
the nurturing chicome couatl, and
the furious tletli couatl.
Couatl, Quetz
These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and good. Some
operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while others
operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they watch
over mortals and try to inﬂuence and aid them from the shadows, shifting from
plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz
couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while they
do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster peace
and cooperation with others.
Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green
scales. Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh
nearly a ton. They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the
occasional evil humanoid.

CRAB SPECIES
Crabs can be found along all of the
world’s coastlines, from relatively
small creatures like the king crab or
the coconut crab, to truly oversized
monsters like the great reef crab,
shark-eating crab, or the lumbering
shipwrecker crab.
Crab
Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways
gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and ﬁght other crabs for
territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs
prefer to ﬂee, but when retreat isn’t possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly
as they can.
The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water’s
surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations
to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain
darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of
the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.
These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size
makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.

CRAWLING HAND ORIGINS
A popular tale among necromancers
tells of an ancient wizard who
traﬃcked in evil magic. During a
summoning ritual gone wrong, the
wizard’s hand became possessed
and later strangled them while they
slept. The hand dragged the corpse
across the wizard’s rooms to their
workbench, propped up a knife in a
vise, and severed itself from the rest
of the body. According to the story,
the hand went on to commit several
more murders and disappeared into
the sewers of a major metropolis,
never to be seen again. Some
necromancers believe that this
original crawling hand still creeps
through the shadows of that city,
killing as it pleases.
Crawling Hand
Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with
a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers.
Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an
appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the
Negative Energy Plane.

A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and

THE CURSE OF CRAWLEY JACK
The damnable curse of the culdewen
traces back to the First World, when
a bitter old culdewen named Crawley
Jack poached a ﬁsh from the pool
of a powerful fey noble. Short of
temper and feeling vindictive, the
noble doomed Crawley Jack’s people
to never consume another ﬁsh again.
Yet their desire to eat ﬁsh never
diminished. The curse’s punishment
is exacted in endless creative ways.
A culdewen’s catch might be rescued
by merfolk, stolen by skum, eaten
by nipping sharks, or carried away
on a piece of driftwood when the
culdewen’s boat is destroyed in a
storm or shipwreck.
Culdewen
Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of
appealing ﬁsh to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated
fey calls every living creature a “ﬁsh.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend
to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never ﬁnd satisfaction. Each
time they catch a ﬁsh, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot
to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace.
By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.
A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack
things with their oar, and shake their tiny ﬁsts at the sky. Conversation with a
culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of ﬁshing and the weather.
Capturing a “ﬁsh” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen
capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.

to vanish on the journey—typically being lost in the water or consumed by aquatic

act, the culdewen must attempt an Athletics check against the
creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.
While hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their
Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen’s curse above).
Reel In Ȱɵ (manipulate) The culdewen pulls the rope attached to their hook. If they
have no creature hooked, the ﬁsh hook returns to the culdewen’s hand. If a creature
is hooked, the culdewen attempts an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude
DC, pulling it up to 30 feet closer on a success (60 feet on a critical success).
Swear Ȱɵ (auditory, curse, enchantment, primal) The culdewen
unleashes a string of invectives. Each creature that hears them
must attempt a DC 25 Will save, with the eﬀects of mariner’s
curse and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Even on
a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day.

ABADDON
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane
of pure evil for only the most corrupt
souls. If Hell is a realm of torture
and systematic depravity, Abaddon
is its twisted cousin—a place where
one can ﬁnd only misery and
despair in ample quantities, with
neither the strictures of Hell nor
the chaotic freedom of the Abyss.
For evildoers who seek simply to
inﬂict their wickedness on others,
Abaddon is a rich hunting ground
where one can revel in turpitude,
though visitors be forewarned: the
competition is ﬁerce.
Daemon
Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.
PISCODAEMON (VENOM DAEMON)
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards,
delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on
a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and
even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons’ preferred
tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River
Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They
are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by
drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget
their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.

MELADAEMON (FAMINE DAEMON)
Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst,
and revel in spreading the same despair that brought
about their mortal demise. When they aren’t blighting
ﬁelds, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies,
they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures
can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that
result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian,
Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other
daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.

FORMED IN HIS IMAGE
Meladaemons have always been
gaunt and bestial, but they didn’t
always resemble jackals. When
Trelmarixian overthrew the previous
Horseman of Famine, one of his
ﬁrst acts as a ruler of Abaddon was
to forcibly twist the appearance of
his deacon caste to resemble his
own wicked form. He went on to
imbue meladaemons with other
jackal-like aspects as it suited him,
further warping them and cementing
their fealty.

DERGHODAEMON (RAVAGER DAEMON)
Derghodaemons
represent
death
through
unfathomable violence and being eaten alive.
Whether in life a ravenous murderer hacked them to
bits for stew, a werewolf tore them limb from limb, or they simply succumbed to the
elements and became worm meat, derghodaemons seek to inﬂict the same twisted
and bloody ends upon any they come across. Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons
derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths—to these ﬁends, the quicker they can
enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim
and repeat the violent cycle.
Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected
to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long—
the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience
severe visual warping. The derghodaemon’s appearance becomes more and more
twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous
urges to inﬂict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horriﬁc attack
derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming
infestation—the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of
ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death,
provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp
of the insects’ bodies don’t drive them to violent fury ﬁrst!

DAEMON HARBINGERS
The four Horsemen are the most
powerful of the daemonic demigods,
but they are only four of many. Far
more daemonic harbingers dwell on
Abaddon, each a unique and powerful
demigod in their own right that
enjoys sweeping inﬂuence among
daemonkind. Jacarkas the Collector

Consumption), Vorasha the Ophidian

Savage Assault ʚʖ The derghodaemon makes up to ﬁve claw
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count

penalty doesn’t increase until after all the attacks.
Swarming Infestation ʚʖ The derghodaemon spews a
large swarm, making a swarm spit Strike against up to
two adjacent targets within range. Whether or not the
targets are hit, each must attempt a DC 31 Reﬂex
save (at a –2 circumstance penalty if it was actually
hit by the swarm spit). Persistent damage caused

THANADAEMON (DEATH DAEMON)
Also known as the deacons of death, thanadaemons
represent death via old age. They are among the
most patient daemons, and prefer to bide
their time to enact far-reaching, decadeslong plans rather than ﬁght (though they
are still deadly foes). Like the Horseman
of Death, they ply the waters of the River
Styx in search of wayward souls. Rarely are
thanadaemons seen without a trademark oar
(which they wield as a bo staff), a tool they use to navigate the
river’s muck-ridden channels and turbulent rapids.

STYX PASSAGE FEES
Gliding with eerie ease along the
murky River Styx, thanadaemons
are only too happy to oﬀer mortals
passage aboard their dilapidated
skiﬀs—for a price. Gold is typically
an acceptable payment for a
thanadaemon’s services, though these
ﬁends are well-known for altering the
details of arrangements after the fact,
and may just as likely demand a favor
or some esoteric good, such as a soul
gem, instead of coin.

PURRODAEMON (WAR DAEMON)
Few creatures embody war’s sheer amount of bloodshed
and loss of life as deeply as the purrodaemons, deacons
of war. These giant humanoid daemons are bedecked
in black, unholy armor, with weapons piercing their
ﬂesh at every opening. Far from wounds, however,
these weapons are the purrodaemon’s arsenal. A
purrodaemon can, with frightening swiftness
and nauseating ease, extract a weapon from its
own ﬂesh as though drawing a sword from a
sheath, and their blood is so tainted with evil
that weapons steeped in it become
powerful tools of war.

weapon that’s no longer sheathed in the

daemon; Eﬀect The steeped weapon swiftly
ﬂies through the air to resheath itself in the

to the purrodaemon, which can have up to 10

is sheathed in the purrodaemon’s body as though the daemon had used Steep Weapon.

SOUL GEMS AS GEAR
Daemons often carry soul gems
either as trophies or for powering
an ability. Cacodaemons (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 70) are the most common
source for soul gems, but they can
also be created by spells like bind
soul. If a daemon crushes a soul gem
to power an ability, the trapped soul
is released into the afterlife and can
be resurrected normally.
OLETHRODAEMON (APOCALYPSE DAEMON)
Even daemons fear the most massive and terrifying of their kind, olethrodaemons.
No single entity could embody the level of evil necessary to manifest one; instead,
these living war machines are made from the souls of many—or so the story goes.
Other theories suggest that the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are responsible for
creating the olethrodaemons, or that olethrodaemons are merely the seeping run-off
of an even greater being: a mysterious ﬁfth Horseman.
Whatever the truth, olethrodaemons are real, and their existence is terrifying
enough to instill paralyzing existential dread. With dozens of unblinking glowing
eyes above a drooling maw, two sets of four muscled limbs, and countless horns,
olethrodaemons resemble no other creature known to mortalkind.

Babaus revel in their art and often

NABASU (GLUTTONY DEMON)
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material

releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life.
Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage
to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more
powerful. Once they have sufﬁciently feasted, the demons become
worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo
a vile transformation, ﬁnally digesting their accumulated meals
and deforming further into powerful vrolikais (page 69).
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those
who prefer the tang of undead ﬂesh.

HALF-DEMONS
The Abyss can corrupt living
creatures through direct congress
or supernatural infusion of Abyssal
energies, resulting in monstrous
hybrids. A half-demon should be a
custom creature, but you can quickly
generate one by giving an existing
creature a few of a demon’s abilities
along with the demon’s sin-related
vulnerability. For example, a halfhezrou hill giant would gain purity
vulnerability, but perhaps also a bite,

a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often
waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber,
squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to
fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own.
Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or
neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious
spread of drugs and poisons through a society.

NALFESHNEE (BOAR DEMON)
Nalfeshnees are huge, corpulent, boar-headed
demons that hoard treasures and knowledge alike
and form from the souls of avaricious mortals.
Few demons understand the inner workings
of the Abyss itself like nalfeshnees, and it’s not
unusual for a nalfeshnee to see itself as a servitor
of the Abyss itself ﬁrst rather than bow before
a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the
ﬂeshy realms that birth new demons, while others
guard sites of particular signiﬁcance deep in the
plane’s secret reaches. A nalfeshnee’s realm in the
Abyss can easily surpass the strength and size of the
largest mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a
singular gift for managing and manipulating the chaos
of the Abyss.

Claim Wealth Ȱɵ (conjuration, divine, extradimensional) The
nalfeshnee steals all unattended items glowing with its Light
of Avarice into an extradimensional space. The demon can
Interact to regurgitate any number of these items into their
hand or onto the ground. If the demon dies, is aﬀected by a
teleportation eﬀect, or consumes an extradimensional space
(such as a bag of holding), they vomit up all the items.
Light of Avarice ʚʖ (divine, enchantment, light, mental);
Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect Beams of unholy light
shoot from the nalfeshnee toward four items within 60
feet. If someone is holding or wearing a targeted item,
they can keep it from being aﬀected with a successful
DC 34 Reﬂex save. For 1 minute, the aﬀected items glow
in nauseating colors. Any non-demon is sickened 2
and slowed 1 as long as it holds, wears, or touches a
glowing item. Recovering from the sickness requires
a successful DC 29 Will save instead of a Fortitude
save. Ending the sickness this way ends the slowed
condition and makes the creature temporarily
immune to Light of Avarice for 24 hours. If the
creature removes or drops the item, both conditions
end immediately but the creature doesn’t become
immune to Light of Avarice.
VROLIKAI (DEATH DEMON)
Unlike other demons, the dread vrolikai doesn’t
form from a sinful soul—they instead manifest from
a nabasu once the nabasu ﬁnally satisﬁes their hunger
and returns to the Abyss, and as such vrolikais
suffer from no vulnerability associated with
a speciﬁc sin. A vrolikai who survives this
process and the period of vulnerability
that follows gains great power and in time can
claim large regions of the Abyss as their own domain.
Also known as death demons, these murderous monsters
often serve demon lords as executioners or assassins.

VROLIKAI NEWCOMERS
When vrolikais ﬁrst manifest on the
Abyss, they have no base of power and
are, despite their abilities, relatively
defenseless from denizens even more
powerful than themselves. As a result,
most rely upon stealth and patience
for their ﬁrst few centuries while
they build up a network of minions
and establish their own Abyssal
fortiﬁcations before they turn their
attentions back to the Material Plane.

Focused Flames ʚʖ The vrolikai attacks a single target with
all of its black ﬂame knives. The demon makes a black
ﬂame knife Strike. On a successful attack, the
vrolikai deals the damage from a black ﬂame
knife Strike to the target, plus an additional
2d6 negative damage for every black ﬂame
knife they wield beyond the ﬁrst (typically
6d6 extra damage). Even on a failed attack,
the vrolikai deals the damage from one black
ﬂame knife to the target, though they still
miss completely on a critical failure. On a
critical hit, the victim becomes drained 2 as
the focused attack drains pure life essence
as well as damage. This counts toward the
vrolikai’s multiple attack penalty as a number
of attacks equal to the number of black ﬂame
knives the demon wields.

LENG
Known variously as the Nightmare
Realm or the Terror Beyond Dreams,
the frozen Plateau of Leng looms
physically and spiritually above the
Dreamlands. Both a part of that
dimension and a corruption of it, Leng
is a realm inhabited by eldritch horrors
and ruled by the horrors’ ancient gods.
Denizen of Leng
Slavers and raiders from the cold, windswept dimension of Leng, these malevolent
humanoids range across reality in ominous black ships capable of sailing beyond
the borders of dimensions and planes. Although most denizens of Leng seek
slaves and plunder like any pirate, others operate as self-styled ambassadors and
merchants, sowing discord with far-ranging plots. While the inscrutable denizens
dress themselves in ﬂowing robes, veils, and broad turbans to appear human, their
aberrant physiology, when glimpsed, is evident from their crown of stubby horns
and tentacled jaws to their furry, goat-like legs.
Above the ﬁerce captains who command the infamous black ships are an even
higher caste of denizens of Leng. These cultists and musicians serve as high priests,
laboring to appease the frightening gods who look down upon the Nightmare
Realm with cold malice.

They lose this ability on Leng or in areas where planar connections

or become clumsy 1. Each time a target fails an additional
save against this ability, the condition value increases by 1
(to a maximum of clumsy 4). This condition value decreases
by 1 every 24 hours.
Leng Ruby (enchantment, occult) Many denizens of Leng carry
strange rubies mined from quarries in Leng. As long as a creature
holds a Leng ruby that it willingly accepted as a gift or payment
from a denizen of Leng, any denizen of Leng can target that
creature with outcast’s curse, phantom pain, or mind reading at
a range of 1 mile, and the bearer uses an outcome one

DESTRACHAN LANGUAGE
The Destrachan language can be
learned by other creatures, but
without a destrachan’s unique vocal
organs, non-destrachans can convey
only basic notions and concepts with
it. In most cases, it’s better to speak
Undercommon to a destrachan than
attempt to use its own language.
Destrachan
This underground reptilian horror walks on two powerful hind legs. Its
forelimbs are armed with sharp curving claws, and its toothy, eyeless, tubular
head has three hypersensitive frilled ears that turn toward any sound made in
its vicinity. This cruel monster’s true weapon, however, is an ampliﬁed version of
the sonic cry that it uses to navigate, communicate, and hunt. It communicates
with others of its kind through a complex series of clicks, shrieks, and whistles,
but it is intelligent enough to understand other languages. Most destrachans
understand at least one other language—usually Undercommon—and can often
be reasoned with.
An obligate carnivore, the destrachan relishes fresh meat but won’t hesitate to
make a meal of carrion it ﬁnds in its path. When traveling in packs, the creatures
take great delight in stalking travelers through miles of tunnels before attacking
and subduing them, then devouring them alive.

THE HIERARCHY OF HELL
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little
use for compassion or empathy. As
such, it exists entirely within a strict
hierarchy, and this order extends to
its denizens. While diﬀerent types of
demons correspond to various sins
and daemons are associated with
modes of mortal death, the diﬀerent
types of devils exist solely to fulﬁll
particular roles in the infernal
machine. On occasion, a particular
devil can transcend the role for
which they were literally shaped,
but this often transforms the devil
physically into the type suitable for
their new role.
Devil
Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell’s bureaucracies and hierarchies,
though some have far more specialized functions than others.
ZEBUB (ACCUSER DEVIL)
Zebubs serve as Hell’s messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they’ve seen
with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also
to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms
upon unsuspecting lands to debase ﬂesh and land alike while collecting secrets the
infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate
weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs’ whims. While
arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and conﬁdence of most devils, and
thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions.
Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil
Baalzebul in the frozen, ﬁlthy wastes of Hell’s seventh layer, Cocytus.

to another creature. The zebub replays 10 minutes of witnessed
events to a touched willing creature, which receives the memories
in a ﬂash of information. By remaining in contact, the zebub can
spend additional 3-action activities to replay more information. After relaying
their visions to another, the zebub can’t ever recall those events again.
Sneak Attack The zebub’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
SARGLAGON (DROWNING DEVIL)
Sarglagons dwell in Hell’s myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve
as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the
ﬁfth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and
can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness.
Few ﬁends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river
crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their
infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the
ﬁends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway’s memory-sapping
qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious
secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons
sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what
they did to earn their unwanted protectors’ attention. The constant uninvited
vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stiﬂing to their wards.

commandment they uphold with unwavering
fervor. They spawn within the Styx-fed swamps
of Hell’s ﬁfth layer, Stygia; where heresies and
the souls of heretics stagnate, osyluths eventually
rise. In the remote corners of that same layer of Hell,
they build massive, calciﬁed hives where they perform their vile
interrogations and perfect their torturous arts upon lesser devils
and petitioners alike.

HAMATULA TREASURES
Perhaps because hamatulas exist to
guard the riches of archdevils, infernal
dukes, and queens of the night, they
ﬁnd themselves drawn to wealth.
Though they despise summoners who
pull them away from their assigned
duties, hamatulas use their servitude
as an opportunity to collect treasures
and wealth that they can oﬀer to their
lords upon their return. Treasures that
are painful or dangerous to handle are
among their favorite prizes.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Barb only. A hamatula gains an extra reaction at the start of
each of its turns that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity. It can’t use
more than one Attack of Opportunity triggered by the same action. In addition to the
normal trigger, a hamatula can make an Attack of Opportunity against a creature that
touches it or an adjacent creature that attempts a melee Strike against it.

Bloodletting On a critical hit, the hamatula’s barbs deal 3d6 persistent bleed damage.
Frightful Strike Ȳ˓ (divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental) Trigger The hamatula
hits a creature with a barb Strike; Eﬀect The creature struck must succeed at
a DC 27 Will save or become frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical
failure). Regardless of the result of its saving throw, the creature
is then temporarily immune to Frightful Strike for 24 hours.
Impaling Barb ʚʖ The hamatula makes a barb Strike, then
Strides up to half its Speed without triggering reactions. If
the Strike hits, the hamatula impales the target with one of
its barbs and snaps the barb free as it moves away from
the target. This deals an additional 2d8 piercing damage
to the target and pins it to an adjacent surface, rendering
it immobilized (Escape DC 29).
Warden of Erebus A hamatula’s glyph of warding innate
spell can contain any common spell from the Core
Rulebook that meets the criteria in glyph of warding;
the hamatula doesn’t need to provide the spell.
GYLOU (HANDMAIDEN DEVIL)
Though gylous are deeply entrenched in the expansive
and complex machinations of Hell, they are highly
skilled agents capable of nuanced diplomacy, masterful
deception, physical ﬁnesse, and nearly any other
tasks they set their minds to. This versatility has
led to gylous becoming widespread throughout
all layers of Hell, enabling them to ﬁlter key
information to their masters regarding other
devils’ plots and schemes. Their allegiance
is no secret, but their skills are so great
that powerful devils employ one or more
gylous regardless. While most gylous have
a feminine form (combined with their role,
this is the source of their common moniker
of “handmaiden”), some have other gender
presentations, and nearly all gylous take on
carefully cultivated illusions to best suit the roles
they ﬁll. More often than not, gylous arise when
lesser devils who have demonstrated exceptional utility
and invaluable skills are uplifted into a new form, though
on rare occasions they are shaped from the souls of evil mortals
who showed unparalleled savvy within bureaucratic enterprises.

encaged at a time.
CORNUGON (HORNED DEVIL)
Hell’s armies contain legions upon legions of
different devils all suited precisely to their roles.
But such an army needs able commanders,
and it is this role that cornugons ﬁll. Their
mere presence inspires those under their
command to improved performance—
often through fear of the horrible
torments that a cornugon can unleash as
punishment for failure. Forged in the ﬁres
of Malebolge from the most renowned
warriors among lesser devilkind, even
the least cornugon is among the ﬁercest
warriors of the multiverse. The greatest

SOUL SWALLOWERS
The fact that devourers consume
souls makes them particularly hated
by the church of Pharasma and
psychopomps alike.
Devourer
When ﬁends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches
of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horriﬁc undead called devourers that
consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are
ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—
manifestations of the devourers’ most recently consumed souls.

Spell Deﬂection (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster who targets a devourer with
a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession,
spirit blast, or spirit song can attempt a counteract check to free a soul the
devourer has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds,
the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the
devourer can’t use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are
otherwise immune to these spells.

Devour Soul ʚʖ (death, divine, necromancy) The devourer touches
a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative damage (DC 31 basic
Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes
trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature
can’t be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a wish spell.
Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul
(see Spell Deﬂection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one
soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature
(see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast
spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature
is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul
charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by
powerful magic such as wish.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living
creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become
drained 1. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition
value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Soul Spells A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend
a number of soul charges equal to the spell’s level (similar to casting a spell
using charges from a staﬀ). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by
expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically
has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.

WIDGET WORKSHOPS
The ﬁrst dig-widget came from the
workshops of a dwarven thieves’
guild called Godak’s Grifters, which
used more advanced magical
clockwork theories as a springboard
for these simpler but no less eﬀective
contraptions. With their dig-widgets,
the Grifters plagued the authorities
of several dwarven settlements
over the years. Their travels spread
dig-widget technology, and numerous
improvements have since led to faster
and more reliable versions. Though
upstanding dwarven mechanics have
observed dig-widgets and recognized
the complexity of the technology,
they’ve steadfastly refused to
adapt something with such an
unscrupulous origin.
Dig-Widget
Thieves covet dig-widgets, specialized constructs built for inﬁltration. Each
dig‑widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices
that function as thieves’ tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews
for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel
themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct,
they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path,
dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They’re rarely left unattended, as a thief
needs to be nearby to follow after—both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget
from engaging in further larceny once it’s achieved its goal.
The source of a dig-widget’s power is as much mechanical as it is magical.
The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement
over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant
winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget’s moving
parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.

Fastening Leap Ȱɵ The dig-widget Leaps up 20
feet onto a creature or object and attempts
a corkscrew Strike against it. If the Strike
damages the target, the dig-widget attaches
to the target (typically to the back of a
creature). This is similar to Grabbing the
creature, but the dig-widget moves with that
creature rather than holding it in place. While
attached, the dig-widget can’t use its corkscrew. The
dig-widget can be Shoved oﬀ, or it can detach itself with
an Interact action.
Sneak Attack A dig-widget’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.

COMPSOGNATHUS FAMILIARS
Appropriate familiar abilities for
a compsognathus familiar include
climber, damage avoidance, fast
movement, kinspeech, manual
dexterity, scent, or speech. A
compsognathus familiar who can
talk tends to do so in a rapid voice,
with plenty of questions as a result
of its eager curiosity. Note that while
dinosaurs aren’t technically all the
same species, you should consider
allowing a compsognathus with
kinspeech the ability to speak to any
dinosaur rather than limiting it to
only fellow compsognathuses.
Dinosaur
Dinosaurs encompass a staggering range of creatures, from tiny but still
dangerous scavengers like the compsognathus to lumbering giants like the
ravenous spinosaurus to ornery herbivores like iguanodons. Often sought out
and partially domesticated to serve as exotic pets for eccentric aristocrats or
dangerous guardians for those eager to protect their holdings with frightening
but tamable creatures, dinosaurs are far from limited to lurking in primeval
“lost worlds.”
COMPSOGNATHUS
The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting
motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that
the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or
snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus
is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive
dinosaurs result not from the creatures’ hunger but from frightened defensive
reactions when the dinosaurs’ inquisitive natures compel them to enter into
situations (such as wagons or bedrolls) that inadvertently put them at odds with
surprised adventurers.
A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and
weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar
for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren’t involved, however, those
encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with
the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as
they are at best partly tame.

PACHYCEPHALOSAURUS
Pachycephalosauruses are normally peaceful herbivorous dinosaurs, but they grow
much more violent during their mating season, when they ﬁght one another to win
over mates and warn away interlopers. They also defend themselves vehemently
when potential predators stray too close to their herd. The pachycephalosaurus’s
skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous blunt, bony
horns. This feature, combined with the dinosaur’s powerful, compact neck, allows
it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inﬂicting great damage.
Some humanoid groups have successfully trained pachycephalosauruses for use
as mounts, but the creatures aren’t particularly well suited to the task.
Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.

HADROSAURID
Hadrosaurids are a broad grouping
of herbivorous dinosaurs that
share
characteristic
ﬂat
snouts ﬁlled with rows
of grinding teeth well
suited
for
feeding
on vegetation. Also
known as “duck-billed
dinosaurs” due to the
unusual shape of their jaws,
hadrosaurids
are
lumbering
creatures that can rival an
elephant for size, although they
tend to be much less aggressive and
are prone to ﬂight when confronted
with danger rather than stubbornly standing
their ground. Many species of hadrosaurids have
uniquely shaped crests on their heads that give each
species its own unusual proﬁle, making them easily
recognizable even to an amateur dinosaur watcher.
Giants and other oversized creatures have been known
to domesticate hadrosaurids to serve as livestock. Despite
their ability to sprint quickly, they don’t make particularly
viable mounts due to their timid natures, but in a large group,
a panicked gathering of hadrosaurids can wreak
great damage with their trampling.
A hadrosaurid can walk for short
distances on its hind legs but prefers
to graze and travel on all fours. The
typical hadrosaurid is 20 to 30
feet long and can weigh up to
10,000 pounds.

IGUANODON
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests
where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other
depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach
delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger.
Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A
well‑placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a
cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh
6,000 pounds.

SPINOSAURUS
The spinosaurus is more than just one of the largest carnivorous
dinosaurs—it’s also one of the most unusual in appearance,
with a large, sail-like ﬁn running along its spine. Often
quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to
attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it

MAGICAL DINOSAURS
In a fantasy setting, magical eﬀects
or supernatural inﬂuences can
enhance dinosaurs by giving them
unexpected attacks, modes of

quickly create a memorable magical
beast simply by giving a dinosaur the
magical attack of another creature of
an equal level, such as a spinosaurus

sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to
make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy
maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture
spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong
dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances
make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those
who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals
or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to ﬁght for the amusement of
others won’t discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones
seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus’s appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just
giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals
into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus’s potential. More
so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to ﬂeshwarping
procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance
the creatures’ viability
as effective guardians.

DOLPHINS TO THE RESCUE
Dolphins have a somewhat unusual
trait—they often come to the aid of
other creatures in distress, such as to
save a drowning person or to protect
someone from the attack of a shark.
Not every monster in this book
wants to hurt player characters—
consider having a dolphin come to
an endangered PC’s rescue if the
situation merits!
Dolphin
Dolphins encompass a wide range of aquatic mammals, all of which are quite
social, intelligent, and widespread through the world’s oceans.
BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN
The bottlenose dolphin is the most common and widespread species of dolphin.
They are social predators who hunt shallow seas and rivers in large family groups
called pods. Sailors are fond of bottlenose dolphins and frequently tell tales of how
they save drowning ﬁshers or kill sharks with blows from their powerful snouts.

ORCA
While many know orcas as “killer whales,” they are actually
the largest species of dolphin. These powerful animals hunt
together in pods to take down seals, sharks, and even true
whales. Adult orcas are typically 15–25 feet long and weigh
8,000–12,000 pounds.

DOPRILLU MASKS
A doprillu’s stylized mask isn’t a part
of the creature itself, though doprillus
inherently understand the mask’s
purpose and power. When born,
doprillus start out weak and small.
Once one matures and gains suﬃcient
intelligence and manual dexterity, it
carves its personal mask. The ﬁrst
time it dons the mask, the doprillu
rushes out to seek a ﬁght. This mask
is never replaced, and it might be
marred from hundreds of battles.
Doprillu
The aberrations known as doprillus are hulks with banded muscles who wear ornate
masks at all times that ﬁll their wearers with magical strength and ﬁghting spirit.
Doprillus love to battle, especially by grappling, and are eager to start brawls. On
neutral ground, a doprillu offers to duel the strongest-looking opponent, but when
a doprillu’s home turf is invaded, no rules apply to the confrontation. As beﬁts the
superheated blood that fuels them, doprillus make their homes in warm locations:
hot jungles, sunny deserts, and underground caverns near sulfur vents.

Dragon, Primal
The strange and otherworldly primal dragons hail from realities adjacent to the
Material Plane—the four Elemental Planes and the Shadow Plane. These true
dragons have natures and powers that exemplify their plane of origin and an
afﬁnity for primal magic, unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, who favor
arcane or divine magic. Although they come from distant planes, primal dragons
can be found on the Material Plane in regions touched by or reminiscent of their
home plane. Although such encounters are rare, adventurers and travelers have
sometimes found a brine dragon dwelling near a salty inland sea, for example,
or a crystal dragon living in massive natural caverns deep in the Darklands.
Unlike chromatic and metallic dragons, primal dragons tend not to develop
shape-changing powers, and they are less interested in inﬁltrating settlements or
inﬂuencing others from the shadows.
PRIMAL DRAGON SPELLCASTERS
Each type of primal dragon features a note in the margins on spellcasting dragons of
that type. To make a primal dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy
and Draconic Momentum abilities and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You
can swap out any number of these with other primal spells, provided you keep the
same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s
Wisdom or Charisma modiﬁer by 1 or 2 to reﬂect their mastery of magic.
PRIMAL DRAGONS OF GOLARION
Golarion is not home to many primal dragons. Yet primal dragons do still come to
Golarion now and then, whether to escape persecution in their home plane, build
new lairs, torment and brutalize weaker creatures, or seek knowledge and resources
that are scarce or unavailable at home.
Brine dragons can be found along Golarion’s coastlines but are often frustrated
by piracy and other lawless elements. They tend to avoid heavily populated
coastal areas like the Shackles and instead choose remote islands in the oceans as
their homes, where they can rule small communities of their own curation. Cloud
dragons are even more isolated, and lacking any interest in politics, they prefer
to dwell in large mountain ranges like the Kodars or the Barrier Wall. Crystal
dragons’ vanity compels them to seek places that complement their natural
beauty, such as gem-studded caverns in the Darklands. Of all the primal dragons,
cantankerous magma dragons may be the ones most often found dwelling on
Golarion, where they are drawn to volcanic ranges like the Five Kings Mountains.
Umbral dragons hail not from an Elemental Plane but the Shadow Plane, and they
can be encountered anywhere the borders to that plane grow thin, particularly in
the sinister nation of Nidal.
BRINE DRAGON
Brine dragons are usually blue-green in color, with shiny scales, crests that help
them glide through the water, and sweeping neck frills. They care little for either
good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order
on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted
community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards
of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement
seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the
most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.
Depending on the dragon’s personality, their community members might view
their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful
tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or
philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of
greater concern than individuals’ well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion
rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine
dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.

REZLARABREN
A series of underwater caverns
on Thoska Isle in the Ironbound
Archipelago serves as Rezlarabren’s
lair. There she rules a tribe of ulat-kini
who labor as miners. Her relationship
with the Linnorm Kings is complex,
and whether she views them as allies
or enemies depends on her mood.
Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their
lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside
grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed,
or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel
safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of
offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged
from sunken ships.

CLOUD DRAGON
At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing
more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range
in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and
rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest
mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they’re at home.
Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they ﬂy over from great
heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique
their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something
on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are
not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something
they desire off the ground and ﬂy away with it as they are to bargain fairly.
A cloud dragon’s ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the
complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are

Zanembis is an excellent example of

creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other
true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon’s
penchant for living in the moment is not a personality ﬂaw—they’re more than
capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won’t make foolish
choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have
little interest in worrying about the future and are as conﬁdent in their ability to
handle tomorrow’s problems as they are today’s.
Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural
result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended
periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather
a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a
cloud dragon, a diversiﬁed hoard is a perfect hoard.

PRIMAL DRAGON HOARDS
Primal dragons may hail from other
planes of existence than chromatic or
metallic dragons, but they share one
thing in common with those types—
an obsession with treasure. Speciﬁc
details on the types of treasures each
category of primal dragon favors are
detailed in their respective entries
on the following pages; beyond
those broad guidelines, the treasures
in a dragon’s hoard should match
the themes of that type of dragon.
A brine dragon’s treasures should
have nautical themes to them, for
example, while an umbral dragon
would have collected treasures
of grim and shadowy nature; a
crystal dragon focuses on gemstone
valuables, and a cloud dragon seeks
items that grant ﬂight or produce an
exotic scent. Of them all, the magma
dragon’s treasure hoards are most
akin to that of the classic dragon—
provided the items collected can
survive at the blazing temperatures
that tend to be present in these
dragons’ volcanic dens!
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The dragon breathes a thundercloud
that deals 11d6 electricity damage in a 40-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reﬂex save). They
can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Cloud Walk The cloud dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though on solid ground.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ The dragon makes two claw Strikes and one horn Strike in any order.
Draconic Momentum The dragon recharges their Breath Weapon whenever they score
a critical hit with a Strike.

PRIMAL DRAGON RELIGION
While religious primal dragons
sometimes worship Apsu or Dahak
(which dragon god they favor
depends on their stance on good
or evil), most prefer to worship
elemental divinities.
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (electricity, evocation, primal) The dragon breathes a thundercloud
that deals 20d6 electricity damage in a 60-foot cone (DC 41 basic Reﬂex save). This
cloud remains in the area for 1d4 rounds, with the eﬀects of obscuring mist. A creature
that ends its turn inside of the cloud takes 10d6 electricity damage (DC 41 basic Reﬂex
save). The cloud dragon can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Cloud Form Ȱɵ As adult cloud dragon
Cloud Walk As young cloud dragon.
Draconic Frenzy ʚʖ As young cloud dragon.

Thundering Bite An ancient cloud dragon’s jaws Strike creates a deafening clap of
thunder when it damages a foe. A creature that takes damage from the dragon’s
jaws Strike must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute (or
permanently on a critical failure).
CRYSTAL DRAGON
Good-natured but vain, crystal dragons are beautiful creatures with brilliant
hides made of multicolored crystal and gemstone. Their beauty is a source of
great pride but is also something of a weakness, as crystal dragons are easily
angered by insults about their appearance. Despite their relatively benign natures
when compared to other true dragons, crystal dragons can be short tempered
and prone to ﬁnding insults where none were intended. Although their opinions
are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of
sudden interruptions or distractions.
Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate
environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations
mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some
part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there
are always plenty of reﬂective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own
appearance. These range from crystals to reﬂecting pools to ﬁnely crafted mirrors,
which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or
magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.
Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections
or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make
friends quickly. While a crystal dragon tends to ﬁnd evil creatures uncouth
and unpleasant, any other nearby denizen or inhabitant of their home could
become fast friends or beloved pets, depending upon the creature’s capacity
for conversation (and for providing the frequent praise and compliments that
crystal dragons hunger for).

SHARDIZHAD
Still a relatively young crystal
dragon, Shardizhad has already
made a name for herself in the city
of Wati in Osirion. She has taken
on a somewhat unusual role as a
shopkeeper in that city’s necropolis,
where she’s eager to trade magic
items she’s collected for more gems
and valuable stones.
this aura’s emanation are dazzled. Each creature that ends its turn in the emanation
must succeed at a DC 34 Will saving throw or be stunned 1 (or stunned 3 on a critical
failure). Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is temporarily immune to the stunning
eﬀect for 1 minute. The crystal dragon can turn this aura on or oﬀ using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait, and it can choose not to aﬀect allies.
Reﬂect Spell Ǻȓ Trigger The crystal dragon is targeted by a ranged spell attack roll;
Eﬀect The crystal dragon adjusts a wing to try to reﬂect the spell and gains a +4
circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, the spell

their own AC to determine if the spell hits them instead.

MAGMA DRAGON
Magma dragons have a reputation
among other dragons for being
unpredictable
and
brash.
Their
temperament and tendency for violent
outbursts ensure that the typical
magma dragon lives a solitary life,
with hatchlings often bickering or
ﬁghting to establish dominance among
themselves before they leave the nest.
A magma dragon always has a reason
for their outbursts and can always justify
their sudden turns in mood, yet they rarely
feel the need to do so.
Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically
active mountains or deep underground amid
vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all
true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards
of treasure, but the nature of their searing
lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to
metals, gems, and items capable of resisting
the heat of a volcano’s core.

UMBRAL DRAGON
While the other primal dragons

umbral dragons originate in the
depths of the Shadow Plane.
Their sleek black scales and
serpentine grace allow them to
strike from hiding, and they are
known for playing with their
prey before ﬁnally ﬁnishing
it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome
appetites prefer the necrotic ﬂesh of undead creatures
to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of
accidental beneﬁt to nearby humanoid societies,
but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures
for the taste, rather than out of any desire to
protect others from the undead. The beneﬁt
is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons
exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to

be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite
meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.
For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced
with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons ﬂee into
the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk
their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by
loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have
a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek
to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down
through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they’ve fed upon.

DRAGONFLY SPECIES
While dragonﬂies come in many
colors, the diﬀerences between
species sometimes extend beyond
aesthetic variation. Giant blue
dragonﬂies are larger toxic versions
of the insects with a numbing bite
that boggards use to craft poisons.
Cave dragonﬂies are slower but
stronger variants that dwell in large
cavern systems. The legendary
storm dragonﬂies are truly immense
creatures that can use their powerful
wings to stun foes.
Dragonfly
Dragonﬂies hunt with a combination of agile power and deadly speed. In their
early life stages these insects are entirely aquatic predators, but they take to the air
once they’ve molted. Most live around bodies of water suitable for spawning, but
giant dragonﬂies have been known to ﬂy many miles when on the hunt. Though
their gossamer wings and colorful bodies are beautiful at ﬁrst glance, an unwary
adventurer lured in by the display runs a very real risk of becoming lunch.
GIANT DRAGONFLY NYMPH
The aquatic, wingless offspring of dragonﬂies are called dragonﬂy nymphs. Giant
dragonﬂy nymphs can be several feet in length and mostly hunt in shallow waters,
eating carrion and ambushing living creatures with their fully grown counterparts.
They are not daunted by larger creatures, compelled by their instinct to eat as
much as possible to sustain their growth.

DRAINBERRY COLLECTIONS
As drainberry bushes sell their berries
to others, they collect coins and small
curios—such as a cameo depicting a fey
noble, a lock of golden hair knotted in
a complex pattern, or a ring inscribed
“To my dearest Memdaria.” Not all of
these baubles have monetary value,
but those that don’t certainly had
emotional value to the original owner.
Occasionally, drainberry bushes
accept intangible trade goods, such as
odes celebrating the bushes’ grandeur.
Drainberry Bush
Drainberry bushes are ﬂoating bushes that originate from the First World, with long,
thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly
siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn
consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a
faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.
Drainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense
of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their
berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes ﬁnds the plants
telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, “Money
please,” “Deal good,” “Deal no good,” “Want that,” (with a gesture toward an
item it covets), “Thank you, customer,” and if necessary, “No refunds.” Though
a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly
prefers interesting art objects as payment—even ones of signiﬁcantly lower value.

Blood Berries The drainberry bush must drain blood from living
creatures for sustenance. This causes clusters of bright red
berries to grow among its branches. Each cluster of berries lasts
for 1 day, and a drainberry bush typically has 1d6+3 clusters when
encountered. When consumed, a cluster
restores 2d8+10 Hit Points. This eﬀect has
the healing, necromancy, and primal traits.
A creature can pluck a cluster of berries
with a successful unarmed Strike or
Thievery check against the bush’s AC.
Consume Berries Ȱɵ (healing, necromancy,
positive, primal) The bush draws nourishment
from one cluster of blood berries, regaining
2d8+10 HP. That berry cluster wrinkles and dies.
Drain Blood Ȱɵ Requirements The drainberry bush
has at least one living creature grabbed with one of its
vines; Eﬀect The bush’s hollow thorns siphon blood
from creatures it has grabbed. Each creature
must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take
2d8+10 damage and become drained 1 (double
damage and drained 2 on a critical failure). For
every creature damaged this way, a cluster of
blood berries (see above) immediately grows
along the bush’s branches.
Storm of Vines ʚʖ The drainberry bush makes up to
four vine Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These
attacks count toward the bush’s multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until after the bush makes all these attacks.

DRAKES AND DRAGONS
Although drakes and dragons are
related to one another, little love is
lost between them, and even the
most territorial drakes know better
than to remain in a dragon’s territory
longer than they have to. In rare
cases, large rampages of drakes band
together to attack an encroaching
dragon, especially if the dragon is
young and inexperienced.
Drake
Distant cousins to dragons, drakes menace and terrorize settlements.
SHADOW DRAKE
Shadow drakes are typically among the smallest and least powerful of their
species. Most stand as tall and long as house cats and have charcoal-colored scales
and membranous wings just translucent enough to pass for shadows. Attracted
to shiny materials, they employ deception, teamwork, and even rudimentary traps
to create opportunities to make off with ill-gotten gains. Shadow drakes have a
particular fascination and admiration for umbral dragons—a notable exception
to the norm for drakes and dragons.

DRAKE LOCATIONS
While the diﬀerent species of drakes
are adapted to diﬀerent climates and
environments, many drakes share
similar preferences regarding nest
location, searching out high places
that oﬀer cover from above, such
as cliﬀside or mountaintop caverns,
jungle canopies, and so on.
Creatures within the burst take 3d6 cold damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save). The explosion
of shadow also snuﬀs out mundane light sources the size of a torch, lantern, or smaller,
and attempts to counteract magical light with a +10 counteract modiﬁer. The shadow

SEA DRAKE
Long and slender, sea drakes have ﬁns
down the length of their backs and
webbing between their talons, making
them just as adapted for gliding through
ocean waves as the skies above. More
solitary than most drakes, they hunt and
live alone. Although most sea drakes make
their roosts high on ocean-facing cliffs, it isn’t
unheard of for them to dwell in underwater
caves, living entirely aquatic lives.

DRAUGR SHIPS
When an entire ship’s crew dies
in one calamity, they might rise
simultaneously, bound together in
death. Tirelessly plaguing the seas,
these draugr crews slowly corrupt
their vessels. The cursed ships often
exhibit unsettling phenomena, such
as being able to sail against the wind
or leaving schools of dead ﬁsh in
their wake. Sea shanties tell of draugr
raiders approaching during the night,
wreathed in fog pierced only by the
green glow emanating from their eyes.
Draugr
Risen corpses of sailors who died at sea, draugr reek of the rot and decay of
the briny deep. Their eyes glow with ghastly green light, and rotting seaweed,
barnacles, and dead sea creatures cling to their bodies. Draugr can’t speak, but
expresses their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally
drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living
creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs
often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the
depths with even more dead.
Draugr rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of negative
energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the
sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, a
corpse becomes increasingly disgusting before it ﬁnally rises. Proximity to intelligent
life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a
shipwreck might cause a body to snap to unlife as a draugr suddenly. The creatures
don’t take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.
Though steeped in evil, draugr are susceptible to reminders of their lives as
mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work
song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures
have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but
providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the
beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the
draugr, reafﬁrming their desire for blood and death.
More powerful draugr with burning red eyes are called draugr
captains. They’re 3rd-level creatures with elite adjustments
(page 6) that can cast obscuring mist as an innate divine spell
three times per day.

attacks for the draugr’s multiple attack penalty.

DWEOMERCAT FAMILIARS
Particularly powerful spellcasters
sometimes take young dweomercat
cubs as familiars. Their
independence and ﬂightiness makes
dweomercats somewhat unreliable
allies, though, so one is never
sure whether their bond with a
dweomercat will be long-lasting or a
temporary aﬀair.
Dweomercat
Dweomercats are magically gifted felines from the First World, where they prey
upon other creatures and feed upon their primal energy. They are sometimes
encountered in areas of the Material Plane where the veil to the First World is
thin, or in regions where magic has been irreparably warped. Dweomercats are
famous for their ability to twist the metaphorical strings of spells cast on or near
them, which they can transform into their own defensive magic or tap into to
instantly teleport across the battleﬁeld.

D’ziriak
These strange creatures are native to the Plane of Shadows, where their colorful
nature is in opposition to that realm’s overwhelmingly monochromatic palette.
Averaging 7 feet in height, d’ziriaks have four arms, two legs, and a termitelike abdomen. The larger pair of arms, used for most tasks, have ﬁve‑ﬁngered
hands with sharp, insectile claws. The smaller pair of arms are reserved for ﬁne
manipulations and are not effective in combat.
D’ziriaks’ otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous
runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual’s
role in d’ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane’s other native
inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and d’ziriaks can make
them ﬂare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical
glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and
shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized
carefully over time to ﬁt the individual’s station.
The D’ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few
other creatures. D’ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy
rather than endure the sound of their language being “butchered by ﬂeshy
throats.” D’ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These
hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost
part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for
residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D’ziriak settlements are lit inside
and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of
runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and
perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.

and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both attacks.
LIGHT WEAVERS
The masters of the d’ziriaks’
light‑weaving craft are occult
practitioners, almost always sorcerers
of the aberrant bloodline. Light
weavers prefer spells that provide
light or create magical writing. In their
hive cities, light weavers create art,
lighting, signage, and magic wards.
They also use their light weaving for
entertainment and education.

OTHER AQUATIC REPTILES
The elasmosaurus is but one of
many types of aquatic reptiles found
in primeval oceans or lost worlds.
Some, like the ichthyosaurus, are
almost ﬁshlike in appearance.
Others, such as the mosasaurus,
are truly massive beasts capable of
killing and eating whales.
Elasmosaurus
Elasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and
seas. Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar
locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies
underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to
their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An
elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for
even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote
lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are
mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with
near‑humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem
to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it’s theorized that a typical water
orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both
to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.
While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions,
those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds
to speciﬁc regions. As a result, it’s not unheard of for a wandering specimen to
ﬁnd its way to coastal waters. Those that do often ﬁnd the ports of small towns
or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by
coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward
elasmosaurus like this ﬁnds its way into a city’s
sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become
the stuff of urban legends.

each of which takes the
normal multiple attack penalty. It then Swims up
to its swim Speed. This Swim does not trigger

DIVERSE ELEMENTALS
The Elemental Planes are more
than expanses of sky, rock, ﬁre,
and ocean. Clouds of fog, dust, and
storms ﬂoat through the Plane of Air.
The Plane of Earth includes verdant
groves, shining metal and crystal,
and irradiated wastelands. The Plane
of Fire features magma, suﬀocating
smoke, and radiant ﬁrelight. Amid the
endless sea of the Plane of Water are
pockets of ooze and brine, plus the
otherworldly environs of the deep.

inhales the belker and is immobilized by the pain of the smoke rasping in its throat and
lungs. The creature can attempt to exhale the belker by spending an action coughing
and succeeding at a DC 23 Fortitude save. Most of the belker remains outside the
creature, so the belker can still act normally. If the belker moves out of the creature’s
space or uses Noxious Fumes again, the creature automatically exhales it.
Smoke Slash Ȱɵ Requirement The belker is partially inhaled by a creature; Eﬀect The
belker automatically deals its claw damage to the inhaling creature by forming a claw
to slash and scrape the creature from within.
MELODY ON THE WIND
This cloud of song and sound has been caught
by the wind and carried across the air. While

LOOTING EARTH ELEMENTALS
Earth elementals sometimes have
valuable gemstones or minerals
incorporated into their bodies,
and once they are slain, these
valuables can be scavenged as
treasure. Gemstones, precious
metals such as silver or gold ore,
or rarer materials such as mithral
or adamantine can be harvested
from these creatures, although the
more expensive finds tend to be
incorporated into only the most
powerful earth elementals.
Elemental, Earth
Certain earth elementals manifest as speciﬁc types of material, be they boulders,
sand, or crystals.
LIVING BOULDER
Living boulders roll and glide through the Plane of Earth, gathering gemstones
and metal shards until their surfaces resemble a ship’s hull covered in barnacles.

SAND SENTRY
Shifting back and forth between a detailed likeness of a human and a muted and
featureless bipedal form, this creature of pure sand moves with an eerie grace.
The sand sentry is often called upon by spellcasters to stand guard over an area
of great importance—these elementals are patient participants in such roles,
making them well suited for long-term service.

SAND MIMICS
Sand sentries have no true culture
or society of their own, but they
are endlessly fascinated with the
society and culture of humanoids
they encounter. They can shape their
appearance to mimic any similarly
sized humanoids, and although
they always remain obviously
composed of sand, they do their best
to mimic the day-to-day activities
they observe other humanoids
performing. Of course, structures
and objects sand sentries build from
sand never last, but this never seems
to stiﬂe their obsession.

GRANITE GLYPTODONT
This squat and stony creature looks like an armadillo with a large raised back
and a ﬂail-like tail. The granite glyptodont has no true need to feed, as with
all elementals, yet it does seem to linger after transforming the ﬂesh of those it
calciﬁes, as if the mere proximity of ﬂesh fossilizing into stone pleases it somehow.

Melee Ȱɵ tail +20 (forceful, reach 10 feet, versatile piercing), Damage 2d12+9
bludgeoning plus calciﬁcation
Calciﬁcation (incapacitation, primal, transmutation) A blow from a granite
glyptodont’s tail hardens the ﬂesh of the creature struck. The target must
succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw or become slowed 1 (or
slowed 2 on a critical failure). Further failed saves
against calciﬁcation increase the value of the
slowed condition. Once a creature’s actions are
reduced to 0 by calciﬁcation, that creature
becomes petriﬁed. If the creature isn’t
petriﬁed, the slowed conditions end once 1
minute passes without the creature failing a
save against calciﬁcation.
Every 24 hours after it was petriﬁed,
the creature can attempt a DC 26
Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it
becomes ﬂesh again, but is slowed 1 for
the next 24 hours. On a critical success,
the creature recovers and isn’t slowed.
On a failure, the creature remains
petriﬁed, but can try again in 24 hours.
On a critical failure, the petriﬁcation
is permanent, and the creature can’t
attempt any more saves.

smoke. But sometimes, fragments

MEPHIT INTERACTIONS
Diﬀerent types of mephits that can
be found on the same elemental
plane often develop friendly (or, in
some cases, ﬁerce) rivalries with
one another. While mephits from
elementally opposed planes (such
as ﬁre and water) may have strong
opinions about the superiority of
their own element, the fact that they
rarely see such mephits means that
when they do encounter them, they
often get along better than they do
with their close neighbors.
Elemental, Mephit
Mephits are small, weak creatures that serve at the whims of other elemental entities.
The mephits presented here are less common than air mephits, earth mephits, and the
like, as they are a blend of two different elements rather than focusing on one alone.
DUST MEPHIT
Whining and self-important creatures, dust mephits are known for their tendency
to pronounce doom and gloom at every opportunity, lamenting every insigniﬁcant
and minor difﬁculty as though it were an insurmountable obstacle and making
themselves out to be heroes for struggling valiantly against their cruel fates. They
tend to be thin and gaunt, with dusky brown and gray skin and wings.

ICE MEPHIT
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their ﬁre mephit kin, ice
mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most
mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company.
Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness,
and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
few moral qualms about acting selﬁshly
and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
should the chance arise.

OOZE MEPHIT
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants,
shamelessly ﬂattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although
their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting
targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ochercolored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell
disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.

STEAM MEPHIT
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They
are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in
shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even
when they aren’t bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from
their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.

MEPHIT NAMES
Perhaps because they’re so often
compelled into service by mortal
conjurers and more powerful
elementals, mephits tend to adopt long
names peppered with self-proclaimed
titles and imagined or exaggerated
accomplishments to alleviate their
feelings of inadequacy. Some examples
of mephit names follow.
• Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places,
the Tragic Hero, One Against All
• Silothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord
of the Eternal Chill, Lord of Icicles
• Oglophax, Prince of Pungency, the
Viscous One, the Forever Stain
• Zarnozath the Magniﬁcent, First

ROGUE ELEPHANTS
Elephants of all species are, by
nature, social creatures who form
strong bonds with one another, but
when an elephant separates from
its herd—either due to tragedy or an
individual streak of viciousness—they
become known as rogue elephants.
These dangerous solitary creatures
are ill-tempered and quick to attack
anything that approaches them, and
often have the elite adjustments to

MASTERS OF ADAPTATION
Kayals understand that many
Material Plane cultures view them
with suspicion or even fear, and
take pains to adapt to cultures with
which they seek to establish trade.
Unfortunately, kayals’ mastery
at cultural adaptation can often
backﬁre, leading to fears that the
so-called “fetchlings” are an invading
force that seeks to duplicate and
replace those with whom they
merely wish to do business.
Fetchling
The people known today as fetchlings are a distinct ancestry descended from
generations of humans who became trapped ages ago on the Shadow Plane. No longer
human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic
in coloration, with ﬂesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all
shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid
yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.
Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane,
often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures
there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d’ziriaks. While individual
fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment,
which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the
regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they
trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks
or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.
Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the
event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don’t mind traveling to and
blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react
defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of
the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the
worst of interlopers might make sense to some.
Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane;
most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who
have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere,
exiles who were banished from their homelands,
or planar castaways with no ability to return to the
Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded,
are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities
of signiﬁcant size, one can sometimes even ﬁnd a small community of
a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so
subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing
layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.

IRNAKURSE MOCKERIES
When drow capture a particularly
hated surface elf, or one with a large
following, they inﬂict even greater pain
upon them during the ﬂeshwarping
process than most other victims. The
resulting irnakurse are known as
“mockeries,” and always have elite
adjustments. Rather than using them,
drow keep them close at hand as living
“art” akin to a pet or trophy.
Fleshwarp
Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two ﬂeshwarps
presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths
into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
IRNAKURSE
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and
humiliating ﬂeshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment
of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose ﬂesh,
and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display
to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to
hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all
other targets.

ZEVGAVIZEB’S FAVORED
The demonic patron of many
xulgaths, Zevgavizeb, spends most
of his time slumbering in the Abyssal
realm of Gluttondark. However, his
vile priests actively pursue what
they insist are their dormant god’s
goals. Some xulgath high priests
practice ﬂeshwarping upon their own
acolytes, creating ghonhatine zealots
to serve in their legions and guard
their evil temples.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1. Further failed saves against Soul Scream increase
the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. Each time the character gets
a full night’s rest, the stupeﬁed condition gained from Soul Scream decreases by 1.
Critical Failure As failure, except the stupeﬁed value increases by 2 instead of by 1.
Storm of Tentacles ʚʖ The irnakurse makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the irnakurse’s multiple attack penalty, but
the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all of its attacks.
GHONHATINE
In transforming xulgaths, drow ﬂeshwarpers sought not to create a new type of
creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished
from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to
crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.

unsettlingly oversized pests. Others

awful diseases.
Fly
Giant ﬂies are pony-sized insects that have massive compound eyes and bodies
bristling with short, stiff hairs. Their lairs are notorious for the rotting meat
they stockpile to lay their eggs into. Their maggot-dens are also prime breeding
grounds for virulent diseases.
GIANT MAGGOT
Giant ﬂies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they
hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous

ALIEN ORIGINS
Froghemoths have been known to
suddenly abandon an established lair
to seek a new home, as if in response
to some cosmic convergence or
subspace signal imperceptible to
other creatures. Some argue that
the froghemoth is never fully
comfortable in any environment
because it isn’t from this world at
all, and that these wanderings are
instinctual urges to seek out its true
home—a home not represented by
the strange world in which the beast

A terrifying abomination of teeth, tentacles, and unbridled rage, the froghemoth
is thankfully rarely encountered even in the deepest swamplands or most remote
Darklands caverns. Capable of devouring dinosaurs and even dragons, it is a
frighteningly effective ambush hunter, immersing itself in the mire with only its
eyestalk protruding and watching in every direction at once with uncanny precision.

UNKNOWN ORIGINS
Frost worms are clearly supernatural
in origin, though the source of their
magical abilities remains unclear.
Research is hampered by the fact
that neither the corpse nor its magic
survive the creature’s death, and live
frost worms are notoriously diﬃcult
and dangerous to keep or transport.
Evidence exists that the winter
witches of Irrisen may have created
the ﬁrst frost worms, while other
clues suggest they hail from the
distant planet of Triaxus.
Frost Worm
The frost worm’s single round, red eye gleams prominently at the head of its monstrous
mass, white as a winter snowfall. What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually
two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth.
An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouﬂage, burrowing, and
deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive,
high‑pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared
it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches.
The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while
it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such
regions. A frost worm that somehow ﬁnds itself in temperate or even tropical
environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time,
creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain.

eﬀects of Worm Trill last for 1 round, but if the
frost worm uses this ability again on subsequent
rounds, it extends this duration by 1 round for any
creature already aﬀected.

immune to Worm Trill for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated by the frost
worm.
Critical Failure As failure, but the fascinated
condition doesn’t end if the frost worm uses
hostile actions against the creature.

WOOD GIANT CELEBRATIONS
Despite the seriousness with which
wood giants approach their duties,
or perhaps because of it, wood giant
gatherings are joyous occasions.
Wood giants most often gather to
sing, dance, seek life partners, and
celebrate their hard work.
Giant
Giants prosper in many environments, and although they are quite diverse, they
all tend to have equally larger-than-life personalities.
WOOD GIANT
Wood giants are the denizens and protectors of the deepest, most primeval
forests in the world. They dedicate their entire lives to the preservation of
nature—a role that they believe nature itself has selected them to carry out.
Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild
places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part
of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense
humanoid settlements.
Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most
giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense
forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely
with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness
regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory,
foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands.
While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey
creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most
fey as far too ﬂighty to take part in any long-term plans.
An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200
pounds.

Piercing Shot Ȱɵ The wood giant shoots an arrow at a target so that it
glances oﬀ the ﬁrst target to strike another target behind the ﬁrst
one. The wood giant chooses two targets in a direct line, one of which
must be giving lesser cover to the other, then makes a single ranged
Strike with its longbow against both targets. This attack ignores
the lesser cover the ﬁrst target provides to the second. The wood
giant rolls damage only once, and applies it to each creature it hits.
Piercing Shot counts as two attacks for the wood giant’s multiple
attack penalty.

GAFFS
Many marsh giants ﬁght with
oversized gaﬀs—lengths of wood
with a single metal spike aﬃxed
to the tip. Used often by ﬁsherfolk
to land ﬁsh, marsh giants use their
gaﬀs as weapons. A gaﬀ sized for
a Medium creature is a common
martial weapon in the club group.
It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage
and has 1 Bulk. It requires one
hand to use and has the trip and
versatile P weapon traits. Gaﬀs are
readily available in ﬁshing or coastal
settlements for 1 gp.
MARSH GIANT
Dwellers of brackish coastal salt marshes and fetid bogs and swamps, marsh giants
are hideous in appearance indeed, with ﬁshlike mouths, slimy gray-green skin, and
dark, beady eyes. They prefer to eat the ﬂesh of those they slay in battle, but many
are also cannibals. It is perhaps this vicious behavior that keeps the creatures in
check, for if a fellow marsh giant becomes too dangerous and powerful, it runs the
risk of being ambushed and consumed by its clan.
Marsh giants are insular and mysterious, dedicating much of their lives to
zealous worship of sea-dwelling deities or stranger entities. While there is no
central religion followed by all marsh giants, many are known to venerate the
demon lord Dagon, while others worship even more powerful monstrosities from
the Elder Mythos, such as distant, dreaming Cthulhu.
Only rarely do more than a dozen marsh giants settle together in a location,
but when they do it is often for a religious purpose. Whatever call from the deep
draws them together also tugs at nearby creatures such as boggards or skum, who
look upon marsh giants in fear and reverence. The grim, terrifying chants and
screams coming from such an encampment are a sure sign of terror to come for
any other residents of the area.
Barely topping 11 feet tall and 1,000 pounds, marsh giants are small
for giants but make up for their relatively diminutive stature with
their zealotry.

TAIGA GIANT CLANS
Each taiga giant clan links its identity
to the deeds of their most famous
ancestors and heroes. Names such
as Cliﬀsmiter and Mountainripper
hint at legendary accomplishments,
though the stories are rarely shared
with outsiders.
TAIGA GIANT
Taiga giants prefer a nomadic lifestyle, both to keep from depleting any one
area’s resources while satiating their massive appetites and to satisfy a constant
wanderlust. They are deeply spiritual and frequently commune with their
ancestors’ spirits for guidance and knowledge. Taiga giants are happiest when
they are left alone to live out their traditional lives, and their impressive size and
strength are enough to persuade all but the most dangerous foes to do so.
Taiga giants subsist on migratory herds of aurochs, mammoths, and elk. They
occasionally raid humanoid villages, but such cases are opportunistic rather than
malicious, with a focus on stealing away livestock for food rather than people.
Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating
event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants
by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are
scheduled to come close.
Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in
everything they do. This deep connection makes them ferociously proud of
those legacies, and little can compel taiga giants to go to war more swiftly
than insulting their ancestors. Merely mentioning the false rumors that
ancient taiga giant spellcasters were responsible for the creation of the
ﬁrst rune giants is a sureﬁre way to earn a taiga giant’s unending wrath.
A taiga giant stands 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.

Some shadow giants travel to the

in Nidal’s Umbral Court. Rumors of
these massive shock troops deployed

SHADOW GIANT
Shadow giants are ﬁerce natives of the Shadow Plane, where they have dwelled in
perpetual twilight for millennia. Their cultures vary greatly depending on whether
the giants reside in their land of origin or have relocated to the Material Plane. On
the Shadow Plane, they live in familiar groups and uphold a nomadic way of life
as they roam across ancestral lands between shadowy forests and misty chasms.
These hunter-gatherers pass down lore through oral histories, conduct pilgrimages
to unholy ziggurats of black stone, and bathe in the blood of their long-standing
foes, including rival shadow giant clans and velstracs intent on enslaving their
kind. On the Material Plane, conversely, they are secretive and isolationist,
keeping apart from other peoples in forbidding structures of black stone in
high, isolated mountain valleys.
Standing 15 feet tall, with gray skin and hair only a shade lighter,
shadow giants are fearsome foes with a well-earned reputation as zealous
warmongers and ruthless combatants. They rarely interact with
outsiders, though they may treat with proven warriors
who show the giants the respect and deference they feel
they deserve. Only a small subset of shadow giants
worship Zon-Kuthon, and most of these Kuthites are
so ﬁrmly entrenched in the culture of Nidal that their
Shadow Plane-dwelling kin would hardly recognize
them. Most shadow giants instead practice an ancient
religion, unique to their people, with its own bloody themes
of sacriﬁce and self-mutilation.

CARRION GOLEM COMPONENTS
The decaying body parts that make
up a carrion golem are of little
value in most cultures. However,
the magic used to preserve them
and infuse them with disease can
still be harnessed by unscrupulous
necromancers and other practitioners
of foul arts. Such creatures may
be willing to purchase a destroyed
carrion golem, but the processes
used to extract the power within the
pieces are diﬃcult and ineﬃcient, so
they won’t pay much.
Golems
The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity
of its crafter. Over the ages, skilled minds and hands have reﬁned the formulas
for creating speciﬁc types of golems, resulting in the development of common
forms. The secrets of creating the types of golems presented here may be
guarded within the halls of famous golemworks or the forgotten libraries of
many worlds.
GOLEM ANTIMAGIC
A golem is immune to spells and magical abilities other than its own, but each
type of golem is affected by a few types of magic in special ways. These exceptions
are listed in shortened form in the golem’s stat block, with the full rules appearing
here. If an entry lists multiple types (such as “cold and water”), either type of spell
can affect the golem.
• Harmed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to take the
listed amount of damage (this damage has no type) instead of the usual eﬀect. If the
golem starts its turn in an area of magic of this type or is aﬀected by a persistent
eﬀect of the appropriate type, it takes the damage listed in the parenthetical.
• Healed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem makes the golem lose the
slowed condition and gain Hit Points equal to half the damage the spell would have
dealt. If the golem starts its turn in an area of this type of magic, it gains the Hit
Points listed in the parenthetical.
• Slowed By Any magic of this type that targets the golem causes it to be slowed 1
for 2d6 rounds instead of the usual eﬀect. If the golem starts its turn in an area of
this type of magic, it’s slowed 1 for that round.
• Vulnerable To Each golem is vulnerable to one or more speciﬁc spells, with the
eﬀects described in its stat block.
CARRION GOLEM
Carrion golems are foul-smelling and ﬂyswarmed amalgams of putreﬁed parts
stitched together from many different
creatures. Unlike most golems, carrion
golems only rarely are given a humanoid
form, instead appearing more twisted and
bestial in frame. As a result, some students of
golem crafting claim that the carrion golem isn’t
a “true golem,” but regardless of those claims these
foul constructs certainly share other golem-like traits,
including their signiﬁcant immunities. What is true is
that most who craft carrion golems don’t do so out
of true interest in the technique of golem crafting, but
for the golem’s ability to spread disease. The crafters
of carrion golems send their mindless minions to cause
immediate destruction and leave wakes of illness and
death behind them.

ICE GOLEM COMPONENTS
When destroyed, the magic
sustaining an ice golem’s form
quickly dissipates. Unless it is in a
freezing environment, the golem’s
shattered remains soon melt
completely away. Still, the animating
magic can linger in shards of ice
that resist melting; these may fetch
a good price from wealthy folk to
preserve foods or chill beverages.
Pieces of ice that are captured and
magically preserved or allowed to
melt in sealed containers can also be
sold to scholars who may be able to
divine arcane secrets from the once
magically animated materials.

aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as
long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, aﬀected creatures take
a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened
condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Vulnerable to Gentle Repose Casting a gentle repose spell on a carrion golem causes it
to grow stiﬀ. The golem attempts a DC 19 Fortitude save. It’s unaﬀected on a critical
success, slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds on a success, and on a failure is immobilized and
slowed for 1d4 rounds.

Stage 5 dead
ICE GOLEM
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from
individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a
humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates,
the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer
temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower
end of the scale as far as cost and difﬁculty to create, gives these constructs
unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful
in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians
for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem
standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the
chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice
golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

Unless they are badly damaged by
magical ﬁre, the rare woods and
exquisitely carved blocks used to

of their value after the golem’s
destruction. Carpenters, sculptors,
and even some merchants will pay
a fair price for the remains of a
defeated wood golem. However, if
the golem belonged to a rich and
powerful person and its fragments
are thus recognizable, it may be more
diﬃcult to ﬁnd willing buyers.

even if it’s not willing. If it is targeted, for 1 round it can’t use Breath Weapon or

Creeping Cold (arcane, cold, evocation) When the ice golem gets a critical hit with a ﬁst
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 persistent cold damage and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
WOOD GOLEM
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
together from scraps of ﬁrewood and discarded burls. It’s less common for
wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to
be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their
owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems
to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve
dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don’t
bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically
see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids
often feel when facing a carrion or ﬂesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such
creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic
match between the wood golem’s appearance and such locations.

GLASS GOLEM COMPONENTS
The destruction of a glass golem
often leaves nothing behind but a
pile of tiny shards of crystal and lead.
However, if larger pieces survive, the
crystal can be sold to glass merchants
or skilled crafters who can turn them
into glittering works of art.
Ranged Ȱɵ splinter +16 (magical, range increment 30 feet), Damage 2d4+8 piercing
Splinter Volley ʚʖ (arcane, evocation) The wood golem makes up to four splinter
Strikes, each against a diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the wood golem’s
multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the
wood golem makes all of its attacks.
GLASS GOLEM
Crafted of hardened glass and held together by magically treated lead, glass golems
are both deadly guardians and works of exquisite art. Glass golems most often
protect grand cathedrals or opulent palaces—testaments to the wealth and power
of those they serve, or once served. Once spurred into action by the commands of
their creators, glass golems are quicker and more agile than most other golems.
Their sharp, blade-like limbs can easily sever veins and arteries, creating wounds
that bleed profusely.
Of all the various types of golems, the glass golem is the one most akin to a
work of art. Just as powerful aristocrats might use an ice golem for temperature
regulation or a wood golem as an ego-boosting statue, a glass golem’s colorful
glass construction can elevate the beauty of any chamber by its mere presence.

ILL-ADVISED TRAININGS
While many have tried to train
gorgons as mounts or beasts of war,
the combination of their notoriously
short tempers and the diﬃculty
in containing the eﬀects of their
petrifying breath make this a diﬃcult
task. In most cases, those who
attempt to domesticate gorgons
end up creating untamed gorgon
breeding grounds.
Gorgon
Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic,
interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a
creature of ﬂesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a
charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are
dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become
especially deadly.
Gorgons typically subsist on petriﬁed ﬂesh or fossils. These supernatural
beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they ﬁnd
raw stone ﬂavorless, so it’s not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons
use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the
resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks
with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetriﬁed organic material,
and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such
discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures
even more ill tempered than usual—much to the chagrin of anyone they
subsequently encounter.
Gorgon ﬂesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and
aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs ﬁnd off-putting. Creatures with a close
association to earth and stone are more likely to ﬁnd the ﬂavor appetizing;
stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be
delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures,
consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a
physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with
gorgon ﬂesh can ﬁnd renown for their skill in creating
palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.

DOMINION PLOTS
While Golarion largely survived
the events of the Doomsday Dawn,
the threat of the Dominion of the
Black is far from over. This alien
conglomerate recognizes that it
needs to understand the vastness
of humanoids in the universe to
better enact their plans, and certain
nihilistic scholars suggest that the
Doomsday Dawn was never intended
to end the world, but instead served
its primary goal of setting the
stage for an even more devastating
invasion from the Dominion in the
near future.
Gosreg
Gosregs are agents of the Dominion of the Black that insinuate themselves into
humanoid societies to foster the goals of their sinister alien masters. They act as
spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting
plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.
In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy
legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to inﬁltrate
societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately
compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their
brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of
the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.

GREMLIN MINIONS
Most know better than to employ
gremlins, so when the fey creatures
live side-by-side with others, it’s often
as parasites and unwelcome guests.
Imaginative and sinister folk who ﬁnd
themselves infested sometimes catch
the gremlins and release them in the
homes of their enemies.
Gremlin
The mischievous fey known as gremlins seem to come in endless varieties with
differing appearances. Preferring to destroy rather than to build, gremlins almost
never construct their own homes, instead infesting tunnels and abandoned buildings.
They augment these lairs with cruel traps, and sometimes trained animals (often
ones considered pests by humanoids). Gremlin lairs are generally near a city or
village (whether on the surface or in the Darklands) that provides them with a ready
source of food, trap-building materials, and, of course, victims for entertainment.
There is little difference in appearance between male and female gremlins, and
many observers wrongly assume that they are single-gender or genderless. Gremlins
are proliﬁc breeders, and a handful can quickly become a mob. Young gremlins are
raised communally—a necessity, as they exhibit the urge to cause mischief from
birth. They grow quickly and reach full size in a matter of weeks.
VEXGIT
These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that
clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the
works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An
individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or
remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become ﬁlled
with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding
violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.
Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and
other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they’re unable
to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a
maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.
Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger
groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with
additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained
giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in
vexgit lairs.

a time—if they create a new snare, the previously
created one vanishes.

================================================================================
PAGE 136
================================================================================

GREMLIN FAITH
Lawful evil gremlins are sometimes
drawn to the worship of archdevils,
though not in an orthodox fashion.
Dispater is revered as the archdevil
of cities—playgrounds to engage in
thievery and sabotage. Mammon is
worshipped as the bringer of wealth
and protector of gremlin warrens
that, like his domain of Erebus,
are dark and trap-ﬁlled. Neutral
evil gremlins have been known to
worship Norgorber in his aspect as a
patron of thieves, but pugwampis in
particular prefer to worship gnolls (or
at least, worship whoever the local
gnolls worship). Chaotic evil gremlins
often revere Andirifkhu, demon lord
of illusions, knives, and traps. Those
that retain a connection to the First
World may swear allegiance to the
Lantern King, Eldest of laughter,
mischief, and transmutation.
Rusting Grasp ʚʖ (primal, transmutation) Frequency once per hour; Eﬀect The vexgit
makes a +9 spell attack against a creature or unattended object. If they succeed,
the vexgit deals 1d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is
wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If they hit an unattended metal item, the
item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses Shield Block with a metal
shield against this attack, the shield is automatically broken, but no other item is
rusted on that attack.
Speedy Sabotage When a vexgit succeeds or critically succeeds at a check to Disable a
Device, they gain an additional success toward disabling a complex device.
NUGLUB
The “towering” hunchbacked nuglubs are among the largest gremlins, though
they’re not quite three feet tall. Nuglubs have three glowing blue eyes and black,
oily hair on their head and back that covers them like a cloak. Nuglubs enjoy
killing with a glee that other gremlins reserve for sabotage. Indeed, they spend
long hours preparing ambushes for unwary travelers or plotting the murders of
sleeping villagers. Though less technically inclined than their kin, nuglubs do enjoy
building traps. They delight in stealthily constructing traps in places their victims
consider familiar, such as front doors and the ﬂoors around beds. If someone else
gets blamed for the mayhem the nuglub creates, all the better.
In combat, nuglubs focus on targets wearing metal armor. Some attribute this to
envy on the part of the nuglubs, who ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ﬁt armor on their twisted
bodies. Nuglubs are particularly talented at causing those nearby to stumble over
them and fall prone. Once an enemy falls to the ground, all the nuglubs descend
upon the target, biting and scratching until nothing remains.
Nuglubs rarely gather in groups larger than half a dozen, as quarrels often lead to
violence and cannibalism. A lone nuglub who bullies a group of smaller gremlins is
more likely to get their way, and thus less likely to attack their allies.

GRENDEL’S MOTHER
At the bottom of a remote mountain
lake ﬁlled with sea serpents is a
magical house—the lair of Grendel’s
mother. Among her many treasures is
a sword so big and heavy that only a
supernaturally strong individual can
wield it. When Grendel is injured, he
retreats here to heal.
Grendel
This reaver of the cold marsh is not just a monster; he is a force of nature. Where there
is peace and prosperity in the world, Grendel strikes, eager to prove that tranquility
is transitory and death is the only constant. He stalks the edge of his fens, seeking
settlements where joy holds sway. He strikes under cover of night, primarily targeting
celebrations or festivals. The more happiness or joy he can extinguish, the better.
Although Grendel is a unique creature, killing him won’t save the world from his
ravages for long. Once Grendel’s mother instinctively feels the pain of her violent
son’s death, she soon births a replacement. The new Grendel seems to avoid the
sites his elder brothers terrorized, as if he instinctively knows that such a place hosts
heroes powerful enough to defeat him.

GRIMSTALKER FORESTRY
Grimstalkers often harvest the seeds
of carnivorous plants, particularly
assassin vines, which they sow
during their wanderings. Typically
they seed their territory’s borders
with these dangerous plants as a
defense tactic, but they also sow
gardens and ﬁelds, weaponizing
these plots of land against hapless
gardeners and farmers.
Grimstalker
These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and
slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they
prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work
to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature
can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy
to perform nature’s dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters,
and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or
travel within.
Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown ﬂesh
gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a
thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of
their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that
often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny
plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, ﬁlling roles that
pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these “pets”
poorly at best.
There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the
most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or
weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps
shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company
worth keeping.
Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets.
They surround enemies ﬁrst, then work to unnerve them by knocking on
trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry.
Of course, a band of grimstalkers won’t stay together for long, quickly
succumbing to bickering and inﬁghting. These violent arguments
are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each
grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more
powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers
from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that
this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afﬂicted fey
who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it’s just
part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered,
confrontational, and bitter.

GIANT GRINDYLOWS
While most grindylows are Small, a
minute percentage of these creatures
keep growing throughout their lives.
Those that become Large or larger
gain the giant trait and often become
champions of their schools.
Grindylow
The top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but from the waist
down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles. They dwell
mostly in shallow waters both fresh and briny, including lakes, rivers, coastal
regions, and near coral reefs. Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging
from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be
brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances
last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving
grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own.
Grindylows aren’t territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build
permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until
driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of
seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters
that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.
Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred
for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylowinfested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in
hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay,
it can also backﬁre, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated
attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship’s route becomes predictable.
This hatred of squids does not extend to
other tentacled creatures; grindylows
consider octopuses to be the
epitome of grace and power.

A HISTORY OF NEUTRALITY
Grippli villages rarely get involved in
the concerns of other communities,
preferring to focus on maintaining
relative peace within their own
small societies. Legends explain
this attitude with a tale of a grippli
champion who dragged his people
into a war between humans and
charau-kas. The stories diﬀer as to
which side the gripplis took, but every
version ends with the bloody deaths
of the hero and his family. Since that
time, village elders claim, gripplis have
done their best to remain far from the
conﬂicts of others.
Grippli
Gripplis make their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests. These
frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized
eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow
them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with
their physiologies inﬂuenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live
in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes.
In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown
coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and
orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately
30 pounds.
Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers.
Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don’t maintain typical
farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and
gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis
hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of
giant dragonﬂies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly
enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger
ﬂying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The
rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however,
so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as
local heroes.
Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly
dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden
platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad
leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages,
making them especially difﬁcult to spot from the forest ﬂoor,
and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that
only they can navigate.
Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts
of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the
settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or
agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on
ﬁnesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.

GRODAIR TREASURE
Amid the vile, rubbery entrails of
an exploded grodair is a bizarre
cluster of tubular organs about the
size of a melon that serves as its
extradimensional water storage.
Harvesting the organ cluster
takes 5 minutes and a successful
DC 22 Survival check. For the next
2d6 hours, the cluster can then be
used produce either the “stream” or
the “fountain” eﬀect of a decanter of
endless water (Core Rulebook 573).
On a critical failure to harvest the
organ cluster, it bursts and deals 2d6
bludgeoning damage to the harvester.
Grodair
Grodairs are bizarre ﬁshlike creature native to the First World. Their supernatural
physiology includes a strange organ with an extradimensional space capable of
storing thousands of gallons of water. This grants grodairs the ability to create
a suitable environment for themselves anywhere by releasing the water, quickly
transforming any surrounding land into a shallow bog. When grodairs wish
to leave for a new location, they simply suck up all the water back up. When
necessary, grodairs can also travel on land by walking upon the tangle of long,
ﬂeshy tentacles that dangle from their bellies.
Grodairs have two sets of eyes that function independently. While this makes
the creatures difﬁcult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During
conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difﬁculty
remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing
tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they
aren’t reliable. They have difﬁculty following plans or schedules, and they can
keep a secret only if they happen to forget it ﬁrst. For these reasons, grodairs
don’t always make the best allies.
Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods—in
fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that
they venture out of First World. They can also capture and store within their
throats any small animals and plants easily suspended in water, and eject them
for consumption at a later time.

CATS AND DOGS
If there’s one thing more certain to
infuriate a hellcat other than to treat
it as a mere animal, that is to compare
it in any way to a hell hound. Hellcats
consider hell hounds little more than
vermin infesting the hellscapes they
call home, and enjoy torturing them
more than any other creature.
Hellcat
Hellcats are devious predators native to the ﬁery pits of Hell. While the ﬁendish
creatures appears as skeletal smilodons, their bones smoking with heat and
dripping with boiling blood, they are not undead. They are living hellspawn with
transparent ﬂesh that reveals their burning skeletons. A typical hellcat is 9 feet
long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
Left to their own devices, hellcats spend their time hunting—that is, seeking and
stalking prey just for the thrill of the chase. As ﬁendish creatures, they do not require
mortal sustenance, but they do devour their prey for the sheer pleasure of inﬂicting
pain. They are also far more intelligent than most assume, and they resent being
treated as unintelligent animals; those who treat a hellcat as a one may ﬁnd themself
made into a trophy for its pack, as a hellcat goes to great lengths to coordinate
elaborate revenge upon those who fail to show proper respect.
Though they can’t speak, hellcats know Infernal and can communicate
by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. They rarely say much
except to make whispered threats and to acknowledge the orders of
their diabolic masters.
Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly outmatched or up
against foes they’re unable to reach, but they never forget prey that
escapes them. They often track potential victims and recruit allies,
including other hellcats, to make coordinated attacks or ambushes
against their foes.

AQUATIC CAVALRY
Protecting the harbor of Absalom
and the shores of Starstone Isle,
the elite Wave Riders use combattrained hippocampi as mounts. The
Wave Riders harass enemy ships,
defend against aquatic foes, and
intercept smugglers.
Hippocampus
The strange beasts known as hippocampi resemble terrestrial horses from head
to midbody, but on their legs, they have splayed ﬁns instead of hooves, and in
place of horses’ hindquarters, they have powerful tails resembling those of ﬁsh.
Hippocampi have colorful scales ranging from pearly white to seaweed green, and
brilliant ribbed dorsal sails as manes. In the wild oceans, most types of hippocampi
tend to congregate in the shallows near the beds of seaweed and kelp forests that
provide them with food and shelter from predators. They form huge schools to
provide safety in numbers, like land-bound horses form herds.
Hippocampi are highly prized by undersea societies and surface dwellers alike,
as they are as easy to train as horses and serve many of the same functions, be
that as beasts of burden, war-trained mounts, transportation, or as pets. Though
hippocampi are able to wear barding, it hampers them considerably, so most
handlers outﬁt them with the lightest options available. More often they are
trained to pull specially designed underwater chariots or sleds. Hippocampi
do not to leave the water, as they are clumsy on land, can’t bear riders while
ﬂopping about on the ground, and can’t breathe air for long.
Numerous variant species of hippocampi exist, although most of them
differ from the common hippocampus only in coloration. Heartier species,
such as polar hippocampi, dwell exclusively in arctic waters and are best
presented as hippocampi with elite adjustments.

Hippocampi serve as steeds for aquatic humanoids or roam wild in the sea.

HIPPOGRIFF EGGS
Rather than birthing live young,
hippogriﬀs lay a clutch consisting of
only a single egg. Hippogriﬀ eggs are
sought after by potential trainers and
opportunists alike.
Hippogriff
With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magniﬁcence of a powerful
horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps
the creation of a ﬂesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of
their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above
their favored plains or hill country.
Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather
coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have
managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their
torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are
colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or
even palomino coloration.
Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their
equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies
above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and
wyverns. Only hippogriffs’ superior speed helps protect them from
these predators.
Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and ﬁercely protect the
lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands,
rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their
homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb
the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid.
Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal
to aid in digestion.
Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both
ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set
bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs
frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote
outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer,
elk, and bears.
However, other communities train hippogriffs from
hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—
the most notable among these groups in the Inner
Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the citystate of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult
hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more
difﬁcult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat
techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount,
ﬁghting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement
of their companion’s wings.

HODAG TALES
Those who’ve encountered hodags
tend to create larger-than-life
reports of the sighting. In the
dense Verduran Forest, lumberjacks
working for the Lumber Consortium
regale each other with competing
stories about Big Marna, a legendary
hodag who the loggers claim has
killed two dozen people. Inhabitants
of Echo Wood in the River Kingdoms
spin lore about Black Shiv, a hodag
spotted haunting the outskirts of
small settlements, and in recent
months, hunters and miners in the
southwestern reaches of Ravounel
speak of a frightening undead hodag
called Ghouliegut.
Hodag
Because they are often described only in drunken retellings of loggers’ or miners’
tales, hodags are considered by many to exist only in the local folklore of remote
areas. However, some individuals have actually encountered these dangerous
beasts ﬁrsthand, and even fewer have lived to tell their tales.
Hodags are reptilian creatures the size of bulls. These vicious predators’ long
claws can tear creatures apart in seconds. Their backs sport dozens of long spines
that run from their snouts all the way down the length of their powerful tails. Their
wide mouths are full of sharp and twisted rows of teeth not unlike those of a shark.
The hodags’ rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to
blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey. Only their glowing red
eyes reveal their presence, though hodags have learned to use this to their advantage
by drawing attention to their eyes in one area, then closing their eyes and stealthily
moving to another area to cause their prey to misconstrue their location.
In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets a region, hodags grow a
foul‑smelling coat of greasy, dark-brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between
their scales. A typical hodag measures over 10 feet long from snout to tail and
weighs upward of 700 pounds.

TINDALOS
Ancient texts refer to these
relentless temporal hunters as the
hounds of Tindalos, yet they never
seem to explore what Tindalos
actually is. In some references, the
implication is that Tindalos is one of
the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods,
but if this is the case, it is among the
most obscure of these entities. Other
tomes refer as Tindalos as a location,
perhaps even a city or nation that
once existed before time began and
that can be reached only by methods
impossible for any creature bound
by the laws of time. In all likelihood,
both and neither are right—what
Tindalos is may simply be impossible
for mortal minds to comprehend.
Hound of Tindalos
Lean and athirst, the hounds of Tindalos are drawn to those who tamper with the
ﬂow of time, travel through time, or use magic or rare alchemical drugs to send
their thoughts or perception back or forward in time. Powerful spellcasters can
draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the
hounds’ ire, so few who trafﬁc in such rituals live long enough to spread their
knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely
interact with other creatures—other than to hunt and destroy those who have
attracted their unblinking attention.
Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The
pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and
devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of
Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.

Angled Entry Ȱɵ The hound of Tindalos casts
a 4th-level dimension door spell, but it must
transport itself into a space adjacent to an
angle of 90º (or more acute) in the structure or
environment around it. For example, it could teleport
to a space adjacent to a wall (using the angle
between the wall and ﬂoor) or a corner in a room, or
adjacent to a sizable tree growing straight up out of
the ground, but not to a ﬂat plain or a room
with only curved corners and edges.
Once per day, the hound can use
this ability to plane shift to or from
the Dimension of Time, with the
same restrictions on what angles it can appear next to.

SENSATION SEEKERS
Intellect devourers steal bodies to
experience the physical sensations
denied their nearly invulnerable
natural forms. Each new body
brings the opportunity to explore
new vistas of taste, touch, and pain.
Intellect devourers occupying a
body fear little but discovery, and
even that simply puts a temporary
end to their games. Harm to the
host is just another sensation to
experience, and replacement bodies
are easy to ﬁnd.
Intellect Devourer
Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and inﬁltrators for the powerful
force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the
Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When
an intellect devourer inﬁltrates a society, its ﬁrst priority is to acquire a body. It
might ﬁrst seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than ﬁghting
and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host’s brain
cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of
its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to
make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.

Body Thief ̂ˬ (manipulate, necromancy, occult, possession) The intellect devourer
reduces in size and burrows into the brain of a creature dead for no longer than 1 day.
At the start of the intellect devourer’s next turn, the body revives at its maximum Hit
Points, controlled by the devourer. The intellect devourer is conscious and can sense
everything the possessed body could. Any eﬀect that ends the possession kills the host
body with the same eﬀects as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can’t use any of the host
creature’s spells with Body Thief but can use its own spells. The host body slowly decays
while inhabited by the intellect devourer, becoming uninhabitable after
7 days unless preserved with gentle repose or a similar eﬀect.
Exit Body Ȱɵ (move) Requirements The intellect devourer is
controlling a body with Body Thief; Eﬀect The intellect
devourer leaves its host body, which dies instantly
and is no longer a suitable host for any Body
Thief ability. The intellect devourer appears
at full size in an adjacent space.
Ravage ̂ˬ The intellect devourer makes
two talon Strikes against a paralyzed,
restrained, or unconscious creature,
using the same attack modiﬁer as its
highest attack modiﬁer. These Strikes
gain the death trait. If Ravage kills the
target, the intellect devourer may use Body
Thief against it as a free action.
Stolen Identity While an intellect devourer
uses Body Thief, it gains the ability to
understand and speak all languages
known by the host, as well as knowledge
of the host body’s abilities, identity, role
in society, and personality. However,
it does not gain the
speciﬁc memories
or knowledge of
the host body.

IRLGAUNT RELIGION
A small number of irlgaunts actively
worship Rovagug, whom they believe
to be the progenitor of their species.
Instead of living solitary lives,
these chaotic evil irlgaunts form
cabals that inhabit deep ﬁssures,
transforming them into grisly
temples by decorating them with
the corpses of their sacriﬁces. They
also decorate their own bodies by
carving prayers into their chitin and
painting themselves with crude and
disturbing images. Some claim these
runes grant them divine powers of
protection and the ability to summon
Rovagug’s otherworldly kin.
Irlgaunt
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils
erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow
them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines
that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible
alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without
pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful
ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating
gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive
enzymes strong enough to break down ﬂesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and
explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because ﬁnding enough food
to sustain a community tends to be difﬁcult. However, they still maintain a sense
of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to
discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been
known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.

EXILES FROM BEYOND
These disgusting parasites originally
manifested in the First World, but
the fey denizens of that realm found
them too awful to endure and exiled
them to the Material Plane. Over
time, the isqulugs sloughed oﬀ their
fey features for new, more powerful
bodies of their own. Reports of
stranger variants ﬂourishing in areas
such as demon-deﬁled Tanglebriar
and remote fungi-ridden vaults in Orv,
however, suggest their foothold on
Golarion has become more established
than previously thought.
Isqulug
The isqulug’s appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect.
The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and
a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy
transparent eggs ﬁlled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute
the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an
organic suit manufactured from the ﬂesh of those it has consumed, analogous to
the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of
movement and violence.

JABBERWOCK TREASURE
Jabberwocks have no interest
in treasure for its own sake, but
they gather objects of great value
or power speciﬁcally to entice
mortals into seeking it out. As a
result, jabberwocks quickly amass
impressive hoards of treasures taken
from nearby areas.
Jabberwock
Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many
cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey
realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures
known collectively as the Tane.
Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat,
drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly
by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or
frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most
powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one
purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the
Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even
entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a
single mortal. Sometimes, no speciﬁc insult or injury is required, as some of
the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically
create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its
younger and less chaotic sibling.
Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its ﬁrst order of business
is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day’s
ﬂight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might
eventually come hunting it, the better!
The relationship between jabberwocks
and vorpal weapons is the subject
of much debate and speculation
among scholars, and the various
poems, songs, and legends about the
jabberwock do little to clarify the issue,
conﬂicting and diverging on this point.
Some believe that vorpal weapons
were ﬁrst created speciﬁcally
to combat jabberwocks, but
others take the story one step
further. They cite evidence
in certain ancient myths that
there may once have been only
a single, unique jabberwock,
so powerful that nothing
could so much as scratch
it—nothing, that is, except
for the ﬁrst vorpal sword,
crafted for that very purpose.
So epic was the resulting battle
that it created strange echoes
throughout reality, and as a result,
these echoes, in the form of vorpal
weapons, can now be found on
many worlds. Those who subscribe to this
belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today
are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock,
and they speculate that only the combined efforts of
several Eldest would be sufﬁcient to create such a
creature again.
VARIANT JABBERWOCKS
The Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the
jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or
legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.

================================================================================
PAGE 152
================================================================================

JABBERWOCKS AND DRAGONS
Although jabberwocks may fear
vorpal weapons and are ﬁlled with
rage against all mortal creatures,
few things invite a jabberwock’s
wrath more than a Material Plane
dragon. Some scholars believe that
in the same way the First World is
believed to have been a template or
“ﬁrst draft” of the Material Plane,
dragons were created in the likeness
of jabberwocks. A jabberwock
that learns of a nearby dragon will
attempt to kill it to the exclusion of
all other priorities.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level
24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a
jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World,
mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of ﬁre, and
have eyes that burn with blue ﬂames that deal cold damage instead of ﬁre damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and
slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the
normal ﬂy Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock’s whifﬂing
aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.

roll, the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if the 19 would be a failure.
Whiﬄing Ǻȓ (aura) Trigger The jabberwock Flies or makes a wing Strike; Eﬀect The
jabberwock’s wings whiﬄe, creating severe winds within a 30-foot emanation. These
winds move outward from the jabberwock, and they persist until the start of the
jabberwock’s next turn. During this time, ﬂight of any kind in the emanation requires a
successful DC 43 Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight, and creatures ﬂying toward
the jabberwock are moving through greater diﬃcult terrain. Creatures on the ground
in the emanation must succeed at a DC 43 Athletics check to approach the jabberwock.

JELLYFISH SPECIES
A large number of types of
monstrous jellyﬁsh dwell in the
world’s oceans, each with their
own unusual specialty in hunting.
The immense vampire jellyﬁsh is a
blood-drinking monster that often
attacks sailors aboard ships. Among
the largest are the dreaded whaler
jellyﬁsh, colossal creatures that feed
on whales or even krakens.
Jellyfish
Many varieties of jellyﬁsh drift through the world’s oceans, feeding on ﬁsh and
other tiny marine creatures. However, deadly species of monstrous jellyﬁsh pose a
threat to unwary swimmers and sailors alike. Note that while jellyﬁsh are animals,
they also have the mindless trait because they lack a centralized nervous system.
FIRE JELLYFISH SWARM
While individually one of these ﬁst-sized jellyﬁsh is merely a nuisance, in great
numbers, ﬁre jellyﬁsh can form into dangerous swarms. Bobbing in the water,
they create a cloud of stinging tentacles. They were named in part for their
bright coloration, but those who are stung by ﬁre jellyﬁsh learn the larger reason
for their name—the pain of their stings is comparable to being burned alive.

CRYSTAL VAULTS
Jyoti make ideal guardians for artifacts
too dangerous to be left where those
hungry for power might seize them.
Only they know what items of myth
and legend, long thought lost or
destroyed, lie within their crystal
vaults. They are unreliable guardians
of religious artifacts, however, which
usually disgust them.
Jyoti
Jyotis are sometimes called “false phoenixes” (a term they ﬁnd insulting) by the
ignorant or willful. These avian humanoids are native to the Positive Energy Plane.
They rarely leave this enigmatic realm and view visitors from other planes as stains
on the purity of their home. Jyotis particularly distrust divine spellcasters and
religious warriors, seeing them as inclined to take credit for manifesting a life force
that, from the jyotis’ perspective, is as plentiful and ubiquitous as water is to ﬁsh.
Despite their distrust of intruders, jyotis rarely attack unprovoked when their
homes are not threatened. They are intolerant, however, of those who intrude on the
palaces of crystallized light and captured ﬂame in which they dwell. They often chase
even those who come bearing gifts away; few visitors have anything they desire,
for what they desire most is to be left alone. The jyotis’ full wrath is reserved for
natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. Historically, the promise
of battle with the gargoyle-like sceaduinars, whom they consider it their duty to
oppose, has been the only thing to lure jyoti armies beyond the Positive Energy Plane.

KELPIE FOLKTALES
Some fanciful stories about kelpies
speak of them appearing in equine
form wearing riding tack, complete
with silver stirrups and bridle bit.
These folktales claim that cutting
the harness from the kelpie’s body
grants the bearer power over it, or
causes the kelpie to sicken and die.
In truth, doing so has no ill eﬀect
on a kelpie, suggesting these stories
are spread by kelpies themselves
to further trick prey into making
foolish mistakes.
Kelpie
Kelpies are malevolent amphibious fey shapechangers intent on luring mortals
to their doom. These cruel predators lurk in and around areas of water, slightly
preferring freshwater over saltwater. Kelpies lure or drag their prey underwater
then drown and devour them, leaving behind only the victim’s heart and liver—
the only parts of a meal kelpies ﬁnd unpleasant. Kelpies are fond of magically
disguising itself as ﬁne steeds or attractive strangers to draw in victims, but
its true appearance takes the form of a hideous equine with slimy, green ﬂesh
resembling aquatic plants.

Captivating Lure ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental,
primal) The kelpie instills an overwhelming attraction to itself within the mind of a
single creature within 60 feet. The target perceives the kelpie as a desirable person (if
the kelpie is in humanoid form) or a valuable steed (if the kelpie is in equine form) and
must attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to Captivating
Lure for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round and is then temporarily immune to
Captivating Lure for 24 hours.
Failure The creature is fascinated, and it must spend each of its actions to move closer to
the kelpie as expediently as possible while avoiding obvious dangers. If a captivated
creature is adjacent to the kelpie, it either attempts to mount the kelpie
(if the kelpie is in equine form) or stays still and
doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked by the
kelpie, or if it can’t breathe water and enters
an area of water, the creature is freed from
captivation at the end of the kelpie’s turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target
doesn’t consider water a danger and
will enter an area of water even if
it can’t swim or breathe water.
If it is attacked by the kelpie or
starts to drown, it can attempt
a new save at the start of its

KORRED DANCES
Despite their insular nature, korreds
love to dance. On certain auspicious
dates, korreds hold great festivals
of music and dance in ancient stone
circles deep within forest glades.
A few non-korred fey sometimes
receive invitations to these dances,
but any non-fey who interrupts the
dance is berated at best or attacked
at worst.
Korred
Korreds are reclusive fey in the form of small, hirsute individuals with long,
animated manes of hair. While korreds have a natural afﬁnity and admiration for
stones and boulders, they prefer to dwell aboveground in areas of rocky forest or
wooded hills rather than in caves. Korreds are a private people who don’t take
kindly to intruders, and they invariably work to drive off or kill any non-fey who
stumble into their territory. Staunchly proud of their hair, korreds choose their
minimal attire so as to allow their body hair to ﬂow freely, often wearing only a
belt with a pouch for throwing rocks and trimming shears—though this belt and
pouch are rarely visible under their wild manes.

to coil around an adjacent creature. The creature must attempt a DC 21
Reﬂex save. The korred cannot use Hair Snare again for 1d4 rounds.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The hair wraps around the creature. The creature takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all of its Speeds until it Escapes (DC 21) or until
the korred uses Hair Snare again (at which point the previous snare drops to
the ground, no longer animated).

creature is slowed 1 for 1 round (or stunned 1 on a critical failure).
Stone Stride ʚʖ (conjuration, earth, primal, teleportation) The korred steps into a block
of stone large enough for them to ﬁt inside and instantly teleports to any other stone
within 30 feet that has the same minimum size. Once the korred enters the stone, they
instantly know the rough locations of other suﬃciently large stones within 30 feet.
They can exit from the original stone, if they prefer. They can’t carry extradimensional
spaces with them when they Stone Stride; if the korred attempts to do so, Stone
Stride fails.

LEECH SPECIES
The spotted hooktooth leech is
often found in areas frequented
by trolls, who sometimes wear
them as awful decorations, relying
on their regeneration to control
the bleeding eﬀects. The gigantic
elephant leech feeds on immense
beasts of the swamplands or jungles,
like elephants, froghemoths, and
dinosaurs, attacking from unexpected
range. But it’s the relatively small
gutleech that provides the most fuel
for nightmares, due to its awful habit
of feeding on victims from inside.
Leech
Though valued by apothecaries and ﬁeld medics as methods to reduce swelling
or drain blood, leeches are despised by most who encounter them, regardless
of the setting.
GIANT LEECH
Capable of growing to lengths of nearly 5 feet, giant leeches have circular maws
ﬁlled with hook-like teeth. They prefer to dwell in stagnant or slow-moving
shallow water or in damp, moist undergrowth. Horses and larger animals are
their favorite prey, but they won’t balk at a chance to latch onto a human- or
halﬂing-sized meal.

BROOD LEECH SWARM
Most smaller species of leeches do not tend to swarm, but
brood leeches are prone to gathering in seething, undulant
mats of squirming gluttony. When they gather in sufﬁcient
numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech’s
feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding.
In these situations, their mild venom can affect much
larger creatures than their usual prey.

heavy objects, such as rocks or chunks of metal, either
attaching two heavy objects together to create a web
bola or fastening one to its leg to create a web war ﬂail.
Descend on a Web Ȱɵ (move) The Leng spider moves
straight down up to 120 feet, suspended by a web line. It can
hang from the web or drop oﬀ. The distance it Descends
on a Web doesn’t count when calculating falling
damage. The web can be severed by a Strike that

POTS OF GOLD
While it’s true that leprechauns
typically return items they steal,
they particularly love gold and often
hoard gold coins and treasures in
pots tucked away in hidden places.
It’s rumored that a person who ﬁnds
a gold coin in the forest and returns
it to the leprechaun who dropped it
will be granted a wish as a reward.
Unfortunately, this rumor is false—a
deception perpetrated by leprechauns
to trick others into bringing them even
more gold for their pots.
Leprechaun
Leprechauns are mostly jovial tricksters who prefer mischief over conﬂict. They
ﬁll their days with as much fun, wine, and food as possible. Mostly found in
forested regions, leprechauns respect nature and those who protect it.
Leprechauns do not attack on sight. Rather, they engage in conversation and
try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely
giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises
of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of
those they meet—a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining
for goods or favors. They aren’t above turning people against each other for their
own beneﬁt but generally not to an extent that causes harm.
In most cases, a leprechaun doesn’t keep a purloined possession for long. The
leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions,
often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement
and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun’s trick goes too far and
results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly ﬂees the conﬂict rather
than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to ﬂee from
battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for
thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their
powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a
joke into danger... or even death.

LERRITAN CAVALCADES
Every few decades, lerritans gather in
large bands to travel from one volcanic
region to another, razing every sign
of civilization they ﬁnd along the
way. Lerritan cavalcades contain
up to a dozen lerritans and their
lackeys: crimson worms, powerful ﬁre
elementals, and ﬁre giants.
Lerritan
Lerritans are unstoppable giants with skin of volcanic glass and blood of roiling
lava. These malicious arsonists would see the world burned to a cinder. They pay
homage to Ymeri, the evil elemental demigod of ﬁre, and they bully other ﬁery
creatures. When the urge to immolate grows too great to ignore, lerritans burn

on the lerritan’s back erupts and sends lava bombs raining
down in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 12d12 ﬁre damage.
Each creature in the area must attempt a DC 46 Reﬂex

LESHY COMMUNITIES
Leshys are fairly egalitarian when
interacting with their own kind.
Most communities are meritocracies,
rewarding leshys who defend their
communities and help each other
succeed, and they see working together
as the best path to a successful future.
Leshy
These intelligent plant creatures maintain complex societies in remote wildernesses
and places of primal power. By working together, leshys help to defend powerful
fey and druidic sites from interloping humanoids. They often have good relations
with local fey and druidic orders but distrust most other humanoids.
A primal spell caster, often a druid, can create a leshy by binding a nature spirit
to a carefully crafted body grown from speciﬁc vegetation. The details of these
rites vary based on the type of leshy, but all are carefully guarded secrets and tend
to take place in sacred areas associated with nature or primal magic, such as a
druid circle or dryad grove.
SUNFLOWER LESHY
Sunﬂower leshys are the ambassadors and social leaders of their kind.
Their petals radiate from their heads in various hues with a
serrated, leafy, beard-like ruff. When particularly excited, their
eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they
become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant
coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts
in coloration are echoed in sunﬂower leshy art, which
can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For
example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place
of glowing lava and ﬂickering ﬂames, drawing upon
many vibrant colors, but to a sunﬂower leshy, the only
proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays,
blacks, and whites.
The more adventurous sunﬂower leshys leave their
communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of
humanoids. When interacting with humanoids,
sunﬂower leshys are some of the most likely
to act friendly and give strangers a chance to
prove their good intentions, though they remain
cautious. They’re often accompanied by other,
more powerful leshys.

from their head in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures within
the area (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save). It gains a +2 status bonus to this damage against
dazzled creatures. The sunﬂower leshy can’t use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.
FLYTRAP LESHY
While often seen as unfriendly by non-leshys, ﬂytrap leshys get along well with other
leshys. Nonetheless, they’re among the most aggressive leshys, often guarding the
most vulnerable places in the natural world with their ﬂytrap mouths and hands.
When a large threat emerges, pairs of ﬂytrap leshys band together to create
amalgams capable of driving back powerful foes. This unusual form of communal
defense suffuses ﬂytrap leshy society, and they often form relationships between
multiple individuals that would confuse or even scandalize more uptight
humanoids—to a ﬂytrap leshy, though, there’s nothing strange about sharing your
innermost secrets with people you literally merged together with to defend your
home from an enemy.

GNOLL MASTERS
Leucrottas often associate with
gnolls. They never submit to serve
others as beasts of burden, but they
sometimes permit gnoll leaders who
impress them to ride them into battle
as steeds. More often, a leucrotta
considers itself to be the true leader
of a gnoll clan, whispering and
manipulating a gnoll warchief into
doing its bidding or (if it tires of the
game) goading them into challenging
the leucrotta for leadership and then
taking over the clan directly after
eliminating its rival.
Leucrotta
The vile and vicious offspring of a demon lord and a monstrous species of hyenas,
leucrottas are intelligent and cruel beasts. They use their astounding vocal mimicry
to lure unsuspecting creatures near so that they can ﬁrst torment and then devour
them. Leucrottas measure 5 feet at the shoulder and weigh 800 pounds, and they
are perpetually ﬁlthy. A leucrotta’s oversized jaws are lined with rows of jagged,
hardened bony ridges rather than teeth, and it can shear through ﬂesh, bone, and
even steel with ease.

within the emanation that was
deceived by Sound Mimicry must
succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become
fascinated and compelled to move toward the sound of the
leucrotta’s voice on their turn. Fascinated creatures are
also ﬂat-footed. If the leucrotta attacks, the fascinated
condition ends only for the creature that is attacked.
If the leucrotta speaks a creature’s name while
using its Luring Cry, that creature takes a –2
circumstance penalty to their saving throw to
resist the ability. On a successful save, a creature
is temporarily immune to Luring Cry for 24 hours.
Sound Mimicry Ȱɵ The leucrotta perfectly imitates
voices and speech and attempts a Deception check
against listeners’ Will DC to fool them. The leucrotta
gains a +4 bonus to this Deception check if it has
listened to the creature it’s imitating for at least
10 minutes at any point in the last 24 hours. The
leucrotta can’t duplicate voice-based abilities or
spells, though it can perfectly mimic the sound
of verbal spellcasting and can attempt to
deceive constructs or undead that respond to
voice commands. The leucrotta can’t imitate
speech in languages it doesn’t know.

LEYDROTH LEGACY
On Golarion, the ﬁrst leydroths
were created by a secret society of
Azlanti sorcerers who drew their
powers from elemental bloodlines.
These sorcerers clashed often
against various wizardly guilds who
held power throughout the various
regions of Azlant, and intended
for leydroths to serve as weapons
of terror against their foes. Today,
leydroths remain isolated on certain
particularly dangerous islands
among the remnants of the shattered
continent of Azlant, but now and
then foolish explorers seek to
transport them back to the mainland.
Leydroth
In ancient times, a cabal of primalists imbued an amalgam of beasts with both
supernatural might and a hatred of magic itself, hoping to achieve a potent
weapon for use against arcane spellcasters. Effective beyond expectation, the ﬁrst
leydroths broke free and turned on their creators. Worse, the leydroths bred true,
and these reclusive predators have long outlived their original creators.
Leydroths look like distorted, apelike felines with many-branching horns growing
from the backs of their heads. Their thickly muscled limbs end in glowing claws.

LINNORM LEGENDS
Creatures as powerful as linnorms
tend to spawn stories of their own,
accurate or not. Critical failure on
a check to Recall Knowledge on
linnorms might suggest that you
can avoid a linnorm’s death curse by
closing your eyes as you deliver the
fatal blow, or that rubbing poison
oak on yourself can ward oﬀ a
linnorm’s attention.
Linnorm
The powerful, serpentine beings known as linnorms may be distantly related
to the more well-known chromatic and metallic dragons, but their draconic
physiologies are where any such similarities end. Whereas true dragons boast
incredible intellectual capabilities and far-reaching plans, linnorms are driven
only by their insatiable hunger and desire to inﬂict cruelty on others. Linnorms
are exceptionally difﬁcult to outwit due to their strong wills, and it’s not wise
to try bargaining with them—when faced with one of these legendary beasts,
one’s best option is ﬂight, pure and simple. Failing that, a noble death is a viable
back-up plan.
Extremely powerful linnorms dwell in remote parts of the world. One such
creature is the legendary Fafnheir, the Father of All Linnorms, said to be the oldest
and mightiest linnorm of them all. Fafnheir’s death curse causes anyone who
would slay him to slowly erode away physically and mentally until they die, at
which point the cursed victim’s body fuels Fafnheir’s resurrection.
SHOAL LINNORM
Shoal linnorms occupy rocky shoreline shallows and slither
along lonely coastlines. While they do not intentionally seek
out large settlements, these linnorms nonetheless beleaguer
ﬁshers headed out from small coastal towns, and they may
even follow skiffs back to their home port to appraise the
town’s defenses and plan a raid. Shoal linnorms tend to hunt
large prey, both underwater and on land. Their preferred
quarries includes giant squid and grizzly bears—meals rich
in fat, which the linnorms metabolize into the ﬁery steam that
courses through their veins.

NEWBORN LINNORMS
Almost all linnorms lead solitary
lives; they are too reprehensible for
even their own kind to tolerate for
any length of time. Most species do
not even meet to reproduce; rather,
female linnorms usually deposit a
solitary egg in a remote location,
which a wandering male linnorm
then fertilizes and places in a nook
suitable for incubation. Newborn
linnorms range in size from that of
adult crocodiles to full-grown bulls,
and their growth is rapid. Even a
juvenile linnorm is strong enough to
wreak havoc on a small settlement—
though most don’t dare to commit
such audacious pillaging, for fear of
evoking the anger of another, larger
linnorm in the area.

or begins their turn in the area takes 6d8 ﬁre damage (DC 36 Reﬂex save negates).
During this time, the steam is so thick that it impedes movement as well as sight,
turning the area into diﬃcult terrain. All creatures in the steam become concealed,
and all creatures outside the steam become concealed to creatures within it. The shoal
linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

FJORD LINNORM
Fjord linnorms make their homes in damp caves behind ice-cold waterfalls in
the river-veined coastal reaches of the north. While they may appear graceful as
they swim up the fjords for which they’re named, they are as vile as any other of
their species and take pleasures in capsizing river boats before gobbling up their
terriﬁed crews.

FIRST WORLD CONNECTIONS
Linnorms have a deep connection to
the First World, the primordial home
of the fey. While linnorms typically
won’t think twice before devouring
a gnome or other fey, they do have
an unusual respect for wielders of
powerful primal magic. The only

to common wisdom, is to remind it
that there are forces of nature even

CAIRN LINNORM
Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes
in necropolises, burial grounds, and the sites of immense and gory battles. Some
point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a
service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any
creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb
without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the
deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a
cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won’t leave until it has secured permission
to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone’s guess; nevertheless,
reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade
even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts
or mausoleums.

Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears.
Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in

Sometimes this means of tracking isn’t enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga
linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk
in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the
water’s surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.

LIZARD LOCATIONS
Giant lizards can be found in all
temperate or tropical climates, often
in relatively close proximity to smaller
villages or rural regions where they
can be a dangerous threat to livestock
or travelers. The two lizards presented

jungles for giant chameleons, and
savannas for megalanias.

Giant lizards come in a wide variety of species, but they all tend to be voracious

GIANT CHAMELEON
Giant chameleons are legendary for their ability to change their skin color in

GREATER RITUAL GATES
Well-versed and knowledgeable lurkers
in light can lead groups of their kind in
a more advanced Ritual Gate to enable
travel to other planes, rather than
just summoning. Doing so requires
the sacriﬁce of a creature of equal or
greater size to the lurker in light who
wishes to travel the planes. Multiple
lurkers in light can travel in this way,
but this requires multiple sacriﬁces.
The creation of a greater Ritual Gate is
a 1-hour activity, at the end of which
all aﬀected lurkers in light travel to the
same plane, chosen from the Material
Plane, one of the Elemental Planes, or
the First World.
Lurker in Light
These malicious and strange fey appear as fairies about 2 feet tall, with insectile
wings, large eyes, and bulbous heads. They slaughter and cause mischief in
a pattern only their alien intellect understands, but they’ve been seen to take
particular umbrage against dwarves, gnomes, and creatures who live in darkness.
With their grudges and pursuit of their own wicked and sadistic whims, lurkers in
light deftly overturn the conventional wisdom that creatures associated with light
are benign and friendly.
While lurkers in light are fey and have ties to the First World, these creatures are
often found elsewhere in the Great Beyond. They are particularly fond of invading
the Shadow Plane to bring light to those who dwell there—not to help, but to
spread misery and pain among those to whom light is agonizing.

MANDRAGORA SUCKLINGS
Sometimes a mandragora oﬀers its
services to a spellcaster in exchange
for sustenance. Tales tell of sorcerers
or other magical creatures who keep
mandragora “familiars” whose loyalty
is sustained by feeding the little beasts
with their own blood. These tales
generally have gruesome endings
wherein the mandragora is overcome
with bloodlust and, unable to control
itself, devours its master.
Mandragora
A mandragora looks like a freshly pulled tuber that has grown into the malformed
shape of a child with a grotesque face and hideously bloated body. These insidious
little plants typically form when a mandrake root is watered with a demon’s
blood. Upon absorbing the otherworldly properties of the demon’s blood, the
root animates and is forced to seek out blood to feast from, lest it die of thirst.
Always famished and in search for sustenance, mandragoras live haunted, pained
lives and perform vile and desperate acts to acquire the blood they crave. While
they prefer magically infused blood such as that of unicorns, fey, or sorcerers, and
they can also feed off of potions, alchemical bombs, and other magical elixirs,
a mandragora can subsist on the blood of non-magical creatures. They ﬁnd the
ﬂavor of mundane blood to be bland and bitter, and they do not blanch at voicing
these complaints to the creatures from which they drink.
While the typical mandragora is the size of a human child, some of these evil
plants continue to grow and grow, reaching sizes more comparable to those of
giants. Sometimes as they grow, they form additional limbs or rudimentary faces,
eventually transforming into truly hideous mockeries of the human form.

FEY MANIPULATORS
Marrmoras exert a strange and
subtle dominance over other fey.
The fey under their control are ﬁlled
with both horror at the destruction
wrought by marrmoras and
fascination with their ﬁery power.
Marrmora
On the First World, marrmoras dwell in ruined wildlands perpetually scourged
by ﬁre and rarely, if ever, travel elsewhere. When a wildﬁre devastates a wilderness
region on the Material Plane and results in the death of other fey, marrmoras
can be drawn across the planar boundary to revel in the resulting destruction.
They seek to reignite the ﬁres that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon
the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of
dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away
from the First World. They are burdened by a capricious but persistent rage
and are unfailingly cruel. While they are capable of negotiation and intelligent
interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with
others only as a means to more efﬁciently spread their ﬁery devastation.
A marmorra’s twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark
has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands
ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken ﬂesh looks like charcoal‑burnt
wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They
trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies.
Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants
roasting in the ﬂames of their carefully curated ﬁres, there is little that
brings more pleasure to a marrmora than the sight of good-aligned plant
creatures cooking to a crisp.

INHUMAN MURDERERS
While it’s true that most mohrgs
seem to rise from the corpses of
humanoid killers, the capacity to
murder is not limited to humanoids.
Mohrgs of other sorts could certainly
exist—as long as they come from a
society that has the capacity not
only to judge and execute, but also to
harbor murder within their hearts.
Mohrg
The weight of murder wears heavy on the soul. With souls marked by a lifetime
of dealing death, these killers, whether mass murderers, bloodthirsty soldiers, or
sadistic executioners, sometimes do not let judgment and lawful execution stanch
their slaying sprees. When such individuals are brought to justice, they may rise
after death as mohrgs to continue their ruinous work.
Drawn to others of their kind, mohrgs prefer to hunt in small groups, occasionally
in partnership with weaker free-willed undead such as shadows and wights. They
seek out weak prey and revel in causing drawn-out suffering. Some mohrgs haunt
locations they favored in life, reenacting old crimes on new victims. They may even
skulk about in public, wearing rags, cloaks, or freshly harvested skins to hide their
nature. The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no
longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to
turn living towns into mass graves.
Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of
a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only
on a society’s dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg’s control, a canny
mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a
point where it feels conﬁdent unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement.
Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking
out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting,
mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are
valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.

Mohrg Spawn (occult, necromancy) A living creature slain by a mohrg
that had a lower level than the mohrg rises as a mohrg spawn after
1d4 rounds, on its turn. This mohrg spawn is under the command
of the mohrg that created it. If the creator of the mohrg spawn
is destroyed, the mohrg spawn is destroyed as well, immediately
collapsing into a pile of decayed ﬂesh and bones.

Paralysis (occult, incapacitation, necromancy) A living creature hit by a mohrg’s tongue
Strike must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The creature can
attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases
by 1 on each attempt.
MOHRG SPAWN
When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its ﬂesh decays away save
for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead
trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a
living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg’s immunities
and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack
that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack
that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the
mohrg spawn’s level (Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook 503). Mohrg spawn cannot
create mohrg spawn of their own.

DOMINION SEEDLINGS
Moonflower seeds are tough and
fibrous, capable of surviving the
fire of reentry into a planet’s
atmosphere. They are often
dropped by agents of the Dominion
of the Black in orbit above
unsuspecting worlds.
Moonflower
These enormous plants have thick, knotted trunks festooned with fanged
blossoms. A gaping mouth sits at the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most
creatures smaller than the moonﬂower whole. Moonﬂowers can move slowly on
their powerful roots or use them to attack, but usually they dig them deeply into
the surrounding ground and remain stationary to await prey.
Though moonﬂowers can’t speak in the conventional sense, they communicate
telepathically with other moonﬂowers. Explorers who encounter a single
moonﬂower can thus be assured that any other moonﬂowers in the vicinity will
be prepared for them. Those who manage to intercept a moonﬂower’s telepathic
communications are assaulted by visions of dreadful, primeval jungles ruled over
by titanic plant life. Whether this is some vision of the past or a dream
of the future shared by all moonﬂowers is unknown.
Moonﬂowers are alien life‑forms from a long-dead planet, but
their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been ensured through the
machinations of the Dominion of the Black, a sinister, alien organization from
the dark places between the stars.

creatures can attempt to Rupture the pod. The
cocooned creature takes half damage from any
damage dealt to the cocoon. Once the cocoon is
Ruptured, it deﬂates and decays.

pod prison, the pod transforms into an adult moonﬂower
with full Hit Points after 1d4 hours of growth. The
newly formed moonﬂower has its own consciousness,
but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles
the creature that died within. The dead creature’s
equipment remains inside the new moonﬂower and can
be retrieved if the moonﬂower is slain.

MORLOCK MACHINERY
Morlocks tend toward brutish actions
and violent traditions and have little
interest in bettering their societies
or creating art. However, they have
a strange obsession with ancient
machinery and magical items,
particularly clockwork constructions.
Their knack for tinkering helps
keep ancient guardians and traps
functional, even if their work
backﬁres now and then.
Morlock
Originating from humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks are brutal
monsters that dwell in the tangled tunnels of the upper reaches of the Darklands.
Their wiry frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions, and
their arms are long enough that they can drop into an uncanny, four‑limbed shufﬂe
for speed or stealth. They no longer remember the lives their ancestors led on the
surface, although many morlocks still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient
homes. Some morlocks worship the statues of humans from these bygone eras as
gods, but others now worship Lamashtu, Rovagug, or other violent deities.
Morlock young are insatiable and clamor for even the slightest morsel of food,
even consuming their siblings if no other meal presents itself. Most morlocks
encourage the practice to ensure their ancestral group as a whole grows stronger.
A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.

construct or mechanical hazard. They attempt a
Crafting check against the construct’s or

Critical Success The target gains 4d6 HP and a

the morlock can make a melee Strike against
an enemy in its reach. The morlock then can’t

MALARIA STRAINS
This pernicious disease is often
associated with mosquitoes. The
most common version of malaria
is presented on page 118 of the
Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
and while the variants inﬂicted
by mosquito swarms and giant
mosquitoes are deadlier, they don’t
have the chance to recur after
1d4 months. Pyrexic malaria also
causes weakness and fevers, while
septic malaria causes painful and
infected lesions to form on the
body. Regardless of the strain you
contract, you can’t reduce your
sickened condition while you are
aﬀected with malaria.
Mosquito
While the common mosquito is a pest capable of spreading deadly diseases, their
giant kin and the ravenous clouds of mosquito swarms are even more dangerous.
FEN MOSQUITO SWARM
When deadly fen mosquitoes gather in large numbers, they form into lethal
swarms capable of draining blood at a truly alarming rate. Fen mosquito swarms
are typically encountered only in tropical swamps or bogs, but during humid
months in spring or summer they can drift into riverine areas or even through the
waterfront reaches of settlements.

MUDWRETCH LIFESTYLES
Mudwretches are rarely encountered
alone. They inhabit swampy patches
in small groups, often gathering
near the ruins of sites that once held
great signiﬁcance. Mudwretches can
remain dormant for centuries, always
eager to lurch up to attack passersby.
They’re usually more interested
in defending territory than killing
intruders, and they won’t pursue
victims for long if they ﬂee.
Mudwretch
In its resting form, a mudwretch looks like a large puddle of thick, dark mud, heaped
at the center in a slightly drier patch of loam. When a living creature approaches,
though, the mudwretch lurches upward, piling its muddy ﬂesh upon itself to form
a roughly humanoid shape, often in vague mockery of the approaching creature’s
general form in cases where the creature is a humanoid itself.
Mudwretches possess a low level of intellect, and while they do not form societies
or cultures of their own, they are attracted to ruins or abandoned settlements. They
have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries
out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from
living creatures has to do—a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than
one that’s comfortably wallowing on a river bank.

NATURAL WARNINGS
Regions haunted by bog mummies
lack small animals, insects, and
other wildlife. A character who is
Investigating, Searching, or Scouting
during exploration mode can attempt
a secret Nature check against the
bog mummy’s Stealth DC to notice
something sinister. A critical success
is enough to speciﬁcally suggest the
presence of undead in the area.
Mummy, Bog
The cultural practice of mummifying the dead is not the only way a body can
become preserved, nor is it the only route that gives rise to these disease-spreading
undead monstrosities.
Bog mummies (also called peat mummies or mire mummies) rarely, if ever,
leave their marshy realms. Less powerful than their more notorious artiﬁcially
preserved kin, bog mummies are preserved not by agents introduced during rituals
but by the natural elements present in the airless, acidic morass of a peat bog or
muddy swamp. While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from
the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed
inﬂuence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething
need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unﬁnished at the time of
death—often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of
this emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife
beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body
was disposed of does the rest.
Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulﬁll their
dark yearnings with general violence. Filled with wrath and hatred for the
living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into
their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes,
driving away most natural life dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to
the potential danger that lies beneath the surface.

LUNAR NAGA ADDICTION
Some people enjoy the eﬀects
of lunar naga venom and have
developed ways to enhance the
euphoric qualities through alchemical
reﬁnement. While some merchants
pay nagas for their venom, most hire
hunters to capture and enslave the
creatures. As a result, nagas despise
any humanoid who sells or buys their
venom for any reason. Reﬁned lunar
naga venom is identical in price and
eﬀect to dreamtime tea (Pathﬁnder
Gamemastery Guide 121).
Naga
Nagas are identiﬁable by their serpentine bodies and strange, humanlike heads.
All nagas have magical abilities and great intelligence, which they combine to
advance their own agendas.
LUNAR NAGA
Lunar nagas are skilled diviners and astrologers whose dark scales and white hair
sparkle with motes of light that mimic the night skies to which they are forever
drawn. While they are less physically imposing than other nagas, they possess a
graceful beauty that many ﬁnd entrancing, even without the help of the naga’s
inherent magical abilities. Earning a lunar naga’s trust is difﬁcult, but not impossible,
especially for someone who shares the creature’s interest in the celestial sphere.
As they have no hands, lunar nagas use mage hand to manipulate delicate
instruments and ﬁne telescopes to observe the night sky. They track the positions
of celestial bodies, recording their discoveries in esoteric journals. At their best,
lunar nagas are wise and mysterious beings who seek to expand their knowledge of
the cosmos. At their worst, after too much exposure to the unfathomable entities
that dwell in the darkness between the stars, they become dark prophets who drive
others to commit terrible deeds in the name of abominable masters.
On Golarion, the lunar nagas of the nation of Nagajor use their abilities to
serve many communities as soothsayers. A few have founded observatories in
which they and their followers explore the night sky. Some nagas even use their
knowledge of the stars as navigators on ships or overland caravans. In the broader
world, where people do not give nagas deference as nearly divine rulers, lunar
nagas try to avoid contact with outsiders or use their magical powers of disguise
to hide their true forms from all but their most worthy allies.

drop whatever items they are carrying as well). The lunar
naga can Sustain a Spell on Hypnosis. If the naga moves, aﬀected creatures are
compelled to remain within 30 feet of the naga and must spend each of its actions
moving closer to the naga as expediently as possible on its next turn. If a creature
is unable to end its turn within 30 feet of the naga, the eﬀect ends for that creature.

SPIRIT NAGA COVENS
Like hags, spirit nagas occasionally
form small groups of their own kind.
They normally do this for mutual
protection against a greater threat
or to accomplish a goal that a single
spirit naga cannot complete on their
own. Sometimes, spirit nagas form
a coven to bring groups of cultists
together or take over a city or other
large community, and in rare cases a
spirit naga might even join a hag or
witch coven.
Lunar Naga Venom (poison, sleep) Saving Throw DC 24; Maximum Duration 6 rounds;
Stage 1 stupeﬁed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 as stage 1 (1 round); Stage 3 stupeﬁed 2 (1 round);
Stage 4 unconscious (1 round). Once a creature falls unconscious from lunar naga
venom, they remain asleep for 1d8 hours unless woken.
SPIRIT NAGA
In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place
similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives
of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they
can beneﬁt from the spirit naga’s powers without paying a heavy price—for most
who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.
Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and
corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards,
crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may
know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to
the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth
and stones there.
Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit
nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences.
They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are
revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of
“civilized” society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship
of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They
often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and
rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread
the nagas’ foul inﬂuence throughout a community.

OTHER NECROPHIDIUSES
Ultimately, a necrophidius’s abilities
are the result of its creators’
designs. Some have diﬀerent
immunities or have bites that deal
poison, cold, or negative damage
instead of inﬂicting paralysis. There
are even rumors of soulbound
necrophidiuses whose creators
arranged for the soul of the skull’s
donor to empower the construct.
These necrophidiuses are not only
sentient but also have the facility to
reason and even cast spells.
Necrophidius
Although the necrophidius is a mindless construct with no particular ability to
comprehend the complexities of good or evil, these sinister-looking constructs are
often crafted by evil or macabre creators seeking to imbue their guardians with a
frightening aesthetic.
Constructed from bones harvested from serpents and humans, a necrophidius
is animated by occult magic, not unlife. Each necrophidius is built from the
skeleton of a large snake, but its skull has been replaced by that of a humanoid
creature. Some death cults or particularly cruel crafters seek out the skulls of
speciﬁc individuals against whom they bear grudges to provide the head for their
necrophidius. The ﬁnal step of the construction is the alteration of the teeth and
jaws to give the creature a more serpentine visage, complete with fangs.
If a necrophidius’s creator dies, the construct follows the last series of commands
it was given. If it cannot do so, the necrophidius aimlessly wanders the area near
where it last served its creator and attacks any creatures it encounters. Some believe
that those who know the secrets of a necrophidius’s origins can command it,
provided its original creator no longer exists and no one else currently commands
it. There are also a number of reports concerning strangely aware and intelligent
necrophidiuses that roam with a purpose and track down or hunt speciﬁc living
creatures they interpret as the targets of former assassination missions.

DENEBRUM
Most neothelids on Golarion reside in
the Vault of Derebrum, deep within
the Darklands. Here, in a vast cavern
of fetid pools of stinking swamps
and surreal forests of poisonous
fungi, neothelid hives nestle among
twisted spires of hardened resin that
look as horriﬁc as the monstrous
worms themselves. Tended by armies
of worm-like minions who worship
them as gods, they endlessly plot,
scheme, and wage war.
Neothelid
This gigantic, mauve worm has a hooked mouth with multiple circular bands of
teeth and four barbed tongues. A wielder of terrible occult powers and a vast alien
intellect, the neothelid serves the ageless horrors that dwell in strange dimensions
beyond known reality—the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos.
Neothelids pass down these mysteries to the eerie wormlike creatures they spawn
and create in preparation for a future where the worms below shall rule—a time

NEREID SHAWLS
A nereid’s shawl has Hardness 1
and 4 Hit Points (BT 2). If the shawl
is broken, it no longer grants the
amphibious trait. If it’s destroyed, it
melts away into water, and the nereid
who created it becomes doomed 1
and drained 1. These conditions
values increase by 1 every 2d6 hours
thereafter until it creates a new shawl.
Nereid
Nereids are aquatic fey with deep ties to water. They share some similarities with
naiads, but they are not guardians and do not bind themselves to a speciﬁc body
of water. Although they are primarily aquatic creatures, their unique ability to
imbue their vitality into a supernatural shawl allows them to travel on land as
well. A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life
essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid.
Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat,
but when forced to ﬁght, their ability to transform the natural waters in their ﬂesh
into poison serves them as well as any weapon.
Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of
“aquatic tempters,” regardless of the fey’s type or gender, using these creatures’
names interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful ﬁgure who exists to
lure mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and
often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can
cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas
are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids
loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the
beauty of the natural world in peace.
When a nereid learns of a rusalka’s increased activity, it often seeks
out the rusalka to route them—not so much out of an urge to protect
humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to
prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from
humanoids who can’t be bothered to note the difference between a
murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.

a creature and causes water from its own body to ﬂow into the creature’s lungs. If
the creature cannot breathe water, it must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude save.
Success The creature is unaﬀected and is temporarily immune to Drowning Touch for
24 hours.
Failure The creature becomes sickened 3 as it chokes on the water.
Critical Failure The creature chokes on the water and runs out of air. It falls unconscious
and starts drowning (Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook 478). If the creature is above water, it
recovers from drowning as soon as it succeeds at a saving throw against suﬀocation.
Manifest Shawl ̂ˬ (conjuration, primal) The nereid divests themself of part of their
connection to the First World and imbues this essence into a ﬂowing shawl that enables
them to function on land. The nereid can Dismiss this eﬀect as long as they are touching
the shawl. As long as the shawl exists, the nereid gains the amphibious trait. A nonnereid who carries the shawl also gains the amphibious trait. If a
nereid’s shawl is destroyed rather than Dismissed, the nereid can’t
Manifest a Shawl for 24 hours.

BOG NIXIES
Nixies who dwell in swampy regions
tend to have fouler attitudes and
are more eager to turn to violence.
Known as bog nixies, these evil fey
prefer dwelling in festering swamps
or blighted fens and delight in using
their ability to grant desires to tempt
visitors into acts of unplanned evil.
Nixie
These aquatic fey often guard ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs, protecting their
bucolic homes from the advances of predators and careless humanoids alike.
Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids,
hoping trespassers won’t give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted
by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive
fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon.
On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better,
a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing
openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid.
Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them
ﬁrst; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing
story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more
signiﬁcant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the
source of pollution near their home.
Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer
solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conﬂicts before they can escalate
to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm
individuals and, when they can establish magical inﬂuence, encourage intruders to
leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them
from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers.
Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or
help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is
underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe
water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are
given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most
trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.
Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes,
catﬁsh-like whiskers, and webbed ﬁngers and toes. They have scaly skin,
pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small
communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great
enough. In many cultures’ folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden
at the bottom of particularly large lakes.

the request or desire of a non-fey creature. The
creature whose desire is granted can never

NORN TRIUMVIRATES
Norns who visit the Material Plane
often do so in groups of three
known as triumvirates. The norns
of a triumvirate can communicate
with each other telepathically over
a planetary distance. Regardless of
their appearance on the First World,
when a norn becomes part of a
triumvirate on the Material Plane,
her apparent age shifts so that in
each group, there always appears to
be one young adult norn, one middleaged norn, and one elderly norn—a
Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch.
Norn
Ancient beyond imagining, norns are powerful fey women who hold in their
hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread.
They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a
vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.
Norns’ relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among
norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the
ﬁrst norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies:
a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads
of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in
her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic
commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are
powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power,
and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns ﬁnd the other Eldest
even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the
Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave
to meddle with fate as much as they desire.
While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unafﬁliated norn with
ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are
spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They
know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious
demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns’ interference. And so the balance of
power remains tenuous between unafﬁliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for
eons. However, norns know that it’s merely a matter of time before the Eldest
lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite
norns’ best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.
A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
WORSHIPPING NORNS
On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others,
especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who
uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to
discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support
such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a speciﬁc norn or norn
triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same beneﬁts regardless
of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears
cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the
aging process.
FOLLOWERS OF FATE (LN)

LOST NORNS
When separated from a triumvirate
for too long, a norn on the Material
Plane can grow confused and weak.
Her powers remain strong, but her
ability to interpret fate becomes
skewed and warped. Lost norns
begin to use their abilities for their
own goals rather than serving fate.
A lost norn’s alignment slowly
shifts from lawful neutral to
either lawful evil or lawful good,
depending on how she interprets
her visions.

Fated When a creature is subject to a fortune eﬀect from a norn and a
misfortune eﬀect from any source other than a norn (or vice versa), the
norn’s eﬀect automatically counteracts the other eﬀect and then takes
place normally, rather than the two eﬀects canceling
each other out. If both the fortune and misfortune
eﬀect are from a norn, then the two cancel each
other out as normal. At the GM’s discretion,
powerful entities related to fate or luck, like
Desna, Magdh, or Pharasma, count as a norn for
the purpose of this ability.
Sever Fate (necromancy, occult) When a norn deals
negative damage with a Strike, she regains 10 Hit
Points. The target must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude
save or become drained 1 (drained 2 on a critical failure).
Further negative damage dealt by the norn increases
the drained condition value by 1 on a failed save (or by 2
on a critical failure), to a maximum of drained 4.
Shift Fate Ǻȓ (divination, occult) Trigger A creature within 120
feet attempts a saving throw; Eﬀect The creature rolls the
saving throw twice, and then the norn decides which
result applies. If the norn chooses the lower roll, this is
a misfortune eﬀect; if she chooses the higher roll, it’s
a fortune eﬀect; if they’re the same, she decides
which trait to apply.
Snip Thread ʚʖ (death, manipulate, necromancy,
occult) Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect The
norn produces a golden thread linked to the fate
of a creature within 100 feet of her, then snips
it short with her shears. The target takes 100
negative damage (DC 42 basic Fortitude save). If
the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points from this
damage, the thread is completely severed and the
creature dies immediately. A creature slain by Snip
Thread can’t be restored to life except by miracle, wish,
or similarly powerful magic; or by divine intervention. Regardless of the outcome
of their saving throw, a creature targeted by Snip Thread then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours. The norn can’t use Snip Thread again for 1d4 rounds.

UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS
Nuckelavees are equally delighted to
murder and feed upon both hapless
peasants and altruistic naturalists
engaged in the process of cleaning
up pollution. Indeed, those who
would seek to purify such sites
are often regarded as the greater
threat by a nuckelavee, as without a
befouled land to dwell in, the foul fey
would wither away.
Nuckelavee
When pollution despoils a natural waterway, it draws the dreaded nuckelavee to
it from the First World. This spirit of wrath is a grisly sight to behold: a horselike
monstrosity with the gnarled upper body of a humanoid growing directly from its
back. Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen
hybrid form, as though it survived its own ﬂaying.
When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction
across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the
cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those
who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn’t
discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

OCTOPUS SPECIES
The octopuses presented here
are smaller versions of the much
larger giant octopus, but other
species exist as well. The brightly
colored seaﬁre octopus occupies
a predatory niche somewhere
between the reef octopus and giant
octopus—its bite injects a venom
that causes a painful rash and
nausea. The immense grisly octopus
is among the largest of its kind. It
can swallow humans whole and can
squirt particularly sticky crimson
ink to incapacitate prey.

ONI ORIGINS
The ﬁrst oni originated in the nation
of Minkai on the continent of Tian Xia.
Whether due to prevalent local kami—
particularly in the mist-shrouded
Forest of Spirits—or its peoples’ faiths,
Minkai is a hotbed of oni activity.
Oni
Not all divine creations are meant to live as mortals. Some spirits are created as
guardians instead, tasked as protectors of elements of nature that cannot protect
themselves. When these spirits accept their divine place in the metacosmos and take
on such charges, they become kami. But some of these spirits are willful, obstinate,
or simply rotten, railing against such demands from the gods and becoming bodiless
and unable to interact with the world they can torturously still observe. Others
receive such punishment simply for failing at their duty, and their despair at their
condition twists them like those that began with a seed of darkness. When these
spirits look upon mortal lives and become overcome with envy of the ﬂesh and
pleasure that humanoids can revel in, they form surrogate bodies of their own and
become monsters known collectively as oni.
When an oni manifests, they always do so in a form that parodies a speciﬁc
humanoid ancestry closely associated with the oni’s obsessions and envies.
Giants’ over-the-top personalities and sizes are likely the reason why these
humanoids are the most common incarnations chosen by oni; such oni
are known collectively as yai oni. Yet there exist oni
associated with almost every kind of humanoid.
Most oni are capable of supernaturally disguising
themselves as their associated humanoid type and use
this ability to inﬁltrate societies and seize control
from within. Once established, oni typically reveal
their true form and revel in dominating those they
view as lesser beings ﬁt only to serve their whims.
Oni are nothing if not vain. They typically
choose comely or striking appearances in their
humanoid disguises—forms that are completely
at odds with the ugliness of their true natures. An
oni’s true form is indicative of their innermost
desires and always has features such as oversized
teeth that verge into tusks, sharp claws, unusually
bright skin colors, or a third eye in the forehead. Oni
have desires as varied as those of any being, though
by their nature these desires are almost always for
hedonistic or destructive experiences of the ﬂesh,
typically food, pleasure, or violence.
ONIDOSHI
Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with
the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi’s
supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect
are enough to awe and cow entire families of
rank-and-ﬁle ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are
often found at the head of ogre war parties or
orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind
the scenes. It’s rare for onidoshi to lead solitary
existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the
countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils
for themselves.

ONI SHAPECHANGERS
Oni humanoid forms are limited to one
speciﬁc appearance. An ogre mage can
assume only one speciﬁc ogre form,
while an ice yai can appear only as
one speciﬁc frost giant. Some oni have
greater control over their shapeshifting
power and can assume the form of any
humanoid creature, and these oni tend
to be the most dangerous.

ICE YAI
Ice yai combine the brutality of frost giants with the grace of martial artists. More
than any other oni, ice yai delight not in the pleasures of the ﬂesh, but in ﬂesh
itself—rather than indulging in oft-destructive mortal vices like drink or lust, ice
yai pursue physical perfection, reveling in the process of turning their bodies into
powerful ﬁghting machines.

OTHER ONI
Diﬀerent oni exist for nearly every
humanoid ancestry. Kuwa oni mask
their golden skin and four-ﬁngered
claws in human form, while ja oni
hide as hobgoblins. Other yai include
wind yai (who take their form from
cloud giants) and the immensely
powerful void yai (who form from
other yai and ascend to rule over
rune giants).
FIRE YAI
Fire yai take the form of ﬁre giants. Like ﬁre giants, ﬁre yai are shrewd and
militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage
in battle to conquer and control others, ﬁre yai also love the thrill of war, ﬁghting
for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a ﬁre yai with a true challenge in combat can
potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai’s

ONI DAIMYO
Oni daimyo are quasi-deities with
isolated mortal domains. The most
powerful is Inma, the Empress of the
World, but Akuma the Horned King,
Murona the Dark Mother, and Nataka
the Red King are also worshipped.
WATER YAI
Among the most powerful yai are those who emulate the form of storm giants.
Rather than lord over their giant-kin like most oni, though, water yai prefer to
lurk alone in the world’s oceans (or, much more rarely, large and remote freshwater lakes). When a water yai must interact with mortals beneath the waves, they
prefer to do so while disguised as a storm giant. Water yai pursue the acquisition
of material wealth and riches above all other interests, garbing themselves in
richly colored, magically waterproofed kimonos and adorning their monstrous
faces with all manner of jewelry. These yai can infuse their kimonos with eerie
magical properties, and in combat, they can also ﬁre bolts of electricity from their
third eye.

AMOEBAS LARGE AND SMALL
Giant amoebas and amoeba swarms
are usually found near each other,
as the two oozes are part of the
same life cycle. When a giant
amoeba grows large enough, it can
spontaneously split apart into two
separate amoeba swarms, and when
an amoeba swarm feeds enough,
its individual components can fuse
together into a single creature.
Ooze
Due to their bizarre physical structures and ability to break down and feed on a
wide variety of materials, oozes are able to adapt to nearly any climate, especially
when assisted by magical or alchemical tinkering. As a result, explorers frequently
encounter new and terrifying varieties of these amorphous creatures.
AMOEBA SWARM

held together by acrid-smelling slime. As ravenous as they are mindless, amoeba

GIANT AMOEBA
These blobs of nearly transparent protoplasm are identical in form and behavior
to the microscopic creatures from which they have evolved, except their
outlandish size makes them all the more dangerous. Unlike slimes, puddings, and
other deadly oozes, giant amoebas have an outer membrane that contains their
internal structures, making them more susceptible to slashing weapons than their
amorphous kin. However, this membrane is also extremely ﬂexible and permeable,
allowing them to surround prey and absorb it, suffocating and slowly digesting it
in the amoeba’s acidic ﬂuids.

SLIME MOLD FUNGI
The particularly foul environments
in which slime molds dwell are
conducive to the growth of extremely
potent and dangerous mushrooms
and other fungi. A dead slime mold

to produce a few doses of deathcap
powder or other types of poison.
Some creatures, such as deros or
those with inherent immunity to
disease, cultivate slime molds in order
to harvest these materials.

Weak Acid As amoeba swarm.
SLIME MOLD
A slime mold appears as a mound of earth and detritus covered in a thick
layer of fungus that exudes a faint stink of decay. The fungus actually shares
a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive
system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains
perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with
disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with
a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horriﬁc disease that painfully breaks
down a victim’s ﬂesh. At ﬁrst, the disease manifests as painful rashes and
agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the ﬂesh of the affected creature
actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature’s spores continue
to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open
and release a brand new slime mold.

GRAY OOZE
These dangerous oozes are the bane of any who travel through swamps, marshes,
or damp caves. Easily masquerading as pools of clear water or
patches of wet stone, gray oozes lie in wait for unwary victims
to reach down for a drink or step into what
appears to be a puddle, then lash out
with whiplike pseudopods to ensnare
and consume their hapless prey.

GRAY OOZE ADAPTABILITY
Gray oozes have shown the astounding
ability to overcome environmental
challenges by changing their qualities.
For example, some gray oozes have
adapted to fully aquatic environments,
replacing their movement with a swim
speed and gaining a paralytic poison
similar to that of gelatinous cubes.
Other gray oozes have become charged
with psychic energy, gaining the ability
to cause nearby creatures to become
confused, fascinated, or frightened for

Verdurous oozes are found in temperate forests, warm jungles, or other places
where plant life grows in abundance. Unlike many types of oozes, verdurous oozes
are not particularly good climbers and have been known to get trapped in natural or
artiﬁcial chasms. Warlords and wizards sometimes make use of that fact and keep
verdurous oozes as guardians in pits around the walls of their fortresses or towers.

unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, it
automatically pushes creatures and objects out of the way to ﬁll a

VERDUROUS CONGREGATION
When verdurous oozes gather in
suﬃcient number, they can merge
together into conjoined forms.
These enlarged blobs develop red
and white connecting vessels that
pulse hideously as thick, green ﬂuid
moves within them. While conjoined,
the oozes move as one creature.
Their usual enliven foliage and
sleep gas auras double in size, and
they become even more aggressive,
feeding voraciously on any metal or
ﬂesh they can ﬁnd.
Constrict Ȱɵ 2d6 bludgeoning plus 1d6 acid, DC 24
Sleep Gas ʚʖ (incapacitation, mental, poison, sleep) The verdurous ooze adjusts its aura
of supernatural vapors to aﬀect living creatures within a 20-foot emanation, forcing
them to attempt a DC 24 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and becomes temporarily immune to Sleep
Gas for 24 hours.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes
up automatically.
Critical Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious after 1 hour, it
wakes up automatically.
Verdurous Ooze Acid A verdurous ooze’s acid damages only metal and ﬂesh—not bone,
stone, or other materials.
CARNIVOROUS BLOB
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the
stars, born across the galaxy in inert form until they fall like meteorites onto
unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant
for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When
a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it
lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming
every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until
it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at
which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping
food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way
to defeat it. The blob’s ability to split into smaller
oozes that might stay hidden after a ﬁght means it can
be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.

PELUDA PATRONS
Occasionally a particularly cunning
band of humanoids—typically
lizardfolk or orcs—ﬁnds a way to
assuage a local peluda’s temper
and then elevate the dragon to the
status of a local liege, patron, or even
object of worship. Although peludas
rarely have any actual aﬀection
for such servants, they revel in
the submission of these weaker
creatures and the gifts of gold and
food they bring.
Peluda
Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely
forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch
of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential
rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed
footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses
on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt,
roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and
killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.
Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves,
especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or
breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more
impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try
anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry,
which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and ﬁre breath.

PERYTON FLOCKS
On rare occasions, a peryton ﬂock
forms at the lead of an alpha female. It
lasts until the alpha makes a mistake
that erodes her perceived power. Then
the rest of the ﬂock tears her apart.
Peryton
The peryton is an amalgam of horror, merging the features of a stag, wolf, and
hawk. They love using shadows to stalk their victims before ripping out their stillbeating hearts and relishing the dying pulse as they swallow them whole, so the
doomed victims spends their last moments watching as their ﬂesh is consumed.
Despite perytons’ animalistic appearance and brutal behavior, they are viciously
cunning and as intelligent as humans. Their preferred tactic is to ﬁnd a lone
traveler and stalk it from on high. Most perytons are loners who loathe all other
creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult
males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else.
Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have
collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to
secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating
ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally
abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched
perytons must fend for themselves from the moment
they emerge.
A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky
overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree
where they can observe nearby lands. Although they
aren’t particularly interested in wealth, perytons do
like to collect small objects from their victims. During
those times between hunts, they sometimes study these
trophies in order to relive the memories of victims’ last
moments and the taste of victims’ hearts.

rips out the heart of an adjacent corpse with their jaws.

witnesses this event must succeed at a DC 21 Will
save or become frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on
a critical failure).
Mimic Shadow Ȱɵ (necromancy, occult, shadow)
Requirements The target must be casting a
shadow; Eﬀect The peryton Flies, going no
higher than 20 feet over the target creature. The target creature must succeed
at a DC 21 Will save or the peryton’s shadow changes to match that cast by the
target creature. With their shadow so transformed, the peryton gains a +2 status
bonus to attack and damage rolls against that creature. In addition, each time
the peryton successfully Strikes that creature, the creature must succeed at a DC
21 Will save or become frightened 1, or increase its frightened condition by 1 if
it’s already frightened. This is an emotion and fear eﬀect. The shadow remains
transformed for 1 hour or until the peryton Mimics a Shadow again, whichever
comes ﬁrst.

OTHER PETITIONERS
Each plane (save the Negative
Energy Plane) has its own category
of petitioner, but not every plane or
demiplane present in the Pathﬁnder
setting is listed here. Certainly,
planes of your own design aren’t
represented! You can use the wide
range of petitioner types and
descriptions here as templates or
inspiration for creating new types
of petitioners: each needs a name,
appearance, alignment, language,
additional ability, and attack.
For instance, Desna maintains a
demiplane called Cynosure that
straddles the Material Plane and
Elysium. Petitioners on Cynosure are
known as the chosen dreamers, and
they appear as idealized and softly
glowing versions of their mortal
selves; they are chaotic good, speak
Celestial, are immune to confusion
and stupeﬁed, and deal bludgeoning
damage with their ﬁsts.
Petitioner
When a mortal dies, their soul travels to the Boneyard in the Outer Planes where
they are judged by Pharasma, the goddess of the dead. Once they have been judged,
their soul is sent on to their ﬁnal reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the
process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants
the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical
forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner’s memories from their life are
typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments
akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner’s size, power, or
nature in life, they’re a Medium creature in their afterlife.
Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily
eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes
themselves can further change the petitioner’s nature by transforming them
into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane’s
physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of
supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or ﬁend. Should a petitioner die,
their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back
to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the
true end of a soul’s journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart
of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the
creation of entirely new souls.

GENIEKIN PARENTAGE
Planar scions from the elemental
planes are known as geniekin because
they are overwhelmingly born from
couplings between mortals and
genies: ifrits are born of efreet, oreads
of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of
djinn, and undines of marids. Despite
this distinguished ancestry, geniekin
do not display most of their parents’
exceptional talents, such as their
ability to grant wishes.
Planar Scion, Geniekin
Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of genies,
causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though
the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments,
geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any
alignment. More information on genies can be found on page 162 of the Bestiary.
IFRIT
Ifrits’ blood blazes with elemental ﬁre. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who
serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those
born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to ﬂee it live
lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.
Ifrits are fond of ﬁre, but this doesn’t mean they all
embrace ﬁre’s destructive nature. Those who seek
more productive roles in a society ﬁnd inspiration in
the way ﬂames ﬂit and dance, and they pride themselves
in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of
Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit ﬁre dancers, both in
appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits
have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.
But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and
callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of ﬁre.
Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical
teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown
or conﬂagration lit.

EXTRAPLANAR HUMANOIDS
An important distinction exists
between planar scions and extraplanar
humanoids, such as fetchlings.
Fetchlings and other extraplanar
humanoids represent true ancestral
groups with their own physical and
cultural identities and traditions.
Planar scions are members of diverse
ancestries who share a similar
inheritance from extraplanar beings
and, with exception of marids, typically
integrate into other humanoid societies
instead of building their own.
with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and
ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to
each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural
splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they
are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random
direction, departing with only their hope that they’ll discover whatever mystery
lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads ﬁnd that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in
such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also ﬁnd time
to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a speciﬁc portion of a fortiﬁcation or a remote
location on a wilderness trail.

SULI
Because their genie forebears are native to the Material
Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large
the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are
often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring
harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.
Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other
geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful
pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or
humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that
bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffedup ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution
easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis’ boasts not
only glorify themselves, but also secure their
companions’ and families’ accomplishments
in history, with the ultimate goal of
spinning stories that will be retold for
generations. This is especially true
for sulis who have lived with other
geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a
strong connection to an Elemental Plane.
Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek

SYLPH
Born with elemental gales coursing through their breath, sylphs are wispy planar
scions whose bodies seem caught in a perpetual, gentle breeze. Born of unions
between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but
they are prone to ﬂights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.
Sylphs are notorious for their practice of “listening to the wind,” which
most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means
much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to
them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs
may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others,
most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying
connected to the world around them while still keeping it
comfortably at arm’s length. Certainly the typical sylph
sneak doesn’t seek to use what they learn for ill, but
instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized
or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.

OTHER PLANAR SCIONS
Two other planar scions are the
entropy-infused ganzi and their polar
opposites, the orderly aphorites,
scions of chaos and law respectively.
Eﬀect A swift gale whips up between the sylph sneak and the source of the ranged
attack, giving the sneak a +3 status bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the
attack misses, the wind deﬂected it. The wind can’t deﬂect unusually large or heavy
ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts).
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ starknife +9 (agile, deadly d6, ﬁnesse, versatile S), Damage 1d4+4
Ranged Ȱɵ starknife +9 (agile, deadly d6, thrown 30 feet, versatile S), Damage 1d4+1
Sneak Attack The sylph sneak’s Strikes deal 1d6 extra precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
Surprise Attacker On the ﬁrst round of combat, creatures that haven’t acted yet
are ﬂat-footed to the sylph sneak.
Wind’s Guidance When the sylph sneak attacks with a thrown weapon, the range
increment increases by 10 feet.
UNDINE
Undines are infused with elemental water—the churning power of the
briny deep ﬂows through them. These planar scions are often athletic and
lithe, but they are easily distracted by auditory sensations because of how
much louder and clearer sound rings above the waves.
Undines are perhaps the most settled of all geniekin, often forming
communities along the coast or even on the water itself. In the latter
case, they prefer to settle in ship-towns that sometimes number
dozens of vessels in all shapes and sizes.
The undines who ﬁll these communities
are similarly diverse, bringing aspects
of multiple cultures together to
form one whole. Ship-towns are
permanent, but ﬂuid—they grow,
recede, and migrate constantly as undine families add
their ships to or remove them from the ﬂotilla. An
undine town like this may remain at sea for years, its
residents coming ashore only on rare occasions
to collect wood for cookﬁres or to repair their
homes. The paradoxically ever-shifting permanence
of these communities reﬂects the undine virtues of adaptability and
freedom, while also maintaining the prime importance of the community.
Undine hydromancers are quite valued on these ﬂoating settlements, if only
for their ability to create fresh drinking water while adrift on the sea.

VANDALS OF CHAOS
Those who seek secret knowledge
beyond their means to purchase can
bargain with akizendris to provide
them with rare tomes in exchange
for delivering the immersed akizendri
into a library via another book. From
there, the akizendri can vandalize
books to its heart’s content without
being detected.
Protean
Proteans are manifestations of chaos made ﬂesh, natives of the Maelstrom that
embody the primeval potency of entropy in their serpentine forms. They follow
a loose, confusing, and ever-shifting caste system and form choruses based on
malleable and evanescent shared philosophies.
WARPWAVES
Many proteans can use the forces of chaos to distort reality in their foes’ minds,
creating mental ripples called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw
and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the
speciﬁc effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect
lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave
effect already affecting a creature.

Stupeﬁed 2 (3 on a critical failure)
AKIZENDRI
Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and
altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions
and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with
elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows
into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.
Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing
insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages.
Libraries in such places as Heaven, Axis, and Hell are especially keen to avoid
such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every
akizendri in existence.

Entropy Sense (divination, divine, prediction) An akizendri can anticipate the most
likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of
chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the akizendri the ability to sense
creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of nondetection or
that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via
entropy sense.

Protean Anatomy (divine, transmutation) An akizendri’s vital organs shift and
change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the akizendri takes
acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that
damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage
of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type),
whichever comes first.

MOCK CHORUSES
Azuretzis form mock choruses in
emulation of their more powerful
kindred, aping the shifting
philosophies of proper choruses. While
mischievous or outright malevolent
to hostile or lawful creatures,
they interact amiably with chaotic
creatures, who run the risk of being
promptly followed–willingly or not–by
a serpentine gaggle of self-appointed
understudies.
The akizendri is immune to polymorph eﬀects unless it is a willing target. If blinded
or deafened, the akizendri automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new
sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet, swim 25 feet; freedom of movement

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The akizendri takes
on the appearance of any Small or smaller creature. This doesn’t change its Speed or
its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type
its Strikes deal.
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+3 bludgeoning, DC 20
Garbled Thoughts (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A creature hit by the akizendri’s
bite Strike must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is also confused for 1 round.
Text Immersion (divine, transmutation) When the akizendri casts
secret page, it can physically immerse itself in the text, changing
the message of the text in the process. It can exit the book
at any point by Dismissing secret page, at which point it
appears in a space adjacent to the text. If it does so to
begin combat, it rolls a Deception check for initiative. As
long as it remains immersed in the text, the akizendri
has no body. It can communicate telepathically with
a creature as long as the creature touches the book
or scroll that contains the secret page. It can sense
nearby creatures using its entropy sense, but not in any
other way, nor can it use any attack, manipulate, or
move actions or speak aloud. If the object it is
immersed in is destroyed, the akizendri reappears
in an adjacent square and is stunned 1.
AZURETZI
Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures
with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant
blue scales with mottled purple and pink
highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic
approximation of leering, laughing faces.
The Maelstrom’s chaotic forces spawn
these small proteans from a variety of
sources: physical mating between older
azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion
of bestial naunets, and possibly from
mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may
just be confusing putative mortal memories
with experiences gained from games of
mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by
any rational, self-consistent rules.
Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos,
particularly in the form of mockery and
parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting
a target’s features into a laughingstock.

Critical Success The azuretzi chooses
one spell of up to 3rd level
that the target creature has
available to cast. The azuretzi
gains that spell as a mock
divine innate spell, and it
can cast that spell once as an
innate divine spell using its own

PSYCHOPOMP TRAITORS
Some psychopomps view their task
of sorting souls as ultimately hollow
and meaningless, since the multiverse
itself must one day end. Eons ago,
these rebels shirked their duties
and ﬂed to the empty corners of
the planes, becoming a new type of
evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils
feed on mortal fears, particularly
fears of death, and enjoy tormenting
those who must die. Psychopomps
generally leave these malcontents
alone, except when sahkils interfere
with the proper ﬂow of souls.
Psychopomp
Many psychopomps are intimately involved with the Boneyard’s massive
bureaucracy. Few pursue mercy, justice, or personal gain; their duties to Pharasma
and her Boneyard are supreme. Nevertheless, individual psychopomps interpret
their duties in different ways, which might put them in conﬂict with mortals or even
with each other.
ESOBOK
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of
the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around
their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with
those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their
business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when snifﬁng out
threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they’re among the least
intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats.
The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won’t do so twice.

must attempt a DC 20 Will save. Creatures without souls (such as most constructs)
and creatures whose bodies and souls are one (such as most celestials, ﬁends, and
monitors) that roll a failure or critical failure on the save get a success instead.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The target is stunned 1.
Failure The esobok wrenches the target’s soul from its body
into its jaws. Mindless undead creatures of level 2 or lower are
destroyed, other undead creatures are stunned for 1 round, and all
other creatures are paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a creature
paralyzed by this eﬀect can attempt a new save to end the eﬀect. The
paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws Strike or speaks.

PSYCHOPOMP FOES
Psychopomps’ greatest enemies are
creatures that devour or steal souls,
such as astradaemons and night
hags. Their other opponents include
necromancers, proteans, and those
who have unnaturally extended their
lifespan, such as liches.
CATRINA
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these
souls, helping to convince them of the ﬁnality of their fate to ease a spirit’s passing.
Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can’t accept their death. They
perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion
for a mortal’s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help
an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright ﬂowers and colorful dresses,
giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most
catrinas present as feminine, masculine catrinas still dress in bright colors and
carry garlands of ﬂowers.

VANTH SCYTHES
Vanths’ favored weapon is the scythe,
a choice that even further adds to
their fearsome appearance and can
lead to unfortunate associations with
the Grim Reaper or Urgathoa among
more superstitious mortals. Vanths
ﬁnd such comparisons to be ignorant
at best or insulting at worst. Some
vanths infuse their scythes with
diﬀerent qualities, such as cold iron
or silver, depending on the nature of
their most common enemies.
VANTH
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as
vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask
resembling a vulture’s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to ﬁght against those who
would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to
the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war,
vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any

PSYCHOPOMP COURTS
Psychopomps rarely oppose
celestials or ﬁends. In fact, they
frequently host such creatures in
the Boneyard, particularly in the
sprawling psychopomp courts where
these outsiders petition for one
soul or another to be remanded to
their jurisdiction. Complicated cases
are judged by yamarajes, while the
thorniest or most politically delicate
are handed by Pharasma herself.
YAMARAJ
The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose
wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma
herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an
emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the
senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly
individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in
their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.

QLIPPOTH AND DEMONS
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons
and still see themselves as its rightful
rulers. When the Abyss ﬁrst began to
spawn demons from the souls of sinful
humanoids, the realm was plunged
into a brutal war spanning untold
millennia, in which qlippoth, though
more powerful and established, were
slowly but surely driven back by the
endless demonic hordes who spawned
far more quickly than qlippoth could
ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth
have been driven to the deepest,
darkest corners of the Abyss where
they cling tightly to the crumbling
remains of their territory.
Qlippoth
Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in
the Abyss, qlippoth ruled the Outer Rifts. These inimical creatures are a form of
primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well.
Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through
the Abyss, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest reaches of the Abyss, and
they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet rather than directly oppose
demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless
war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might
be turned back.
CYTHNIGOT
The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of
small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the
ﬂeshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything
else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot’s most identifying feature is
the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature’s body, ending in a
surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.

becomes aﬄicted by fast-growing spores that swiftly grow
into twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hairlike
ﬁbers. These growths erupt from the bite wound and writhe
and wrap around the creature’s limbs. Plant creatures take
a –2 circumstance penalty to save against tangle spores; Saving

QLIPPOTH AND MORTALS
As qlippoth lost territory to their
demonic rivals, they realized that the
only way to stem the tide of demonic
forces was to starve them of the
sinful souls that the Abyss uses to
spawn new demons. While qlippoth
have no concept of how they
might go about preventing sin by
changing the way mortals act, they
do understand that exterminating
mortal life would solve the problem
as well.
SHOGGTI
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims,
bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no
doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lampreylike mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its
forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

NYOGOTH
Little more than a coiled mass of intestines
encircling a massive gaping maw, this
qlippoth is an Abyssal scavenger, subsisting on
the ﬁlth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth
alike, although it relishes any opportunity to
consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role
in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid
beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure
its next meal.

QLIPPOTH REALMS
Although it is widely accepted
that qlippoth have lost incalculable
territory in the Abyss to demonkind,
these ﬁends still control vast regions
in the deepest reaches of that plane.
Some sages suggest the troubling
possibility that perhaps qlippoth still
hold more territory of the Abyss than
demons do, but because demons are
more concerned with mortal life, we
simply interact with the layers they
control more often. For all we know,
these dour sages postulate, the
Abyss teems with endless swarms of
qlippoth that have yet to make their
move against mortal life.

OTHER QLIPPOTH
The qlippoth presented here are but
a small fraction of the squirming
awfulness that lurks in the deeper
rifts of the Abyss. Other types of
qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like
gongorinans, which use living
creatures as incubators; shapeshifting
utukku, which inﬁltrate and undermine
religions; death-spawned behimirons,
which slay the living to reproduce;
and the living siege engines known as
catabolignes. Yet most frightening of
all is the immense iathavos, a monster
so abhorrent that even the Abyss
cannot bear to allow more than one to
exist at any one time.
Aura of Order’s Ruin (aura, necromancy, occult) 30 feet. A lawful or good creature that

drain back into one of the chernobue’s mouths. The poisoned creature takes 7d6

more powerful qlippoth. Scholars

QUICKLING PRANKS
Quicklings consider cruelty to
be the pinnacle of pranking. As
a relatively minor example, a
quickling may spend an entire day
constantly moving food out of reach
of a starving man. More commonly,
however, a quickling prefers to cause
pain and injury directly, such as by
suddenly replacing a dinner fork with
a red-hot knife as it’s picked up, or
slashing the legs of a traveler moving
through tall grass.
Quickling
Few creatures can match a quickling’s speed. These malicious fey creatures delight in
striking with blinding speed and accuracy, racing in to stab and slash at foes before
scampering away for cover with maddening­—even frightening—swiftness. Stories
of people simply doubling over, bleeding from what appear to be spontaneously
opening wounds, are often eyewitness accounts of quickling attacks.
Quicklings actively hate the “slow-paced dullards” they encounter every day,
delighting in inﬂicting suffering and pain on creatures they deem too sluggish to
matter. While they are related to kinder fey such as brownies and pixies, quicklings
care only for their own merriment. They see their own cruel pranks as the height of
humor and have full conﬁdence that their speed and invisibility will keep them safe
from harm. They occasionally form gangs of up to a dozen individuals, although
the group usually devolves very quickly into mayhem, as they inevitably perform
increasingly deadly pranks against each other.

Supernatural Speed The quickling’s speed, combined with nearly instantaneous
acceleration and deceleration, enables them to move in astonishing ways. As
long as they have a ﬁrm surface to travel across, they can Stride their full
movement vertically or horizontally. They can even run across unstable
surfaces, such as water, in the same way,
although dangerous surfaces (acid, lava,
etc.) harm them as normal. They must
end their movement on a horizontal surface

COASTAL HUNTERS
Quoppopaks prefer to hunt at dawn
and dusk, prowling seashores and
estuaries for fresh meat. While they
could easily live oﬀ of the minerals
and tiny organisms they ﬁlter from
the water sucked through their
ventral tubes, they delight in killing
living creatures. Despite their cruel
natures, quoppopaks don’t mind
hunting alongside others of their
kind if it means they’ll be able to
create even more carnage.
Quoppopak
Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses,
and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of
an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in
a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey’s mouth and is capable of intaking
ﬂuids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land,
they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the
ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through
their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through
their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can’t expel ﬂuids, it
still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but
they are located inside the creatures’ abdomens, allowing them to draw their
air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can
hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to
humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters’ water reserves
quickly deplete.

ANCIENT INTELLECTS
Each radiant warden’s animating
force consists of raw positive
energy fused to the soul of a
willing sacriﬁce—usually an
astronomer or scholar near the
end of their natural life. Focused
now on protecting a site from any
intrusion­—including by curious
archaeologists or adventurers—a
radiant warden might pause before
an attack if approached peacefully.
Unfortunately, these constructs are
prone to speaking in vague riddles
or complex mathematical diatribes
that can be as confusing as they are
intriguing; often, discussions break
down as frustration mounts on
either side (or both).
Radiant Warden
The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of
years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien
aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians
expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space
have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets,
planes, or dimensions.
Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their
bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on
their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.

warden releases a 50-foot cone of bright energy
that deals 10d12 force damage (DC 38 basic

Radiant Blast for 1d4 rounds.
Radiant Blow When a creature is hit by the

RAVEN TRADERS
Given enough time to develop the
relationship and establish what you
want, it is possible to engage a raven
in a sort of trade. Placing a small,
shiny object where the raven can take
it might entice it to grab the prize and
ﬂy oﬀ, returning 3d6 minutes later
with something from its own stash.
Convincing a raven to trade requires
a DC 20 Nature check to Command
an Animal and, of course, a raven who
has the inclination to trade with you
in the ﬁrst place.
Raven
Few birds are as cunning and social as the raven.
RAVEN
These omnivorous birds are cunning and opportunistic scavengers. Capable of
solving simple puzzles in order to retrieve desired items, ravens gather at the
periphery of civilization, raiding it as needed when they are not hunting in the
wilds. Whether singularly, in pairs, or as a ﬂock, ravens live off scraps as often
as they do carrion or prey. They are also unusually social among their own
kind, even alerting other ravens to large carcasses with loud, croaking cries; it is
rumored that this extends between ﬂocks as well.

manipulated by supernatural forces or simple desperation born from hunger,
an unkindness of ravens can be a surprisingly dangerous foe.

persistent in the natural world as an angry unkindness of
ravens. A raven swarm can hound its prey through most
barriers. Simple latches, unsecured chimney ﬂues, loosely
shuttered windows, and similar obstacles rarely keep an
unkindness away. A raven swarm attempts a Thievery check to bypass
many of these simple obstructions, typically against DC 20.
Swarming Beaks Ȱɵ The ravens’ angry pecking deals 1d8 piercing
damage to each enemy in the swarm’s space (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). A creature that critically fails its save is blinded
for 1d4 rounds as the ravens focus their attacks on the target’s
vulnerable face.

RAVENER LAIRS
Cunning and paranoid, raveners
prefer to make their lairs in places
hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so
high that living creatures struggle to
breathe the rareﬁed air, submerged
beneath pools of magma in the
caldera of an active volcano, and so
on. Some raveners even go so far
as to deliberately ﬁll their entire
lair with lethally poisonous gases,
and raveners that are capable of
advanced spellcasting often seal
their lairs completely, accessing
them exclusively by spells such as
teleport or gaseous form. Of course,
raveners must feed on the living to
persist, so they never locate their
lairs so far from sources of life that
they’ll starve.
Ravener
Though their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually
perish. While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some
manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all
living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures,
some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly,
and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger
when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may ﬁnd some dragons,
but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue
a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can
transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.
A ravener’s ﬂesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only
their skeleton. What they lose in ﬂesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending
power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their
skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing ﬂight with now-skeletal wings. This new
existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the
ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane
metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners
are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they
strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a
time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their
power and become a ravener husk (page 224).
CREATING A RAVENER
Any evil dragon of at least level 13 can become a ravener, although it is exceedingly
rare for a dragon younger than an ancient true dragon (such as a chromatic, primal,
or metallic dragon) to do so. Typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called
ravenous reanimation, but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener
has the aid of a powerful patron. In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention
of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without
the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major
impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. If
you don’t have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps.
Increase the dragon’s level by 2 and change their statistics as follows.
• They gain the undead trait and the Necril language.
• Increase their AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 2.
• They gain weakness to good damage and more HP (see below).
• The ravener’s melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their
damaging Breath Weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage.

RAVENEr ABILITIES
A ravener gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Soulsense A ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within
the listed range. Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like
celestials and ﬁends, appear brighter to this sense.
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Cowering Fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A ravener’s frightful presence causes
creatures to cower in fear as well. As long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or
more as a result of the ravener’s frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear.
Soul Ward An intangible ﬁeld of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total
destruction. A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level

================================================================================
PAGE 224
================================================================================

RAVENER MINIONS
Raveners view most undead
creatures with little more respect
than they have for living creatures,
but they often make use of them as
servants. They prefer incorporeal
undead such as ghosts, specters, and
wraiths over such crude and simple
minions as skeletons and zombies.
RAVENER SPELLCASTERS
Instead of gaining the vicious
criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster
gains additional spellcasting
prowess. When creating your own
ravener spellcaster, give it the
spellcasting ability of a spellcaster
roughly 2 levels higher than a normal
spellcasting dragon of its kind. This
typically means that if the original
dragon had two spells prepared of
its highest level, you should add one
more spell of that level and then
two spells of the next highest level,
while if it had three spells prepared
of its highest level, you would add
three spells of the next highest
level (if applicable, add only a single
10th‑level spell). Either way, increase
its cantrip level by 1.
If the ravener is unusually young,
you might be able to use spells from
the relevant spellcasting dragon
sidebar, but for a typical ancient
dragon, consider the following spells
to ﬁll in the new slots, depending on
which level of spells you need.
• 10th wish
• 9th power word kill, telepathic
demand, weird
• 8th disappearance, maze, mind
blank
• 7th contingency, energy aegis,
spell turning
21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in
excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If
this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed.
A soul ward’s Hit Points can be restored only via speciﬁc ravener abilities such as
Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a
week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves,
and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed. If the ravener’s soul
ward loses all its Hit Points while the ravener still has more than 1 HP, they become a
ravener husk (page 224).
Consume Soul Ȳ˓ (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger A living creature within 30 feet of
the ravener dies; Eﬀect The ravener tears the creature’s soul from its body with their
maw and gulps it down. The dying creature must attempt a Fortitude save with the
same DC as the ravener’s Breath Weapon.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The ravener tears oﬀ a small chunk of the creature’s soul. If the victim is restored
to life, they are drained 1 in addition to any other side eﬀects of returning to life. The
ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level.
Failure As success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. The creature is drained 3 and the
ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level.
Critical Failure As failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. The victim can’t
be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level eﬀect such
as miracle or wish, and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward
equal to twice the creature’s level.
Discorporate Ȳ˓ (divine, necromancy) Trigger The ravener takes excess damage to their
soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; Eﬀect The ravener
draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order
to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes,
reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where
they used Discorporate.
Ravenous Breath A ravener’s Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips
life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener’s
Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature
is drained by the ravener’s Breath Weapon, the ravener’s soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.
Vicious Criticals The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20,
as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a
critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or
gain the drained 1 condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than
0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever
the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.

RARE
EVIL
NECROMANCY
Cast 1 day; Cost valuable treasures from the target dragon’s hoard worth a total value

Requirements You must be an evil dragon.
You destroy the gathered treasures with your breath weapon or other powerful magic,
then invoke necromantic energies before you feed upon the charred and melted remains.
As you do so, negative energy courses through your ﬂesh, automatically killing you.
Each individual ravener’s ravenous reanimation requires three to ﬁve unique additional
components. Whether or not you return as a ravener depends on the success of the ritual.
Critical Success You immediately transform into a ravener upon ﬁnishing the ritual; your
soul ward starts at full Hit Points (equal to 5 × your level).
Success You rise as a ravener 24 hours after completing the ritual, as long as your body
remains relatively intact. When you rise as a ravener, your soul ward starts at 1 Hit Point.
Failure You rise as a ravener husk 24 hours after completing the ritual.
Critical Failure You die.

of the spell or magical ﬁre, control is transferred to the ravener, and this action counts
as the ravener having Sustained the Spell with the action (if applicable). The ravener
can choose to end the spell instead of taking control, if they choose.
Ravenous Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, evocation, ﬁre) The ravener breathes a blast of
ﬂame that deals 20d6 ﬁre damage plus 4d6 persistent negative damage (DC 44 basic
Reﬂex save). A creature that fails its save is also drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical
failure). If a creature is drained by the ravener’s Ravenous Breath Weapon, the ravener’s

OTHER RAYS
Stingrays and manta rays are among
the most common species of these
ﬁsh, but others dwell in more remote
areas. The dangerous blood ray is
an ambush predator that dwells in
murky swamp waters and drains
creature’s blood after paralyzing them
with its sting, while the immense
leviathan ray is a deep-ocean predator
that has a deadly mouth capable of
swallowing small ships whole.
Ray
Rays are an unusual type of ﬁsh with wide, sail-like ﬁns and long tails, giving them
an almost kite-like shape as they swim gracefully through the water. All rays have
a rudimentary form of electrolocation, allowing them to detect the faint electrical
charges that emanate naturally from nearby living creatures, a sense akin to scent
in its accuracy.
STINGRAY
Found in salt or fresh water, stingrays are normally passive creatures, but when
threatened or cornered, they lash out with their tails to lance foes with their
toxic stingers. Stingrays often bury themselves in mud, sand, or sea grass, and
unfortunately for those wading in shallow waters, stepping on an unseen stingray
is a sureﬁre way to receive a painful sting.

found in temperate or tropical oceans,
and they generally stay in the upper reaches
or at the surface of deeper waters. These rays are
ﬁlter feeders that subsist on plankton. They can also
eat larger ﬁsh or aquatic creatures as the need arises, but
rarely attack anything Small or larger. Many underwater
cultures, particularly aquatic elves, raise and farm manta
rays to serve as messengers, beasts of burden, or even pets.

EXCEPTIONS TO EVIL
While most undead are evil, revenants
are not—these unusual stalkers rise
not out of a sense of cruelty or hatred
of the living, but spontaneously from
the need for vengeance following
a deep betrayal. One can avoid a
revenant’s wrath by simply getting
out of its way—unless you happen to
be its reason for unlife!
Revenant
Revenants are obsessed, undead stalkers who arise from their own murders and
are driven by only one thing: revenge against their killers. The common wisdom
is that revenants arise only from individuals who have been utterly betrayed or
abandoned to die a grueling death, but even then such victims might not rise
from their graves. In other cases, revenants might even rise from what might
legitimately be considered an accident if the revenant doesn’t understand the full
circumstances of their demise. In such cases, it doesn’t matter that the “murderer”
may not have intended to kill, for revenants understands no pity and can never
forgive. Revenants have little memory of their lives other than anything they
might need to recall in order to achieve their goal of vengeance.

their self-loathing and does everything they can to destroy it until the end of

RHINOCEROS HORNS
While some species have only a
single horn, many rhinos, including
woolly rhinos, have a second,
smaller horn on their brow directly
behind the larger one. Despite their
appearance and durability, rhino
horns aren’t bone or ivory, but rather
are composed of the same substance
as hooves and toenails. A rhino’s
horn continues to grow as it ages,
enabling a rhino to slowly regrow
a broken horn. While some value
rhino horns as trophies, the horns
themselves have no intrinsic value.
Rhinoceros
This hefty animal is easily recognizable by the distinctive upward-thrusting horn
on its snout. Rhinoceroses are herbivorous and, in spite of their hulking size, can
run at considerable speed. While rhinos have good hearing and a keen sense of
smell, their eyesight is relatively poor.
RHINOCEROS
Rhinoceroses are short‑tempered, territorial, and easily startled, and these traits
combined with their innate ferocity means their natural instinct when disturbed
is to attack. When intruders disturb or surprise rhinoceroses, the animals
respond by charging directly at the interlopers and then lashing out with their
mighty horns.

BLUE WEEK
Those living in areas where rusalkas
dwell know well to avoid the water
during the week-long period in
early Sarenith when the fey become
particularly active, a time known in
many regions as Blue Week. Most
villages prohibit swimming and
ﬁshing during this time, though the
prohibition is diﬃcult to enforce, as it
takes place during the height of good
weather. Particularly superstitious
folk take care to lock their doors
both from within and without.
Rusalka
These androgynous, river-dwelling fey delight in manipulating the emotions of
those unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp, using humiliation to break
their victims’ wills. Rusalkas enjoy keeping their broken toys nearby, both for
continuing entertainment and to aid in the rusalkas’ defense, as the shame their
captives feel often drives them to become obsessively loyal to these fey.

Call again on subsequent rounds, the duration extends by 1 round for
all aﬀected creatures. Once a creature succeeds at any save against
Beckoning Call, that creature is temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated and must spend each of its actions to
move closer to the rusalka, avoiding obvious dangers. If a beckoned
creature is adjacent to the rusalka, it stays still and doesn’t act. If
attacked by the rusalka, the creature is freed from captivation at the
end of the rusalka’s turn.

OTHER DEVILS
For over a decade, the legend of
the Sandpoint Devil has persisted
in western Varisia. Most hold that
it’s the fantasy of simple folk and
booze-ﬁlled bellies, but locals insist
it exists. Other creatures akin to
the Sandpoint Devil might exist
elsewhere in the world, with slight
variations on their innate spells and
the nature of their Accursed Breath.
Sandpoint Devil
While some creatures have been fused to create a new entity that’s graceful and
beautiful, the Sandpoint Devil is the opposite. It has the hooves and body of a
powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid
gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs
and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature’s back bears a draconic
tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.
The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists
gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children,
with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.

can be heard for miles. Each creature within a 100-foot emanation

ODDS AND ENDS
Scarecrows hold a certain liminal space
that is inhabitable by spirit creatures.
Ghosts in particular can use their
malevolent possession on a scarecrow
as if it were a living creature, using
them as vehicles to escape their sitebound nature and so further spread
their murder and mayhem.
Scarecrow
A ramshackle collection of materials in a human shape, the scarecrow construct
is indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow until it slowly creaks to life. As it
animates, its carved pumpkin or sackcloth face bursts into eldritch ﬂame, sending
fear creeping into the air around it. Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in
its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination
of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar
materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments. This rudimentary construction
makes a scarecrow somewhat fragile, prone to snapping limbs in the crush of
battle. Yet its structure is adaptable, allowing it to reshape another piece of itself
into a clawed limb or grip a severed portion of itself to swat at its foes.
When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator’s
blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny
sliver of the creator’s soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than
enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to
follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog. When
a scarecrow is destroyed, the blood leaks back out from its eyes, but the portion
of the creator’s soul never returns.

ability on the ﬁrst round of combat, any creature that has not acted yet is
startled and becomes ﬂat-footed against the scarecrow for 1 round. It can

Clawing Fear The scarecrow’s strikes deal an additional 1d6 mental damage to frightened

SCEADUINAR CRYSTALS
Sceaduinar congregate on the great
crystalline knots of negative energy
that accrete in the Negative Energy
Plane. Sceaduinar prod treelike crystal
growths to produce dangerous items
akin to spheres of annihilation or
great structures that echo with eerie
chimes. Sceaduinar also stimulate
these aggregations of crystals to yield
other sceaduinar and similar hateful
creatures of unlife.
Sceaduinar
Strange creatures born from jagged crystals in the heart of the Negative Energy
Plane, sceaduinar are fueled by its negative energy and driven to extinguish all
life. Resembling crystalline gargoyles with serrated limbs and sharp, bat-like faces,
sceaduinar stand about 7 feet tall and weigh around 100 pounds.
These malevolent beings sometimes gather in great packs of their own kind.
Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part,
though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar
sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of
life that ﬁnd their way into that deadly realm—even the twisted sparks found in
undead creatures.
When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in
great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the
Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for
extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a
plane where negative energy isn’t the rule doesn’t improve these creatures’
attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent
when encountered in such realms.

THE DESERT RIDER
Those rescued from death in the

same dying vision: a strange,
silver‑eyed woman whose scarlet
silk tents stand on the back of a
colossal black scorpion, riding out
of a shattered city and leading an

Millennium‑old paintings on the

this red‑robed woman is unknown.
Scorpion
Scorpions are frightening enough at their normal diminutive size, but when they
grow to reach or surpass the size of a human, they become absolutely terrifying.
CAVE SCORPION
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of
their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of
the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack
humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure
scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.

out by necromancers, as it is a vital
component in creating particularly
potent necromantic wands and
staves. A single scythe tree typically
yields about 150 gp worth of viable
scythewood for such endeavors.
Scythe Tree
Malevolent, vicious, and cruel, scythe trees pose as normal trees near deep forest
paths, where they wait to slaughter passersby. Instead of drawing sustenance
from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the ﬂesh, blood, and bone of
sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted
gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The
screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an
extra dimension of ﬂavor to the meal.
Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean
that they don’t need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once
food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When
a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its
bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow
into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on
to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.
Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted
branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have darkbrown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown
leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees’ disturbing mouths
remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on
the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices
are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when
discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally
ﬁnd to be insufferable and worthy of little more than
being hacked to pieces.

THE HEADLESS KING
Ydersius was defeated by an Azlanti
heroine named Savith in the era
before Earthfall, and now the so-called
Headless King’s body prowls aimlessly
in the Darklands. That the decapitated
god’s clerics still gain power from
worship points to Ydersius’s tenacity
and continued existence, after a
fashion. Those who seek to recover
his skull and return it to his body
hope that doing so will restore both
him and the sekmin civilization to
their full power.
Serpentfolk
Before their ancient clash with humanity devastated their civilization, serpentfolk
were masters of a sprawling underground empire. Few serpentfolk survive
today; their power is shattered, their god Ydersius decapitated (although not
quite slain). The cunning, intelligence, and magical abilities of serpentfolk have
diminished from their ancient heights, and most are born without these boons.
Those serpentfolk who retain their ancestry’s legacy of intelligence and magic
are known as zyss, and they look down upon their more numerous kindred with
a mix of disdain and shame. They see these offshoots as a curse on their kind,
resulting from their god’s decapitation and the pandemonium during the fall
of their underground empire, and have dubbed them aapoph, meaning “chaos
made ﬂesh.”
Today, the central realm of the Darklands retains the old name of the serpentfolk
empire that once dominated this region—Sekamina. This name is also the source
of the serpentfolk’s Aklo title, sekmin, which they are often called in ancient texts.
Sekamina itself retains very little of the serpentfolk’s legacy, its mantle of rule
having passed on to others like drow, ghouls, gugs, and deep gnomes. Yet in remote
reaches of this dangerous realm, the ruins of serpentfolk cities still stand. Within,
a great many serpentfolk sleep in torpor in secluded vaults, with only a few
cells awake to enact their schemes. In addition, a small number of serpentfolk
settlements dot Golarion’s surface, most of them in humid, remote jungles,
far-ﬂung islands, or caverns close to the surface. It’s rare for such a settlement
to number more than a few dozen serpentfolk. They rely primarily on slaves
to build their power bases, to defend them, and to perform essentially all the
practical functions of their society. This includes providing food, crafting goods,
and tending to the serpentfolk’s every need.
Zyss serpentfolk are megalomaniacal geniuses with dreams of returning
to their place of dominance, though modern serpentfolk have few means of
accomplishing this goal. Many of their plans hinge on resurrecting Ydersius,
their decapitated god. His headless body still thrashes about, mindless, in the
Darklands, waiting to be reunited with his lost skull. Serpentfolk numbers are
so small that reclaiming their dominance seems a distant dream, especially
since their reproduction is slow. Though a parent can birth a dozen young
at once, the gestation period lasts up to a decade, and the likelihood that
even one will be zyss is low. There’s no telling whether a child will be zyss
or aapoph, regardless of parentage. A coveted zyss child is just as likely
to arise from aapoph parents as from two zyss, and every serpentfolk
colony has someone in charge of sorting the young, identifying the
earliest signs of intelligence in them.
Though the number of zyss is small in serpentfolk colonies,
bringing in more zyss isn’t necessarily desirable. A serpentfolk
conclave with just a few zyss is functional, but one with a large
number becomes fractious. Cults and societies form, all pursuing their own
passions and politics, with scheming and backstabbing running rampant.
A powerful priest may be able to bring other zyss to heel, but many zyss
question why a priest should be in charge if their god is dead. Zyss thrive
on selﬁsh desires for hedonistic pleasure and adulation. They feel no love
for others, even their offspring. Thriving on decadence, they crave receiving
expensive gifts, gorging themselves on massive meals, and pursing arts such
as music, poetry, or sculpture. Even more academic hobbies, like the study
of magic or warfare, take an artistic bent, like carefully designing colorful
illusions or memorizing epic poems about renowned wars. Each zyss
believes themself to have more reﬁned tastes than their peers.

state, he might as well be. Reduced to a feral, animalistic

COIL SPY
Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve their
innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as members
of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of
their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more
efﬁciently inﬁltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme
step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in
methods of inﬁltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be
capable of inﬁltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they’re
expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people,
most Coil spies also ﬁnd personal pursuits to keep them occupied in
the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it’s rarely due to a lack
of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they
pursue their hedonistic desires.

SHOCKER LIZARD TRAPS
Kobolds are particularly fond of using
shocker lizards in their trap designs,
although such traps rarely keep the
shocker lizards’ safety and comfort in
mind, forcing these cruel but creative
kobolds to constantly replace the
permanently restrained lizards they’ve
set up to defend their lairs.
Shocker Lizard
These brightly colored reptiles share the rough size and pack mentality of guard
dogs, roaming in small groups. Shocker lizards have specialized glands under their
scales that accumulate static electricity, and they can unleash blasts of lightning
strong enough to harm signiﬁcantly larger foes. Though they’re meek and docile
when encountered alone, shocker lizards are signiﬁcantly more aggressive in
packs, when they can amplify each other’s electrical attacks.
Shocker lizards are notoriously difﬁcult to domesticate because they’re
dangerously hostile as part of a pack, but will also swiftly wither and die if kept
alone in captivity without constant attention. A shocker lizard is 3 feet long and
weighs 25 pounds.

SKAVELING INTELLECT
As a curious side eﬀect of its
creation, a skaveling absorbs many
of the memories and thoughts of the
ghoul brains it was fed. While it was
merely an oversized animal in life,
in undeath these memories coalesce
into a strange form of intelligence
that aﬀords the skaveling the ability
to speak and reason, all the better to
serve its urdefhan masters.
Skaveling
Hideous necromantic rituals give rise to skavelings, or ghoul bats, monstrosities that
are not true ghouls but instead are speciﬁcally crafted undead creatures. Their creators
are the bloodsucking urdefhans of the Darklands, who create skavelings from giant
bats specially raised on diets of toxic fungus and the ﬂesh of ghouls—especially
brains harvested from these undead. Upon reaching maturity, these giant bats are
ritually slain via the use of cytillesh oil (Core Rulebook 551). While this poison
simply rots away the ﬂesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats
will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.
Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of
ﬂight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back—urdefhans often use
skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that
of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere
mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can
reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them,
and they never take actions in a ﬁght that would knowingly put their masters in
harm’s way.

SKRIK NETTLE HARVESTING
Skrik nettle venom is magical in
nature and deteriorates swiftly. A
character with alchemist’s tools can
harvest a single dose of skrik nettle
venom from a skrik nettle that has
been dead no longer than an hour
with a successful DC 24 Crafting
check, which transforms the ﬂuid
into a standard potion of ﬂying.
Skrik Nettle
The expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarrelooking creatures that resemble large jellyﬁshes. A fringe of brightly colored
feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in
a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above
the First World in ﬂocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the
fey realm’s cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack
their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to ﬂoat
helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their
helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the
poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.
Skrik nettles that ﬁnd their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the
First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies
that they ﬁnd comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent.
The ﬁrst few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend
to be ﬁlled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby
creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are
somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming
the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and
does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who ﬁnd themselves
marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and
they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.

creature can move normally but still increases its altitude as
appropriate from the venom. A creature that can’t ﬂy falls as

violence means the creatures often
accumulate a fair amount of valuable
coin and items. They prefer ﬁne
weapons above all else and jealously
protect such ﬁnds. Since clothing
inhibits their natural camouﬂage,
skulks either store this treasure in
a secure location or carry it in such
a way that their bodies block what
they are carrying from sight.
Skulk
The cowardly and lazy skulks live on the fringes of organized societies and steal
from others without a second thought. Even murder is merely another necessity,
and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and
taking what they want.
Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks
difﬁcult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of
large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically
travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger
than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see
themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a
strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared
purpose for very long.
Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around
sewers and the like, are skulks’ favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow
them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording
them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare
occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves’
guild and become sought after for difﬁcult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and
overwhelming selﬁshness, however, usually means they are unable to secure longlasting leadership roles.
A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human.
Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent
end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of
violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who
remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles
as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for
eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one
band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after
throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to
the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate
attempt to track down such an exile.

SLUGS OF WAR
Subterranean cultures like
urdefhans and xulgaths sometimes
turn giant slugs into war beasts.
The creatures’ primitive minds make
them easy to control for anyone
who knows a few simple tactics—
mostly ways of keeping them
well-fed until just before battle and
methods of guiding them in the
right direction as they rampage.
Slug
These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through
swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat ﬂesh
or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare
entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they ﬁrst
shred the creatures using their radula—tongue-like appendages covered in teeth—
to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully
acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip
that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near
swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many
almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each
giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into
proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated,
and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these
eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.
Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry
weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides
of bridges, or even fortiﬁcations like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break.
Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but
instead ﬁnds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant
slugs don’t have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in
particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily
compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable,
so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.

EATING HABITS
Snakes of all sorts eat their meals
by devouring their prey whole. After
incapacitating a creature, a snake
unhinges its jaw and consumes the
creature entirely, even if it’s more
than twice the diameter of the
snake’s body. A snake can consume
a creature of the same size as itself
or smaller, but most snakes are logy
and sluggish while the meal digests.
Snake
Snakes of some variety thrive in every non-arctic ecosystem, each with their own
particular hunting patterns and defense mechanisms.
SEA SNAKE
These lithe snakes like to frequent the shallow waters of tropical seas. Their 4-footlong, blue-green bodies easily blend into the water where they lurk to ambush prey.

SOLIFUGID BURROWS
Most species of solifugid lay their
eggs in burrows. The female doesn’t
eat while guarding her eggs, and
thus ﬁghts even more aggressively
against any creatures she deems
potential threats to her brood. The
bodies of wayward adventurers often
litter such burrows, though this does
little to deter other fortune-hunters
from trying their luck in such
treasure-laden nests.
Solifugid
These monstrous vermin have six legs and two large feeding appendages easily
mistaken for an additional pair of legs. They are often called camel spiders,
sun spiders, or wind scorpions, despite the fact that they are neither spiders

Soul on a creature is slain within 100 feet of that
creature’s corpse and the creature has been dead no

the stupeﬁed value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. This condition
value decreases by 1 each time the creature gets a full night’s rest. As long as the
creature is stupeﬁed by a soul eater, rest does not decrease any doomed

SPECTRAL THRALLS
Specters often keep a few humanoid
thralls to torment, preventing the
agony of pain starvation, but since
they can’t minimize the negative
damage they inﬂict with their vile
touch, humanoid thralls who are too
low level generally don’t last long.
Specter
When an evil mortal creature dies, it sometimes returns to haunt the area of its
death as a specter, a hateful remnant, always seeking to slay others—particularly
humanoids—in an attempt to distribute its pain among as many souls as it can. A
specter maintains a strange semblance of its prior identity, but with a corrupted
sense of purpose. It cannot be reasoned with.
A specter denied the opportunity to harm living humanoids grows increasingly
agonized and irrational, akin to the mindset of a starving person forever denied a
release from agony through death.

spectral corruption for 1 minute.
Success The creature is stupeﬁed 2 for 1 hour.
Failure The creature succumbs to the corruption and becomes a spectral
thrall. The creature is controlled by the specter, obeying the specter’s
telepathic or spoken orders, though a spectral thrall does not obey
obviously self-destructive orders. It can attempt a new Will save at
the end of each of its turns; on a success, it is no longer controlled
by the specter but becomes stupeﬁed 2 for 1 hour.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature remains a thrall to the

SPIRAL CENTURION GLITCHES
A spiral centurion might have one of
the following glitches.
Dulled Blades: Its blade Strike deals
only 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage.
 Misaligned Gears: It loses Rev Up,
and if it Strides more than once per
round, it takes 1d10 damage.
 Stuck in a Rut: It uses the same
actions each round, regardless of
the circumstances.
Spiral Centurion
These mechanical constructs were created to serve as guardians in an ancient
and bygone era, although exactly who made them and the secrets of their
construction have long since been lost to history. From the waist up, they
resemble humanoids made of metal, but from the waist down their bodies
take the form of spinning metal tops ringed with blades, which excel at cutting
down nearby foes. Most spiral centurions can be directed to stand down with a
password, although often these command phrases have been lost to the mists of
time. In rare cases, a spiral centurion may also wield manufactured weapons or
a shield in addition to its built-in weapons, giving it access to additional actions
besides those listed below.
Most spiral centurions are hundreds or even thousands of years old, only
staying functional because of the powerful magic used in their creation. Still,
millennia of neglect have caused many spiral centurions to develop small glitches
or malfunctions.

OTHER SPORTLEBORES
While the creature presented here
is the most common of its type,
the sportlebore is in fact an entire
family of insects that specialize in
mimicking everyday objects. Other
varieties of sportlebore include the
spindly, wood-devouring wartlebore;
the corpse-eating sportlegore; and
the sportleglug, which is so small it
can burrow into leather wineskins
and drink their contents without
the bag spilling a drop. Like the
sportlebore, most of these vermin
aren’t too dangerous as individuals
but can turn into a real problem if
their numbers are left unchecked.
Sportlebore
The bane of hungry adventurers the world over, sportlebores are nefarious vermin
that resemble delicious snacks. When positioned near trail rations such as fruit or
jerky, a sportlebore can ﬂawlessly imitate these foodstuffs by ﬂexing, contorting,
and color-shifting its abdomen, then folding its thorax, head, and legs into hiding
under its delicious-looking body. Once consumed, the sportlebore reproduces into
a hungry swarm that is regurgitated by the now ailing eater, ravenously attacking
any creatures it thinks it can consume.

On its own, a single sportlebore functions as a hazard rather than a creature.

REDEEMED SPRIGGANS
A spriggan’s nature is rooted
deeply in its inability to feel joy
and pleasure, and as such, non-evil
spriggans are rare. Yet they are not
unheard of. A spriggan who manages
to turn back on their inherent
nature loses their ability to assume
enormous size, and always becomes
a hated (if not feared) exile from
their clan. Such a spriggan never
fully transforms into a gnome, but
those who embrace redemption often
discover strange new powers waiting
for them to master, such as the
ability to draw upon the First World
to heal themselves and allies, or the
power to transform into actual fey
creatures for a short period of time.
Spriggan
When the gnomes ﬁrst emigrated from the First World so many eons ago, some
found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they lost their sense
of joy. Seeing only the threat of the new world and none of its wonders, these
gnomes grimly resolved to survive no matter what the cost. Their innate magic
responded to this goal by twisting them in mind and body over the course of
many generations, eventually transforming them into the creatures known today
as spriggans.
Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning for nearly all spriggans, for
their minds have long since abandoned the capacity to understand and enjoy
such positivity in the world. Violence, malice, and distortion have expanded in
spriggan society to ﬁll the aching voids left behind by their ancient expunging of
positivity. Today, the best a spriggan can manage in place of positive emotions is
a muted satisfaction when they make another creature suffer.
Spriggans resemble muted, hairless gnomes with oversized, pointed ears and
an alien, feral appearance. Many of them are gaunt and haggard. Skin tones vary
across all different shades of blue, from a pale sky color to a deep midnight.
Unlike their more cheerful and optimistic kin, spriggans do not become afﬂicted
by the bleaching, a fact that many of their kind smugly hold up as proof that
their ancestors’ choice to abandon joy was the right one.
While spriggans can specialize in a wide range of skills, one feature they all
share is the capacity to transform into lumbering, hulking incarnations of their
normally small frames. By drawing upon the void left behind in their souls,
they reﬂect the anger and cruelty in their minds and physically transform into
giant versions of themselves akin to ogres in stature; however, this rage-induced
change takes a toll on their bodies. The longer a spriggan remains in giant form,
the more pain and agony they have waiting for them when, inevitably, they
revert to their true size. Yet this promise of pain does not deter a spriggan from
using their power to grow in size, for it’s only when they assume gargantuan
proportions that they can truly feel joy and satisfaction. That spriggans feel these
emotions only when they are bullying smaller creatures, ﬁghting enemies (or
even allies), or inﬂicting pain on victims speaks to the depths of their corruption.
SPRIGGAN BULLY
The typical spriggan is a bully who prefers to take live prisoners in ﬁghts, but
only to ensure that they have a large stock of living victims to torment, tease, and
abuse. They train to use weapons in nonlethal ways that inﬂict the maximum
amount of pain even as they guard against accidental death. When not bullying
prisoners or hunting for new victims, spriggan bullies enjoy drinking, watching
others ﬁght, and ﬁghting among themselves.

SPRIGGAN DISTRACTIONS
As a culture, most spriggans live for
battle and constantly patrol their
territories in hopes of encountering
trespassers to capture and victimize.
Even so, spriggans sometimes need to
relax. Since they lack the capacity for
pleasure, games, art, and similar leisure
activities are lost on them. Instead,
they ﬁll their idle time training for
combat, watching others ﬁght to the
death, crafting weapons, or plotting
against their kin for personal gain.

SPRIGGAN WARLORD
While the leaders of larger spriggan enclaves tend to be uniquely trained warriors
with highly specialized skills, spriggan warlords are fond of the traditional spriggan
weaponry of morningstar and crossbow, valuing this traditional ﬁghting style for
its simplicity and for using both weapons to their full potential. Spriggan warlords
often serve as sub-commanders in large groups, ﬁlling roles in spriggan society
akin to captains of the guard or bodyguards to spriggan royalty.
In smaller groups or remote outposts, a single spriggan warlord is
typically in charge of a band of spriggan bullies.

GIANT SQUID TACTICS
The giant squid attacks by lashing
out with its longest tentacles and
then rapidly pulling the prey toward
itself. While closing the distance
between them, it attacks again,
this time closing its smaller arms
around the prey. Once it has the prey
thoroughly trapped, the giant squid
tears and cuts with its beak and the
teeth-lined saw it has in the place of
a tongue.
Squid
The unusual shape of these swift, voracious predators has prompted many a
nautical tale.
VAMPIRE SQUID
Vampire squid are neither undead nor blood drinkers. Their name is instead
inspired by their red eyes and the dark, cloak-like webbing between their arms.
Living in the lightless depths of the ocean, the vampire squid can eject a cloud of
bioluminescent mucus that nauseates predators.

STYGIRA GEMS
The gem a stygira carries does not
need to be particularly valuable,
but some stygiras prefer to use
more expensive gems as an
aﬀectation. More powerful stygiras
have developed methods of using
particularly expensive gems to
enhance their gem gaze ability,
allowing some to charm those they
gaze upon, light them on ﬁre, or even
aﬄict them with crippling poison.
Stygira
Withered hermits wrapped in tattered rags, these scarred, eyeless creatures
command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the
subterranean depths. In some regions, stygiras are worshipped as seers or even
gods, although they lack the ability to grant spells to clerics and are often not aware
of their worshippers at all. In other areas, they have strange ties to the ancient
empires of the cyclopes, often dwelling in the oversized ruins those creatures left
behind long ago. To many stygiras, gemstones harvested from ancient cyclopean
mosaics have even greater magical properties than other crystals.
Although technically blind, stygiras do have vestigial eyes hidden beneath the
stony, scarred ﬂesh of their faces. Capable of sensing bright lights even through
their scars, stygiras are sickened and distracted by these ﬂashing glimpses, so
they keep to their caves during the day and
wander into the world above only after
nightfall. Far from benevolent, they seek out
unwary travelers or explorers to capture and
reduce them down to the base chemicals and
supernatural humors the stygiras require to
infuse gemstones with the capacity to give
them sight and magical power.

gazes into the mind of a creature within 30 feet, infusing the creature’s

The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or become frightened 1
(frightened 2 on a critical failure).
Stone Curse (curse, primal, transmutation) Wounds dealt by the stygira’s
claws leave the ﬂesh bleached of color and turn the blood that runs from
them dark gray. Each time a creature is damaged by the stygira’s claw
Strike, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or become permanently
slowed 1 (slowed 2 on a critical failure) as its ﬂesh stiﬀens like stone. If
a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the stygira’s claw Strike and
fails the saving throw against stone curse, it is petriﬁed. A creature
that spends 8 hours in direct sunlight can attempt a new saving
throw to remove the eﬀects of stone curse, even if it has
been petriﬁed.

OTHER TATZLWYRMS
People in some regions claim to have
seen creatures that are just like
tatzlwyrms in most respects—a long
body, two arms, and a head—except
that they have traits that are not
of reptilian origin. Travelers on a
savanna should beware a furry,
lion-headed tatzlwyrm protecting its
cubs, while those in the mountains
might be attacked by a feathered
(but wingless) variant with the head
of an eagle.
Tatzlwyrm
Tatzlwyrms resemble human-sized snakes with two arms and a dragon’s head.
Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of
intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their
ability to reason is limited and they can’t use magic. They do possess a level of
cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and
even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don’t expect to ﬁnd a
tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.
Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons,
though it’s a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as
messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due
to their smaller size), guides (when they’re familiar with a particular mountain),
and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon’s direct attention).
Tatzlwyrms don’t work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.
Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they
seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable
occasion, townsfolk reported being brieﬂy overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conﬂict
between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still
debate whether the cause of the inﬂux was the sudden change in weather or if the
creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part
of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.
When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed,
they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales’ natural
camouﬂage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching
poisonous vapor into an opponent’s face. Since this breath attack doesn’t have
much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes ﬁrst and bring them close
to their mouth.

TENDRICULOS LACQUER
Objects coated with tendriculos
lacquer gain resistance 5 to acid.
Making and applying tendriculos
lacquer requires a 5th-level formula,
the Alchemical Crafting skill feat,
and the ﬂuid from the stomach of a
tendriculos. A successful DC 20 Craft
check and 4 days of work are enough
to protect 1 Bulk of items with no
other cost in materials, but the ﬂuid is
used up even on a failed check.
Tendriculos
These strange amalgams of plant and fungus with animal tendencies form where
the natural world is corrupted by foul magic or frayed planar boundaries.
Tendriculoses are instinctive ambush predators who seek out lightly traveled
forest paths and lie in wait in the undergrowth. A tendriculos swallows its prey
as quickly as possible and lets its paralytic digestive juices ﬁnish the meal, while
swiftly restoring itself with the nourishment provided by the trapped creature.
When collected, neutralized, and reﬁned, the digestive ﬂuids of a tendriculos
form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos’s acid resistance.
A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the
Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different
tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have
little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined
fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even
closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great
patience and plentiful food—and these the gifts of food must be alive
when handed over.
When it has ﬁnished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into
a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach.
Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible
portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived
digestion and indicate that a tendriculos’s hunting grounds lie nearby.
Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near
populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous
appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast
forth millions of spores. Spores that
happen to alight on carrion grow into
new tendriculoses.

THUNDER AND FIRE
Thunderbirds have a complex
relationship with phoenixes, whom
they regard as too kindly and patient
with human civilizations, even as
they admire phoenixes’ beauty
and mastery over elements that
thunderbirds cannot control. Often,
encounters with phoenixes escalate
into violent arguments, but it’s rare
for one of these meetings to end
in a thunderbird’s death, and even
rarer for a phoenix to be signiﬁcantly
threatened by the upstart challenger.
Thunderbird
Thunderbirds bring storms on their wings. In times of drought, they are welcomed.
Other times, they are offered gifts in hopes they might leave before ﬂooding begins.
When angered, they call down hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so many
settlements conduct extensive rites to appease and honor local thunderbirds.
Thunderbird parents carry their newly hatched offspring to hidden mountaintop
nests, where the young are struck by their ﬁrst bolts of lightning and learn the
mysteries of the storm.

TICK DISEASES
Giant ticks and tick swarms can
potentially inﬂict diseases other than
tick fever. Drawing from the list on
pages 118–119 of the Gamemastery
Guide, potential diseases that a
tick could spread include blinding
sickness, bubonic plague, malaria, or
scarlet fever. The saving throw DC
should be adjusted to DC 17 (for giant
ticks) or DC 27 (for tick swarms).
Tick
These blood-sucking parasites are common vectors for disease and other
infections. Ticks infest all parts of the world, save for the most remote and frigid
locales, and have evolved to feed on just about every kind of creature.

Attach When the giant tick Strikes a creature larger than itself, its barbed hypostome
attaches it to that creature. This is similar to Grabbing the creature, but the giant tick
moves with that creature rather than holding it in place. The giant tick is ﬂat-footed
while attached. If the giant tick is killed or pushed away while attached to a creature on
which it has used Blood Drain, that creature takes 1 persistent bleed damage. Escaping
the attachment or removing the giant tick in other ways doesn’t cause bleed damage.
Blood Drain Ȱɵ Requirements The giant tick is attached to a creature; Eﬀect The giant
tick uses its hypostome to drain blood from the creature it’s attached to. This deals 1d4
damage, and the giant tick gains temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt. A
creature that has its blood drained by a giant tick is drained 1 until it receives healing

FROGS AND TOADS
While they might look similar
in appearance, toads and frogs
are quite diﬀerent creatures,
particularly some of their oversized
variants. Frogs tend to dwell in
swampy or marshy areas, while
toads are found in drier regions
like forests, plains, grasslands, and
deserts. Monstrous toads also skew
to a larger size overall.
Toad
Most giant toads live in dry environments, particularly deserts, and eagerly
eat almost any creature smaller than themselves. They’re known to eat giant
rats, then take over the rats’ burrows as homes. Giant toads have large poison
glands behind their eyes that enable them to coat their skin with poison. This
leads to them having very few natural predators, and populations can quickly
explode if left unchecked. While most consider giant toads dangerous pests,
some groups of ogres and hill giants cultivate them to collect their poison for
recreational use.

to the toad but prevents it from using its tongue Strike
until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week.
TOAD TEARS
A giant toad’s poison glands can be harvested and
used as raw materials to craft a specialized poison
known somewhat inaccurately as “toad tears” (likely
due to the harvesting process, which requires one to
dig the glands out from behind the eyes). One giant
toad’s poison gland can supply enough materials for
a single dose.

FLESH SCULPTORS
Some totenmaskes craft macabre
“art” by shaping the ﬂesh of their
victims, spending hours, days, or
even weeks molding a victim’s skin,
or even fusing multiple creatures
together into one piece. The
horrifying results of this process can
take the form of furniture made from
ﬂesh that still lives and breathes,
“sculptures” that in no way resemble
the human form, and even more
twisted and depraved things.
Totenmaske
Spawned by the same unnatural and self-destructive obsessions that drove them
when they were alive, totenmaskes are the undead remnants of the most selfindulgent and sinful among us. Though unable to sate their perverse desires, these
foul undead can drain the very ﬂesh from their victims so as to wrap themselves
in a perverse mockery of life that allows them to pursue their base wants.
Totenmaskes’ speciﬁc longings vary—one might be obsessed with food or drink,
while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a
mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the
sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is
what helped condemn it to unlife in the ﬁrst place. A totenmaske obsessed with
food, for example, might ﬁnd itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain
totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and
switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.

Fortitude save (sickened 2 and drained 2 on a critical failure).
Living Form Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
The totenmaske takes the appearance of a Medium or
smaller humanoid creature. This is either its form
from before it became undead, or the form of
the last creature it successfully hit with Drink
Flesh. This doesn’t change the totenmaske’s
Speed or the attack and damage bonuses for its
Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning).
Shape Flesh (curse, divine, necromancy) After spending
1 minute in contact with a paralyzed, unconscious,
or willing creature, a totenmaske can reshape the
target’s face, causing ﬂesh to cover vital features.
The target can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save
to resist; a critical success grants temporary
immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours. Each
time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses
one feature: ears (target becomes deafened),
eyes (target becomes blinded), mouth (target
can’t speak or eat), or nose (target can’t
smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth
sealed can’t breathe and begins to suﬀocate (Core
Rulebook 478). Changes are permanent until reversed
by removing this curse, or the sealed ﬂesh can be
surgically opened with a DC 25 Medicine check that takes
1d4 rounds and deals 1d6 slashing damage per round.

TRITON CONCH TRUMPETS
Tritons use a conch shell as a focus
to summon aquatic allies. Some
specialize in diﬀerent uses of the
conch, such as frightening foes (as
the fear spell) or using water for
attacks (as the spell hydraulic push).
Triton conch shells in the hands
of non-tritons do not produce any
magical eﬀects, but have inspired
other crafters to build magical
triton’s conches (Core Rulebook 576).
Triton
While sometimes understandably mistaken for merfolk—both species live
underwater and have a blend of features from both humans and ﬁsh—tritons
have two legs instead of a tail. This gives tritons the ability to operate on land,
though they are neither as comfortable nor as skilled above water as below.
The arms and legs of a triton feature ﬁns that assist in swimming, and their
entire body is covered in ﬁne scales that range in color from silver to cerulean
blue to seaweed green. Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between
the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and
a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass,
commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in
color from sea blue to golden.
Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to
protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders—whether
they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are
sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons
have had to ﬁght underwater and on land.
In their quest to ﬁght underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins
and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elementals, and
sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using
a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea
species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufﬁciency, rarely trading
with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely
forming established alliances.
Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea ﬂoor,
forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys
heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons—
though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to
the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They
like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants,
bioluminescent ﬁsh, and attractive trinkets recovered
from shipwrecks.

DEATHLESS FROST
Historically isolated in the remote
frozen wilderness of the Saga Lands,
frost trolls have increasingly been
encountered in more temperate
climates on Golarion. It’s unclear
what’s driving these ice-hearted
trolls southward, but some suspect
the machinations of a wrathful
demon lord are at play.
Troll
Towering brutes with slavering jaws and razor-sharp claws, trolls are voracious
predators. They are nigh invulnerable and single-minded in their pursuit, so they
throw themselves against prey with reckless abandon. Wounds that would cripple
or kill most other creatures regenerate into healthy troll ﬂesh within seconds.
Trolls don’t mark their hunting grounds with claw marks or urine as beasts
do. After gorging upon their kill, they suspend any meat, bones, or other bodily
detritus that remain from tree branches to mark their domains. Unfortunately,
trolls tend to treat these borders as approximations. Before a hapless traveler
even spots such a grisly marker and realizes that they have wandered into troll
territory, the trolls are already preparing to attack.
These pages present lesser-known varieties beyond the common troll.
FROST TROLL
Frost trolls are nightmarish frozen monsters of rime-stained claws and hoarfrost
teeth. Possessing wits superior to those of common trolls, frost trolls often hunt in
packs of three—one attacking their quarry openly while the remaining two pause to
assess weaknesses before moving in for the kill. Frost trolls relish the taste of human
ﬂesh and adjust their hunting grounds seasonally to remain in close proximity
to their favorite prey. Of slighter frame than common trolls, a typical frost
troll stands 11 feet tall when not hunched and weighs 900 pounds. Their
sickly, cracked ﬂesh is of an icy, cerulean pallor. Frost trolls often adorn
themselves with trophies of bone and hide ﬂayed from their kills.

CAVERN TROLL
Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom
of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in
their path—even rocks and minerals when more
nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky
goliaths can tunnel through stone with their
iron-sharp claws.

================================================================================
PAGE 266
================================================================================

NAR-VOTH DELICACIES
Both cavern trolls and xorns—squat,
tripartite earth elementals—share a
voracious appetite for deposits of
precious minerals. When either group
encounters the other, a frenzy of
claws and ravenous gorging ensues
until only one side remains. Powerful
cavern trolls who consume a critical
mass of xorns can gain tremorsense
and rule as monarchs over their
subterranean kin.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
vulnerability to sunlight that petriﬁes them on sustained contact. Unlike common
trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by ﬁre. The crystalline nature of
their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their ﬂinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete
with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and
weighs about 2,000 pounds.

TWO-HEADED TROLL
Two-headed trolls are savage, dualminded monsters with an unquenchable
thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their
ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the
lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke
the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children.
“Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or
a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow
you whole!” It’s unclear why such a morbid tradition gained
traction with parents, but it’s an undeniable fact that twoheaded trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures
small enough to devour with one bite.
Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height,
weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common
trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright
gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk
hunched over.

MOTHER OF TROLLS
Trolls and ettins do not normally
seek one another as mates, but this
pairing is the source of the original
two-headed trolls—such couplings
were engineered and arranged by
the cult of Lamashtu in ages past.
Oblivious to their origin, two-headed

JOTUND TROLL
Jotund
trolls
are
gigantic,
nine-headed
horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes,
and wastelands, always alone and always
enraged. While each of the jotund troll’s nine
heads possess their own brains and senses,
they work much more in tandem than the
dual-minded nature of the two-headed
troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and
bicker, particularly over which head gets to
eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the
same shared stomach makes little difference
in such culinary disagreements.
Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund
troll represents a primordial, if not
original, shape and design for the ﬁrst
trolls to plague the world, arising from a
mythical realm in the Great Beyond known
as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be
nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary
home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the
jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague
the Material Plane as punishment or challenge,
or if it’s merely an evocative legend told
by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the
jotund trolls themselves likely care little.

one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully
restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately.
Multiple Opportunities A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their
heads beyond the ﬁrst, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity
with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can’t use more than 1 reaction for the
same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their
reach, and the jotund troll must use a diﬀerent head for each Attack of

TROLLHOUND GENESIS
The ﬁrst trollhounds were the
unexpected result of occult
experimentation on wargs with
alchemically prepared troll blood in
the hope of creating an ooze with
limited regeneration. Most of the
wargs died during the trials; the
few survivors lost their cunning
and intelligence in exchange for
a troll’s voracious appetite and
ability to regenerate. Successive
generations of trollhounds often hunt
alongside trolls, understanding on an
instinctual level the bonds they share
with these lumbering giants.
Trollhound
Trollhounds are squat, slavering beasts akin to trolls in canine form. Requiring
vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild
trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious
hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some
regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds’ keen sense of
smell to aid in the hunt.
Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating
contagion known as bloodﬁre fever. Creatures that contract the disease through
the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on
ﬁre. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-ﬁlled blisters,
and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both
trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.
Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to
regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of ﬁre is enough to repel
them, as the beasts don’t recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, ﬁre is
one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to
burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative
powers are potent indeed.
While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and
even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters.
Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds’ diseased slobber, their
ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality
and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more
reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping
into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds
can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to
multiply into a signiﬁcant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds
to the trolls, as they say!

BUILDING WITH SHELLS
The shell of a giant snapping turtle
is over 20 feet long and is sturdy,
naturally curved, and waterproof,
making it a useful building material.
While boggards seldom have
advanced construction techniques,
they use giant snapping turtle shells
as roofs and rafts when available.
Boggards also incorporate smaller
turtle shells into their armor.
Turtle
These generally mild-mannered and docile creatures prefer to be left alone, but the
ill-tempered snapping turtle is a notably violent exception to this rule.
SNAPPING TURTLE
Snapping turtles are freshwater reptiles with a long ﬂexible neck, a sharp piercing
beak, and a confrontational temperament that doesn’t prevent some spellcasters
from choosing these creatures as familiars. They weigh about 20 pounds and have
shells around 18 inches in length.

GIANT SNAPPING TURTLE
If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle
seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain.
Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is
capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly
boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to
serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those
unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle ﬁnd that even
the creature’s stomach is somewhat armored, making it difﬁcult to cut through.

TWIGJACK BRAMBLES
Sometimes groups of twigjacks
gather and form temporary
communities called “brambles,”
usually to aid in times of need for
the forest or to enact some great
vengeance. These groups can
consist of anywhere from three to
30 twigjacks. Once their task is
complete, the twigjacks go their
separate ways.
Twigjack
Maladjusted forest denizens, twigjacks form from the cruel and prankish
combination of fey and the very woods in which they reside. A twigjack’s body is
made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike
hair, tops a twigjack’s head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken
sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from
the creature’s body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of
twigjacks living in the undergrowth.
While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider
to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their
wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and
travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However,
they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When
sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the
area eagerly arrive to ﬁght, even if they were not invited.
Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often
mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they
have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks
resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they
embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks
go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures
they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of
a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only
to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey
seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but
some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness
the twigjacks’ violent urges and disruptive
behavior for their own purposes.
While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often
found in the First World, it’s somewhat curious that
those twigjacks who ﬁnd religion only rarely turn to
the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend
to worship false deities of their own design: ﬁgures
spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth,
or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions
are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support
clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.

UMONLEE FABLES
While they’re immense, violent,
and frightening, umonlees aren’t
inherently evil creatures. As such,
there are stories of youths, gnomes,
or other small-statured creatures
who encounter umonlees in the wild
and manage to befriend them, so that
at some later point in the tale when
the pint-sized protagonists are in
peril, their enormous ally can arrive,
bursting from a nearby glacier to
play the role of overwhelming savior.
Whether or not these tales have any
basis in truth is unknown.
Umonlee
Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that
swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes.
Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the
Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.
Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service
of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are
semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are
not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafﬁcked
areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse
group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path
of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that
crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by
an encounter with one of these monstrosities.
Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as
the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean
predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they
can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to
this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of
alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these
alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren’t evil argues well
against such a theory.

MINOS-PASHAT
The ﬁrst urdefhans were unleashed
into the depths of Golarion’s
Darklands in the vault of MinosPashat, a nation-sized cavern riddled
with maze-like tangles of stalactites,
stalagmites, and ﬁssures.
Urdefhan
The violent warmongers, occultists, and poisoners known as urdefhans dwell
within the Darklands. They were created in eons past by the mysterious First
Horsemen of the Apocalypse to serve as agents of the end times within the
Material Plane. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the
wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their ﬁendish lieges,
urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill.
While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is
where their similarities to surface ancestries end. Their visages are horriﬁc, with
transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming
bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This, combined with
their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that
these beings are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living ﬂesh and
blood. When an urdefhan’s life comes to an end, their ﬂesh quickly curdles and
then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the ﬂesh of other
creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a
disappointment, for once they’re dead, their chances to kill will
ﬁnally come to an end.
Urdefhans’ primary concern is death and how to inﬂict it
in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond
this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only
tangentially with matters such as formal modes of
warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When
an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence,
their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense
of self-preservation that ensures they survive
long enough to spread the “blessings” of their
daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new
weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic,
all in preparation for the next inevitable conﬂict.
URDEFHAN WARRIOR
From the moment they are born, urdefhans are prepared for war. Urdefhan
warriors are among the least powerful urdefhans one might encounter outside of
their eerie underground cities.

RHOKA SWORDS
The rhoka sword is the preferred
weapon of urdefhan soldiers,
though all urdefhans
know how to wield these
instruments of war. These
uncommon advanced
weapons cost 4 gp, deal 1d8
slashing damage, have 2 Bulk,
and require 1 hand to use. Rhoka
swords are in the sword group and
have the deadly d8 and two-hand
1d10 traits.
Ravenous Attack ʚʖ The urdefhan makes one rhoka sword Strike and one jaws Strike
against a single creature. Its multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after
both attacks.
Wicked Bite Ȱɵ Requirements The urdefhan damaged a creature with a jaws Strike on its
last action; Eﬀect The urdefhan maintains contact, turning the creature’s
ﬂesh translucent around the site of the injury. The urdefhan chooses
one of two options, each of which requires a DC 20 Fortitude save.
If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suﬀers both eﬀects,
using the same save result for both.
• Drain Blood The urdefhan drinks some of the creature’s blood. On a
failed save, the creature is drained 1 and the urdefhan regains 5 HP
(or, on a critical failure, it’s drained 2 and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).
• Drain Vitality (necromancy) The urdefhan draws out some of the
creature’s vital essence. The creature becomes enfeebled 1 for 1 hour
on a failed save (or enfeebled 2 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
URDEFHAN TORMENTOR
Urdefhan spellcasters with a knack for the divine are invariably
unholy worshippers of daemonkind, typically taking on one of
Abaddon’s Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their patron deity.
With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons
into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to
stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.

BUILDING A VRYKOLAKAS
Like vampires (Bestiary 318–321),
vrykolakas can infect victims with
their twisted form of vampirism,
transforming practically any living
monster into one of these undead
horrors. You can build a new
vrykolakas from the ground up
using the standard monster creation
rules, which were used to create
the vrykolakas spawn, vrykolakas
master, and vrykolakas ancient, or
you can use the guidelines presented
under Creating a Vrykolakas to
turn an existing creature (even a
player character!) into a vrykolakas,
adjusting the monster as you see ﬁt.
In either case, speciﬁc vrykolakas
abilities like negative healing, Feral
Corruption, and Drink Blood work
the same.
Vampire, Vrykolakas
Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as
vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. They spread
suffering and death among all who cross their paths, punishing all who remind
them of those who failed to properly lay their bodies and souls to rest.
CREATING A VRYKOLAKAS
You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
• It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil.
• Increase AC, attack modiﬁers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
• Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed.
• Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability
can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
BASIC VRYKOLAKAS AbILITIES
If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that speciﬁcally come
from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented
its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to
adjust abilities that conﬂict with the vrykolakas’ theme. All vrykolakas gain the
following abilities.
Darkvision
Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking.
Negative Healing
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep
Feral Corruption Ȳ˓ (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession)
Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet;
Eﬀect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn’t destroyed when it reaches 0
HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must
attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas’s level from the Spell DC and
Spell Attack Roll table on page 66 of the Gamemastery Guide). On a failure, the animal
is possessed. This has the eﬀects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of
days equal to the vrykolakas’s level. This possession can’t be counteracted with magic
(though remove curse works against it normally).
If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a diﬀerent
animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no
animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.
A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound
below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery,
its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host.
Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After
1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn’t been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas
rises in a new body that’s identical to its previous one, formed from the animal’s remains.
Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities.
• Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It
must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours,
during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to
this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this
host animal can’t return to the burial site before the possession eﬀect ends, the
vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal.
• Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can’t use its Feral
Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.
Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed.
Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing
damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature’s level on
the Strike Damage table found on page 65 of the Gamemastery Guide.

================================================================================
PAGE 276
================================================================================

VRYKOLAKAS HABITS
Most vrykolakas have curious
aﬀectations, such as a compulsion
to knock on a door before
entering or calling out the name
of the person within. If the person
answers, the vrykolakas then tries
to hunt and slay them within 3 days.
Others have an aﬃnity for speciﬁc
types of animals, always preferring
to charm or possess them, or have
an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi
vampire, however, for a vrykolakas
these habits are merely sadistic
games or personal preferences, not
mystical compulsions.
Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs
Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink
Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature’s level on the Strike Damage table
found on page 65 of the Gamemastery Guide.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas’ last action was a
successful fangs Strike; Eﬀect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to
drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC.
On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal
to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking
Blood from a creature that’s already drained doesn’t restore any HP to the vampire,
but it increases the creature’s drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also
consume blood that’s been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP
from doing so.
The target creature’s drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood
transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and suﬃcient blood or
a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.
Rend Ȱɵ The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.
VRYKOLAKAS MASTER AbILITIES
Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their
victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or
higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who
have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient.
Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master
inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, wargs,
werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders
to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can’t communicate back.
Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the
area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague.
Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened
to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as
divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level (Gamemastery Guide 66).

Vrykolakas are corrupted bestial

MYTHOLOGICAL ORIGINS
The vrykolakas (pronounced
“vree-KO-la-kahss”) is an undead
creature from Greek folklore. These
revenants appear as humans come
back after death to complete some
task left undone before they can
peacefully rest. Many are vengeful
and murderous, but some are simply
attempting to return to their former
lives, like a shoemaker rising from
the grave to mend his children’s
shoes, carry water, and chop
ﬁrewood. The Pathﬁnder version of
this creature is more associated with
a feral form of vampire.
Drink Blood Ȱɵ (divine, necromancy) When Drinking Blood, the vrykolakas master
regains 19 HP.

AGENTS OF EMPTY DEATH
Vampiric mists are linked to the
will-o’-wisp, another notorious
swamp-dwelling, vaporous predator,
in that both of these entities are
often encountered in areas where
the Outer God Nhimbaloth has
brushed close to the world. Often,
the wounds on a corpse fed upon by
a vampiric mist bear Nhimbaloth’s
mark: a cluster of seven perfectly
spaced punctures through which the
victim’s blood has been drained.
Vampiric Mist
Though they’re often mistaken for vampires in gaseous form or an unusual type
of air elemental, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an
amorphous body that consists as much of ﬂuid as it does of air, these creatures
dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat
isn’t as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas,
as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While
blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these
sadistic monsters vastly prefer the ﬂavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures.
Like will-o’-wisps, vampiric mists ﬁnd that fear ﬂavors the blood, though they
gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.
Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They
sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working
together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey—a pursuit they
approach with great creativity. The mists’ propensity for taking on vague, skeletal
forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and
fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric
mists enjoy using this common misconception
to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish
tactics—such as tricking spellcasters
into attempting to use positive
energy against them as if they
were undead monsters.

FORBIDDEN ARMOR
After a devastating battle with a
vaspercham, many legendary heroes
have tried to forge armor or weapons
from the magical shell of the sea
beast, but all have failed because of
the powerful curse that suﬀuses the
opaline material. If one were able to
dispel the curse of a vaspercham’s
shell—or somehow twist the curse
to their own beneﬁt—they would be
able to craft an incredible suit of
spell-reﬂecting plate mail.
Vaspercham
The darkly intelligent vaspercham, an aquatic horror who delights in violence and
destruction, lurks in the shallows near shorelines. Once a vaspercham settles on a new
home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A
vaspercham’s physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard
to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a
vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best
a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature
recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.

makes four tentacle Strikes, each against

penalty doesn’t increase until
after the vaspercham makes all of
their attacks.

A MORTAL NAME
Some mortals refer to velstracs
as “kytons,” a misattribution that
the velstracs tolerate with cold
amusement. The term “kyton” denotes
a master or virtuoso among their kind,
and these ﬁends enjoy being labeled
as masters of their horrid paths of
perfection through agony.
Velstrac
The search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation is the horrifying
preoccupation of the shadow-dwelling ﬁends known as velstracs. They transcend
their stoic detachment only when inﬂicting pain and terror upon their victims,
practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back
on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending
such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as
emotionless tormentors who inﬂict sadistic suffering. These ﬁends claim to
seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don’t recognize any
reﬁnement that doesn’t require the painful excision of the ﬂesh or spirit.
Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic
mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane. They take on forms that
suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros
of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps
the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through
untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.
AUGUR
These spherical knots of sinewy muscle, serrated blades, and bloody metal are
the most common velstracs on the Shadow Plane. Each augur has only a single
eye, from which they can see the horrors inﬂicted by other velstracs, who train
the augur to expect and appreciate pain. Augurs are 1 foot in diameter and
weigh 30 pounds.

VELSTRAC DIVINITIES
The most powerful velstracs are
unique divinities known collectively
as velstrac demagogues—powerful
creatures worshipped by those
mortals who seek to experience
agonizing new revelations and
gain power by enhancing the body
through pain.
OSTIARIUS
Ostiariuses, as emissaries of the velstracs, tend to the portals between the Shadow
Plane and the Material Plane. They not only escort other velstracs into the world
of mortals, but also work to entice mortals into the realms of the velstracs—
from which most mortals never leave. Among the most pleasant and persuasive of
the velstracs, ostiariuses are prepared to converse for hours upon any topic, and
they are skilled at returning, again and again, to the subject of the delights found
in their perverse philosophies. Ostiariuses stand over 6 feet tall, and individuals
range from skeletally thin to hugely corpulent.

themself by whispering words of courage from their wounds.
The ostiarius and their allies in a 50-foot emanation gain a +1
status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear eﬀects.
The ostiarius can Sustain Compel Courage. Non-velstracs who accept this
compelled courage ﬁnd bleeding wounds opening on their own bodies to
whisper in thanks. They take 1 persistent bleed damage and can’t attempt
a ﬂat check to end this damage as long as they’re compelled.
Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The ostiarius
stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The creature must immediately
attempt a Will save against whispering wounds. In addition, if the creature was
already sickened and fails its save, the creature is fascinated by the ostiarius and
can’t use hostile actions. This fascination lasts for 1 round or until the ostiarius takes
any hostile action against the creature or the creature’s allies. Whether the creature
succeeds at or fails the save, it is temporarily immune for 1 hour.

of the planes to spread the word of their kind’s abhorrent belief in perfection
through pain. They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the

DESPICABLE ORIGINS
Velstracs originated with the ﬁrst

divine beings found so deplorable
that they locked all velstracs away
in Hell. It wasn’t long, however,
before the newly formed beings
escaped their infernal prison to the
Shadow Plane.
Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal ﬂesh-sculptors or serving as
wardens of horriﬁc dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may
serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for
mortal’s souls or choice mortal ﬂesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans,
although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh
350 pounds or more.

make chain Strikes against any creature that is adjacent to an

Focus Gaze Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, enchantment, fear, mental, visual)
The evangelist stares at a creature they can see within 30 feet. The
target must immediately attempt a Will save against unnerving
gaze. In addition, if the creature was already frightened, on a failed
save, the evangelist is concealed from the creature for as long as the
creature remains frightened. After attempting this save, the creature
is then temporarily immune until the start of the evangelist’s next turn.
Impaling Chain When the evangelist critically hits with a chain Strike,
the target is impaled and anchored in place, becoming grabbed by
the chain. The creature is unable to recover from persistent bleed
damage until it gets free (DC 25 Escape).
SACRISTAN
Sacristans are failures among the velstracs, creatures
whose bodies and minds have been utterly broken
by the velstracs’ torments. These unfortunates are
assembled from scrap metal, nerveless ﬂesh, and
bits of darkness into loyal agents who take ecstatic
pleasure in serving other velstracs. Sacristans
are empowered by a miniature gateway to the
Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending
their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and
windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in
appearance but are the size of maimed humans.
Their features are redundant or absent and they are
wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.

THE SHADOW FORGE
Many velstracs outsource the forging
of their chains to unique velstracs
known as almoners. These six-armed,
legless humanoids toil endlessly at
a great burning foundry called the
Shadow Forge. Almoners operate
under mysterious strictures, and are
just as likely to turn a velstrac away

attempt a DC 28 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is
unaﬀected and is then temporarily
immune for 24 hours.

Failure The creature is confused and deafened for
1 round.
Critical Failure The creature takes 20 mental damage,
and is confused and deafened for 1 round.
INTERLOCUTOR
Interlocutors are the most talented surgeon-sculptors of
the velstracs, carving away ﬂesh and replacing it with
new body parts of muscle, sinew, and metal.
Each interlocutor structures their individual
appearance carefully, but all are towering,
multi-limbed amalgamations of the strongest
limbs, densest bone, and sharpest metal they
can ﬁnd. They continually search for new
material to graft to their forms, and their slain
foes are rarely found intact, as little is
more valuable to interlocutors than a
powerful opponent’s legs, eyes, or even
brain. Interlocutors average 9 feet tall
and weigh approximately 800 pounds.

VELSTRACS ON GOLARION
Velstracs are most often
encountered in the shadowy realm
of Nidal, where the state worship
of Zon-Kuthon is rigidly enforced.
Indeed, many velstracs are created
from the souls of Joyful Things,
devotees of Zon-Kuthon who have
had their limbs amputated to focus
their minds on the veneration of
pain, sacriﬁce, and torment.

DEADLY WHIPS
Canny adventurers can harvest a
defeated violet fungus’s tentacles and
use them as whips. The whips inﬂict
violent rot (with the same eﬀects
and DC as in the violet fungus’s
stat block) on anything they touch,
including the wielder, although metal
gloves such as gauntlets can protect
against the poison. Such whips can be
used for 1 hour before they degrade
and become useless.
Violet Fungus
At a glance, a violet fungus might seem to be little more than an unsightly and
sickeningly purple mushroom of unusual size. Only once one draws closer—
once whip-like tentacles dripping with ﬂesh-rotting venom slither out from the
fungus’s cratered cap—does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool
become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the
clutches of this monstrous fungus’s tentacles, since violet fungi are practically
synonymous with caverns on Golarion.
Anyone who has ever braved the world’s caves for an extended period of
time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as
drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush
with this vicious plant’s cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean
trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch
game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands
peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths
in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a
ﬁrst line of defense.

VIPER VINE POLLEN
While viper vine pollen degrades
quickly after it is harvested carefully
from the plant, a character who has
a set of alchemical tools can gather
and preserve 1d6 doses of pollen
with a successful DC 33 Crafting
or Nature check and 10 minutes
of work. A single dose of viper
vine pollen is worth 300 gp as raw
materials for crafting any alchemical
or magical item that creates an
incapacitation eﬀect.
Viper Vine
A voracious, ﬂesh-eating carnivore, the viper vine has a single enormous blossom
arising from a thick, leafy tangle of snake-like vines. When the plant senses the
approach of suitable prey through its sensitive, shallowly buried root system, it
rises up like an agitated snake and unfurls its brightly colored bloom, an act that
releases a cloud of mind-numbing pollen. Persistent stories claim the viper vine
can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect
is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.
Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than
through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion
and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form
of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and
make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly
large or dangerous-looking.
The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially
devoured remains of victims. It’s not unusual to ﬁnd the rotting corpses of wild
animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant’s immediate vicinity,
along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses. A
viper vine rarely returns to the carcass of a creature it killed earlier,
preferring to hunt fresh meat.

NON-EVIL UNDEAD
Void zombies are unusual in that
their animating negative force is
provided by a living parasite that
survives within their corpses,
controlling their nervous systems
for defense and to hunt food. As
such, the soul of a person who
succumbs to an akata’s void death
is not bound to its rotting corpse at
all and travels on to judgment in the
Boneyard unimpeded. Nevertheless,
most worshippers of Pharasma
and crusaders against undeath
still consider void zombies to be
anathema and ﬁght to destroy them.
Void Zombie
A void zombie arises when a humanoid dies from an akata’s void death afﬂiction
(page 13). This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the
deceased creature’s brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the
corpse’s mouth to drink blood from its victims.
A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and
the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural
end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie ﬁnds a secluded place to vomit
forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva
metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the
corpse as its ﬁrst meal.
The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by
necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien,
not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that
a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata
within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies,
has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other
names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,”
or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace
name has proven difﬁcult to shed.
The driving force behind a void zombie’s violence rises from
the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel
for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often
to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted
within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best,
one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a
captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall (page 301)
in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two—
after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic
outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly
violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct
comparisons of the two creatures particularly difﬁcult, or even
dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk
thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of
this strange behavior.

Salt Water Vulnerability Salt water acts as an extremely strong acid on
the larval akata inside the void zombie. Full immersion in salt water deals
4d6 acid damage per round. On any round in which the void zombie takes
damage due to its salt water weakness, the larval akata retreats to the depths
of the void zombie’s body, causing the void zombie to become slowed 1 until
the end of its next turn.

LOCAL ORMS
People who live by the lakes
inhabited by legendary water
orms have a tendency to give local
lake monsters names that sound
somewhat homey or even adorable.
As a result, such creatures are often
regarded as local mascots or goodluck charms—particularly in lakeside
settlements that depend on ﬁshing
as a signiﬁcant income source.
Water Orm
Legendary creatures lurking in remote lakes, water orms always ﬁnd their way
into the tavern tales of lakeside communities. To some travelers, every lake of
respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of ﬁshers claiming to have
spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and
gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and
linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.
Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability
to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid
contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling
curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm
sightings usually occur when they can’t help but to rise up to the surface to take
a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or ﬂoating
on the water’s surface.
These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even
centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes
without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water
without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty
lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to
their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes
missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the
local water orm is responsible, leading to
folk tales that caution residents against
venturing out alone near the water.
While
most
water
orms
are
described as serpentine or long-necked
reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely
elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea
horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.

this condition by using Swallow Whole to gulp down a meal.

ability. A water orm can return to its normal form using a single action which has the

CREATING WERECREATURES
Werecreatures are complex monsters
capable of shifting between three
diﬀerent forms and of inﬂicting their
condition upon other humanoids. Full
rules for building werecreatures, along
with how to apply the werecreature’s
curse, appear on pages 328–329 of
the Pathﬁnder Bestiary.
Werecreature
Werecreatures transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under
the light of the full moon. The doomed fate of these shapechanging creatures
derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through
their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reﬂect werecreatures in their
hybrid forms.
WERECREATURE ABILITIES
The following abilities are shared among all werecreatures. A werecreature also
gains several other abilities, as explained in the Bestiary, but additional rules for
those abilities aren’t necessary unless you create your own werecreature.
Animal Empathy (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of
the same general kind.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature
changes into their humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a speciﬁc,
persistent appearance. A true werecreature’s natural form is their hybrid shape. In
humanoid shape, the werecreature uses their original humanoid size, loses their jaws
and claw Strikes, and gains a melee ﬁst Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to
the slashing damage dealt by their claw. In animal shape, their Speed and size change
to that of the animal, they gain any special Strike eﬀects of the animal that they didn’t
already have (such as Grab), and they lose their weapon Strikes.
Curse of the Werecreature (curse, necromancy, primal) This
curse aﬀects only humanoids; Saving Throw Fortitude DC
is the standard DC for the werecreature’s new level – 1. On
each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another
Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature
until dawn. The creature is under the GM’s
control and goes on a rampage for half the
night before falling unconscious until dawn.
Moon Frenzy (polymorph, primal, transmutation)
When a full moon appears in the
night sky, the werecreature must
enter hybrid form, can’t Change
Shape thereafter, becomes one
size larger, increases their reach
by 5 feet, and increases the
damage of their jaws Strike by 2.
When the moon sets or the sun rises,
the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued
for 2d4 hours.
WEREBOAR
Wereboars tend to be aggressive and stubborn, and often
live with their own kind in small, remote
communities. Even when they’re inclined
to interact with others, wereboars’ short
tempers and hostile nature lead other creatures
to avoid them. Lone wereboars who settle down—often on
remote farms—are extremely territorial, though others are
content to roam and explore lands far from home. Their other
habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down
to diet: some wereboars might feast on human ﬂesh, while others are
mostly vegetarian.

LYCANTHROPY
Many scholars refer to the curse of

but technically this is correct only

Nevertheless, the word has gained
traction in certain circles, and as a
result it’s not uncommon to hear
the whispers of locals who fear
lycanthropes even when a ravenous
weretiger is the real threat. Naturally,
the werecreatures themselves don’t
take this ignorance lightly, and tend
to see being equated with a werewolf
as a great insult. Unless, of course, the
werecreature is a werewolf!

WERETIGER
These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true
apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal.
Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them
ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of
environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated
cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders)
often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming
overwhelmed by the urge to hunt. They prefer to wear looseﬁtting clothing and rely on their claws and jaws in a ﬁght.

CAIRN WIGHT DIRGES
Unlike a typical wight, cairn wights
have an unusual aﬃnity for music.
The lyrics of their dirges often
contain a valuable bit of knowledge
or long-lost lore, possibly the
greatest treasure a cairn wight
guards. There are even brave souls
who seek out the creatures to listen
to their songs in hopes of ﬁnding
proﬁt from the dry, rasping words.
Wight, Cairn
Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn
from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought
of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered
by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently,
particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to
transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time.
Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to
spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the
intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant
wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.
As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to
the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread
their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn
wight’s sword channels life from the victim into the wight.

Cairn Wight Spawn (divine, necromancy) A living humanoid slain by a cairn
wight’s weapon or claw Strike rises as a spawned wight after 1d4 rounds.

It doesn’t have drain life or cairn wight spawn and is clumsy 2 for as long as it is
a spawned wight. If its creator dies, the spawned wight becomes a full-ﬂedged,
autonomous cairn wight; it regains its free will, gains drain life and cairn wight
spawn, and is no longer clumsy.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the cairn wight damages a living creature with
a melee Strike, using an unarmed attack or its bound weapon, the cairn wight gains
5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or
become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the cairn wraith increases the drained
condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Funereal Dirge ʚʖ (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) The cairn
wight chants a low, haunting melody. Living creatures within 50 feet must

WISPS AND FIRE
Witchﬁres have the ability to summon
will-o’-wisps, but a number of these
aberrations usually linger nearby of
their own accord. The fear-inducing
witchﬂame aura manifested by
witchﬁres provides will-o’-wisps their
favored sustenance.
Witchfire
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green ﬂames, this incorporeal
undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the
center of the ﬂames usually resembles the witch’s idealized self-image, regardless
of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchﬁre often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays
around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o’-wisps, which seem to
have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchﬁre. A witchﬁre might visit
villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always
attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams.
A witchﬁre might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens,
but a witchﬁre is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.

ALIEN ALLIES
High-ranking or wealthy witchwyrds
rarely travel the planes alone,
employing bodyguards to accompany
them and leading entourages
composed of various strange beings
they’ve met during their travels.
Witchwyrd
Witchwyrds conceal most of their faces, leaving only their eyes unmasked. Their
inscrutability is a boon to one of their most signiﬁcant interests—mercantilism—
and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by
their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new
opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone
is trying to pull one over on them.
These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically
6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and
spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the
local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-ﬁtting clothes in bright reds or
yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions
of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This,
however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about
details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on
Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the
notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked,
many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these
queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars
have theorized a connection between
witchwyrds and several other four-armed
creatures, but like with questions of their
place of origin, witchwyrds have little to
say about the topic.

TERRITORIAL BEASTS
Wolverines are territorial animals
and ﬁercely defend their kills,
even from larger predators or
when they’re outnumbered. They
claim wide swaths of forests or
frozen tundra as their territory,
marking it with a pungent odor that
serves as a warning to those who
recognize the smell. Wolverines
have voracious appetites and tend to
aggressively devour their food with
reckless abandon.
Wolverine
Few creatures in the natural world can compare in ferocity to an angry wolverine.
WOLVERINE
Wolverines resemble small bears, to which they are related. Stocky and muscular
with long claws, wolverines are about 3 feet in length and weigh approximately 40
pounds. They have a thick fur coat that protects them from the cold temperatures
of the forests and frozen tundras where they reside.

its jaws Strike deals 1d8+7 damage, and its claw Strike deals 1d6+7 damage. While
raging, the wolverine can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait, except for Seek.
After it’s stopped raging, a wolverine can’t use Wolverine Rage again for 1 minute.
GIANT WOLVERINE
Giant wolverines grow to the approximate size of
horses and claim even more expansive territories
than their more diminutive wolverine cousins.

from armed humanoids, a giant wolverine is

OTHER WALKING VERMIN
While worms are the most common
type of creature to form the composite
body of a worm that walks, other
verminous variations are possible.
• Cockroaches: A worm that walks
made of cockroaches gains a +1 bonus
to AC and light blindness.
• Leeches: A worm that walks made of
leeches gains a swim Speed of 25 feet,
but its land Speed is 10 feet.
• Spiders: A worm that walks made
of spiders gains a climb Speed equal
to half its land Speed, and half the
damage from its Squirming Embrace
is poison damage.
Worm That Walks
When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and a
remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with eldritch
magic, a strange phenomenon can occur. The decaying body fattens and
instructs the very worms that feast upon it. These grave worms thrive not
only on the consumption of the spellcaster’s dead ﬂesh, but on their corrupt
memories and magical power. The spellcaster’s very soul is consumed in this
vile process, only to be split apart into fragments that inhabit each of the
individual worms. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known
as a worm that walks—a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the
body that granted it this new existence and can use the powers and magic
the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a
spellcaster before its death, but it is not undead—it is a hideous new form of
undulant life.
CREATING A WORM THAT WALKS
You can turn an existing evil, living, spellcasting creature into a worm that
walks using the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
• It gains the aberration and swarm traits and usually remains evil.
• Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modiﬁers by 1.
• Reduce its Hit Points by the amount listed on the table (to a minimum of 2
HP per level).
• The worm that walks gains fast healing, resistance to physical damage, and
weakness to area damage and splash damage as indicated in the table. These
abilities are the reason the worm that walks has fewer HP.

WORM THAt WALKS ABILItIES
A worm that walks loses any abilities that came from its previous physical form
and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. It retains
any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the
abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conﬂict with the
monster’s new theme as a worm that walks.
Darkvision
Tremorsense 30 feet (imprecise)
Immunities All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision,
and unconscious. They also have the swarm mind ability, which makes them immune
to mental eﬀects that target a speciﬁc number of creatures, though they are still
subject to mental eﬀects that aﬀect all creatures in an area.
All-Around Vision
Discorporate When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the
component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single
worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that
typically takes 1d10 days.
While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm
that walks’s foes have to dispatch the ﬂeeing worms before they escape, usually its
foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area eﬀect
or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed.
After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing
the damage must attempt a DC 15 ﬂat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage

================================================================================
PAGE 298
================================================================================

WORMS REDEEMED
In rare situations, once a spellcaster
rises as a worm that walks it might
recant its evil ways, given the right
inﬂuence and enough time. Many
of these worms that walk seek selfdestruction, not out of abhorrence at
their new form but at the realization
of the evils they wrought while alive.
Others, though, take advantage of
their second chance and use their
new life to help undo the ruin and
horror they might have aﬄicted upon
the world in their prior existence.
eﬀect performed on the area reduces the DC of this ﬂat check by 2, to a minimum of
DC 5. If any of these ﬂat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm
that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping
or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to ﬁnish oﬀ the worm
that walks.
Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with
reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If
it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as
the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should
deal three-quarters of that damage.
Squirming Embrace Ȱɵ The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a
space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an
additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a
basic Reﬂex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2.
Swarm Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm
of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While
discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions
and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small
enough for its individual worms to ﬁt without having
to Squeeze. It can use the same action to coalesce back
into its normal form.
WORM THAT WALKS
This worm that walks was a cultist of the Great Old One
Hastur in its prior life. It continues its conspiracies and
strives to further its evil plots in its new life.

DREAD WRAITH ORIGINS
The most unusual dread wraiths
are those that coalesce from an
amalgamation of evil spirits, often
in regions where such spirits are
shredded from their consciousnesses
and churned in foci of negative
energy, such as the Negative Energy
Plane or on the Isle of Terror.
Wraith, Dread
These menacing spiritual remnants of wicked warlords or bloodthirsty generals
are towering specters of shadow and death. Like other wraiths, dread wraiths
haunt the shadowy places of the world, but dread wraiths are more likely to travel
greater distances to sow terror or amass inﬂuence, often sticking to dark glades or
sinister ruins when journeying across sun-dappled lands. Dread wraiths tends to
be arrogant and rarely form a pack with others of their kind, preferring instead
to dominate groups of ordinary wraiths. A particularly powerful necromancer
might compel packs of dread wraiths into service, however, while a particularly
malevolent goal—such as to eradicate a bastion of light and life—might draw
several dread wraiths together in a common purpose.

essence of the target wraith, becoming quickened and gaining a
+10-foot status bonus to its ﬂy Speed for a number of rounds
equal to the level of the absorbed wraith. It can use its
extra action only to Fly or Strike. An unwilling target can
attempt a DC 28 Will save to resist being absorbed.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the dread wraith
damages a living creature with its spectral hand
Strike, the wraith gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the target must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude

life or wraith spawn. If the creator of the wraith spawn dies,
the wraith spawn becomes a full-ﬂedged, autonomous wraith; it
regains its free will and gains drain life and wraith spawn.

THE ETHER WAR
Xills see Material Plane creatures as
little more than incubators, but the
need for fresh hosts never abates,
for on their home plane, xills are
constantly at war. Only the relative
emptiness of the Ethereal Plane
keeps their conﬂict with creatures
like ether spiders from becoming too
overwhelming and outpacing the speed
at which new ranks of soldiers can
replace those who have fallen.
Xill
Xills visit the Material Plane, where they’re often known as ethereal stalkers,
primarily to maraud and to kidnap creatures back to their native Ethereal Plane.
These four-armed, warmongering monsters paralyze their victims before implanting
them with eggs using an ovipositor normally kept retracted behind their mandibles.
Their single-minded drive to expand and conquer is so all-encompassing that while
they work together dutifully and without dissent, there is little else in their lives.

paralysis for 1 minute.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is paralyzed for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is paralyzed. It can
attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns
to recover, and the save DC decreases by 1 each round.

MASSIVE MUSK CREEPERS
Ancient or specially cultivated musk
creepers can grow to great size. Their
pollen often changes color as they
grow, and pollen of diﬀerent colors can
alter the creeper’s thralls in diﬀerent
ways. Some creepers even become
intelligent after they’re awakened by
primal magic. These few exert far more
control over their thralls.
Yellow Musk Creeper
Made up of thick, green vines with numerous yellow ﬂowers, the yellow musk
creeper grows at places where the ground is enriched with spilled blood and corpses,
like battleﬁelds and graveyards. An ideal environment for the yellow musk creeper
isn’t inhabited, but draws occasional humanoid visitors the plant can transform into
thralls. The yellow musk creeper enraptures creatures with its bright yellow pollen
to bring them close. It then physically alters their brains with its tendrils, implanting
a seed in each to turn the creatures into mindless thralls. The yellow musk creeper
might try to take over a sleeping creature, but it lacks the faculties to sneak up on
anyone, and is likely to wake victims before it can drag itself close enough.
The plant’s pollen can spread far on the wind but quickly becomes too diffuse to
cause harm. Wilderness scouts learn to sniff out the distinctive musky scent of the
pollen, which stays potent even in harmless quantities. A sprouting creeper is also
easy to detect, since it grows from the rotting, messy corpse of a thrall creature.

Bore into Brain ̂ˬ (manipulate, mental) The creeper bores dozens
of tendrils into the brain of a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid
creature that’s unconscious, willing, or fascinated by Spray Pollen,
and within reach of the creeper’s tendrils. The creature must succeed
at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become stupeﬁed 1 (stupeﬁed 2
on a critical failure). Subsequent failed saves against Bore
into Brain increase the stupeﬁed value. If the creature
reaches stupeﬁed 5, it is turned into a yellow musk thrall
(see below). Boring into a creature’s brain doesn’t end
fascination caused by Spray Pollen.
Spray Pollen ʚʖ (mental, poison) The yellow musk creeper
blasts yellow pollen in either a 30-foot line or a 15-foot
cone. Each creature in the emanation must attempt a DC
20 Will save. Once a creature succeeds at any save against
Spray Pollen, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is fascinated. For as long as it is fascinated, it must
spend each of its actions to move closer to the yellow musk creeper
as expediently as possible, while avoiding obvious dangers. If the
creature is adjacent to the yellow musk creeper, it stays still
and doesn’t act.
Critical Failure As failure, but the condition doesn’t
end automatically. The creature can attempt
a new save at the end of each of its
turns. On a success, the fascinated
condition and other eﬀects end.

RECOVERY FROM THRALLDOM
A creature that’s transformed into a
yellow musk thrall or brute doesn’t
die right away, although it no longer
retains its personality, memories,
or abilities as long as it exists as a
thrall. Within the ﬁrst few days after
its transformation, a thrall or brute

creature becomes a Small thrall rather than a Medium one). The transformation
takes 1 hour. A yellow musk thrall takes only the most rudimentary of actions:
bringing the yellow musk creeper water and new creatures to infest. After a few
days (or if the creeper dies), the thrall wanders off into the wilderness and falls dead
within 24 hours. The body of a deceased thrall sprouts a new yellow musk creeper
within hours of its death, becoming a fully grown plant within 24 hours.

YETH HOUND ALLIES
When an evil cult engages the
services of a yeth hound, the
process is more like forging an
alliance than animal training. Yeth
hound allies can provide much more
complex services than a typical
animal, but they also present the
risk of possible treachery.
Yeth Hound
Wicked canine creatures who live for the thrill of the hunt, yeth hounds often
serve evil masters as guardians and trackers. Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek
dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the
ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent,
although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate
tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside
when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten
and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a
dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to
corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their
lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from
the hounds’ previous meals.
Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt
only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a
subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their
prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight,
working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when
then can’t simply overpower and kill them.
Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound
servants by ﬁendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to
turn against those who fail to advance the patrons’ wicked aims. The cult of
Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.

fails and is within 60 feet of the

ZOMOKS’ PRIMAL CALL
Zomoks can use primal call without
needing any secondary casters. The
zomok typically calls an awakened
tree, arboreal, or shambler, and
often tasks the called creature
with guarding a sacred location,
accompanying an ally on a mission
for the good of the forest, or a
similar assignment.
Zomok
Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes
from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural
disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons,
growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in
the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow
their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically
left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest
Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.

throw. Creatures touching the ground that fail their saves take a 10-foot

Ability Glossary
The following creature abilities are listed here because
they are shared by many creatures or are highly complex.
The statistics for individual creatures might alter the
traits, the number of actions, or other rules of these
abilities. Anything noted in a speciﬁc creature’s stat
block overrides the general rules for the ability below.
In these abilities, “monster” is used for the creature
that has the ability, to differentiate it from any other
creatures the ability might affect.
All-Around Vision This monster can see in all directions
simultaneously, and therefore can’t be ﬂanked.
Aquatic Ambush Ȱɵ Requirements The monster is hiding in
water and a creature that hasn’t detected it is within the
listed number of feet; Eﬀect The monster moves up to
its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature,
traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in
reach, the monster makes a Strike against it. The creature is
ﬂat-footed against this Strike.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within the
monster’s reach uses a manipulate action or a move action,
makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move
action it’s using; Eﬀect The monster attempts a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical
hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster
disrupts that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward the
monster’s multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack
penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
At-Will Spells The monster can cast its at-will spells any
number of times without using up spell slots.
Aura A monster’s aura automatically aﬀects everything within
a speciﬁed emanation around that monster. The monster
doesn’t need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura’s
eﬀects are applied at speciﬁc times, such as when a creature
ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.
If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists
only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal
this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura
and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature
can take damage from the aura only once per round.
The GM might determine that a monster’s aura doesn’t
aﬀect its own allies. For example, a creature might be
immune to a monster’s frightful presence if they have been
around each other for a long time.
Buck Ǻȓ Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to
buck oﬀ unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts
will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless
the mounts are spooked or mistreated; Trigger A creature
Mounts or uses the Command an Animal action while riding
the monster; Eﬀect The triggering creature must succeed
at a Reﬂex saving throw against the listed DC or fall oﬀ the
creature and land prone. If the save is a critical failure, the
triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in
addition to the normal damage for the fall.
Catch Rock Ǻȓ Requirements The monster must have a free hand
but can Release anything it’s holding as part of this reaction;
Trigger The monster is targeted with a thrown rock Strike
or a rock would fall on the monster; Eﬀect The monster
gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the
triggering attack or to any defense against the falling rock.
If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends
against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes
no damage, and is now holding the rock.
Change Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
[magical
tradition],
polymorph, transmutation) The monster changes its shape
indeﬁnitely. It can use this action again to return to its
natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise
noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear
as a speciﬁc individual. Using Change Shape counts as
creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception.
The monster’s transformation automatically defeats
Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is
a member of the ancestry or creature type into which
it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its
Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its
disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the
monster can adopt. The monster doesn’t gain any special
abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For
example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and
Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size.
Any changes are listed in its stat block.
Constant Spells A constant spell aﬀects the monster without
the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited.
If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can
reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions
the spell requires.
Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of damage
to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained by it.
Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save
with the listed DC.
Coven (divination, mental, occult) This monster can form a
coven with two or more other creatures who also have the
coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony
with all prospective coven members. After the coven
is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments
(page 6), adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members
can sense other members’ locations and conditions by
spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait,
and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a
two‑action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.
Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members,
but these can be cast only in cooperation between three
coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another.
A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a
single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal
component. If two coven members have contributed these
actions within the last round, a third member can cast a
coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting
actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited
number of times but can cast only one coven spell each
round. All covens grant the 8th-level baleful polymorph
spell and all the following spells, which the coven can
cast at any level up to 5th: augury, charm, clairaudience,

================================================================================
PAGE 306
================================================================================

clairvoyance, dream message, illusory disguise, illusory
scene, prying eye, and talking corpse. Individual creatures
with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any
coven they join. A coven can also cast the control weather
ritual (Core Rulebook 411), with a DC of 23 instead of the
standard DC.
If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a
coven member brings the coven below three members,
the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for
24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the
necessary actions, they can’t cast coven spells.
Darkvision A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well
in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in
black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such
as a 4th-level darkness spell, block normal darkvision. A
monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through
even these forms of magical darkness.
Disease When a creature is exposed to a monster’s disease, it
attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The
level of a disease is the level of the monster inﬂicting the
disease. The disease follows the rules for aﬄictions found
on page 457 of the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook.
Engulf ʚʖ The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can
move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any
creature of the monster’s size or smaller whose space the
monster moves through can attempt a Reﬂex save with the
listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act
automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds
at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of
the monster’s path) or pushed in front of the monster to the
end of the monster’s movement. The monster can attempt
to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of
Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can
ﬁt in its space.
A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster’s
body. It is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath
or start suﬀocating. The creature takes the listed amount
of damage when ﬁrst engulfed and at the end of each of
its turns while it’s engulfed. An engulfed creature can get
free by Escaping against the listed Escape DC. An engulfed
creature can attack the monster engulﬁng it, but only with
unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The
engulﬁng creature is ﬂat-footed against the attack. If the
monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or
exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or
spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that
gets free by either method can immediately breathe and
exits the engulﬁng monster’s space.
If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are
automatically released as the monster’s form loses cohesion.
Fast Healing A monster with this ability regains the given
number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.
Ferocity Ǻȓ Trigger The monster is reduced to 0 HP; Eﬀect The
monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but
its wounded value increases by 1. When it is wounded 3, it
can no longer use this ability.
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A creature
that ﬁrst enters the area must attempt a Will save.
Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature
is temporarily immune to this monster’s Frightful Presence
for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected by the presence.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4.
Grab Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a
success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry,
or it has a creature grabbed using this action; Eﬀect The
monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the
monster’s next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever
body part the monster attacked with, and that body part
can’t be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended.
Using Grab extends the duration of the monster’s Grab
until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it.
A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of
the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the
monster moves away from it.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of
damage to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained
by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude
save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save
falls unconscious, and a creature that succeeds is then
temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater
Constrict for 1 minute.
Improved Grab, Improved Knockdown, or Improved Push
Ȳ˓ The monster can use Grab, Knockdown, or Push (as
appropriate) as a free action triggered by a hit with its
initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs
to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it
already has grabbed.
Knockdown Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was
a success with a Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage
entry; Eﬀect The monster knocks the target prone.
Lifesense Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital
essence of living and undead creatures within the listed
range. The sense can distinguish between the positive
energy animating living creatures and the negative
energy animating undead creatures, much as sight
distinguishes colors.
Light Blindness When ﬁrst exposed to bright light, the
monster is blinded until the end of its next turn. After this
exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it
spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster
is in an area of bright light, it’s dazzled.
Low-Light Vision The monster can see in dim light as though
it were bright light, so it ignores the concealed condition
due to dim light.
Negative Healing A creature with negative healing draws
health from negative energy rather than positive energy.
It is damaged by positive damage and is not healed by
positive healing eﬀects. It does not take negative damage,
and it is healed by negative eﬀects that heal undead.
Poison When a creature is exposed to a monster’s poison,
it attempts a Fortitude save to avoid becoming poisoned.

================================================================================
PAGE 307
================================================================================

Bestiary 2
The level of a poison is the level of the monster inﬂicting
the poison. The poison follows the rules for aﬄictions
found on page 457 of the Core Rulebook.
Push Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a success
with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry; Eﬀect The
monster automatically knocks the target away from the
monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description,
the creature is pushed 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit,
this distance is doubled.
Regeneration This monster regains the listed number of Hit
Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its dying
condition never increases beyond dying 3 as long as its
regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a
type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration
deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the
regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type,
since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it
to dying 4.
Rend Ȱɵ A Rend entry lists a Strike the monster has;
Requirements The monster hit the same enemy with two
consecutive Strikes of the listed type in the same round;
Eﬀect The monster automatically deals that Strike’s damage
again to the enemy.
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ Trigger An enemy damages the
monster’s ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster;
Eﬀect The ally gains resistance to all damage against the
triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster’s level. If the
foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee Strike
against it.
Scent Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell,
and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability,
and it functions only if the creature or object being detected
emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually
do not exude an aroma).
If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM
can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to
detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a
creature is downwind.
Shield Block Ǻȓ Trigger The monster has its shield raised and
takes damage from a physical attack; Eﬀect The monster
snaps its shield into place to deﬂect a blow. The shield
prevents the monster from taking an amount of damage
up to the shield’s Hardness. The monster and the shield
each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or
destroying the shield.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) The monster attempts to swallow
a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed in
its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum
size listed, the monster can’t use Swallow Whole again.
If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster
can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines
the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check
opposed by the grabbed creature’s Reﬂex DC. If it succeeds,
it swallows the creature. The monster’s mouth or jaws no
longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is
free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster
can’t attack creatures it has swallowed.
A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to
hold its breath or start suﬀocating. The swallowed creature
takes the listed amount of damage when ﬁrst swallowed
and at the end of each of its turns while it’s swallowed. If
the victim Escapes this ability’s grabbed condition, it exits
through the monster’s mouth. This frees any other creature
grabbed in the monster’s mouth or jaws. A swallowed
creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but
only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk
or less. The swallowing creature is ﬂat-footed against the
attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage
equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single
attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A
creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself
free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing
monster’s space.
If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be
freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend
a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open
with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or
slashing damage.
Swarm Mind This monster doesn’t have a single mind
(typically because it’s a swarm of smaller creatures), and is
immune to mental eﬀects that target only a speciﬁc number
of creatures. It is still subject to mental eﬀects that aﬀect all
creatures in an area.
Telepathy (aura, divination, magical) A monster with
telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures
within the listed radius, as long as they share a language.
This doesn’t give any special access to their thoughts,
and communicates no more information than normal
speech would.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ The monster interacts to pick up a rock within
reach or retrieve a stowed rock and throws it, making a
ranged Strike.
Trample ̂ˬ The monster Strides up to double its Speed
and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed
size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The
monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only
once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the
damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can
attempt a basic Reﬂex save at the listed DC (no damage on
a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage
on a critical failure).
Tremorsense Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the
vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement.
It is usually an imprecise sense with a limited range
(listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the
monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only
if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the
surface.
Wavesense This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations
caused by movement through a liquid. It’s usually an
imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).
Wavesense functions only if the monster and the subject
are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is
moving through the liquid.

Creature Traits
Some of these traits appear in the Core Rulebook, while
others are new to this book and the ﬁrst Bestiary.
Rarity Traits
Unless the creature is common, its trait list starts with a
rarity trait. Creatures that don’t start with a rarity trait
have the common rarity.
Common A creature of this rarity is generally known and can
be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.
Uncommon Less is known about uncommon creatures than
common creatures. They typically can’t be summoned. The
DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 2.
Rare As the name suggests, these creatures are rare. They
typically can’t be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge
checks related to this creature is increased by 5.
Unique A creature with this rarity is one of a kind. The DC
of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 10.
Alignment Trait Abbreviation
Following any listed rarity trait is one of nine alignment
trait abbreviations. They are listed below with the
alignment traits that these abbreviations represent.
General descriptions of alignments are found on pages
28–29 of the Core Rulebook.
CE Chaotic and evil
CG Chaotic and good
CN Chaotic and neutral
LG Lawful and good
LE Lawful and evil
LN Lawful and neutral
N Neutral
NE Neutral and evil
NG Neutral and good
Size
After any listed rarity trait and the alignment
abbreviation, each creature has its size listed
before its other traits.
Gargantuan This size of creature takes up a space
of at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but
can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have a
reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are long,
but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
Huge A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot space (9
squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15 feet if the
creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
Large A Large creature takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot space
(4 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 10 feet if
the creature is tall or 5 feet if the creature is long.
Medium A Medium creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Small A Small creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Tiny A creature of this size takes up less than a 5-foot-by-5-foot
space (1 square on the grid), and multiple Tiny creatures
can occupy the same square on the grid. At least four Tiny
creatures can occupy the same square, and even more
can occupy the same square, at the GM’s discretion. They
can also occupy the same space as larger creatures, and
if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.
Other Traits
After any rarity traits, the alignment abbreviation, and
the size, each creature’s trait line lists all other traits the
creature has in alphabetical order. The following is a list
of those traits found in the book.
Aberration Aberrations are creatures from beyond the planes
or corruptions of the natural order.
Acid Creatures with this trait are primarily constituted of acid
or have a magical connection to it.

================================================================================

Bestiary 2
and inevitables communicate via a strange telepathic
hodgepodge of sensory sending called envisioning.
Air Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a
magical connection to that element.
Amphibious An amphibious creature can breathe in water and
in air, even outside of its preferred environment, usually
indeﬁnitely but at least for hours. These creatures often
have a swim Speed. Their bludgeoning and slashing unarmed
Strikes don’t take the usual –2 penalty for being underwater.
Angel This family of celestials is native to the plane of Nirvana.
Most angels are neutral good, have darkvision, and have a
weakness to evil damage.
Animal An animal is a creature with a relatively low
intelligence. It typically doesn’t have an Intelligence modiﬁer
above –4, can’t speak languages, and can’t be trained in

Construct A construct is an artiﬁcial creature empowered
by a force other than necromancy. Constructs are often
mindless; they are immune to bleed damage, death
eﬀects, disease, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks,
poison, and the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed,
sickened, and unconscious conditions; and they may
have Hardness based on the materials used to construct
their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are
they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct
creature is destroyed.
Couatl A family of supernatural feathered serpents who serve
as guardians and messengers on the Material Plane for
various good-aligned divinities.
Daemon A family of ﬁends spawned on the desolate plane
of Abaddon, most daemons are neutral evil. They

the fetchling ancestry. Fetchlings were once human,
but generations of life on the Shadow Plane have
transformed them.
Fey Creatures of the First World are called the fey.
Fiend Creatures that hail from or have a strong connection
to the evil-aligned planes are called ﬁends. Fiends can

Incorporeal An incorporeal creature or object has no physical
form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls.
When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can’t perceive,
attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it
starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures
can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can’t end
their movement in its space.
An incorporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based checks
against physical creatures or objects—only against incorporeal
ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune.
Likewise, a corporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based
checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.
Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to eﬀects
or conditions that require a physical body, like disease,
poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance
against all damage (except force damage and damage from
Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double
the resistance against non-magical damage.
Inevitable These constructed aeons were created by the
axiomites. Each type of inevitable is dedicated to a speciﬁc
task. Most inevitables have weakness to chaotic damage.
Leshy Leshys are small, roughly humanoid plant creatures.
Magical Something with the magical trait is imbued with
magical energies not tied to a speciﬁc tradition of magic.

tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane,
divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait.
Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.
Mindless A mindless creature has either programmed or
rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental
ability modiﬁers are –5. They are immune to all mental eﬀects.
Monitor Creatures that hail from or have a strong connection

Energy Plane. They can survive the basic environmental
eﬀects of the Negative Energy Plane.

to have low mental ability scores and immunity to mental

these creatures are guardians of disorder and are chaotic
neutral. They typically have darkvision, an amorphous
anatomy, and a weakness to lawful damage.

Boneyard to convey souls to the Outer Planes, most
psychopomps are true neutral. They typically have
darkvision, lifesense, and spirit touch, and they are immune
to death eﬀects.

qlippoth are chaotic evil. Their appearance aﬀects the
minds of non-qlippoth that view them.

Plane. They can survive the basic environmental eﬀects of
the Shadow Plane.

Bestiary 2
Spriggan Kin to gnomes, spriggans tend to be evil and can
grow in size to resemble giants.
Suli Sulis are planar scions descended from jann.
Swarm A swarm is a mass or cloud of creatures that functions
as one monster. Its size entry gives the size of the entire
mass, though for most swarms the individual creatures
that make up that mass are Tiny. A swarm can occupy the
same space as other creatures, and must do so in order to
use its damaging action. A swarm typically has weakness
to eﬀects that deal damage over an area (like area spells
and splash weapons). Swarms are immune to the grappled,
prone, and restrained conditions.
Sylph Sylphs are planar scions descended from djinn.
Tane The Tane are powerful creatures created eons ago by the
Eldest of the First World. All of the Tane treat whatever
plane they happen to be on as their home plane.

They do not age, and while some may be driven by
supernatural hungers, they do not need to eat or drink to
survive. They can survive the basic environmental eﬀects
of the Dimension of Time.
Troll Trolls are giant, brutish creatures and are well known for
their ability to regenerate.
Undead Once living, these creatures were infused after death
with negative energy and soul-corrupting evil magic. When
reduced to 0 Hit Points, an undead creature is destroyed.

by negative energy, and don’t beneﬁt from healing eﬀects.

daemons, have transparent skin, and drink blood.
Vampire Undead creatures who thirst for blood, vampires are

form of disturbing gaze.
Water Creatures with this trait are primarily constituted of
water or have a magical connection to the element.
Wight A wight is an undead creature that drains life and
stands vigil over its burial site.
Werecreature These shapechanging creatures either are naturally
able to shift between animal, humanoid, and hybrid forms or
are aﬄicted with a curse that forces them to shift involuntarily.
Wraith A wraith is an incorporeal undead creature infused
with negative energy and driven by a hatred of all life.
Weapon Traits
The bonuses from these weapons traits are included in
creatures’ statistics, but the traits appear because they’re
relevant for the clumsy and enfeebled conditions.
Brutal A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength
modifier instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.
Finesse This melee attack is Dexterity based. Even if
a weapon normally has the finesse trait, this trait is
omitted in the Strike entry if the monster is applying
its Strength.

Some creatures from the Outer Planes can use special
rituals to call their kin or transport themselves to another
plane. These are the rituals used by various creatures in
this book.
