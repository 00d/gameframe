a DC 26 Will save or be slowed 1 indeﬁnitely. An aﬀected creature can choose to roll
twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.
ZELEKHUT
A zelekhut is a bounty hunter and executioner. The zelekhut resembles a mechanical
centaur crafted from silvery metal with golden clockwork wings adorning its back.
Instead of hands, the zelekhut’s arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with
electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities,
the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice—either through active
ﬂight, or by abusing their power and station—so as to bring justice to the multiverse’s
most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut’s quarry are as
famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.
Though the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in
enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own
or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While
hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a
dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn’t shift a single hoof to capture a
corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand
that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the
zelekhut’s job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments
and track down those who seek to ﬂee their punishment.

The
zelekhut makes two

targeting a diﬀerent
creature. Each Strike counts toward the zelekhut’s multiple
attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after it has
made both attacks. If the zelekhut subsequently uses the Knockdown action, it aﬀects
all creatures it hit with Double Attack.
PARADOX AND UNITY
To mortals, aeons sometimes
seem to combine elements that
are fundamentally incompatible,
whether it’s an aeon combining
opposing concepts, or axiomites and
inevitables mixing the organic with
the mathematical or mechanical.
Aeons see no paradox in this, but
rather claim it is an expression of the
underlying unity of all things.

Bestiary 2
MARUT
A marut is tasked with hunting mortals who cheat death by artiﬁcially extending
their lifespans. This includes those who seek undeath, such as liches and
vampires, but also includes those who use powerful magic to cling to their youth,
use divination to discover and avoid an appointed death, or call too often on
the power of resurrection. Once the marut has selected its target, the inevitable
pursues its quarry without surcease or deviation until either it or the target
is dead.
Maruts seem to be carved from stone and clad in golden armor, yet they move
with the deliberate grace of a creature made of ﬂesh and bone. A marut never
rushes, but its thunderous footfalls are relentless as it pursues its target. Though
able to speak any language, the marut is taciturn even among inevitables.

Bestiary 2
THE HIERARCHY OF HELL
Hell is a harsh plane of law with little
use for compassion or empathy. As
such, it exists entirely within a strict
hierarchy, and this order extends to
its denizens. While diﬀerent types of
demons correspond to various sins
and daemons are associated with
modes of mortal death, the diﬀerent
types of devils exist solely to fulﬁll
particular roles in the infernal
machine. On occasion, a particular
devil can transcend the role for
which they were literally shaped,
but this often transforms the devil
physically into the type suitable for
their new role.
Devil
Each type of devil plays a particular role in Hell’s bureaucracies and hierarchies,
though some have far more specialized functions than others.
ZEBUB (ACCUSER DEVIL)
Zebubs serve as Hell’s messengers and spies. Their ability to share what they’ve seen
with other creatures makes them especially useful—not only to other devils, but also
to mortal conjurers. Some infernal lords unleash them in enormous, horrid swarms
upon unsuspecting lands to debase ﬂesh and land alike while collecting secrets the
infernal host might later put to use. Zebubs use any opportunity to manipulate
weak-willed or easily tempted mortals into serving the zebubs’ whims. While
arrogant and deceitful, zebubs lack the cunning and conﬁdence of most devils, and
thus their schemes often focus on satisfying self-serving or self-destructive ambitions.
Zebubs form from the souls of childish and craven mortals, reshaped by the archdevil
Baalzebul in the frozen, ﬁlthy wastes of Hell’s seventh layer, Cocytus.

Infernal Eye ̂ˬ (divine, divination) The zebub records everything they see,
and though they don’t remember all observations, they can pass them along
to another creature. The zebub replays 10 minutes of witnessed
events to a touched willing creature, which receives the memories
in a ﬂash of information. By remaining in contact, the zebub can
spend additional 3-action activities to replay more information. After relaying
their visions to another, the zebub can’t ever recall those events again.
Sneak Attack The zebub’s Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage to
ﬂat-footed creatures.
SARGLAGON (DROWNING DEVIL)
Sarglagons dwell in Hell’s myriad waterways, lakes, and oceans. They serve
as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the
ﬁfth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and
can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness.
Few ﬁends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river
crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their
infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the
ﬁends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway’s memory-sapping
qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious
secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons
sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what
they did to earn their unwanted protectors’ attention. The constant uninvited
vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stiﬂing to their wards.

HELLFIRE
Stinking, sulfurous hellﬁre is infused
with evil. Hellﬁre always deals a
combination of ﬁre damage and evil
damage, though the speciﬁc ratio
depends on the hellﬁre’s origin. Certain
types of hellﬁre can impose other
eﬀects on creatures as well, such as
sapping their strength or memories.

# ZOMOK
================================================================================


ZOMOKS’ PRIMAL CALL
Zomoks can use primal call without
needing any secondary casters. The
zomok typically calls an awakened
tree, arboreal, or shambler, and
often tasks the called creature
with guarding a sacred location,
accompanying an ally on a mission
for the good of the forest, or a
similar assignment.
Zomok
Mighty plant-dragons, zomoks prowl the woodlands, defending their homes
from destructive forces while healing and restoring the woods following natural
disasters and ravaging intruders. Zomoks vary in appearance with the seasons,
growing verdant green in the spring and summer, changing to autumnal colors in
the fall, and decaying to brown in winter. While zomoks can and often do swallow
their foes, they have no real need to eat. Any creature they gulp down is typically
left behind as a mangled corpse the next time the zomok travels via their Forest
Step ability. Zomoks reach 35 to 40 feet in length and weigh 30 tons.

Reﬂex save); prone creatures take a –2 circumstance penalty to this saving
throw. Creatures touching the ground that fail their saves take a 10-foot

on a critical failure. The zomok can’t use Entombing Breath again
for 1d4 rounds.

Ability Glossary
The following creature abilities are listed here because
they are shared by many creatures or are highly complex.
The statistics for individual creatures might alter the
traits, the number of actions, or other rules of these
abilities. Anything noted in a speciﬁc creature’s stat
block overrides the general rules for the ability below.
In these abilities, “monster” is used for the creature
that has the ability, to differentiate it from any other
creatures the ability might affect.
All-Around Vision This monster can see in all directions
simultaneously, and therefore can’t be ﬂanked.
Aquatic Ambush Ȱɵ Requirements The monster is hiding in
water and a creature that hasn’t detected it is within the
listed number of feet; Eﬀect The monster moves up to
its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature,
traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in
reach, the monster makes a Strike against it. The creature is
ﬂat-footed against this Strike.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within the
monster’s reach uses a manipulate action or a move action,
makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move
action it’s using; Eﬀect The monster attempts a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical
hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster
disrupts that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward the
monster’s multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack
penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
At-Will Spells The monster can cast its at-will spells any
number of times without using up spell slots.
Aura A monster’s aura automatically aﬀects everything within
a speciﬁed emanation around that monster. The monster
doesn’t need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura’s
eﬀects are applied at speciﬁc times, such as when a creature
ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.
If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists
only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal
this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura
and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature
can take damage from the aura only once per round.
The GM might determine that a monster’s aura doesn’t
aﬀect its own allies. For example, a creature might be
immune to a monster’s frightful presence if they have been
around each other for a long time.
Buck Ǻȓ Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to
buck oﬀ unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts
will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless
the mounts are spooked or mistreated; Trigger A creature
Mounts or uses the Command an Animal action while riding
the monster; Eﬀect The triggering creature must succeed
at a Reﬂex saving throw against the listed DC or fall oﬀ the
creature and land prone. If the save is a critical failure, the
triggering creature also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage in
addition to the normal damage for the fall.
Catch Rock Ǻȓ Requirements The monster must have a free hand
but can Release anything it’s holding as part of this reaction;
Trigger The monster is targeted with a thrown rock Strike
or a rock would fall on the monster; Eﬀect The monster
gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the
triggering attack or to any defense against the falling rock.
If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends
against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes
no damage, and is now holding the rock.
Change Shape
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
[magical
tradition],
polymorph, transmutation) The monster changes its shape
indeﬁnitely. It can use this action again to return to its
natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise
noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear
as a speciﬁc individual. Using Change Shape counts as
creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception.
The monster’s transformation automatically defeats
Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is
a member of the ancestry or creature type into which
it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its
Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its
disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the
monster can adopt. The monster doesn’t gain any special
abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For
example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and
Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size.
Any changes are listed in its stat block.
Constant Spells A constant spell aﬀects the monster without
the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited.
If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can
reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions
the spell requires.
Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of damage
to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained by it.
Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save
with the listed DC.
Coven (divination, mental, occult) This monster can form a
coven with two or more other creatures who also have the
coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony
with all prospective coven members. After the coven
is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments
(page 6), adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members
can sense other members’ locations and conditions by
spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait,
and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a
two‑action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.
Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members,
but these can be cast only in cooperation between three
coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another.
A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a
single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal
component. If two coven members have contributed these
actions within the last round, a third member can cast a
coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting
actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited
number of times but can cast only one coven spell each
round. All covens grant the 8th-level baleful polymorph
spell and all the following spells, which the coven can
cast at any level up to 5th: augury, charm, clairaudience,

================================================================================
PAGE 306
================================================================================

clairvoyance, dream message, illusory disguise, illusory
scene, prying eye, and talking corpse. Individual creatures
with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any
coven they join. A coven can also cast the control weather
ritual (Core Rulebook 411), with a DC of 23 instead of the
standard DC.
If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a
coven member brings the coven below three members,
the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for
24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the
necessary actions, they can’t cast coven spells.
Darkvision A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well
in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in
black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such
as a 4th-level darkness spell, block normal darkvision. A
monster with greater darkvision, however, can see through
even these forms of magical darkness.
Disease When a creature is exposed to a monster’s disease, it
attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The
level of a disease is the level of the monster inﬂicting the
disease. The disease follows the rules for aﬄictions found
on page 457 of the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook.
Engulf ʚʖ The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can
move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any
creature of the monster’s size or smaller whose space the
monster moves through can attempt a Reﬂex save with the
listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act
automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds
at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of
the monster’s path) or pushed in front of the monster to the
end of the monster’s movement. The monster can attempt
to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of
Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can
ﬁt in its space.
A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster’s
body. It is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath
or start suﬀocating. The creature takes the listed amount
of damage when ﬁrst engulfed and at the end of each of
its turns while it’s engulfed. An engulfed creature can get
free by Escaping against the listed Escape DC. An engulfed
creature can attack the monster engulﬁng it, but only with
unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The
engulﬁng creature is ﬂat-footed against the attack. If the
monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or
exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or
spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that
gets free by either method can immediately breathe and
exits the engulﬁng monster’s space.
If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are
automatically released as the monster’s form loses cohesion.
Fast Healing A monster with this ability regains the given
number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.
Ferocity Ǻȓ Trigger The monster is reduced to 0 HP; Eﬀect The
monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but
its wounded value increases by 1. When it is wounded 3, it
can no longer use this ability.
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) A creature
that ﬁrst enters the area must attempt a Will save.
Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature
is temporarily immune to this monster’s Frightful Presence
for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected by the presence.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4.
Grab Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a
success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry,
or it has a creature grabbed using this action; Eﬀect The
monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the
monster’s next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever
body part the monster attacked with, and that body part
can’t be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended.
Using Grab extends the duration of the monster’s Grab
until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it.
A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of
the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the
monster moves away from it.
Greater Constrict Ȱɵ The monster deals the listed amount of
damage to any number of creatures grabbed or restrained
by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude
save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save
falls unconscious, and a creature that succeeds is then
temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater
Constrict for 1 minute.
Improved Grab, Improved Knockdown, or Improved Push
Ȳ˓ The monster can use Grab, Knockdown, or Push (as
appropriate) as a free action triggered by a hit with its
initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs
to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it
already has grabbed.
Knockdown Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was
a success with a Strike that lists Knockdown in its damage
entry; Eﬀect The monster knocks the target prone.
Lifesense Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital
essence of living and undead creatures within the listed
range. The sense can distinguish between the positive
energy animating living creatures and the negative
energy animating undead creatures, much as sight
distinguishes colors.
Light Blindness When ﬁrst exposed to bright light, the
monster is blinded until the end of its next turn. After this
exposure, light doesn’t blind the monster again until after it
spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster
is in an area of bright light, it’s dazzled.
Low-Light Vision The monster can see in dim light as though
it were bright light, so it ignores the concealed condition
due to dim light.
Negative Healing A creature with negative healing draws
health from negative energy rather than positive energy.
It is damaged by positive damage and is not healed by
positive healing eﬀects. It does not take negative damage,
and it is healed by negative eﬀects that heal undead.
Poison When a creature is exposed to a monster’s poison,
it attempts a Fortitude save to avoid becoming poisoned.

================================================================================
PAGE 307
================================================================================

Bestiary 2
The level of a poison is the level of the monster inﬂicting
the poison. The poison follows the rules for aﬄictions
found on page 457 of the Core Rulebook.
Push Ȱɵ Requirements The monster’s last action was a success
with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry; Eﬀect The
monster automatically knocks the target away from the
monster. Unless otherwise noted in the ability description,
the creature is pushed 5 feet. If the attack was a critical hit,
this distance is doubled.
Regeneration This monster regains the listed number of Hit
Points each round at the beginning of its turn. Its dying
condition never increases beyond dying 3 as long as its
regeneration is active. However, if it takes damage of a
type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration
deactivates until the end of its next turn. Deactivate the
regeneration before applying any damage of a listed type,
since that damage might kill the monster by bringing it
to dying 4.
Rend Ȱɵ A Rend entry lists a Strike the monster has;
Requirements The monster hit the same enemy with two
consecutive Strikes of the listed type in the same round;
Eﬀect The monster automatically deals that Strike’s damage
again to the enemy.
Retributive Strike Ǻȓ Trigger An enemy damages the
monster’s ally, and both are within 15 feet of the monster;
Eﬀect The ally gains resistance to all damage against the
triggering damage equal to 2 + the monster’s level. If the
foe is within reach, the monster makes a melee Strike
against it.
Scent Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell,
and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability,
and it functions only if the creature or object being detected
emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually
do not exude an aroma).
If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM
can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to
detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a
creature is downwind.
Shield Block Ǻȓ Trigger The monster has its shield raised and
takes damage from a physical attack; Eﬀect The monster
snaps its shield into place to deﬂect a blow. The shield
prevents the monster from taking an amount of damage
up to the shield’s Hardness. The monster and the shield
each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or
destroying the shield.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ (attack) The monster attempts to swallow
a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed in
its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum
size listed, the monster can’t use Swallow Whole again.
If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster
can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines
the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check
opposed by the grabbed creature’s Reﬂex DC. If it succeeds,
it swallows the creature. The monster’s mouth or jaws no
longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is
free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster
can’t attack creatures it has swallowed.
A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to
hold its breath or start suﬀocating. The swallowed creature
takes the listed amount of damage when ﬁrst swallowed
and at the end of each of its turns while it’s swallowed. If
the victim Escapes this ability’s grabbed condition, it exits
through the monster’s mouth. This frees any other creature
grabbed in the monster’s mouth or jaws. A swallowed
creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but
only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk
or less. The swallowing creature is ﬂat-footed against the
attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage
equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single
attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A
creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself
free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing
monster’s space.
If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be
freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend
a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open
with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or
slashing damage.
Swarm Mind This monster doesn’t have a single mind
(typically because it’s a swarm of smaller creatures), and is
immune to mental eﬀects that target only a speciﬁc number
of creatures. It is still subject to mental eﬀects that aﬀect all
creatures in an area.
Telepathy (aura, divination, magical) A monster with
telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures
within the listed radius, as long as they share a language.
This doesn’t give any special access to their thoughts,
and communicates no more information than normal
speech would.
Throw Rock Ȱɵ The monster interacts to pick up a rock within
reach or retrieve a stowed rock and throws it, making a
ranged Strike.
Trample ̂ˬ The monster Strides up to double its Speed
and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed
size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The
monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only
once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the
damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can
attempt a basic Reﬂex save at the listed DC (no damage on
a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage
on a critical failure).
Tremorsense Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the
vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement.
It is usually an imprecise sense with a limited range
(listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the
monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only
if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the
surface.
Wavesense This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations
caused by movement through a liquid. It’s usually an
imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).
Wavesense functions only if the monster and the subject
are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is
moving through the liquid.

Creature Traits
Some of these traits appear in the Core Rulebook, while
others are new to this book and the ﬁrst Bestiary.
Rarity Traits
Unless the creature is common, its trait list starts with a
rarity trait. Creatures that don’t start with a rarity trait
have the common rarity.
Common A creature of this rarity is generally known and can
be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.
Uncommon Less is known about uncommon creatures than
common creatures. They typically can’t be summoned. The
DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 2.
Rare As the name suggests, these creatures are rare. They
typically can’t be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge
checks related to this creature is increased by 5.
Unique A creature with this rarity is one of a kind. The DC
of Recall Knowledge checks related to this creature is
increased by 10.
Alignment Trait Abbreviation
Following any listed rarity trait is one of nine alignment
trait abbreviations. They are listed below with the
alignment traits that these abbreviations represent.
General descriptions of alignments are found on pages
28–29 of the Core Rulebook.
CE Chaotic and evil
CG Chaotic and good
CN Chaotic and neutral
LG Lawful and good
LE Lawful and evil
LN Lawful and neutral
N Neutral
NE Neutral and evil
NG Neutral and good
Size
After any listed rarity trait and the alignment
abbreviation, each creature has its size listed
before its other traits.
Gargantuan This size of creature takes up a space
of at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but
can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have a
reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are long,
but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
Huge A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot space (9
squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15 feet if the
creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
Large A Large creature takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot space
(4 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 10 feet if
the creature is tall or 5 feet if the creature is long.
Medium A Medium creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Small A Small creature takes up a 5-foot-by-5-foot space
(1 square on the grid) and typically has a reach of 5 feet.
Tiny A creature of this size takes up less than a 5-foot-by-5-foot
space (1 square on the grid), and multiple Tiny creatures
can occupy the same square on the grid. At least four Tiny
creatures can occupy the same square, and even more
can occupy the same square, at the GM’s discretion. They
can also occupy the same space as larger creatures, and
if their reach is 0 feet, they must do so in order to attack.
Other Traits
After any rarity traits, the alignment abbreviation, and
the size, each creature’s trait line lists all other traits the
creature has in alphabetical order. The following is a list
of those traits found in the book.
Aberration Aberrations are creatures from beyond the planes
or corruptions of the natural order.
Acid Creatures with this trait are primarily constituted of acid
or have a magical connection to it.

================================================================================
PAGE 309
================================================================================

Bestiary 2
and inevitables communicate via a strange telepathic
hodgepodge of sensory sending called envisioning.
Air Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a
magical connection to that element.
Amphibious An amphibious creature can breathe in water and

indeﬁnitely but at least for hours. These creatures often
have a swim Speed. Their bludgeoning and slashing unarmed
Strikes don’t take the usual –2 penalty for being underwater.
Angel This family of celestials is native to the plane of Nirvana.
Most angels are neutral good, have darkvision, and have a
weakness to evil damage.
Animal An animal is a creature with a relatively low
intelligence. It typically doesn’t have an Intelligence modiﬁer

Construct A construct is an artiﬁcial creature empowered
by a force other than necromancy. Constructs are often
mindless; they are immune to bleed damage, death
eﬀects, disease, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks,
poison, and the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed,
sickened, and unconscious conditions; and they may
have Hardness based on the materials used to construct
their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are
they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct
creature is destroyed.
Couatl A family of supernatural feathered serpents who serve
as guardians and messengers on the Material Plane for
various good-aligned divinities.
Daemon A family of ﬁends spawned on the desolate plane
of Abaddon, most daemons are neutral evil. They

the fetchling ancestry. Fetchlings were once human,
but generations of life on the Shadow Plane have
transformed them.
Fey Creatures of the First World are called the fey.
Fiend Creatures that hail from or have a strong connection
to the evil-aligned planes are called ﬁends. Fiends can

Incorporeal An incorporeal creature or object has no physical
form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls.
When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can’t perceive,
attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it
starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures
can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can’t end
their movement in its space.
An incorporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based checks
against physical creatures or objects—only against incorporeal
ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune.
Likewise, a corporeal creature can’t attempt Strength-based
checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.
Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to eﬀects
or conditions that require a physical body, like disease,
poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance
against all damage (except force damage and damage from
Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double
the resistance against non-magical damage.

axiomites. Each type of inevitable is dedicated to a speciﬁc
task. Most inevitables have weakness to chaotic damage.

tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane,
divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait.
Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.
Mindless A mindless creature has either programmed or
rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental
ability modiﬁers are –5. They are immune to all mental eﬀects.
Monitor Creatures that hail from or have a strong connection

darkvision, lifesense, and spirit touch, and they are immune
to death eﬀects.

grow in size to resemble giants.
Suli Sulis are planar scions descended from jann.
Swarm A swarm is a mass or cloud of creatures that functions
as one monster. Its size entry gives the size of the entire
mass, though for most swarms the individual creatures
that make up that mass are Tiny. A swarm can occupy the
same space as other creatures, and must do so in order to
use its damaging action. A swarm typically has weakness
to eﬀects that deal damage over an area (like area spells
and splash weapons). Swarms are immune to the grappled,
prone, and restrained conditions.
Sylph Sylphs are planar scions descended from djinn.
Tane The Tane are powerful creatures created eons ago by the
Eldest of the First World. All of the Tane treat whatever
plane they happen to be on as their home plane.

They do not age, and while some may be driven by
supernatural hungers, they do not need to eat or drink to
survive. They can survive the basic environmental eﬀects
of the Dimension of Time.
Troll Trolls are giant, brutish creatures and are well known for
their ability to regenerate.
Undead Once living, these creatures were infused after death
with negative energy and soul-corrupting evil magic. When

daemons, have transparent skin, and drink blood.
Vampire Undead creatures who thirst for blood, vampires are

water or have a magical connection to the element.
Wight A wight is an undead creature that drains life and

able to shift between animal, humanoid, and hybrid forms or
are aﬄicted with a curse that forces them to shift involuntarily.
Wraith A wraith is an incorporeal undead creature infused
with negative energy and driven by a hatred of all life.
Weapon Traits
The bonuses from these weapons traits are included in
creatures’ statistics, but the traits appear because they’re
relevant for the clumsy and enfeebled conditions.
Brutal A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength
modifier instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.
Finesse This melee attack is Dexterity based. Even if
a weapon normally has the finesse trait, this trait is
omitted in the Strike entry if the monster is applying
its Strength.
Rituals
Some creatures from the Outer Planes can use special
rituals to call their kin or transport themselves to another
plane. These are the rituals used by various creatures in
this book.
