VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

Cold Healing Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold
damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the
cold eﬀect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments (Core Rulebook
518), calathgars gain fast healing 1.
Mold Mulch When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays
and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold
if it was killed by ﬁre damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute,
during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its
turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn
in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an
hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot
square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points,
BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing,
and
slashing
damage;
the mold deals half its
regular cold damage once
it’s broken).

thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot
cone, dealing 1d6 piercing and
4d6 cold damage (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). In mild cold or colder
environments (Core Rulebook 518),
these seeds cling to living creatures
they strike, dealing 1d4 persistent
cold damage. The calathgar can’t
use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.

CALIGNI SLAYER TRINKETS
Slayers obsess over magical trinkets,
coveting them above all else.
They often have a consumable or
permanent item of use in combat,
such as a scroll, wand, or talisman.
Unfortunately, their incessant
tinkering and ﬁddling often leaves
their treasures broken or depleted.
Caligni Slayer
Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other
calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken
merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger.
Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with
their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied
the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience.
Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer’s hunger appears at the moment of
their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless
implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis’ deaths, consuming
the body itself in a ﬁnal attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe
with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 51), ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own.
For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the
talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too
ambitious can become a brave sacriﬁce in battle, for the good of the enclave.
In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers
and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet
another source of slayers’ envy and resentment.

CARBUNCLE CHATTER
“A lizard with an apple-sized
gem sticking out of its forehead?
Wishful thinking!”
“Carbuncles are real! I almost
caught one, but even though it
could barely walk, its magic allowed
it to escape my clutches.”
“Their mind control powers could
make them useful familiars, but if
you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
“My advice is to stay away from
these pests. They drink your hopes
and aspirations through their horns,
leaving you empty except for bad
luck and bellyaches.”
“Planning a carbuncle hunt?
You’d better leave your self-respect
at home, and be ready to emerge
with fewer friends than you had at
the start!”
Carbuncle
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than
that of the lowly carbuncle. At ﬁrst glance, carbuncles appear to be little more
than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and
the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although
rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure‑alls to
potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle’s horn
is merely a highly reﬂective growth, not unlike a ﬁngernail.

Carbuncle Empathy The carbuncle can telepathically send mild feelings and sensations

target, but it might convey a feeling of dread or the scent of food cooking nearby.

Easy to Inﬂuence Any mental spell can aﬀect a carbuncle, regardless of creature type
limitations. Against a suggestion spell, a carbuncle always gets an outcome one degree
of success worse than it rolled on its saving throw.
Fatal Faker Ǻȓ (arcane, conjuration, teleportation) Trigger The carbuncle takes damage;
Eﬀect The carbuncle feigns death by teleporting away and leaving a replica of
its corpse behind, creating a colorful ﬂash of light and a croaking sound. The real
carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow
shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point
it crumbles to dust.

Specious Suggestion ʚʖ (enchantment,
incapacitation, mental) Frequency three
times per day; Eﬀect The carbuncle
concentrates on a creature it can see and
tries to manipulate that creature. The
target must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
The target then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The attempt backﬁres
and bolsters the target’s mind instead,
granting it a +1 status bonus to Will
saving throws for 1 hour.
Success The target brieﬂy experiences an
unusual but harmless sensation like an
unexpected ﬂavor or scent, an urge to eat
something strange, or an amusing half‑forgotten memory.
Failure The target is compelled to spend all of its actions
on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and
usually embarrassing actions.
Critical Failure As failure, but the compulsion
persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt
a new save at the end of its turn each round
to end the eﬀect.

CATOBLEPAS NESTS
A catoblepas den is an awful place
indeed—a ﬁlthy nest composed
of piles of decaying vegetation,
half‑ﬁnished or half-digested meals
of decaying animals, never-quite-dry
banks of mud, and tangles of thorny
branches. Worse, the catoblepas’s
stink infuses such a site, imposing
the beast’s ungodly stench upon
those who would explore and search
within for treasure. A catoblepas
nest can retain its stink in this way
for up to a week after it’s been
abandoned by its foul denizen.
Catoblepas
The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps,
the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods,
leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that
other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas
bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.
A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.

also become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). The catoblepas

FISHER FILAMENTS
A cave ﬁsher can rapidly produce
a cord from a gland at the back of
its throat. This ﬁlament resembles
a semi-transparent silk rope and is
coated with an adhesive that traps
prey that comes in contact with it.
When reeling in its prey, the cave
ﬁsher consumes the ﬁlament as well,
slurping it up like a noodle.
A severed ﬁlament can be
harvested for use as rope. The
adhesive dries after about 10
minutes. A harvested ﬁlament gland
can’t produce new ﬁlaments, but
it can be used as 25 gp worth of
raw materials for creating potent
adhesives, such as sovereign glue.
Cave Fisher
Cave ﬁshers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground
structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave ﬁsher
excretes thin, tough, and very sticky ﬁlaments at its prey with lightning speed
to capture it.
A cave ﬁsher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything
smaller than a rat isn’t much of a meal for it. When a cave ﬁsher captures such
a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract
larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its ﬁlament doesn’t last long, the ﬁsher
frequently needs to eat one ﬁlament and excrete a new one. The ﬁlaments are
translucent and can be hard to see when they’re still and in darkness.
Cave ﬁshers hatch with the ability to excrete ﬁlaments, but they molt many
times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They
often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.

Pull Filament Ȱɵ The cave ﬁsher pulls a creature grabbed by its ﬁlament toward itself,
even suspending the target vertically if necessary. The cave ﬁsher attempts an
Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the cave ﬁsher
pulls the creature 15 feet closer to it (30 feet closer on a critical success).
Sticky Filament Any creature hit by the cave ﬁsher’s sticky ﬁlament is grabbed.
The cave ﬁsher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its ﬁlament, but it
automatically releases the creature if the cave ﬁsher moves beyond the ﬁlament’s
60-foot length. The cave ﬁsher can use only one ﬁlament at a time, and it can
sever the ﬁlament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The
ﬁlament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it.
This doesn’t deal any damage to the cave ﬁsher itself. The ﬁlament has AC 17, and
its Escape DC is 19.

MASSIVE MYRIAPODS
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion,
gathering in numbers around
large corpses or battleﬁelds and
jealously guarding their troves of
ﬂesh from any who would disturb
them. Monstrous centipedes are
also aggressive hunters and are
particularly fond of devouring
horses and similar creatures, often
snatching a mount right out from
under its rider. They are unusually
stealthy for creatures of their size,
making their swift strikes all the
more frightening.
Centipede
Centipedes are ﬂesh-eating myriapods that skitter with great speed through
tunnels, forests, and similar densely packed terrain. Many are small predators,

WINGED CHUPACABRAS
Some chupacabras are mutants
with large reptilian wings and have
been known to carry oﬀ goats or
even children. A winged chupacabra
has a ﬂy Speed of 50 feet. Other
chupacabras grow much larger, up to
Medium sized, and can stand eye to
eye with a full-grown human. These
chupacabras have elite adjustments
to their statistics and deal 2d6+5
damage with their jaws Strikes.
Chupacabra
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras
prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching
potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most
often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly
reﬂective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.
Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats),
and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood‑drained
husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their
naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the
worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.
A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip
of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and
lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only
during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that
hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless
prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.
Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known
to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well
together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and
otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers
or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of
such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common
often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra
capabilities or motive—and a few of the claims, such as that some
chupacabras can ﬂy, are all too true.

COCKROACH SPECIES
Beyond the common giant cockroach,
other ﬂesh-eating cockroaches
exist throughout the world. These
variations include the giant hissing
cockroach, the noxious venomroach,
the huge spitting cockroach (which
can incapacitate enemies from a
distance), the aggressive sawback
cockroach, and the mysterious and
rare dragonroach.
Cockroach
Generally seen more as a nuisance than a personal danger, cockroaches inhabit
most reaches of the world. They are scavengers who live off the detritus of
the natural world and from those that inhabit it. These maligned insects can
survive weeks without eating, and most of their meals consist of organic
waste that would otherwise overwhelm an ecosystem, particularly in their
preferred urban environments. Though a typical cockroach presents virtually
no threat, they can become dangerous in large groups, and some species grow
particularly large.
GIANT COCKROACH
Cockroaches are communal creatures, rarely setting out on their own unless
they are searching for food. If an adventurer encounters a single giant cockroach
while exploring, they had best take precautions against others, as there is likely
an entire colony nearby.

COCKROACH SWARM
While cockroaches tend to gather in cramped spaces, a
disturbed colony is sometimes prone to swarming,
where hundreds or even thousands of the
insects scurry out of their hiding places in
a raft of shiny brown and black carapaces
on thousands of skittering legs. Given how
disgusting many ﬁnd cockroaches to be,
encountering such a swarm can be alarming
to even the most seasoned adventurers. The
creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast
to the insects’ normally skittish and harmless nature,
as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures
that provoked them and harry them with
thousands of stinging bites.

ABADDON
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane
of pure evil for only the most corrupt
souls. If Hell is a realm of torture
and systematic depravity, Abaddon
is its twisted cousin—a place where
one can ﬁnd only misery and
despair in ample quantities, with
neither the strictures of Hell nor
the chaotic freedom of the Abyss.
For evildoers who seek simply to
inﬂict their wickedness on others,
Abaddon is a rich hunting ground
where one can revel in turpitude,
though visitors be forewarned: the
competition is ﬁerce.
Daemon
Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.
PISCODAEMON (VENOM DAEMON)
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards,
delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on
a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and
even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons’ preferred
tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River
Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They
are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by
drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget
their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.

MELADAEMON (FAMINE DAEMON)
Meladaemons personify death by starvation and thirst,
and revel in spreading the same despair that brought
about their mortal demise. When they aren’t blighting
ﬁelds, massacring livestock, or tainting water supplies,
they experiment on prisoners to study how long creatures
can go without sustenance and the deleterious effects that
result from such deprivation. Fiercely loyal to Trelmarixian,
Horseman of Famine, they serve no other beings. They work alongside other
daemons if Trelmarixian wills it, but are notoriously traitorous.

SOUL SWALLOWERS
The fact that devourers consume
souls makes them particularly hated
by the church of Pharasma and
psychopomps alike.
Devourer
When ﬁends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches
of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horriﬁc undead called devourers that
consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are
ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—
manifestations of the devourers’ most recently consumed souls.

Spell Deﬂection (abjuration, divine) A spellcaster who targets a devourer with
a mental spell, banishment, bind soul, divine decree, divine wrath, possession,
spirit blast, or spirit song can attempt a counteract check to free a soul the
devourer has trapped with Devour Soul. If this counteract attempt succeeds,
the trapped soul is released (though the creature remains dead), and the
devourer can’t use any soul charges from that creature. Devourers are
otherwise immune to these spells.

Devour Soul ʚʖ (death, divine, necromancy) The devourer touches
a creature within reach, dealing 8d6 negative damage (DC 31 basic
Fortitude save). If a creature is slain by this attack, its soul becomes
trapped within the devourer. While its soul is trapped, a creature
can’t be resurrected except by powerful magic such as a wish spell.
Destroying the devourer or successfully counteracting Devour Soul
(see Spell Deﬂection above) releases the soul. The devourer can hold only one
soul at a time. A soul has 5 soul charges per level of the originating creature
(see Soul Spells below). The devourer can expend these charges to cast
spells. If the soul is freed and the creature returns to life, the creature
is drained 1 for every 5 soul charges expended. If reduced to 0 soul
charges, the soul is consumed and can be restored to life only by
powerful magic such as wish.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the devourer damages a living
creature with its claw Strike, the devourer gains 10 temporary Hit Points
and the creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become
drained 1. Further damage dealt by the devourer increases the condition
value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Soul Spells A devourer casts occult innate spells, but to do so it must expend
a number of soul charges equal to the spell’s level (similar to casting a spell
using charges from a staﬀ). It can heighten any spell to a maximum of 6th level by
expending more charges as it Casts the Spell. When encountered, a devourer typically
has one trapped soul with 10 soul charges.

ICE GOLEM COMPONENTS
When destroyed, the magic
sustaining an ice golem’s form
quickly dissipates. Unless it is in a
freezing environment, the golem’s
shattered remains soon melt
completely away. Still, the animating
magic can linger in shards of ice
that resist melting; these may fetch
a good price from wealthy folk to
preserve foods or chill beverages.
Pieces of ice that are captured and
magically preserved or allowed to
melt in sealed containers can also be
sold to scholars who may be able to
divine arcane secrets from the once
magically animated materials.

aura must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as
long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, aﬀected creatures take
a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened
condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Vulnerable to Gentle Repose Casting a gentle repose spell on a carrion golem causes it
to grow stiﬀ. The golem attempts a DC 19 Fortitude save. It’s unaﬀected on a critical
success, slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds on a success, and on a failure is immobilized and
slowed for 1d4 rounds.

ICE GOLEM
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from
individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a
humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates,
the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer
temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower
end of the scale as far as cost and difﬁculty to create, gives these constructs
unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful
in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians
for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem
standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the
chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice
golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

Taiga linnorms are covered in hundreds of quill-like black spines as sharp as spears.
Wise hunters native to linnorm-infested lands know to watch for spines stuck in
the bark of conifers—a sure sign that a taiga linnorm has recently passed through.
Sometimes this means of tracking isn’t enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga
linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk
in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the
water’s surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.

PELUDA PATRONS
Occasionally a particularly cunning
band of humanoids—typically
lizardfolk or orcs—ﬁnds a way to
assuage a local peluda’s temper
and then elevate the dragon to the
status of a local liege, patron, or even
object of worship. Although peludas
rarely have any actual aﬀection
for such servants, they revel in
the submission of these weaker
creatures and the gifts of gold and
food they bring.
Peluda
Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely
forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch
of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential
rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed
footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses
on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt,
roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and
killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.
Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves,
especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or
breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more
impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try
anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry,
which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and ﬁre breath.

VANTH SCYTHES
Vanths’ favored weapon is the scythe,
a choice that even further adds to
their fearsome appearance and can
lead to unfortunate associations with
the Grim Reaper or Urgathoa among
more superstitious mortals. Vanths
ﬁnd such comparisons to be ignorant
at best or insulting at worst. Some
vanths infuse their scythes with
diﬀerent qualities, such as cold iron
or silver, depending on the nature of
their most common enemies.
VANTH
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as
vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask
resembling a vulture’s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to ﬁght against those who
would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to
the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war,
vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any
emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.

immune to Vanth’s Curse for 24 hours.
Success The target feels a momentary shudder of doom and is
stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute by the distracting sensation.
Failure The target becomes morose and glum as it accepts its own inevitable fate. For
1 hour, the target is stupeﬁed 2. Each time the target gains the dying condition, the
stupeﬁed condition value increases by 1, to a maximum value of stupeﬁed 4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the eﬀect is permanent.

QLIPPOTH AND MORTALS
As qlippoth lost territory to their
demonic rivals, they realized that the
only way to stem the tide of demonic
forces was to starve them of the
sinful souls that the Abyss uses to
spawn new demons. While qlippoth
have no concept of how they
might go about preventing sin by
changing the way mortals act, they
do understand that exterminating
mortal life would solve the problem
as well.
SHOGGTI
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims,
bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no
doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lamprey-
like mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its
forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

NYOGOTH
Little more than a coiled mass of intestines
encircling a massive gaping maw, this

the ﬁlth and leftovers of demons and qlippoth
alike, although it relishes any opportunity to
consume living prey. Despite this seeming lowly role
in the Abyssal ecosystem, a nyogoth is far from a stupid
beast and can orchestrate cunning ambushes to secure
its next meal.

OTHER QLIPPOTH
The qlippoth presented here are but
a small fraction of the squirming
awfulness that lurks in the deeper
rifts of the Abyss. Other types of
qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like
gongorinans, which use living
creatures as incubators; shapeshifting
utukku, which inﬁltrate and undermine
religions; death-spawned behimirons,
which slay the living to reproduce;
and the living siege engines known as
catabolignes. Yet most frightening of
all is the immense iathavos, a monster
so abhorrent that even the Abyss
cannot bear to allow more than one to
exist at any one time.
Aura of Order’s Ruin (aura, necromancy, occult) 30 feet. A lawful or good creature that
begins its turn in this aura’s emanation must attempt a DC 29 Will save or become
sickened 1 (lawful good creatures instead become sickened 2).
Boiled by Light A chernobue takes 2d10 points of ﬁre damage each time it starts its turn
in an area of bright light.
Recall Venom Ǻȓ Trigger A creature within 30 feet suﬀers the eﬀects from stage 2 of
rupturing venom; Eﬀect The chernobue calls out telepathically to the semi-alive
toxin, causing it to burst out of the target’s body and slither through the air to
drain back into one of the chernobue’s mouths. The poisoned creature takes 7d6
bludgeoning damage (DC 32 basic Fortitude save) as the venom exits its body, but
is thereafter cured of rupturing venom, and the chernobue regains an equal number
of Hit Points.

Paralyzing Display ʚʖ (concentrate, emotion,
enchantment, fear, incapacitation, mental,
occult, visual) The chernobue’s eye
pulses and its lid peels back to reveal
mind-bending awfulness. Creatures in
a 30-foot emanation must attempt a
DC 32 Will save, after which they are
temporarily immune to further Paralyzing
Displays for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The creature is paralyzed for 1d4

end the eﬀect at the end of each of
its turns.

AUGNAGAR
The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast—
preferably on rotten ﬂesh, and when possible, demon
ﬂesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the ﬂesh
of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs
with leathery membranes like a bat’s wings, and
three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for
slicing ﬂesh.

AUGNAGARS AND THULGANTS
An augnagar that gorges suﬃciently,
especially on other augnagars,
can grow so massive it can’t even
move, thrashing and festering
where it lies. It eventually ﬂies
into a frenzy of self-cannibalism
as it rips apart its own ﬂesh to
feast on. From the ruinous remains
emerges a thulgant—a smaller but
more powerful qlippoth. Scholars
are uncertain if other qlippoth are
capable of transforming themselves
in this fashion. So far, none have
returned from the Abyss with proof.

WHAT FALLS WILL RISE
The war between the humans of
ancient Azlant and the serpentfolk
of Sekamina waged on for years.
The serpentfolk’s defeat threw their
society into chaos and undermined
their conviction that they would
continue to rule simply because they
had done so for eons. For millennia,
serpentfolk have remained in hiding
in their underground fortresses, but
many feel it is time to rise again!
Ranged Ȱɵ hand crossbow +10 (range increment 60 feet, reload 1), Damage 1d6+3

Deceptive Reposition Ȱɵ The Coil spy Strides up to half their Speed and attempts a Feint,

Maintain Disguise A Coil spy can maintain an ongoing illusory disguise as long as they
are conscious without having to re-cast the spell; they need only Cast the Spell again
to reassume their illusory disguise if they wish to change their appearance or if the
active spell is dispelled. Coil spies typically seek privacy when they need to sleep, as
an ongoing illusory disguise ends an hour after they fall unconscious.
Serpentfolk Venom (poison) As zyss serpentfolk, but DC 19.
Sneak Attack The Coil spy’s Strikes deal an extra 2d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
BONE PROPHET
The speakers for the dead known as bone prophets hold an esteemed place
as voices for their decapitated god. Burial rites, necromantic rituals,
and the delivery of cryptic utterances supposedly whispered to them by
Ydersius all fall under the dominion of these priests. Bone prophets often
raise fallen aapophs as skeletons.

the equipment and attacks might be diﬀerent depending on the corpses’
possessions (Bestiary 298). These skeletons have the minion trait and

MOTHER OF TROLLS
Trolls and ettins do not normally
seek one another as mates, but this
pairing is the source of the original
two-headed trolls—such couplings
were engineered and arranged by
the cult of Lamashtu in ages past.
Oblivious to their origin, two-headed
trolls tend to give no deference to
the Mother of Monsters.

actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls one of the troll’s arms, but both can move the
legs. Any ability that would sever a two-headed troll’s head (such as the vorpal weapon
property) doesn’t cause the two-headed troll to die if they still have their other head,
but does cause them to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head.

JOTUND TROLL
Jotund
trolls
are
gigantic,
nine-headed
horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes,
and wastelands, always alone and always
enraged. While each of the jotund troll’s nine
heads possess their own brains and senses,
they work much more in tandem than the
dual-minded nature of the two-headed
troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and
bicker, particularly over which head gets to
eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the
same shared stomach makes little difference
in such culinary disagreements.
Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund
troll represents a primordial, if not
original, shape and design for the ﬁrst
trolls to plague the world, arising from a
mythical realm in the Great Beyond known
as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be
nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary
home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the
jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague
the Material Plane as punishment or challenge,
or if it’s merely an evocative legend told
by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the
jotund trolls themselves likely care little.

WISPS AND FIRE
Witchﬁres have the ability to summon
will-o’-wisps, but a number of these
aberrations usually linger nearby of
their own accord. The fear-inducing
witchﬂame aura manifested by
witchﬁres provides will-o’-wisps their
favored sustenance.
Witchfire
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green ﬂames, this incorporeal
undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the
center of the ﬂames usually resembles the witch’s idealized self-image, regardless
of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchﬁre often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays
around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o’-wisps, which seem to
have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchﬁre. A witchﬁre might visit
villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always
attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams.
A witchﬁre might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens,
but a witchﬁre is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.
