VENGEFUL FLOWERS
Calathgar cuttings are greatly desired
in warmer lands, yet horticulturalists
often fail to realize that calathgars
are sapient, mobile, and vengeful
against those who prune their leaves
or take cuttings. These feral ﬂowers
understand the speech of forest
denizens and often shift and move
their groves when they sense danger
approaching. They protect their
immature and immobile oﬀspring,
and if they discover a garden of their
young has been despoiled, they track
down the perpetrators to unleash a
ﬂurry of vengeance upon them.
Calathgar
Calathgars are mysterious predatory plants that grow in the depths of the densest
frozen forests, realms where icicles rarely melt from snow-cloaked trees. A
calathgar’s blue ﬂowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide
as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and
weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.
Calathgars’ psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest
in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly ﬂawless memories and can
share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as
a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on
information by speech. While calathgars themselves can’t speak, they can typically
be reasoned with­—though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar
defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.

Cold Healing Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar would take cold
damage, it instead regains 1d6 Hit Points (regardless of the amount of damage the
cold eﬀect would have caused). In severe cold or colder environments (Core Rulebook
518), calathgars gain fast healing 1.
Mold Mulch When a calathgar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it immediately decays
and dies, transforming into a 5-foot patch of mold (or a 10-foot patch of mold
if it was killed by ﬁre damage). This patch of mold persists for 1 minute,
during which time it deals 3d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its
turn in this area, or 1d6 cold damage to any creature that begins its turn
in an adjacent square. The mold patch decays away after an
hour, but it can be destroyed before then (treat each 5-foot
square as an object with Hardness 0, 10 Hit Points,
BT 5, immunity to cold, piercing,
and
slashing
damage;
the mold deals half its
regular cold damage once
it’s broken).

Seed Spray ʚʖ (cold, evocation,
primal) The calathgar expels
thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot
cone, dealing 1d6 piercing and
4d6 cold damage (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save). In mild cold or colder
environments (Core Rulebook 518),
these seeds cling to living creatures
they strike, dealing 1d4 persistent
cold damage. The calathgar can’t
use Seed Spray again for 1d4 rounds.

CALIGNI SLAYER TRINKETS
Slayers obsess over magical trinkets,
coveting them above all else.
They often have a consumable or
permanent item of use in combat,
such as a scroll, wand, or talisman.
Unfortunately, their incessant
tinkering and ﬁddling often leaves
their treasures broken or depleted.
Caligni Slayer
Caligni slayers possess greater occult talents than others of their kind. In most other
calignis, the power bartered from the long-lost demigods known as the Forsaken
merely burns within. But in caligni slayers, this power is a deep and terrible hunger.
Slayers embrace their evil impulses as a result, and they seek to feed on others with
their soul harvest ability to keep this supernatural hunger sated. Slayers denied
the opportunity to feed descend into paranoia and, eventually, murderous rage.
Delayed feeding improves but never fully restores their composure and patience.
Perhaps the greatest manifestation of a slayer’s hunger appears at the moment of
their death. Upon its last breath, a slayer collapses into itself in a violent, lightless
implosion, rather than the blinding eruption of other calignis’ deaths, consuming
the body itself in a ﬁnal attempt at satiation.
Slayers view themselves as the cleverest and most gifted of the calignis. They seethe
with ill-concealed envy at the position of power caligni stalkers occupy (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 51), ever scheming to displace them and claim that power for their own.
For their part, stalkers tolerate these machinations as an acceptable price for the
talents slayers contribute to an enclave. If necessary, any slayer who grows too
ambitious can become a brave sacriﬁce in battle, for the good of the enclave.
In physical stature, slayers fall between the willowy caligni dancers
and the diminutive creepers. Stalkers tower above most slayers—yet
another source of slayers’ envy and resentment.

CARBUNCLE CHATTER
“A lizard with an apple-sized
gem sticking out of its forehead?
Wishful thinking!”
“Carbuncles are real! I almost
caught one, but even though it
could barely walk, its magic allowed
it to escape my clutches.”
“Their mind control powers could
make them useful familiars, but if
you ever catch one, it dies of fright.”
“My advice is to stay away from
these pests. They drink your hopes
and aspirations through their horns,
leaving you empty except for bad
luck and bellyaches.”
“Planning a carbuncle hunt?
You’d better leave your self-respect
at home, and be ready to emerge
with fewer friends than you had at
the start!”
Carbuncle
Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than
that of the lowly carbuncle. At ﬁrst glance, carbuncles appear to be little more
than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart is their strange magical abilities and
the gemstone-like horn protruding from between their goggling eyes. Although
rumors suggest various uses for carbuncle horns, ranging from miracle cure‑alls to
potent magical components, the truth is much more mundane: a carbuncle’s horn
is merely a highly reﬂective growth, not unlike a ﬁngernail.

Fatal Faker Ǻȓ (arcane, conjuration, teleportation) Trigger The carbuncle takes damage;
Eﬀect The carbuncle feigns death by teleporting away and leaving a replica of
its corpse behind, creating a colorful ﬂash of light and a croaking sound. The real
carbuncle transports to a clear space within 30 feet that it can see, and a hollow
shell remains behind. The fake body appears solid until it is touched, at which point
it crumbles to dust.

concentrates on a creature it can see and
tries to manipulate that creature. The
target must attempt a DC 18 Will save.
The target then becomes temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The attempt backﬁres
and bolsters the target’s mind instead,
granting it a +1 status bonus to Will
saving throws for 1 hour.
Success The target brieﬂy experiences an
unusual but harmless sensation like an
unexpected ﬂavor or scent, an urge to eat
something strange, or an amusing half‑forgotten memory.
Failure The target is compelled to spend all of its actions
on its next turn performing harmless, pointless, and
usually embarrassing actions.
Critical Failure As failure, but the compulsion
persists for 1 minute. The target can attempt
a new save at the end of its turn each round
to end the eﬀect.

CATOBLEPAS NESTS
A catoblepas den is an awful place
indeed—a ﬁlthy nest composed
of piles of decaying vegetation,
half‑ﬁnished or half-digested meals
of decaying animals, never-quite-dry
banks of mud, and tangles of thorny
branches. Worse, the catoblepas’s
stink infuses such a site, imposing
the beast’s ungodly stench upon
those who would explore and search
within for treasure. A catoblepas
nest can retain its stink in this way
for up to a week after it’s been
abandoned by its foul denizen.
Catoblepas
The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times. Though it prefers swamps,
the catoblepas has been know to forage in plains and forests for short periods,
leaving behind hunting grounds tainted by its foul breath and noxious waste that
other predators and prey alike avoid for days or even weeks thereafter. The catoblepas
bullies those creatures it believes are a match for it, and eats everything weaker.
A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds.

FISHER FILAMENTS
A cave ﬁsher can rapidly produce
a cord from a gland at the back of
its throat. This ﬁlament resembles
a semi-transparent silk rope and is
coated with an adhesive that traps
prey that comes in contact with it.
When reeling in its prey, the cave
ﬁsher consumes the ﬁlament as well,
slurping it up like a noodle.
A severed ﬁlament can be
harvested for use as rope. The
adhesive dries after about 10
minutes. A harvested ﬁlament gland
can’t produce new ﬁlaments, but
it can be used as 25 gp worth of
raw materials for creating potent
adhesives, such as sovereign glue.
Cave Fisher
Cave ﬁshers lurk in dark corners near the ceilings of caves and underground
structures, lying in wait for prey to approach. When it does, the cave ﬁsher
excretes thin, tough, and very sticky ﬁlaments at its prey with lightning speed
to capture it.
A cave ﬁsher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything
smaller than a rat isn’t much of a meal for it. When a cave ﬁsher captures such
a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract
larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its ﬁlament doesn’t last long, the ﬁsher
frequently needs to eat one ﬁlament and excrete a new one. The ﬁlaments are
translucent and can be hard to see when they’re still and in darkness.
Cave ﬁshers hatch with the ability to excrete ﬁlaments, but they molt many
times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They
often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.

Sticky Filament Any creature hit by the cave ﬁsher’s sticky ﬁlament is grabbed.
The cave ﬁsher can move while it has a creature grabbed with its ﬁlament, but it
automatically releases the creature if the cave ﬁsher moves beyond the ﬁlament’s
60-foot length. The cave ﬁsher can use only one ﬁlament at a time, and it can
sever the ﬁlament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The
ﬁlament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it.
This doesn’t deal any damage to the cave ﬁsher itself. The ﬁlament has AC 17, and
its Escape DC is 19.

MASSIVE MYRIAPODS
All centipedes prefer to eat carrion,
gathering in numbers around
large corpses or battleﬁelds and
jealously guarding their troves of
ﬂesh from any who would disturb
them. Monstrous centipedes are
also aggressive hunters and are
particularly fond of devouring
horses and similar creatures, often
snatching a mount right out from
under its rider. They are unusually
stealthy for creatures of their size,
making their swift strikes all the
more frightening.
Centipede
Centipedes are ﬂesh-eating myriapods that skitter with great speed through
tunnels, forests, and similar densely packed terrain. Many are small predators,
but others are titanic terrors that devour everything in their path.
GIANT WHIPTAIL CENTIPEDE
Whiptail centipedes are sleek and swift tunnel predators.

# CHOKER
================================================================================


CHOKER TRINKETS
A choker’s nest is small and conﬁned,
as the choker prefers. It doesn’t tidy
its nest, so everything from animal
bones to valuable treasures might
be within, compacted into one mass.
A choker in the wilderness might
have a few remnants of society taken
from victims who wandered through.
These remnants can include candles,
maps, or animal traps. Chokers in
cities have stolen goods appropriate
to their location: books and scrolls if
a library or wizard’s college is nearby,
steins and pillows near a tavern, or
ﬁshhooks and shipping manifests near
a dock, for example. Chokers almost
never have edible or drinkable items,
as they prefer to consume these
“delicacies” themselves—even magical
potions and alchemical items.
Choker
With long, cartilaginous limbs and gray skin, chokers easily hide in stony alcoves,
rocky ﬁssures, and darkened staircases to ambush their prey. The strange little
aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that
wander off from their packs or communities. A choker’s long, spongy arms are
ﬂexible but deceptively strong. The ﬁngers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with
spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically
strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude
tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker
tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that
encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the
products of art and industry. This interest isn’t very deep—it just results in chokers
that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated,
such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.
Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned
structures. These chokers stalk at night, ﬂopping across rooftops, tapping at
windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An
urban choker that ﬁnds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who
is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the
products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items,
from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one
item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to ﬁnd a larger nest to
accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.

The choker attempts an Athletics check, including its bonus to Grapple. If it succeeds
against the grabbed or restrained creature’s Fortitude DC, the choker redirects the
attack to that creature, and the attacker compares its attack roll result against
the new target’s AC.
The choker must move the creature into a space adjacent to itself. The
creature must also be moved within the attacker’s reach against a
melee attack or into a space between itself and the attacker
against a ranged attack. The choker can’t use this ability
to make the attacker target itself, even if it’s grabbing or
restraining the attacker.

Strangling Fingers Any creature hit by a choker’s arm
Strike is automatically grabbed, and the choker
begins to strangle the target. The creature is
suﬀocating and can’t speak as long as it’s strangled.
This prevents it from casting spells with a verbal component or
activating items with a command component.

Bestiary 2
WINGED CHUPACABRAS
Some chupacabras are mutants
with large reptilian wings and have
been known to carry oﬀ goats or
even children. A winged chupacabra
has a ﬂy Speed of 50 feet. Other
chupacabras grow much larger, up to
Medium sized, and can stand eye to
eye with a full-grown human. These
chupacabras have elite adjustments
to their statistics and deal 2d6+5
damage with their jaws Strikes.
Chupacabra
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras
prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching
potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most
often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly
reﬂective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.
Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats),
and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood‑drained
husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their
naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the
worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.
A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip
of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and
lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only
during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that
hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless
prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.
Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known
to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well
together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and
otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers

Bestiary 2
WINGED CHUPACABRAS
Some chupacabras are mutants
with large reptilian wings and have
been known to carry oﬀ goats or
even children. A winged chupacabra
has a ﬂy Speed of 50 feet. Other
chupacabras grow much larger, up to
Medium sized, and can stand eye to
eye with a full-grown human. These
chupacabras have elite adjustments
to their statistics and deal 2d6+5
damage with their jaws Strikes.
Chupacabra
These notorious predators have an undeniable thirst for blood. Chupacabras
prefer to prey upon the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching
potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most
often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly
reﬂective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.
Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats),
and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood‑drained
husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their
naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the
worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.
A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip
of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and
lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only
during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that
hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless
prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.
Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known
to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well
together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and
otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers
or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of
such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common
often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra
capabilities or motive—and a few of the claims, such as that some
chupacabras can ﬂy, are all too true.

COCKROACH SPECIES
Beyond the common giant cockroach,
other ﬂesh-eating cockroaches
exist throughout the world. These
variations include the giant hissing
cockroach, the noxious venomroach,
the huge spitting cockroach (which
can incapacitate enemies from a
distance), the aggressive sawback
cockroach, and the mysterious and
rare dragonroach.
Cockroach
Generally seen more as a nuisance than a personal danger, cockroaches inhabit
most reaches of the world. They are scavengers who live off the detritus of
the natural world and from those that inhabit it. These maligned insects can
survive weeks without eating, and most of their meals consist of organic
waste that would otherwise overwhelm an ecosystem, particularly in their
preferred urban environments. Though a typical cockroach presents virtually
no threat, they can become dangerous in large groups, and some species grow
particularly large.
GIANT COCKROACH
Cockroaches are communal creatures, rarely setting out on their own unless
they are searching for food. If an adventurer encounters a single giant cockroach
while exploring, they had best take precautions against others, as there is likely
an entire colony nearby.

# CULDEWEN
================================================================================


THE CURSE OF CRAWLEY JACK
The damnable curse of the culdewen
traces back to the First World, when
a bitter old culdewen named Crawley
Jack poached a ﬁsh from the pool
of a powerful fey noble. Short of
temper and feeling vindictive, the
noble doomed Crawley Jack’s people
to never consume another ﬁsh again.
Yet their desire to eat ﬁsh never
diminished. The curse’s punishment
is exacted in endless creative ways.
A culdewen’s catch might be rescued
by merfolk, stolen by skum, eaten
by nipping sharks, or carried away
on a piece of driftwood when the
culdewen’s boat is destroyed in a
storm or shipwreck.
Culdewen
Perpetually cursed to hunger and failure, a culdewen plies waterways in search of
appealing ﬁsh to catch—the bigger the better. Of course, this diminutive, emaciated
fey calls every living creature a “ﬁsh.” Only other fey are exempt, and they tend
to consider culdewens lost causes. A culdewen can never ﬁnd satisfaction. Each
time they catch a ﬁsh, a magical curse forces them to hunt for an appealing spot
to dine—an island, cove, or abandoned dock or shack where they can eat in peace.
By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.
A foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack
things with their oar, and shake their tiny ﬁsts at the sky. Conversation with a
culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of ﬁshing and the weather.
Capturing a “ﬁsh” gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen
capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.

Culdewen’s Curse (curse, enchantment, primal) A culdewen that captures a creature is
compelled to immediately retreat to a secluded place to eat, typically journeying by
boat. The travel to the secluded place always takes at least 1 day. Their captive is cursed
to vanish on the journey—typically being lost in the water or consumed by aquatic
creatures—and can be recovered only by a wish spell or similarly powerful magic.

skewered, taking 1d4 persistent bleed damage as long as
the hook remains stuck in it. The ﬁsh hook can be removed
only if a creature spends an Interact action and succeeds at a
DC 25 Athletics check to pull it free.
Land the Fish Ȱɵ Requirements A creature is hooked by the
culdewen’s ﬁsh hook and adjacent to the culdewen; Eﬀect The
culdewen hoists the creature over their shoulder, as though it
weighs no more than a ﬁsh. Unless the creature is unable to
act, the culdewen must attempt an Athletics check against the
creature’s Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature is restrained by the culdewen.
While hoisting a creature, the culdewen gains a +20-foot status bonus to their
Speeds and is compelled to escape with it (see culdewen’s curse above).
Reel In Ȱɵ (manipulate) The culdewen pulls the rope attached to their hook. If they
have no creature hooked, the ﬁsh hook returns to the culdewen’s hand. If a creature
is hooked, the culdewen attempts an Athletics check against the creature’s Fortitude
DC, pulling it up to 30 feet closer on a success (60 feet on a critical success).
Swear Ȱɵ (auditory, curse, enchantment, primal) The culdewen
unleashes a string of invectives. Each creature that hears them
must attempt a DC 25 Will save, with the eﬀects of mariner’s
curse and is then temporarily immune for 24 hours. Even on
a failed save, the curse ends automatically after 1 day.

ABADDON
Daemons hail from Abaddon, a plane
of pure evil for only the most corrupt
souls. If Hell is a realm of torture
and systematic depravity, Abaddon
is its twisted cousin—a place where
one can ﬁnd only misery and
despair in ample quantities, with
neither the strictures of Hell nor
the chaotic freedom of the Abyss.
For evildoers who seek simply to
inﬂict their wickedness on others,
Abaddon is a rich hunting ground
where one can revel in turpitude,
though visitors be forewarned: the
competition is ﬁerce.
Daemon
Daemons form from the most despicable souls and personify forms of death.
PISCODAEMON (VENOM DAEMON)
Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards,
delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on
a putrescent cake—its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and
even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons’ preferred
tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.
Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River
Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They
are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons—representations of death by
drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget
their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.

SOUL SWALLOWERS
The fact that devourers consume

by the church of Pharasma and
psychopomps alike.
Devourer
When ﬁends and powerful evil spellcasters are lost beyond the farthest reaches
of the multiverse, they sometimes return as horriﬁc undead called devourers that
consume the souls of the living to fuel their arcane machinations. Their bodies are
ruined and rebuilt, hollow and twisted, even as their minds undergo a spiritual
transformation. They gain the ability to bind other souls to their own and drain
their essence for magical power, yet can never be sated in their pursuit of it.
Seething masses of distorted ghostly shapes surge within their hollow rib cages—
manifestations of the devourers’ most recently consumed souls.

that resist melting; these may fetch
a good price from wealthy folk to

a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened

ICE GOLEM
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from
individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a
humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates,
the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer
temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower
end of the scale as far as cost and difﬁculty to create, gives these constructs
unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful
in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians
for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem
standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the
chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice
golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

FIRST WORLD CONNECTIONS
Linnorms have a deep connection to
the First World, the primordial home
of the fey. While linnorms typically
won’t think twice before devouring
a gnome or other fey, they do have
an unusual respect for wielders of
powerful primal magic. The only
way to cow a linnorm, according
to common wisdom, is to remind it
that there are forces of nature even

Cairn linnorms are disturbing, even by linnorm standards. They make their homes

point out that cairn linnorms feast on shambling undead and thus provide a
service to the living, but these beasts are not choosy and will happily consume any
creature, whether or not it draws breath.
Some tales state that cairn linnorms will not—or cannot—enter a tomb
without the permission of a descendant of the deceased (or the permission of the
deceased itself, in the instance that it has risen from the dead). Likewise, once a
cairn linnorm has entered a tomb, it won’t leave until it has secured permission
to do so. Whether such legends are true or not is anyone’s guess; nevertheless,
reports of a cairn linnorm in the vicinity are harrowing enough to dissuade
even the most foolhardy grave robber from peeking into too many crypts

Sometimes this means of tracking isn’t enough to avoid an encounter, however; taiga
linnorms, like their tarn and tor brethren, are skilled stalkers. They prefer to lurk
in half-frozen bogs or swampy marshlands with their heads poking just above the
water’s surface, ever watchful for unwary prey.

VERDUROUS CONGREGATION
When verdurous oozes gather in

CARNIVOROUS BLOB
Carnivorous blobs are the ravenous spawn of shattered worlds far beyond the

unsuspecting worlds. These massive beings can lie dormant
for years in desolate caverns or barren wastelands. When
a carnivorous blob perceives living creatures nearby, it
lurches to gelatinous life, seeking out and consuming
every creature it can catch until it is destroyed or until
it has been unable to locate food for 24 hours, at
which point it returns to hibernation. Often, keeping
food away from a carnivorous blob is the safest way
to defeat it. The blob’s ability to split into smaller
oozes that might stay hidden after a ﬁght means it can
be hard to fully eradicate these mindless predators.

PELUDA PATRONS
Occasionally a particularly cunning
band of humanoids—typically
lizardfolk or orcs—ﬁnds a way to
assuage a local peluda’s temper
and then elevate the dragon to the
status of a local liege, patron, or even
object of worship. Although peludas
rarely have any actual aﬀection
for such servants, they revel in
the submission of these weaker
creatures and the gifts of gold and
food they bring.
Peluda
Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely
forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch
of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential
rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed
footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses
on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt,
roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and
killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.
Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves,
especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or
breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more
impressive creatures—especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try
anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry,
which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and ﬁre breath.

# CATRINA

PSYCHOPOMP FOES
Psychopomps’ greatest enemies are
creatures that devour or steal souls,
such as astradaemons and night
hags. Their other opponents include
necromancers, proteans, and those
who have unnaturally extended their
lifespan, such as liches.
CATRINA
Not all spirits who enter the Boneyard realize they have died. Catrinas meet these
souls, helping to convince them of the ﬁnality of their fate to ease a spirit’s passing.
Catrinas are more likely to intervene when a mortal can’t accept their death. They
perform their task to keep the afterlife calm, rather than out of true compassion
for a mortal’s grief. Catrinas only rarely visit the Material Plane, typically to help
an extremely important mortal pass on.
Catrinas resemble skeletons dressed in bright ﬂowers and colorful dresses,
giving them a simultaneously festive and macabre appearance. Though most

VANTH SCYTHES
Vanths’ favored weapon is the scythe,
a choice that even further adds to
their fearsome appearance and can
lead to unfortunate associations with
the Grim Reaper or Urgathoa among
more superstitious mortals. Vanths
ﬁnd such comparisons to be ignorant
at best or insulting at worst. Some
vanths infuse their scythes with
diﬀerent qualities, such as cold iron
or silver, depending on the nature of
their most common enemies.
VANTH
Protecting the Boneyard are the stern and resolute guardians of the dead known as
vanths, psychopomps who resemble skeletons with raven-like wings and a mask
resembling a vulture’s skull. Vanths carry black scythes to ﬁght against those who
would disturb the natural progression of souls, and they consider any visitor to
the Boneyard a potential troublemaker. When the psychopomp armies go to war,
vanths serve as front-line soldiers. They rarely speak and even more rarely show any
emotion other than a grim adherence to duty.

QLIPPOTH AND DEMONS
Qlippoth ruled the Abyss for eons
and still see themselves as its rightful
rulers. When the Abyss ﬁrst began to
spawn demons from the souls of sinful
humanoids, the realm was plunged
into a brutal war spanning untold
millennia, in which qlippoth, though
more powerful and established, were
slowly but surely driven back by the
endless demonic hordes who spawned
far more quickly than qlippoth could
ever hope to match. Today, qlippoth
have been driven to the deepest,
darkest corners of the Abyss where
they cling tightly to the crumbling
remains of their territory.
Qlippoth
Long before the creatures known as demons came to be the dominant force in
the Abyss, qlippoth ruled the Outer Rifts. These inimical creatures are a form of
primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well.
Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through
the Abyss, qlippoth have been driven to the deepest reaches of the Abyss, and
they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet rather than directly oppose
demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless
war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might
be turned back.
CYTHNIGOT
The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of
small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the
ﬂeshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything
else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot’s most identifying feature is
the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature’s body, ending in a
surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.

QLIPPOTH AND MORTALS
As qlippoth lost territory to their
demonic rivals, they realized that the
only way to stem the tide of demonic
forces was to starve them of the
sinful souls that the Abyss uses to
spawn new demons. While qlippoth
have no concept of how they
might go about preventing sin by
changing the way mortals act, they
do understand that exterminating
mortal life would solve the problem
as well.
SHOGGTI
Shoggti travel to other planes in roving bands to capture and charm victims,
bringing them back to the Abyss where they are enslaved for unknown—but no
doubt insidiously evil—purposes. These squid-like qlippoth have slick, blue skin
and four suckered tentacles that end in dexterous pincers. In addition to a lampreylike mouth at the base of its body, each has a secondary maw in the middle of its
forehead that stretches from between its two bulging eyes to the back of its head.

discourse can keep its attention by providing

OTHER QLIPPOTH
The qlippoth presented here are but
a small fraction of the squirming
awfulness that lurks in the deeper
rifts of the Abyss. Other types of
qlippoth include multi-armed, crab-like
gongorinans, which use living
creatures as incubators; shapeshifting
utukku, which inﬁltrate and undermine
religions; death-spawned behimirons,
which slay the living to reproduce;
and the living siege engines known as
catabolignes. Yet most frightening of

AUGNAGAR
The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast—
preferably on rotten ﬂesh, and when possible, demon
ﬂesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the ﬂesh
of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs
with leathery membranes like a bat’s wings, and
three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for
slicing ﬂesh.

into a frenzy of self-cannibalism
as it rips apart its own ﬂesh to
feast on. From the ruinous remains
emerges a thulgant—a smaller but
more powerful qlippoth. Scholars
are uncertain if other qlippoth are
capable of transforming themselves
in this fashion. So far, none have
returned from the Abyss with proof.

CAVE SCORPION
Cave scorpions prefer to reside in underground lairs. Most have lost nearly all of
their pigmentation, making them appear ghostly when they lurk at the edge of
the light. While they prefer to eat large insects, cave scorpions can and will attack
humanoids. Some Darklands societies have developed techniques to herd or lure
scorpions into pest-infested tunnels and warrens at the edge of their settlements,
where the scorpions thrive in a dual role of exterminators and guardians.

aapoph makes both attacks.
COIL SPY
Some serpentfolk undergo intense ritual training and practice to improve their
innate ability to disguise themselves. These serpentfolk often identify as members
of a sinister society known as the Coils of Ydersius, and the most devoted of
their number seek out methods of reincarnating into new forms to even more
efﬁciently inﬁltrate enemy societies. But before such agents take this extreme
step, they must prove themselves as Coil spies. These serpentfolk train in
methods of inﬁltrating other societies to such an extent that they might be
capable of inﬁltrating a mammalian civilization for years. Though they’re
expected to work entirely toward the eventual triumph of their people,
most Coil spies also ﬁnd personal pursuits to keep them occupied in
the shorter term. When Coil spies get caught, it’s rarely due to a lack
of pure skill, but rather to their arrogance or recklessness as they
pursue their hedonistic desires.

# CAVERN TROLL

NAR-VOTH DELICACIES
Both cavern trolls and xorns—squat,
tripartite earth elementals—share a
voracious appetite for deposits of
precious minerals. When either group
encounters the other, a frenzy of
claws and ravenous gorging ensues
until only one side remains. Powerful
cavern trolls who consume a critical
mass of xorns can gain tremorsense
and rule as monarchs over their
subterranean kin.
Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating
vulnerability to sunlight that petriﬁes them on sustained contact. Unlike common
trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by ﬁre. The crystalline nature of
their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.
As cavern trolls age, their ﬂinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and
stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete
with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and
weighs about 2,000 pounds.

TWO-HEADED TROLL
Two-headed trolls are savage, dualminded monsters with an unquenchable
thirst for bloodshed, and dread tales of their
ravenous appetites are whispered of in homesteads throughout the
lands of the Inner Sea. Indeed, it is a custom for parents to invoke
the two-headed troll as a warning to misbehaving children.
“Finish your chores,” a parent might say to a stubborn child, “or
a two-headed troll will snatch you away at night and swallow
you whole!” It’s unclear why such a morbid tradition gained
traction with parents, but it’s an undeniable fact that twoheaded trolls have an appetite for “nibbles”—creatures
small enough to devour with one bite.
Mature two-headed trolls stand 13 feet in height,
weighing roughly 1,700 pounds. Unlike common
trolls, two-headed trolls share the upright
gait of their ettin ancestry and do not walk
hunched over.

# CAIRN WIGHT

Bestiary 2
CAIRN WIGHT DIRGES
Unlike a typical wight, cairn wights
have an unusual aﬃnity for music.
The lyrics of their dirges often
contain a valuable bit of knowledge
or long-lost lore, possibly the
greatest treasure a cairn wight
guards. There are even brave souls
who seek out the creatures to listen
to their songs in hopes of ﬁnding
proﬁt from the dry, rasping words.
Wight, Cairn
Jealous guardians of tombs, barrows, and sepulchers, cairn wights usually spawn
from necromantic rituals. For those mortals who cannot abide the thought
of separation from their earthly possessions, the undead existence offered
by transformation into a cairn wight can be tempting. Perhaps as frequently,
particularly avaricious and wealthy royalty or merchants seek out victims to
transform into cairn wights to guard their precious wealth for all time.
Only in the rarest instances is the greed of a mortal strong enough to
spontaneously transform them into a cairn wight without a dark ritual or the
intercession of a powerful divine being. On those occasions, however, the resultant
wight exhibits unmatched viciousness and likely owns rare treasure indeed.
As guardians of material possessions, cairn wights are supernaturally bound to
the armaments they wore during the ritual used to create them. They can spread
their necromantic powers into the weapons they wield. A slash from a cairn
wight’s sword channels life from the victim into the wight.

autonomous cairn wight; it regains its free will, gains drain life and cairn wight
spawn, and is no longer clumsy.
Drain Life (divine, necromancy) When the cairn wight damages a living creature with
a melee Strike, using an unarmed attack or its bound weapon, the cairn wight gains
5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or
become drained 1. Further damage dealt by the cairn wraith increases the drained
condition value by 1 on a failed save, to a maximum of drained 4.
Funereal Dirge ʚʖ (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental, necromancy) The cairn

witchﬁres provides will-o’-wisps their
favored sustenance.
Witchfire
Manifesting as a sinuous form wreathed in sickly green ﬂames, this incorporeal
undead forms when a powerful hag or witch dies in agony or rage. The body at the
center of the ﬂames usually resembles the witch’s idealized self-image, regardless
of their age and appearance at the time of their death.
A witchﬁre often resides in a bog or swamp, which slowly blackens and decays
around them. These regions are often plagued by will-o’-wisps, which seem to
have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchﬁre. A witchﬁre might visit
villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always
attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams.
A witchﬁre might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens,
but a witchﬁre is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.
