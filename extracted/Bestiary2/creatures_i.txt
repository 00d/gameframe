CONJURING DEMONS
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet
the desperate or wicked still do.
Rituals like planar ally or planar
binding are typical for long-term
ends, and summon ﬁend for combat
applications. For planar ally, demons
sometimes accept oﬀerings that aren’t
valuable if gifting them to a demon
pushes the ritualist further into sin.
INVIDIAK (SHADOW DEMON)
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition,
but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing.
Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.

Favored Host Each invidiak has a particular type of
creature they prefer possessing, chosen from the
following list: aberration, animal, beast, or any
humanoid (such as dwarf)—in most cases, the favored
type of target is human. When an invidiak uses
possession against a favored host, the duration of
possession increases to unlimited, and the eﬀect lasts
until dispelled or until the invidiak dismisses it.
Shadow Blend ʚʖ (divine, illusion) The invidiak Strides
up to twice their speed. If the invidiak ends their
movement in an area of dim light, they become
hidden as long as they don’t move and the lighting
in the area they’re in doesn’t grow brighter than
dim light.
Unbodied Possession An invidiak leaves no body
behind when using possession.
NABASU (GLUTTONY DEMON)
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material
Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that
releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life.
Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage
to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more
powerful. Once they have sufﬁciently feasted, the demons become
worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo
a vile transformation, ﬁnally digesting their accumulated meals
and deforming further into powerful vrolikais (page 69).
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those
who prefer the tang of undead ﬂesh.

NABASU GROWTH
A nabasu stores their stolen deaths
until they ﬁnally become satiated.
For most, this occurs after consuming
death from at least 100 mortals, but
the exact timing is left to the GM. The
demon then travels to the Abyss and
transforms into a vrolikai.

IGUANODON
Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests
where they browse on the abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of
moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other
depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach
delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.
Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger.
Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A
well‑placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a
cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh
6,000 pounds.

Gouging Lunge ʚʖ The iguanodon makes a thumb spike
Strike at an adjacent foe and then Strides up to 15 feet,
dragging its thumb spike across the foe to gouge out a brutal
wound. If this Strike hits, it deals an extra 1d8 points of slashing
damage and the following Stride does not trigger reactions from the
creature struck. This thumb spike Strike counts as two attacks when
calculating the iguanodon’s multiple attack penalty.
SPINOSAURUS
The spinosaurus is more than just one of the largest carnivorous
dinosaurs—it’s also one of the most unusual in appearance,
with a large, sail-like ﬁn running along its spine. Often
quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to
attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it
appear to be even larger than it actually is.
A swimming spinosaurus can also use the

MAGICAL DINOSAURS
In a fantasy setting, magical eﬀects
or supernatural inﬂuences can
enhance dinosaurs by giving them
unexpected attacks, modes of
movement, or other abilities. You can
quickly create a memorable magical
beast simply by giving a dinosaur the
magical attack of another creature of
an equal level, such as a spinosaurus
gaining an acidic breath weapon akin
to that of an adult black dragon.
sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to
make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy
maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture
spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong
dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances
make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those
who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals
or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to ﬁght for the amusement of
others won’t discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones
seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus’s appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just
giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals
into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus’s potential. More
so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to ﬂeshwarping
procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance
the creatures’ viability
as effective guardians.
A spinosaurus can
measure up to 60 feet
in length and weighs
25,000 pounds.

ICE MEPHIT
Though capable of the same depths of cruelty as their ﬁre mephit kin, ice
mephits carry theirs out in a more calculating way. Unlike most
mephits, these pale blue mephits prefer solitude to company.
Lacking in empathy, they are known for their callousness,
and have a reputation for brutal honesty. They also have
few moral qualms about acting selﬁshly
and exploiting weakness for their own gain,
should the chance arise.

OOZE MEPHIT
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants,
shamelessly ﬂattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although
their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting
targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ochercolored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell
disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.

FLAME AND FATHOM MEET
Though ﬁre and water classically
oppose one another, in the right

combination. Water elementals heated
to a scalding temperature through
natural factors such as underwater
volcanoes might deal 1d6 persistent

Water elementals that become infused with cold or mist have increased mobility

ICEWYRM
Resembling wingless, serpentine dragons formed of jagged

ROGUE ELEPHANTS
Elephants of all species are, by
nature, social creatures who form
strong bonds with one another, but
when an elephant separates from
its herd—either due to tragedy or an
individual streak of viciousness—they
become known as rogue elephants.
These dangerous solitary creatures
are ill-tempered and quick to attack
anything that approaches them, and
often have the elite adjustments to
their statistics.
Elephant
Primeval variants of the elephant dwell in remote regions of the world.
ANANCUS
The anancus is an ancient species of elephant with unusually long tusks and a
trunk shorter than its more modern cousins.

# IRNAKURSE
================================================================================


Bestiary 2
IRNAKURSE MOCKERIES
When drow capture a particularly
hated surface elf, or one with a large
following, they inﬂict even greater pain
upon them during the ﬂeshwarping
process than most other victims. The
resulting irnakurse are known as
“mockeries,” and always have elite
adjustments. Rather than using them,
drow keep them close at hand as living
“art” akin to a pet or trophy.
Fleshwarp
Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two ﬂeshwarps
presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths
into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
IRNAKURSE
Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and
humiliating ﬂeshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment
of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves
twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose ﬂesh,
and bony protrusions—parts that should be internal are often left on full display
to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to
hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all
other targets.

ZEVGAVIZEB’S FAVORED
The demonic patron of many
xulgaths, Zevgavizeb, spends most
of his time slumbering in the Abyssal
realm of Gluttondark. However, his
vile priests actively pursue what
they insist are their dormant god’s
goals. Some xulgath high priests
practice ﬂeshwarping upon their own
acolytes, creating ghonhatine zealots
to serve in their legions and guard
their evil temples.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1. Further failed saves against Soul Scream increase
the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. Each time the character gets
a full night’s rest, the stupeﬁed condition gained from Soul Scream decreases by 1.
Critical Failure As failure, except the stupeﬁed value increases by 2 instead of by 1.
Storm of Tentacles ʚʖ The irnakurse makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the irnakurse’s multiple attack penalty, but
the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all of its attacks.
GHONHATINE
In transforming xulgaths, drow ﬂeshwarpers sought not to create a new type of
creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished
from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to
crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.

# ICE GOLEM
================================================================================

Filth Fever (disease) The sickened and unconscious conditions from ﬁlth fever can’t

carrier with no ill eﬀect (1d4 hours); Stage 2 sickened 1 (1 day); Stage 3 sickened 1
and slowed 1 as long as it remains sickened (1 day); Stage 4 unconscious (1 day);
Stage 5 dead
ICE GOLEM
Ice golems are either carved from massive blocks of ice, or pieced together from
individual components that are then fused together through heat and refreezing.
In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a
humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely
carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.
While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates,
the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer
temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower
end of the scale as far as cost and difﬁculty to create, gives these constructs
unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful
in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians
for their estates and vaults, but for comfort—the presence of an ice golem
standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the
chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice
golems as servants to keep drinks cold.

WOOD GOLEM COMPONENTS
Unless they are badly damaged by
magical ﬁre, the rare woods and
exquisitely carved blocks used to
craft a wood golem retain much
of their value after the golem’s
destruction. Carpenters, sculptors,
and even some merchants will pay
a fair price for the remains of a
defeated wood golem. However, if
the golem belonged to a rich and
powerful person and its fragments
are thus recognizable, it may be more
diﬃcult to ﬁnd willing buyers.
Vulnerable to Endure Elements An ice golem can be targeted with endure elements
even if it’s not willing. If it is targeted, for 1 round it can’t use Breath Weapon or
beneﬁt from creeping cold, and its ﬁst attack doesn’t deal cold damage.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +15 (magical, versatile P), Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 cold
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, cold, evocation) The ice golem exhales a blast of freezing
mist that deals 6d6 cold damage in a 30-foot cone (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t
use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Creeping Cold (arcane, cold, evocation) When the ice golem gets a critical hit with a ﬁst
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 persistent cold damage and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
WOOD GOLEM
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
together from scraps of ﬁrewood and discarded burls. It’s less common for
wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to
be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their
owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems
to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve
dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don’t
bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically
see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids
often feel when facing a carrion or ﬂesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such
creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic
match between the wood golem’s appearance and such locations.

# INTELLECT DEVOURER
================================================================================


SENSATION SEEKERS
Intellect devourers steal bodies to
experience the physical sensations
denied their nearly invulnerable
natural forms. Each new body
brings the opportunity to explore
new vistas of taste, touch, and pain.
Intellect devourers occupying a
body fear little but discovery, and
even that simply puts a temporary
end to their games. Harm to the
host is just another sensation to
experience, and replacement bodies
are easy to ﬁnd.
Intellect Devourer
Intellect devourers serve as advance scouts and inﬁltrators for the powerful
force of alien beings called the Dominion of the Black. These monsters roam the
Darklands, from which they mount secret invasions of the world above. When
an intellect devourer inﬁltrates a society, its ﬁrst priority is to acquire a body. It
might ﬁrst seek out a graveyard for a fresh corpse, as this is easier than ﬁghting
and killing someone. When the aberration compresses itself into the host’s brain
cavity, its real body goes dull to sensation as it connects to the nervous system of
its host. If found out, an intellect devourer might quickly inhabit a new body to
make its escape, preferably something inconspicuous such as a domestic animal.

Body Thief ̂ˬ (manipulate, necromancy, occult, possession) The intellect devourer
reduces in size and burrows into the brain of a creature dead for no longer than 1 day.
At the start of the intellect devourer’s next turn, the body revives at its maximum Hit
Points, controlled by the devourer. The intellect devourer is conscious and can sense
everything the possessed body could. Any eﬀect that ends the possession kills the host
body with the same eﬀects as Exit Body. The intellect devourer can’t use any of the host
creature’s spells with Body Thief but can use its own spells. The host body slowly decays
while inhabited by the intellect devourer, becoming uninhabitable after
7 days unless preserved with gentle repose or a similar eﬀect.
Exit Body Ȱɵ (move) Requirements The intellect devourer is
controlling a body with Body Thief; Eﬀect The intellect
devourer leaves its host body, which dies instantly
and is no longer a suitable host for any Body
Thief ability. The intellect devourer appears
at full size in an adjacent space.
Ravage ̂ˬ The intellect devourer makes
two talon Strikes against a paralyzed,
restrained, or unconscious creature,
using the same attack modiﬁer as its
highest attack modiﬁer. These Strikes
gain the death trait. If Ravage kills the
target, the intellect devourer may use Body
Thief against it as a free action.
Stolen Identity While an intellect devourer
uses Body Thief, it gains the ability to
understand and speak all languages
known by the host, as well as knowledge
of the host body’s abilities, identity, role
in society, and personality. However,
it does not gain the
speciﬁc memories
or knowledge of
the host body.

IRLGAUNT RELIGION
A small number of irlgaunts actively
worship Rovagug, whom they believe
to be the progenitor of their species.
Instead of living solitary lives,
these chaotic evil irlgaunts form
cabals that inhabit deep ﬁssures,
transforming them into grisly
temples by decorating them with
the corpses of their sacriﬁces. They
also decorate their own bodies by
carving prayers into their chitin and
painting themselves with crude and
disturbing images. Some claim these
runes grant them divine powers of
protection and the ability to summon
Rovagug’s otherworldly kin.
Irlgaunt
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils
erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow
them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines
that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible
alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without
pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful
ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating
gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive
enzymes strong enough to break down ﬂesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and
explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because ﬁnding enough food
to sustain a community tends to be difﬁcult. However, they still maintain a sense
of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to
discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been
known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.

transforming them into grisly
temples by decorating them with
the corpses of their sacriﬁces. They
also decorate their own bodies by
carving prayers into their chitin and
painting themselves with crude and
disturbing images. Some claim these
runes grant them divine powers of
protection and the ability to summon
Rovagug’s otherworldly kin.
Irlgaunt
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils
erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow
them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines
that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible
alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without
pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful
ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating
gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive
enzymes strong enough to break down ﬂesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and
explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because ﬁnding enough food
to sustain a community tends to be difﬁcult. However, they still maintain a sense
of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to
discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been
known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.

JABBERWOCK TREASURE
Jabberwocks have no interest
in treasure for its own sake, but
they gather objects of great value
or power speciﬁcally to entice
mortals into seeking it out. As a
result, jabberwocks quickly amass
impressive hoards of treasures taken
from nearby areas.
Jabberwock
Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many
cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey
realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures
known collectively as the Tane.
Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat,
drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly
by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or
frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most
powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one
purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the
Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even
entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a
single mortal. Sometimes, no speciﬁc insult or injury is required, as some of
the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically
create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its
younger and less chaotic sibling.
Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its ﬁrst order of business
is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day’s
ﬂight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might
eventually come hunting it, the better!
The relationship between jabberwocks
and vorpal weapons is the subject
of much debate and speculation
among scholars, and the various
poems, songs, and legends about the
jabberwock do little to clarify the issue,
conﬂicting and diverging on this point.
Some believe that vorpal weapons
were ﬁrst created speciﬁcally
to combat jabberwocks, but
others take the story one step
further. They cite evidence
in certain ancient myths that
there may once have been only
a single, unique jabberwock,
so powerful that nothing
could so much as scratch
it—nothing, that is, except
for the ﬁrst vorpal sword,
crafted for that very purpose.
So epic was the resulting battle
that it created strange echoes
throughout reality, and as a result,
these echoes, in the form of vorpal
weapons, can now be found on
many worlds. Those who subscribe to this
belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today
are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock,
and they speculate that only the combined efforts of
several Eldest would be sufﬁcient to create such a
creature again.
VARIANT JABBERWOCKS
The Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the
jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or
legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.

================================================================================
PAGE 152
================================================================================

JABBERWOCKS AND DRAGONS
Although jabberwocks may fear
vorpal weapons and are ﬁlled with
rage against all mortal creatures,
few things invite a jabberwock’s
wrath more than a Material Plane
dragon. Some scholars believe that
in the same way the First World is
believed to have been a template or
“ﬁrst draft” of the Material Plane,
dragons were created in the likeness
of jabberwocks. A jabberwock
that learns of a nearby dragon will
attempt to kill it to the exclusion of
all other priorities.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level
24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a
jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World,
mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of ﬁre, and
have eyes that burn with blue ﬂames that deal cold damage instead of ﬁre damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and
slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the
normal ﬂy Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock’s whifﬂing
aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.

GENIEKIN PARENTAGE
Planar scions from the elemental
planes are known as geniekin because
they are overwhelmingly born from
couplings between mortals and
genies: ifrits are born of efreet, oreads
of shaitans, sulis of jann, sylphs of
djinn, and undines of marids. Despite
this distinguished ancestry, geniekin
do not display most of their parents’
exceptional talents, such as their
ability to grant wishes.
Planar Scion, Geniekin
Geniekin are mortals whose ancestry has become entangled with that of genies,
causing them to exhibit elemental powers drawn from the Elemental Planes. Though
the geniekin found here are all of human descent and have example alignments,
geniekin and other planar scions can descend from other ancestries and have any
alignment. More information on genies can be found on page 162 of the Bestiary.
IFRIT
Ifrits’ blood blazes with elemental ﬁre. Most ifrits are second-class citizens who
serve under the iron heel of the efreeti and their Dominion of Flame, but those
born outside the efreet hierarchy or who choose to ﬂee it live
lives of passion in search of fame, glory, and power.
Ifrits are fond of ﬁre, but this doesn’t mean they all
embrace ﬁre’s destructive nature. Those who seek
more productive roles in a society ﬁnd inspiration in
the way ﬂames ﬂit and dance, and they pride themselves
in their skills as acrobats or dancers. The church of
Sarenrae particularly welcomes ifrit ﬁre dancers, both in
appreciation of their skill and to help ensure these ifrits
have a safe place apart from their more violent kin.
But by and large, ifrits are drawn to professions and
callings that allow them to wallow in the glories of ﬁre.
Ifrit pyrochemists apply this calling to alchemical
teachings, seeing purity in every single bomb thrown
or conﬂagration lit.

EXTRAPLANAR HUMANOIDS

Planar scions are members of diverse

inheritance from extraplanar beings
and, with exception of marids, typically

with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and
ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to
each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural
splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they
are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random
direction, departing with only their hope that they’ll discover whatever mystery
lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads ﬁnd that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in
such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also ﬁnd time
to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a speciﬁc portion of a fortiﬁcation or a remote
location on a wilderness trail.

PSYCHOPOMP TRAITORS
Some psychopomps view their task
of sorting souls as ultimately hollow
and meaningless, since the multiverse
itself must one day end. Eons ago,
these rebels shirked their duties
and ﬂed to the empty corners of
the planes, becoming a new type of
evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils
feed on mortal fears, particularly
fears of death, and enjoy tormenting
those who must die. Psychopomps
generally leave these malcontents
alone, except when sahkils interfere
with the proper ﬂow of souls.
Psychopomp
Many psychopomps are intimately involved with the Boneyard’s massive
bureaucracy. Few pursue mercy, justice, or personal gain; their duties to Pharasma
and her Boneyard are supreme. Nevertheless, individual psychopomps interpret
their duties in different ways, which might put them in conﬂict with mortals or even
with each other.
ESOBOK
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of
the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around
their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with
those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their
business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when snifﬁng out
threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they’re among the least
intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats.
The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won’t do so twice.
