CONJURING DEMONS
Conjuring demons is ill-advised, yet
the desperate or wicked still do.
Rituals like planar ally or planar
binding are typical for long-term
ends, and summon ﬁend for combat
applications. For planar ally, demons
sometimes accept oﬀerings that aren’t
valuable if gifting them to a demon
pushes the ritualist further into sin.
INVIDIAK (SHADOW DEMON)
For most demons, possessing a creature requires a ritual, magic item, or condition,
but for invidiaks, who lack a body, possession is akin to donning a suit of clothing.
Known also as shadow demons, invidiaks are formed from envious mortal souls.

Exorcism Vulnerability If an invidiak attempts to possess a creature and the creature rolls
a critical success on its saving throw to resist possession, or if an invidiak’s possession
of a creature is ended prematurely, such as via a successful dispel magic, the invidiak
takes 6d6 mental damage and cannot use possession
for 24 hours.

Favored Host Each invidiak has a particular type of
creature they prefer possessing, chosen from the
following list: aberration, animal, beast, or any
humanoid (such as dwarf)—in most cases, the favored
type of target is human. When an invidiak uses
possession against a favored host, the duration of
possession increases to unlimited, and the eﬀect lasts
until dispelled or until the invidiak dismisses it.
Shadow Blend ʚʖ (divine, illusion) The invidiak Strides
up to twice their speed. If the invidiak ends their
movement in an area of dim light, they become
hidden as long as they don’t move and the lighting
in the area they’re in doesn’t grow brighter than
dim light.
Unbodied Possession An invidiak leaves no body
behind when using possession.
NABASU (GLUTTONY DEMON)
Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material
Plane from the Abyss, an invasive infestation that
releases the newly formed and ravenously hungry demons
directly into the midst of their favored prey: mortal life.
Nabasus feed on sapient creatures, but they never quite manage
to sate their eternal hunger, even as they grow more and more
powerful. Once they have sufﬁciently feasted, the demons become
worthy to make the return trip to the Abyss, where they undergo
a vile transformation, ﬁnally digesting their accumulated meals
and deforming further into powerful vrolikais (page 69).
Nabasus form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those
who prefer the tang of undead ﬂesh.

NABASU GROWTH
A nabasu stores their stolen deaths
until they ﬁnally become satiated.
For most, this occurs after consuming
death from at least 100 mortals, but
the exact timing is left to the GM. The
demon then travels to the Abyss and
transforms into a vrolikai.

gaze upon a single target they can see within
30 feet. The target must immediately attempt a
Fortitude save against death-stealing gaze.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and
the nabasu suﬀers starvation vulnerability.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature is aﬀected by death-
stealing gaze and becomes drained 1. If
the creature was already drained 1 by the
death-stealing gaze before attempting
the save, a failed save increases the
value of the drained condition by 1, to a
maximum of drained 4. The nabasu gains
10 temporary Hit Points, and the drained
creature is temporarily immune until the
start of the nabasu’s next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature
increases the amount of drain by 2.
Stolen Death A creature that dies while suﬀering
drain from a nabasu’s death-stealing gaze rises as
a ghoul (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 168) the next midnight.
HEZROU (TOAD DEMON)
Hezrous dwell in the vast and endless Abyssal swamps,
mires, and waterways and are equally at home on land
and in the water. A hezrou’s presence has an obvious effect
on nearby ﬂora and water, causing plant life to twist and knot
and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste—signs much
easier to spot on the Material Plane than in the Abyss. Long
exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations
and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities
of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where

MAGICAL DINOSAURS
In a fantasy setting, magical eﬀects
or supernatural inﬂuences can
enhance dinosaurs by giving them
unexpected attacks, modes of
movement, or other abilities. You can
quickly create a memorable magical
beast simply by giving a dinosaur the
magical attack of another creature of
an equal level, such as a spinosaurus
gaining an acidic breath weapon akin
to that of an adult black dragon.
sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to
make a crushing wave.
The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy
maw is well-adapted to catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture
spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong
dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances
make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those
who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals
or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to ﬁght for the amusement of
others won’t discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones
seated in the surrounding stands.
The spinosaurus’s appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just
giants and bloodsport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals
into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus’s potential. More
so than any other dinosaurs, spinosauruses have been subjected to ﬂeshwarping
procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques to enhance
the creatures’ viability
as effective guardians.
A spinosaurus can
measure up to 60 feet
in length and weighs
25,000 pounds.

OOZE MEPHIT
Slick in every sense of the word, ooze mephits are unapologetic sycophants,
shamelessly ﬂattering anyone they may be able to con a favor out of, although
their lack of intelligence and subtlety means that only the most vain or trusting
targets fail to see through their honeyed words. Lacking proper bones, these ocher-
colored mephits have bodies consisting primarily of ooze and muck. They smell
disgusting, and their touch leaves stains that are almost impossible to get out.

STEAM MEPHIT
These brash and arrogant creatures are among the more energetic mephits. They
are quick to nominate themselves the leaders of any group, barking out orders in
shrill, high-pitched voices and insisting on having everything done their way. Even
when they aren’t bossing others around, the constant hiss of steam escaping from
their pores ensures that there is never a quiet moment.

and small unattended ﬂames (such as torches) are extinguished.
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, ﬁre) The steam mephit spits a cloud of
steam in a 15-foot cone that deals 2d6 ﬁre damage to each creature
within the area (DC 17 basic Reﬂex save). The steam mephit can’t use
Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
MEPHIT NAMES
Perhaps because they’re so often
compelled into service by mortal
conjurers and more powerful
elementals, mephits tend to adopt long
names peppered with self-proclaimed
titles and imagined or exaggerated
accomplishments to alleviate their
feelings of inadequacy. Some examples
of mephit names follow.
•	 Anothoraxia, Lurker in Dark Places,
the Tragic Hero, One Against All
•	 Silothiscil the Embittered, Rimelord
of the Eternal Chill, Lord of Icicles
•	 Oglophax, Prince of Pungency, the
Viscous One, the Forever Stain
•	 Zarnozath the Magniﬁcent, First
of His Name, Boiler of Kettles, the
Teapot Terror

ROGUE ELEPHANTS
Elephants of all species are, by
nature, social creatures who form
strong bonds with one another, but
when an elephant separates from
its herd—either due to tragedy or an
individual streak of viciousness—they
become known as rogue elephants.
These dangerous solitary creatures
are ill-tempered and quick to attack
anything that approaches them, and
often have the elite adjustments to
their statistics.
Elephant
Primeval variants of the elephant dwell in remote regions of the world.
ANANCUS
The anancus is an ancient species of elephant with unusually long tusks and a
trunk shorter than its more modern cousins.

Tusk Sweep ʚʖ The anancus sweeps its long tusks
back and forth, dealing 4d6
bludgeoning damage to all
creatures in a 15-foot cone,
who must make a DC 27
basic Reﬂex save.
MASTODON
Not to be confused with the
larger
mammoth,
mastodons
are primeval elephants who dwell
predominantly in temperate forests.
There, they travel in close-knit social groups
and feed on the forest vegetation.

creature. This counts as one attack for the mastodon’s multiple attack
penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both
attacks.
Grabbing Trunk A Medium or smaller creature hit by the
mastodon’s trunk is grabbed. If the mastodon moves, it can
bring the grabbed creature along with it.

ZEVGAVIZEB’S FAVORED
The demonic patron of many
xulgaths, Zevgavizeb, spends most
of his time slumbering in the Abyssal
realm of Gluttondark. However, his
vile priests actively pursue what
they insist are their dormant god’s
goals. Some xulgath high priests
practice ﬂeshwarping upon their own
acolytes, creating ghonhatine zealots
to serve in their legions and guard
their evil temples.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1. Further failed saves against Soul Scream increase
the condition value by 1, to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4. Each time the character gets
a full night’s rest, the stupeﬁed condition gained from Soul Scream decreases by 1.
Critical Failure As failure, except the stupeﬁed value increases by 2 instead of by 1.
Storm of Tentacles ʚʖ The irnakurse makes up to four tentacle Strikes, each against a
diﬀerent target. These attacks count toward the irnakurse’s multiple attack penalty, but
the multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all of its attacks.
GHONHATINE
In transforming xulgaths, drow ﬂeshwarpers sought not to create a new type of
creature but to recapture a form of xulgath predecessor believed entirely vanished
from Golarion. Ghonhatines are the result—hulking reptilian beasts who prefer to
crawl on all fours and tear at their foes with bestial fury.

WOOD GOLEM COMPONENTS
Unless they are badly damaged by
magical ﬁre, the rare woods and
exquisitely carved blocks used to
craft a wood golem retain much
of their value after the golem’s
destruction. Carpenters, sculptors,
and even some merchants will pay
a fair price for the remains of a
defeated wood golem. However, if
the golem belonged to a rich and
powerful person and its fragments
are thus recognizable, it may be more
diﬃcult to ﬁnd willing buyers.
Vulnerable to Endure Elements An ice golem can be targeted with endure elements
even if it’s not willing. If it is targeted, for 1 round it can’t use Breath Weapon or
beneﬁt from creeping cold, and its ﬁst attack doesn’t deal cold damage.
Speed 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +15 (magical, versatile P), Damage 2d6+7 bludgeoning plus 1d6 cold
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, cold, evocation) The ice golem exhales a blast of freezing
mist that deals 6d6 cold damage in a 30-foot cone (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save). It can’t
use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Creeping Cold (arcane, cold, evocation) When the ice golem gets a critical hit with a ﬁst
Strike, the target also takes 2d6 persistent cold damage and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
WOOD GOLEM
Wood golems are often given vaguely humanoid shapes, almost as if cobbled
together from scraps of ﬁrewood and discarded burls. It’s less common for
wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to
be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their
owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems
to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve
dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don’t
bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically
see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids
often feel when facing a carrion or ﬂesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such
creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic
match between the wood golem’s appearance and such locations.

IRLGAUNT RELIGION
A small number of irlgaunts actively
worship Rovagug, whom they believe
to be the progenitor of their species.
Instead of living solitary lives,
these chaotic evil irlgaunts form
cabals that inhabit deep ﬁssures,
transforming them into grisly
temples by decorating them with
the corpses of their sacriﬁces. They
also decorate their own bodies by
carving prayers into their chitin and
painting themselves with crude and
disturbing images. Some claim these
runes grant them divine powers of
protection and the ability to summon
Rovagug’s otherworldly kin.
Irlgaunt
Irlgaunts resemble titanic spiders or crabs, but with cephalopod-like tendrils
erupting from the tips of their chitin-armored legs. Their jagged gray shells allow
them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines
that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible
alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without
pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful
ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating
gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive
enzymes strong enough to break down ﬂesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and
explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.
While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have
a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers
and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.
They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute
explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements
of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.
For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because ﬁnding enough food
to sustain a community tends to be difﬁcult. However, they still maintain a sense
of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to
discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been
known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.

EXILES FROM BEYOND
These disgusting parasites originally
manifested in the First World, but
the fey denizens of that realm found
them too awful to endure and exiled
them to the Material Plane. Over
time, the isqulugs sloughed oﬀ their
fey features for new, more powerful
bodies of their own. Reports of
stranger variants ﬂourishing in areas
such as demon-deﬁled Tanglebriar
and remote fungi-ridden vaults in Orv,
however, suggest their foothold on
Golarion has become more established
than previously thought.
Isqulug
The isqulug’s appearance, though unsettling, might be its least awful aspect.
The creature resembles a bipedal amphibian with tentacles instead of arms and
a head composed of an undulant mass of what appear to be shifting, slimy
transparent eggs ﬁlled with writhing larvae. In truth, these larvae constitute
the mind and consciousness of the isqulug—its “body” is little more than an
organic suit manufactured from the ﬂesh of those it has consumed, analogous to
the complex web of a spider or the hive of a colony of bees, but fully capable of
movement and violence.

Expel Infestation ʚʖ The isqulug expels larvae
from the hivemind in its head in a 30-foot
cone. Creatures in this area take 6d10
piercing damage as the swarm feeds on their
ﬂesh (DC 30 basic Reﬂex save). Any creature
that takes damage is exposed to isqulugia.
The isqulug becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 1d4 rounds,

Saving Throw DC 30 Fortitude; Stage 1 sickened 1 (1 hour);

the creature dies, and its body violently transforms into a
new isqulug. Wish, similar magic, or a 9th-level resurrect
ritual can return the victim to life. The new isqulug
remains even if the victim is brought back to life.
Malleability The isqulug can Squeeze through
tight spaces as if it were a Small creature. While
Squeezing, it can move at its full Speed. The isqulug
can even Squeeze through spaces that typically ﬁt
only a Tiny creature, but does so at the standard speed
for Squeezing.

JABBERWOCK TREASURE
Jabberwocks have no interest
in treasure for its own sake, but
they gather objects of great value
or power speciﬁcally to entice
mortals into seeking it out. As a
result, jabberwocks quickly amass
impressive hoards of treasures taken
from nearby areas.
Jabberwock
Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many
cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey
realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures
known collectively as the Tane.
Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat,
drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly
by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or
frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most
powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one
purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the
Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even
entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a
single mortal. Sometimes, no speciﬁc insult or injury is required, as some of
the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically
create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its
younger and less chaotic sibling.
Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its ﬁrst order of business
is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day’s
ﬂight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might
eventually come hunting it, the better!
The relationship between jabberwocks
and vorpal weapons is the subject
of much debate and speculation
among scholars, and the various
poems, songs, and legends about the
jabberwock do little to clarify the issue,
conﬂicting and diverging on this point.
Some believe that vorpal weapons
were ﬁrst created speciﬁcally
to combat jabberwocks, but
others take the story one step
further. They cite evidence
in certain ancient myths that
there may once have been only
a single, unique jabberwock,
so powerful that nothing
could so much as scratch
it—nothing, that is, except
for the ﬁrst vorpal sword,
crafted for that very purpose.
So epic was the resulting battle
that it created strange echoes
throughout reality, and as a result,
these echoes, in the form of vorpal
weapons, can now be found on
many worlds. Those who subscribe to this
belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today
are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock,
and they speculate that only the combined efforts of
several Eldest would be sufﬁcient to create such a
creature again.
VARIANT JABBERWOCKS
The Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the
jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or
legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.

JABBERWOCKS AND DRAGONS
Although jabberwocks may fear
vorpal weapons and are ﬁlled with
rage against all mortal creatures,
few things invite a jabberwock’s
wrath more than a Material Plane
dragon. Some scholars believe that
in the same way the First World is
believed to have been a template or
“ﬁrst draft” of the Material Plane,
dragons were created in the likeness
of jabberwocks. A jabberwock
that learns of a nearby dragon will
attempt to kill it to the exclusion of
all other priorities.
Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level
24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a
jaws Strike.
Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World,
mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of ﬁre, and
have eyes that burn with blue ﬂames that deal cold damage instead of ﬁre damage.
Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and
slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the
normal ﬂy Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock’s whifﬂing
aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.

roll, the attack is a critical hit. This has no eﬀect if the 19 would be a failure.
Whiﬄing Ǻȓ (aura) Trigger The jabberwock Flies or makes a wing Strike; Eﬀect The
jabberwock’s wings whiﬄe, creating severe winds within a 30-foot emanation. These
winds move outward from the jabberwock, and they persist until the start of the
jabberwock’s next turn. During this time, ﬂight of any kind in the emanation requires a
successful DC 43 Acrobatics check to Maneuver in Flight, and creatures ﬂying toward
the jabberwock are moving through greater diﬃcult terrain. Creatures on the ground
in the emanation must succeed at a DC 43 Athletics check to approach the jabberwock.

EXTRAPLANAR HUMANOIDS
An important distinction exists
between planar scions and extraplanar
humanoids, such as fetchlings.
Fetchlings and other extraplanar
humanoids represent true ancestral
groups with their own physical and
cultural identities and traditions.
Planar scions are members of diverse
ancestries who share a similar
inheritance from extraplanar beings
and, with exception of marids, typically
integrate into other humanoid societies
instead of building their own.
with a pull like that exerted on the needle of a compass—intangible, constant, and
ultimately irresistible. The destination of this mysterious pilgrimage is unique to
each oread, though it usually ends in some place of great mystical power, natural
splendor, or esoteric learning. Most oreads are drawn to a place with which they
are somewhat familiar, but a rare few feel drawn to travel in a seemingly random
direction, departing with only their hope that they’ll discover whatever mystery
lies at the end of their invisible path.
Many oreads ﬁnd that the role of a guard suits their personality well, for in
such a role they can feel as if they are helping to promote order but also ﬁnd time
to stand vigil as lone sentinels over a speciﬁc portion of a fortiﬁcation or a remote
location on a wilderness trail.

SULI
Because their genie forebears are native to the Material
Plane, sulis (scions of mortals and jann) are by and large
the most common geniekin on the Material Plane. They are
often artisans and peace brokers, compelled to try and bring
harmony and balance in a world wrought with discord.
Sulis have a natural charm that often eludes other
geniekin, but tend to layer on a level of boastful
pride or even arrogance as a personal quirk or
humorous facade. Few non-sulis realize that
bragging is not simply the symptom of a puffed-
up ego for sulis, but instead is a cultural institution
easily comparable to human poetry. Sulis’ boasts not
only glorify themselves, but also secure their
companions’ and families’ accomplishments
in history, with the ultimate goal of
spinning stories that will be retold for
generations. This is especially true
for sulis who have lived with other
geniekin and have been seen as lesser for not having a
strong connection to an Elemental Plane.
Suli dune dancers are but one way these geniekin seek
to integrate with other humanoid societies. They work
to hone their skills at boasting to an extent that their

PSYCHOPOMP TRAITORS
Some psychopomps view their task
of sorting souls as ultimately hollow
and meaningless, since the multiverse
itself must one day end. Eons ago,
these rebels shirked their duties
and ﬂed to the empty corners of
the planes, becoming a new type of
evil creature called a sahkil. Sahkils
feed on mortal fears, particularly
fears of death, and enjoy tormenting
those who must die. Psychopomps
generally leave these malcontents
alone, except when sahkils interfere
with the proper ﬂow of souls.
Psychopomp
Many psychopomps are intimately involved with the Boneyard’s massive
bureaucracy. Few pursue mercy, justice, or personal gain; their duties to Pharasma
and her Boneyard are supreme. Nevertheless, individual psychopomps interpret
their duties in different ways, which might put them in conﬂict with mortals or even
with each other.
ESOBOK
Esoboks are brute hunters and pugnacious sentinels that serve as the guard dogs of
the Boneyard. These squat, powerful quadrupeds have a frill of dark feathers around
their distinctive heads which resemble a crocodile skull. Esoboks rarely bother with
those who are truly dead, allowing the dead of the Boneyard to go about their
business while remaining watchful for danger. Though cunning when snifﬁng out
threats to the Boneyard or to their psychopomp handlers, they’re among the least
intelligent of the psychopomps and rarely speak except to utter growling threats.
The wise listen when an esobok makes a threat, as it won’t do so twice.

and spirit touch
Melee Ȱɵ claw +12 (agile, magical), Damage 1d6+3 slashing
plus spirit touch
Divine Innate Spells DC 17; 2nd invisibility (×3; self only)
Pounce Ȱɵ The esobok Strides and then makes a
Strike. If it began this action hidden, it remains
hidden until after the Strike.
Spirit Touch
An
esobok’s
Strikes aﬀect incorporeal
creatures
with
the
eﬀects of a ghost touch
property rune and deal
1d6 negative damage to
living creatures and 1d6 positive damage to undead.
Wrench Spirit Ȱɵ (attack, divine, incapacitation, necromancy) Requirement
A creature is grabbed by the esobok’s jaws; Eﬀect The esobok releases
the target from the Grab but wrenches its spirit free as it does so. The creature
must attempt a DC 20 Will save. Creatures without souls (such as most constructs)
and creatures whose bodies and souls are one (such as most celestials, ﬁends, and
monitors) that roll a failure or critical failure on the save get a success instead.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The target is stunned 1.
Failure The esobok wrenches the target’s soul from its body
into its jaws. Mindless undead creatures of level 2 or lower are
destroyed, other undead creatures are stunned for 1 round, and all
other creatures are paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a creature
paralyzed by this eﬀect can attempt a new save to end the eﬀect. The
paralysis ends automatically if the esobok attempts a jaws Strike or speaks.
Critical Failure As failure, but as long as a creature is stunned or paralyzed, it is
also stupeﬁed 2.

OTHER VELSTRACS
There are as many diﬀerent velstracs
as there are ways to inﬂict pain.
Other velstracs range in power from
the relatively weak lampadariuses to
the powerful phylacators.

Ignore Pain An eremite’s actions can’t be disrupted due to damage or
Strikes (such as Attack of Opportunity).
Paralytic Perfection (aura, divine, enchantment, fear, incapacitation,
mental, visual) 30 feet. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it feels
compelled to oﬀer pieces of its own ﬂesh to the eremite. The creature
must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or become paralyzed for 1 round.
Speed 30 feet, ﬂy 50 feet
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +39 (evil, magical), Damage 4d8+19 piercing plus 2d6 persistent
bleed and exquisite pain
Melee Ȱɵ claw +39 (agile, evil, magical), Damage 3d6+19 slashing plus 2d6
persistent bleed, exquisite pain, and Improved Grab
Divine Innate Spells DC 42; 9th bind soul, blade barrier, harm (×2), heal (×2), shadow
blast, shadow walk (at will); 7th dimension door (at will), dimensional lock, plane shift
(to Material Plane or Shadow Plane only), shadow siphon (at will), warp mind; Cantrips
(9th) stabilize; Constant (9th) true seeing
Rituals DC 42; imprisonment
Evisceration Ȱɵ (attack) Requirements The eremite has a
creature grabbed; Eﬀect The eremite excises ﬂesh or
bone from a creature it has grabbed. The target takes
6d10 persistent bleed damage.
Exquisite Pain An eremite’s knowledge of pressure
points and pain centers is unsurpassed. A creature
hit by an eremite’s melee Strikes must succeed
at a DC 40 Fortitude save or be stunned 2
(stunned 4 on a critical failure). A creature
that critically succeeds is temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Focus
Gaze
Ȱɵ
(concentrate,
divine,
enchantment, fear, mental, visual) The eremite
stares at a creature they can see within 30
feet. The creature must immediately attempt
a Will save against paralytic perfection.
In addition, if the creature was already
paralyzed, on a failed save, its unnatural
longing causes it to become doomed 1.
After attempting this save, the creature is
then temporarily immune until the start of
the eremite’s next turn.
Graft Flesh Ȱɵ Requirement The eremite holds a piece of ﬂesh they collected
via Evisceration; Eﬀect The eremite attaches the stolen ﬂesh to
themself. They either regain 100 Hit Points; reduce the
value of their clumsy, drained, enfeebled, or stupeﬁed
condition by 3; or reduce the stage of any aﬄiction
aﬀecting them by 3.
Shadow Traveler (divine, divination) When an eremite uses plane shift or shadow walk,
they arrive at exactly their intended destination.
