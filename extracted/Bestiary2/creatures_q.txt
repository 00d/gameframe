OTHER COUATLS
The quetz couatl presented here is
the most common of its kind, and
while most adventurers and scholars
refer to them simply as “couatls,”
other kinds exist as well, such as
the ﬁerce xiuh couatl, the nomadic
auwaz couatl, the wise mix couatl,
the nurturing chicome couatl, and
the furious tletli couatl.
Couatl, Quetz
These sacred feathered serpents tirelessly serve the powers of law and good. Some
operate directly as messengers and intermediaries of the deities, while others
operate independently in aiding the cause of righteousness. Either way, they watch
over mortals and try to inﬂuence and aid them from the shadows, shifting from
plane to plane to spread wisdom and healing where they are needed. Some quetz
couatls are worshipped as divinities in remote or isolated societies, and while they
do not encourage such veneration, they use the trust placed in them to foster peace
and cooperation with others.
Quetz couatls are typically 10 to 20 feet long, with iridescent blue and green
scales. Their glorious wings of rainbow-hued feathers span 15 feet and weigh
nearly a ton. They are carnivorous, feeding on birds, mammals, and even the
occasional evil humanoid.

CRAB SPECIES
Crabs can be found along all of the
world’s coastlines, from relatively
small creatures like the king crab or
the coconut crab, to truly oversized
monsters like the great reef crab,
shark-eating crab, or the lumbering
shipwrecker crab.
Crab
Crabs are scavenging crustaceans known for their hard shells and iconic sideways
gait. They use their claws to defend themselves, hunt, and ﬁght other crabs for
territory. When confronted with threats from outside their species, most crabs
prefer to ﬂee, but when retreat isn’t possible, they clamp on to their foes as tightly
as they can.
The statistics presented here represent giant crabs that live close to the water’s
surface. Crabs that live deeper underwater often exhibit more extreme adaptations
to their environment. Crabs who live in the depths where little light reaches gain
darkvision and cold resistance, and those adapted to the most hostile reaches of
the deep sea can detect nearby creatures through subtle shifts in ocean currents.
These skittering creatures are prized for their delicious meat, but their size
makes them dangerous targets for harvesting.

Vulnerable to Prone If a creature critically succeeds on a check to Trip the giant crab, the
crab is ﬂipped over onto its back in addition to the usual eﬀects. A giant crab that is
ﬂipped onto its back has a particularly hard time defending itself; instead of taking the
normal –2 circumstance penalty to AC for being ﬂat-footed, it takes a –4 circumstance
penalty to AC.
Scuttle Ǻȓ Trigger A creature that the giant crab can see targets the crab with an attack;
Eﬀect The giant crab scuttles to the side and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
against the triggering attack. After the attack resolves, the crab can Stride up to its
speed in a straight line as part of the reaction.
Speed 25 feet, swim 15 feet
Melee Ȱɵ claw +10, Damage 1d10+4 slashing plus Grab
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d6+4 bludgeoning, DC 18

COASTAL HUNTERS
Quoppopaks prefer to hunt at dawn
and dusk, prowling seashores and
estuaries for fresh meat. While they
could easily live oﬀ of the minerals
and tiny organisms they ﬁlter from
the water sucked through their
ventral tubes, they delight in killing
living creatures. Despite their cruel
natures, quoppopaks don’t mind
hunting alongside others of their
kind if it means they’ll be able to
create even more carnage.
Quoppopak
Quoppopaks combine the most terrifying aspects of water striders, octopuses,
and vampire bats into one evil, water-dwelling monster. Their bodies consist of
an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in
a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey’s mouth and is capable of intaking
ﬂuids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land,
they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the
ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through
their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through
their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can’t expel ﬂuids, it
still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but
they are located inside the creatures’ abdomens, allowing them to draw their
air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can
hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to
humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters’ water reserves
quickly deplete.

Flooding Thrust ʚʖ Requirements The quoppopak’s ventral tube
is in water; Eﬀect The quoppopak uses Tentacle Stab against
a creature within reach; if either of these Strikes hits, the
creature must attempt a DC 30 Reﬂex save. On a failed
save, the quoppopak shoots water through its tentacles
into the creature, dealing 2d6+5 bludgeoning damage
and making the creature sickened 1 as its internal
organs ﬁll with water (double damage and
sickened 2 on a critical failure).
Tentacle Stab Ȱɵ Frequency once per
round; Eﬀect The quoppopak makes
two tentacle Strikes against the same
creature. These Strikes deal piercing
damage instead of bludgeoning,
and the quoppopak can’t Grab
with them. Its multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until
after both attacks.
Water Glide
The
quoppopak
can stand and move on the
surface of water or other liquids
without falling through. It can
go underwater if it wishes, but it
must Swim to do so.

ANCIENT INTELLECTS
Each radiant warden’s animating
force consists of raw positive
energy fused to the soul of a
willing sacriﬁce—usually an
astronomer or scholar near the
end of their natural life. Focused
now on protecting a site from any
intrusion­—including by curious
archaeologists or adventurers—a
radiant warden might pause before
an attack if approached peacefully.
Unfortunately, these constructs are
prone to speaking in vague riddles
or complex mathematical diatribes
that can be as confusing as they are
intriguing; often, discussions break
down as frustration mounts on
either side (or both).
Radiant Warden
The enigmatic and strange radiant wardens were constructed thousands of
years ago to protect observatories and scholars against the incursion of alien
aggressors from the Dominion of the Black. Over time, their roles as guardians
expanded to include watching over any region where the laws of time and space
have worn thin, particularly near portals and permanent gates between planets,
planes, or dimensions.
Named for both the radial nature of the concentric rings that make up their
bodies as well as the glowing radiance of their attacks, radiant wardens carry on
their orders, defending sites from invasion with single-minded purpose.

Gatekeeper Aura (abjuration, aura, occult) 60 feet. A creature that uses a teleportation
ability within the aura’s emanation or enters it via a teleportation ability must succeed
a DC 38 Will save or become sickened 1 and have its destination changed to a point
of the radiant warden’s choosing within the emanation. On a successful save, the
creature arrives as intended but is still sickened 1.

Orrery Ȱɵ (concentrate) Until it acts, the
radiant warden appears to be an orrery (or similar
large mechanical contraption, such as a telescope). It
has an automatic result of 53 on Deception checks and
DCs to convincingly pass as such a machine.
Radiant Blast ʚʖ (evocation, force, occult) The radiant
warden releases a 50-foot cone of bright energy
that deals 10d12 force damage (DC 38 basic
Reﬂex save). The radiant warden can’t use
Radiant Blast for 1d4 rounds.
Radiant Blow When a creature is hit by the
radiant warden’s hammer Strike, a ﬂash
of radiant energy attempts to anchor
the creature in place. The creature
must attempt a DC 38 Will
save; on a failure, the creature
can’t use any teleportation
eﬀects
for
1
minute.
On a critical failure,
the creature is also
permanently blinded.
