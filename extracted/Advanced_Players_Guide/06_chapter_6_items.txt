CHAPTER 6: ITEMS
The investigator’s trusty detective kit, a swashbuckler’s flashy dueling cape, and a witch’s
effervescent cauldron are nearly as iconic as the characters who use them. For any hero,
the gear and treasure they wield and collect throughout their adventures can play as
important a role as any other facet of their character, from weapons steeped in cultural
history to fantastic treasures of unparalleled worth!
This chapter presents a variety of brand-new equipment and treasure that
expands on and supplements the options provided in Chapter 6: Equipment
and Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure of the Core Rulebook. In particular,
the gear that follows is especially suitable for the new ancestries and classes
presented in this book, but the multitude of new items can enhance and
enrich all types of characters.
As it combines material from two chapters of the Core Rulebook, this
chapter is divided into the following sections.
Weapons and Adventuring Gear
New weapons and adventuring gear begin on page 248. This section includes
class kits for the new classes presented in this book, so you can quickly
equip a new character with the armor, weapons, and gear they’ll need to
start adventuring! The full rules for weapons and adventuring gear appear in
Chapter 6 of the Core Rulebook.
Crafting and Treasure
The second portion of this chapter consists of a catalog of new alchemical
items, snares, and both consumable and permanent magic items, including
runes. Table 6–4: Treasure by Level, on pages 250–251, presents all the
new items appearing in this book. These tables are organized by level and
item category (see the Item Categories margin note) to help you find the
appropriate gear for your character or adventure.
ALCHEMICAL ITEMS
Alchemical items are consumable, non-magical items that rely on the properties
of volatile alchemical reagents to produce their effects. Rules for alchemical
items, including the rules for bombs, elixirs, and poisons, begin on page 543
of the Core Rulebook. The alchemical items in this book are presented by level
on Table 6–5: Alchemical Items by Level, as a reference for alchemists and
other characters with alchemical abilities.
SNARES
Snares are small, simple traps to damage or hamper your foes that you can
create and deploy quickly enough to utilize on a battlefield. Snares are nonmagical consumable items. The full rules for creating and using snares are on
page 589 of the Core Rulebook.
MAGIC ITEMS
The remainder of this chapter contains the descriptions of dozens of new magic
items. These items are divided into two subcategories for ease of reference:
consumable magic items, including ammunition, oils, potions, and talismans,
begin on page 256. Permanent items, beginning on page 260, consist of armor,
held items, runes, shields, staves, wands, weapons, and worn items.
Items are organized alphabetically within each section. Rules for activating
and investing items, for sustaining and dismissing activations, and for reading
an item’s stat block begin on page 531 of the Core Rulebook.
ITEM CATEGORIES
Items in this chapter are grouped into
the following categories.
• Weapons and Adventuring Gear
(page 248) details new non-magical
weapons and equipment suitable
for ancestries, classes, and other
options presented in this book.
• Alchemical Items (page 252)
consists of bombs, elixirs
(including mutagens), poisons, and
alchemical tools.
• Snares (page 256) are simple,
single-use traps.
• Consumable Magic Items (page 256)
contains ammunition, oils, potions,
talismans, and other single-use
magical items.
• Permanent Magic Items and Runes
(page 260) provide new armor, held
items, runes, shields, staves, wands,
weapons, and worn items.

NEW WEAPON TRAITS
The weapons in this section use the following new traits,
in addition to those found on pages 282–283 of the
Core Rulebook.
Concealable: This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous
or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with
this trait.
Ranged Trip: The weapon can be used to Trip with
the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon’s first
range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance
penalty. You can add the weapon’s item bonus to attack
rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee
weapon to Trip, a ranged trip weapon doesn’t deal any
damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears
only on a thrown weapon.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
Bola: This throwing weapon consists of weights tied to
the end of long cords, which can be used to bludgeon
foes or entangle their legs.
Claw Blade: The three parallel blades of this handheld
weapon extend between the fingers to resemble the natural
claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a
way for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to
share the fighting customs of their kin.
Daikyu: This asymmetrical bow, made of laminated
bamboo, wood, and leather, stands 6 feet or more in
height. Using a daikyu while mounted limits its firing
range to your left side.
Khakkara: This staff is topped by a pointed metal
circle from which hang several smaller rings that jingle
and clang noisily as the staff is moved, allowing you to
announce your presence and scare off wild animals as
you walk.
Sword Cane: This slender, rapier-like sword is
concealed within a wooden or metal cane that serves as
a sheath, making it an inconspicuous weapon easy to
slip past inspections or into high-society events. A sword
cane is typically 4 feet long when sheathed, and its hilt is
usually capped with a wooden or metal decoration.
Tengu Gale Blade: This fan-shaped sword, designed
by members of the tengu ancestry, has five broad blades
that join at its hilt. Tengu sailors also use gale blades as
makeshift weather vanes, as the sword spins to show the
wind’s direction when loosely held aloft.
Wakizashi: This short-bladed, single-edged sword is
typically carried as part of a pair alongside a katana.
WEAPONS AND ADVENTURING GEAR
The following weapons and adventuring gear are of particular interest to members of
ancestries and classes introduced in this book, though any character might find them
interesting or useful.

GEAR DESCRIPTIONS
Brass Ear: A brass ear is a short, flared tube with one end
narrow enough to comfortably fit against the ear canal.
When using a brass ear to listen through a door, window,
thin wall, or similar barrier, if the barrier would normally
increase the DC of your Perception check to hear sounds
on the other side, the DC increases by only half as much
as normal.
Concealed Sheath: This leather sheath is large enough to
hold an item of up to light Bulk and is typically used for
daggers, wands, thieves’ tools, and similar objects. You can
affix it to the inside of a boot, under a bracer or sleeve, or
in other inconspicuous locations to gain a +1 item bonus to
Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the item within.
Detective’s Kit: This leather satchel contains empty
vials, a pair of tweezers, a supply of small linen cloths,
a set of brass calipers and a knotted string for measuring
distances, several pieces of chalk, a pen, and a blank
notebook for keeping notes. Every component of a
detective’s kit is of exceeding quality, and thus a detective’s
kit adds a +1 item bonus to checks to investigate a crime
scene, a clue, or similar details.
Dueling Cape: You can pull a dueling cape you’re
wearing from your shoulder and wrap it around your arm
with an Interact action. While wielding the dueling cape
this way, the cape uses that arm and hand, and you can’t
hold anything else in that hand. While you do so, you can
spend an action to hold it in a protective position, giving
you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and to Deception
checks to Feint until the start of your next turn.
Net: You can use a net either on its own or attached to
a rope. When attached to a rope, you can use the net to
Grapple a Medium or smaller creature up to 10 feet away
(instead of only adjacent creatures). You can continue to
Grapple to keep your hold on the target so long as the
target remains within 10 feet and you continue to hold
the net. The grabbed creature gains a +2 circumstance
bonus to Escape unless you are adjacent to them, and
it can attempt a DC 16 Athletics check to Force Open
the net entirely. Once the target is no longer grabbed, the
net is unwieldy until refolded as a Concentrate action
that requires two hands; if used without being refolded,
Grapple checks made with the net take a –2 penalty.
When the net is unattached, you can attempt a ranged
attack roll against a Medium or smaller creature within
20 feet. On a hit, the target is flat-footed and takes a –10-
foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes,
and on a critical hit, it’s also immobilized until it Escapes.
The Escape DC is 16. A creature adjacent to the target
can Interact to remove the net.
Parrying Scabbard: You can draw this reinforced
sheath during the same Interact action you use to draw
the weapon it holds, wielding the weapon in one hand and
the scabbard in your other. A parrying scabbard can be
used for your defense much like a weapon with the parry
trait: you can spend an action to position it defensively,
gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of
your next turn. Parrying scabbards are available for any
sword that can be wielded in one hand.
Periscope: This is a 2-foot-long tube with two angled
mirrors, one at each end. When the mirrors are aligned
correctly, you can look around obstacles while remaining
behind cover. This doesn’t provide a sufficient line of
effect to target creatures around corners.

Class Kits

these kits. The Armor, Weapons, and Gear entries include the basics, and the Options entries suggest additional items
you might purchase with your leftover money to fit your character. Note than an adventurer’s pack, which is included
in each kit, is 1 Bulk and contains a backpack, a bedroll, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks’
rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin.

Alchemical Items
Alchemical items aren’t magical—instead, they leverage
volatile substances in careful combination to produce
exceptional results. The full rules for alchemical items begin
on page 543 of the Core Rulebook. The following table

mixture of chemicals and salts that drain and
disintegrate nearby undead creatures. A ghost
charge deals the listed positive damage and splash
damage, though as usual for positive damage, this
damage harms only undead and creatures with negative
healing. Ghost charges are designed to explode even on
contact with a spiritual substance, making them ideal for

This frothing fluid causes the drinker’s body to exude trace odor-
absorbing oils. For the listed duration after drinking this elixir,
your scent is nearly unnoticeable. Creatures with imprecise
scent don’t detect you with that sense unless they Seek for
you, and you are concealed from creatures that perceive you

to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they
use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn’t apply.

Price 1,450 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

BLOODHOUND MASK
ITEM 2+
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This wide, single-use mask is designed to be slipped over
your mouth and nose and its alchemical filter activated all
with one hand. Once activated, the mask sharpens odors,
giving you imprecise scent with the listed range. You can’t
wear other masks while you’re wearing a bloodhound mask.
When you use Survival to Track a creature by its scent,
your proficiency bonus is equal to your level even if you’re
untrained, and the mask grants you the listed item bonus to
your Survival check. The GM sets the Survival DC based on
the area’s ability to hold scent rather than on visual clues, as
normal for using scent.
Type lesser; Level 2; Price 6 gp
The range is 15 feet, the item bonus is +1, and the duration is
10 minutes.
Type moderate; Level 6; Price 40 gp
The range is 30 feet, the item bonus is +2, and the duration
is 1 hour.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 250 gp

is 8 hours.
FORENSIC DYE
ITEM 1
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
Activating this vial of colorless liquid requires inserting a
small amount of another chemical or material, such as blood
or mud. The vial reacts rapidly, transforming into a murky,
reddish-brown substance.
Once activated, the dye remains potent for up to 10
minutes, during which time you can spend 1 minute to brush
it onto a single object of up to 1 Bulk or across the ground in a
single 5-foot square. Where the dye comes in contact with an

================================================================================

exact match for the activating chemical, it takes on a bright
blue hue, while staying transparent in areas where there is no
activating component present.
GHOST INK
ITEM 1
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate 10 minutes (Interact)
This pale-blue ink dries rapidly, becoming fully
transparent 1 minute after application. The ink glows
red when exposed to heat, such as that from a torch or
other open flame. This glow lasts only as long as the
ink is exposed to heat, after which the ink becomes
invisible again. The crafter of the ghost ink can
alter the formula slightly to instead make the ink
sensitive to sunlight, starlight, magical light, or
heatless light created by an alchemical effect such
as a sunrod.
While the text isn’t glowing, a creature closely
examining a surface marked with ghost ink can
detect the presence of the ink with a successful
DC 25 Perception check. On a critical success, they
can make out the ink well enough to use Society to
Decipher Writing. One vial of ghost ink is sufficient to write a
page worth of text.
ORIGIN UNGUENT
ITEM 2
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 6 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This shimmering, violet unguent forms mild chemical bonds
between objects with a matching composition. You apply the
adhesive to two objects, or to an object and a creature. You
can check if the two share an origin (such as if they were
broken from the same whole, or if a poison sample or body
part came from the same creature) by holding them together
with the unguent between; if they match, the unguent
becomes sticky.
SKINSTITCH SALVE
ITEM 7
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
HEALING
Price 55 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This sticky salve stubbornly holds wounds closed and
encourages swift natural healing. You can activate the salve
in either of the following ways.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You Administer First Aid without
requiring healer’s tools. You either gain a +2 item bonus to
the Medicine check, or you can use the skinstitch salve’s
Medicine modifier of +13 instead of your own.
Activate [free-action] Interact; Trigger You Treat Wounds or use Battle
Medicine; Effect You gain a +2 item bonus to the triggering
Medicine check. If you roll a success on the Medicine check,
you get a critical success instead.
SOVEREIGN GLUE
ITEM 7
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 55 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate 1 minute (Interact)
This peculiar amber glue bonds two surfaces together almost
inseparably. A single flask covers an area up to 1 square
foot and must be used all at once to form a single bond
between two surfaces. If the activation is interrupted, the
bond fails and the glue is wasted.
Once two surfaces are joined with
sovereign glue, they can be separated only
with a successful DC 50 Athletics check. The
adhered objects tend to break before the
glue does unless they’re particularly durable,
though a creature determined to separate the
objects can break off the parts connected by the
sovereign glue and later Repair the objects.
Sovereign glue can affect creatures only if they
are willing, and its bond can be harmlessly broken
by carefully exfoliating the outermost layer of skin or
waiting a short while for the skin to shed.
TIMELESS SALTS
ITEM 4
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 14 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
You sprinkle these salts onto a single object up to 10 cubic feet
in volume and no more than 40 Bulk to preserve it for 1 week.
The object doesn’t decay, and effects that require the object to be
fresh don’t count the time passing during this duration as having
elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse, this extends the period in
which a creature can be revived by magic, as well as the wait
time required before a corpse can be targeted again with speak
with dead. The salts prevent ordinary pests from consuming
the target (such as maggots for a corpse or moths for a piece of
clothing). Any creature can use an Interact action to disperse the
salts from an unattended object and end this effect.
UNIVERSAL SOLVENT
ITEM 5+
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
Originally formulated as a means of dissolving sovereign glue,
this powerful solvent can break almost any adhesive’s grip.
As universal solvent is particularly effective against sovereign
glue, it automatically dissolves sovereign glue. It attempts to
counteract any other adhesives, such as tanglefoot bags, with
a counteract modifier depending on the type.
Type moderate; Level 5; Price 21 gp
The serum has a counteract modifier of +9.
Type greater; Level 12; Price 325 gp
The serum has a counteract modifier of +19.
Type major; Level 18; Price 3,250 gp
The serum has a counteract modifier of +28.

Snares
Some rangers, as well as characters with the snarecrafter
archetype (page 194), quickly set dangerous traps called

to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 31
Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is knocked aside by the snare’s
deployment, taking half damage, and is flat-footed until the
end of its next turn.
Failure The creature is captured by the cage, taking full
damage and falling prone. It is immobilized while it
remains within the cage. It can get free by Escaping

TRAP
Price 180 gp
This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The
first creature to enter the square takes 5d8 piercing damage
and 5d8 slashing damage, with a DC 27 basic Reflex save. On
a critical failure, the hooks piercing its flesh make the creature
immobilized until it successfully Escapes (DC 27).
Magic Consumables
Though they might last a fleeting moment, these magic
items can decide the outcome of an entire battle or
quest. You can find these magic consumables organized
by level and subcategory on the treasure tables on pages
250–251. The Core Rulebook contains full rules for
special categories of items, such as talismans, and the page
numbers where they appear can be found in the glossary
and index, starting on page 266 of this book.
ANTLER ARROW
ITEM 2
CONJURATION
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
Price 7 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] Interact
Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter
with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully
restrain their foes. When an activated antler arrow hits a
target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must
succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the
surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow
(Core Rulebook 284).
If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you
have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC
of the Athletics check increases to 15.
BALISSE FEATHER
ITEM 12
CONSUMABLE
DIVINE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
TALISMAN
Price 400 gp
Usage affixed to a weapon; Bulk —
Activate [free-action] envision; Trigger You deal damage using the affixed
weapon to a creature you have seen commit an evil act.
This long, fire-red feather seems to catch flame every time the
weapon it adorns strikes a purveyor of evil. When you activate
the feather, the creature you damaged burns with holy light. The
creature must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or take a –2 status
penalty to AC and saving throws and reduce its resistances by
5. These effects last until the end of your next turn.
BASILISK EYE
ITEM 9
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
TALISMAN
TRANSMUTATION
VISUAL
Price 150 gp
Usage affixed to a shield; Bulk —
Activate [free-action] envision; Trigger You Shield Block a melee attack
with the affixed shield.
This slimy green stone glows with a strong light whenever
the shield it adorns blocks a melee attack. When the eye is
activated, the attacker must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude
save or become slowed 1 for 1 minute as its body slowly
stiffens in partial petrification.
CANDLE OF INVOCATION
ITEM 16
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
CONSUMABLE

Price 2,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 258
================================================================================

This golden candle bears the symbol of a specific deity
emblazoned on its surface, surrounded by the iconography of
that deity’s faith. Once lit, this candle burns for 1 hour, and it
can’t be extinguished.
Characters who cast divine spells and worship the
deity emblazoned on the candle can perform their daily
preparations within 10 feet of the lit candle to gain two
additional spell slots for the day, each at half the highest
spell level the character can cast (for example, 4th level
slots if the caster can cast 8th-level spells). Prepared casters
must prepare spells in these spell slots as they do for all
their other spell slots.
A caster’s additional spell slots from the candle are lost the
next time that caster performs their daily preparations.
No one can benefit from more than one candle of
invocation in a day, but multiple characters can
benefit from a single candle’s effects.
CANDLE OF REVEALING
ITEM 7
CONSUMABLE
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 60 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
When lit, this black candle’s eerie blue flame reveals
the presence of invisible creatures. Within a 10-foot
radius of the lit candle, creatures don’t benefit from the
invisible condition. Their bodies are outlined, not fully
visible, so they are concealed. Once lit, the candle burns
for 1 minute, after which the effect ends. If extinguished,
it can’t be relit.
CORROSIVE AMMUNITION
ITEM 7
CONSUMABLE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Price 70 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This peculiar ammunition is coated in yellow dust that leaves
a stain on anything it touches. When activated corrosive
ammunition hits a target, it dissolves across the target’s
armor. The armor takes 1d8 persistent acid damage that
ignores the armor’s Hardness; if the target isn’t wearing
armor, it takes the acid damage instead. This damage occurs
at the end of the target’s turns.
The creature can end this effect by
spending an Interact action to wipe off
the corrosive dust, and otherwise the effect
ends once the armor becomes broken.
DUST OF CORPSE ANIMATION ITEM 8+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —
Activate [two-actions] Interact
This black pouch contains what
appears to be fine bone dust.
Pouring the dust in a special
pattern over a corpse turns it
into an undead creature. The type of undead created depends
on the condition of the corpse, resulting in either a skeleton or
a zombie (Bestiary 298 and 340, respectively). If the undead’s
level would be greater than 3, the dust fails to animate it. The
body must be of an appropriate size and type for the undead
you wish to create—for example, you must sprinkle the dust
on a horse’s skeleton to animate a skeletal horse. If more than
one undead in the level range is appropriate, such as skeletal
guard or skeletal champion for a Medium humanoid skeleton,
you choose.
The animated undead has the minion trait, meaning it
can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a
Command for the current turn as part of the activation.
The undead creature remains animated for 1 minute before
collapsing back into its corpse form. As usual, you can
have a maximum of four minions under your control.
Type dust of corpse animation; Level 8; Price 100 gp
Type greater dust of corpse animation; Level 16; Price
1,500 gp
You can animate an undead with a level of 11 or lower.
FREEZING AMMUNITION
ITEM 5
COLD
CONSUMABLE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Price 25 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This chilly ammunition is dark blue and cold to the touch.
When activated freezing ammunition hits a target, the
target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be
slowed 1 for 1 round by the intense cold (slowed 1 for 1
minute on a critical failure).
GECKO POTION
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
POTION
TRANSMUTATION
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
A gecko potion is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks

This black incense smells of fresh earth and
ash. You activate the incense by lighting it,

OIL OF OBJECT ANIMATION
ITEM 8+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
OIL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk —
Activate [two-actions] Interact
This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully
spreading the oil over an object turns it into an animated
object (Bestiary 20) of the same type. For example, sprinkling
it on a statue makes an animated statue. If the animated
object’s level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to
animate it and ultimately fails.
This animated object has the minion trait, meaning it can use
2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for
the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains
animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can
have a maximum of four minions under your control.
Type oil of object animation; Level 8; Price 85 gp
Type greater oil of object animation; Level 16; Price 1,400 gp
You can animate an object with a level of 11 or lower.
OIL OF REVELATION
ITEM 5
CONSUMABLE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
OIL
Price 25 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This bright oil, first created by humans as a tool to help them
fight in darkness, holds flecks of tiny gemstones in suspension
and smells like a struck tindertwig.
The first time a weapon coated with this oil damages a
creature, the wound glows with light for 1 minute. If the creature
is invisible, the light’s position means it is merely hidden to
creatures that would otherwise be unable to see it, rather than
undetected. The light also negates the concealed condition due
to lighting conditions. If the coated weapon doesn’t damage a
creature within 1 hour, the oil sloughs off and loses its power.
OIL OF UNLIFE
ITEM 1+
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
OIL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while
rapidly repairing an undead creature’s physical or
spiritual form. When you dash oil of unlife onto an
undead creature, or a living creature with negative
healing, the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the
creature regains the listed number of Hit Points.
You can pour oil of unlife on an incorporeal undead;
in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.
Type minor; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The oil restores 1d8 Hit Points.
Type lesser; Level 3; Price 12 gp
The oil restores 2d8+5 Hit Points.
Type moderate; Level 6; Price 50 gp
The oil restores 3d8+10 Hit Points.
Type greater; Level 12; Price 400 gp
The oil restores 6d8+20 Hit Points.
Type major; Level 18; Price 5,000 gp
The oil restores 8d8+30 Hit Points.
POTION OF DISGUISE
ITEM 5+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
POLYMORPH
POTION
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
Upon imbibing this potion, you take on the appearance of a
specific type of creature for 2d12 hours. The type of creature is
determined when the potion is created. For example, you might
have a potion of elf disguise or potion of frog disguise. Drinking the
potion doesn’t impart the knowledge of how long the effect lasts;
the GM rolls the duration in secret.
The disguise doesn’t change your traits or statistics, nor does
it give you any of the special abilities of the creature you’re
imitating. It might affect what items you can hold or wear (for
example, your new form might lack opposable thumbs). The
potion shrinks you down to a minimum of size Small, or maintains
your size if the creature is your size or larger. For example, if you
are Medium and drink a potion of fire giant disguise, you’ll take on
the appearance of a fire giant but remain Medium. The creature
has to be of a specific kind, such as “leopard” or “lion” rather than
just “cat,” or “fire giant” or “ogre” rather than just “giant,” but the
potion can’t cause you to mimic a specific individual creature.
The effects of this potion use the same rules as the Impersonate
activity of Deception. Onlookers always assume you’re the
chosen type of creature unless they’re actively Seeking. You gain
a +4 status bonus to your Deception DC against such Perception
checks and add your level even if untrained.
Type lesser; Level 5; Price 30 gp; Craft Requirements Initial
raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh of
the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate.
Type moderate; Level 8; Price 100 gp; Craft Requirements
Initial raw materials must include a bit of blood, hair, or flesh
of the creature the potion will allow the drinker to imitate.
The potion can increase your size if the creature is larger
than you, to a maximum of Large, and it can shrink you to
a creature of size Tiny. This doesn’t change any of your
statistics, with the exception of reducing your reach to 0
feet as a Tiny creature.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 300 gp
While drinking a greater potion of disguise, if you picture
the specific form you want to transform into, the potion
will change you into that form. You can attempt to
Impersonate a specific individual, though you still
need to roll Deception.

CONSUMABLE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
POTION
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
A potion of retaliation is available in four varieties—acid, cold,
electricity, and fire—each with a faint shimmer reminiscent of
the energy it contains. For 1 minute after drinking a potion
of retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of that energy, and
a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed
attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you)
takes damage of that type. The moderate, greater, and major
versions also damage an adjacent creature that hits you with
a melee weapon Strike.
Type minor; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The aura deals 1 damage.
Type lesser; Level 3; Price 12 gp
The aura deals 1d4 damage.
Type moderate; Level 6; Price 50 gp

POTION OF SHARED MEMORIES
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
MENTAL
POTION
Price 4 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
A potion of shared memories can transfer recollections from
one creature to another. To place a memory in the potion,
you must hold the vial and focus on a particular memory for
1 minute. This memory must be of a single event, location,
person, or otherwise encompass a span of about 1 minute.
The clear fluid takes on a shimmering hue reminiscent of the
stored memory and gains a slightly sweet taste.
Upon consuming the potion, the drinker vividly recalls
the memory, and thereafter can remember it as easily as a
memory they actually experienced. An unwilling drinker can
refuse to absorb the memory.
RATION TONIC
ITEM 1+
CONJURATION
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
POTION
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This slender vial appears to hold clean, clear water with a
faintly fruity scent. Drinking a ration tonic magically nourishes
you with the equivalent of a day’s worth of food and water.
The tonic has a subtle, pleasant taste, its particulars chosen
when the potion is crafted.
Type ration tonic; Level 1; Price 3 gp
Type greater ration tonic; Level 7; Price 55 gp
A greater ration tonic nourishes you for 1 week instead of 1
day, distributing the nourishment in a constant and healthy
flow across the week.
SHIELDING SALVE
ITEM 1
ABJURATION
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
OIL
Price 4 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This shimmering paste has many properties of a shield spell.
When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains
a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round. The first time a
physical attack or a magic missile hits the target during that
round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and
then the oil’s effect ends.
TERRIFYING AMMUNITION

Price 50 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This black-and-gray ammunition is etched with occult
symbols and tiny, grinning skulls. When activated terrifying
ammunition damages a creature, it fills the creature’s mind
with visions of their own failures, tragedies, and eventually,
their own death. The creature must attempt a DC 20 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is frightened 1 and can’t reduce its
frightened value below 1 until it spends an action, which
has the concentrate trait, to calm itself down.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is frightened 2.
TIME SHIELD POTION
ITEM 13
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
POTION
TRANSMUTATION
Price 600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This purple potion has a bitter taste and seems to blur with
motion. When you drink a time shield potion, you are frozen in
time for 2d4 rounds. You can’t act or be targeted, you become
immune to all effects, and you vanish from your space; as far
as the universe is concerned, you simply don’t exist as long
as the potion lasts. The durations of any effects targeting you
when you drink the potion are suspended until it wears off.
Once the potion’s duration expires, you return to the normal
flow of time and your former space; if that space is now
occupied, you get shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.
Effects with durations immediately resume affecting you,
elapsing as though no time has passed. If you are within the
area of an effect created while you were outside of time, you
immediately take those effects upon returning. The GM might
determine that other changes that occurred while you were
outside of time (such as the ground beneath you crumbling)
also affect you upon your return.

Permanent Magic Items
and Runes
These peculiar or awe-inspiring magic items might be
the spoils of bold adventures or the creations of diligent
research and toil in a crafter’s workshop. As
permanent items, they can be used repeatedly
over an adventurer’s career. You can find
these permanent items organized by level
and subcategory on the treasure tables on
pages 250–251.
Full rules for special types of items, such as
staves and wands, are in the Core Rulebook,
and the page numbers where they appear can
be found in the glossary and index, starting
on page 266 of this book.
EARTHGLIDE CLOAK
ITEM 15
EARTH
INVESTED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 6,500 gp
Usage worn cloak; Bulk —
This brown-and-gold robe covers you from head to toe. Its
weighty fabric doesn’t move with the wind, instead hanging
still as if carved of stone.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Effect You
Burrow through dirt and stone up to your land Speed, leaving
no tunnels or signs of your passing. If you end your movement
inside solid stone, you are forcibly expelled into the nearest
open area, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet
between the end of your movement and the open area.
EARTHSIGHT BOX
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
MAGICAL

This fine wooden box is inlaid with Dwarven runes,
with hinges and a clasp of forged iron.
The box contains a few handfuls of
fine sand.
Activate 1 minute (envision, Interact);
Frequency once per day; Effect
You hold the box closed and,
while
envisioning
the
earth
around you, turn the box clockwise three
times and then give it three slow shakes. When you
open the box, the sand has arranged itself to replicate, in
miniature, the stone terrain surrounding you, to a range of
60 feet. This shows details of paths; hills; embankments;
boulders; and even artificial structures like walls, ditches,
and tunnels, as long as they’re made of stone and earth.
If you’re underground, it reveals tunnels and voids in
the earth within 60 feet at your current depth. The sand
maintains its shape until you close the box.
ENVISIONING MASK
ITEM 11
DIVINATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Price 1,200 gp
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
These strange masks consist of a thin stone hood and a
shimmering purple veil reminiscent of the pleroma aeon who
first gifted them to mortals in the hope that sharing the
means of aeon communication would reduce the
misunderstandings and conflicts among
mortal civilizations. An envisioning mask
covers your entire face, though it doesn’t
hinder your vision or other senses.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per
day; Effect You lose the ability to produce
language and instead communicate wordlessly
through a series of psychic projections. This
acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet,
but it is understandable to all creatures
regardless of whether they have a language. When
communicating with non-aeons, however, your meaning is
often vague and mysterious. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.
EXPLODING SHIELD

UNCOMMON
COLD
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
FIRE
MAGICAL
Price 1,700 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This +2 striking dogslicer is obviously the work of a
brilliant but scrappy artisan who valued versatility over
safety. Four toothy gems line the blade’s cutting edge,
three of which glow—one with fiery red light, one with
a chill blue, and one that gives off sparks—while the last
is a glistening black. Each of these gems embodies a
weapon property rune, but only one rune can be active
at a time.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You twist the gem along the
blade corresponding with the desired weapon rune:
red for flaming, blue for frost, or yellow for shock. You take
1d6 damage of the type the chosen rune deals. You can
instead twist the black gem to disable the active property
rune, taking no damage.
GLAMOROUS BUCKLER
ITEM 2
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
Price 35 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
A glamorous buckler (Hardness 3, HP 6, BT 3) is lavishly
decorated with gilding and inset gemstones that glitter in
the light. While you have it raised, the glamorous buckler
grants you a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Feint.
Activate [free-action] envision; Frequency once per day;
Trigger You Feint; Requirements You have
the glamorous buckler raised; Effect As
you Feint, the glamorous buckler sparkles
mightily. On a successful Feint, the target is
dazzled for 1 round.

These heavy boots are made of blackened metal and always
feel warm to the touch, with streams of glowing embers
cascading off their heels. While wearing hellfire boots, you
gain resistance 10 to fire damage.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency once per minute; Effect
Stride. Each square you move through during your Stride is
scorched with hellish flames, becoming hazardous terrain
for 1 minute. A creature that moves through one of these
spaces takes 3d6 fire damage.
INFILTRATOR’S ACCESSORY
ITEM 5
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
Price 150 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This elegant +1 striking sword cane serves equally well as a
fashionable accessory and hidden weapon suitable for high-
society events where weapons aren’t typically permitted.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You twist the sword cane’s hilt,
magically merging the blade into the cane. While
the blade is merged, it can’t be drawn and gains the
benefits of a 3rd-level magic aura spell to appear
non-magical. Passive observers can’t attempt a check
to notice the cane is anything more than a mundane,
if superb, fashion accessory. Those carefully examining
it can discern the cane is more than it appears, but
doing so is extremely difficult (DC 30 Perception).
Activating the sword cane again releases the
blade, allowing it to be drawn normally.
LOVER’S GLOVES
ITEM 8
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Price 500 gp
Usage worn gloves; Bulk —

day; Effect You grasp the hands of a willing
creature you have strong positive feelings
about, regardless of the nature of those feelings.
The creature gains a +1 status bonus to saving
throws and 10 temporary Hit Points for 10 minutes.
If the creature shares your feelings, you gain the same
benefits, and for the duration, when you both roll a
success on a saving throw against an emotion effect
that causes negative emotions, you both get a critical
success instead.

This ice-blue half-mask is adorned with a wicked silver grin
that covers the wearer’s mouth, leaving the rest of the face
uncovered. You gain a +2 item bonus to Intimidation checks.
Activate [two-actions] envision, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect The mask emits a soul-chilling scream that deals
6d10 negative damage to each living creature in a 20-foot
emanation (DC 25 basic Fortitude save).

PREDICTABLE SILVER PIECE
ITEM 1
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This seemingly unremarkable, weathered silver
coin bears the bust of an unnamed monarch on
the face and a majestic bird on the tail. You can
toss the coin without activating it, in which case it
follows the normal laws of probability.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You rub your thumb on one side
of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking the
strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in
a coin toss. No matter how the toss is resolved—
letting the coin fall to the ground, slapping it down
on the back of your hand, or catching it on your open
palm—it always lands with the side you rubbed face up.
READY

a 3-action activity.
ROD OF CANCELLATION
ITEM 20
RARE
ABJURATION
MAGICAL
Price 75,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This powerful magic rod is inimical to
all magic.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect You
touch the rod to a magical effect
or magic item and attempt to
counteract the effect or item.
Regardless of the result, the
rod of cancellation can’t be
activated again for 2d6 hours.
On a success, the effect or item is
deactivated for the same amount of time, and its duration,
if any, continues to expire during that time. If you choose,
you can instead completely drain the rod of cancellation’s
magic on a success in order to completely drain the magic
from the effect or item. If you do, both become completely
non-magical and their magic can’t be recovered, even by
the remake spell.
The rod of cancellation automatically fails to counteract
most artifacts and similarly powerful items, but it reacts
explosively when activated against a sphere of annihilation
without a counteract check (Gamemastery
Guide 113).
ROPE OF CLIMBING
ITEM 3+
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION

hold one end of the rope and point to a destination.
The rope animates for 1 minute, moving 10 feet per
round until it reaches the destination or runs out of
length. The rope can move across any non-damaging
horizontal or vertical surface, but it can’t extend upward
without a surface to support it. At any point while the
rope is animated, you can use an Interact action to
wiggle the rope, giving it one of the following
commands: stop in place, fasten securely to
the nearest available object, detach from an
object, or knot or unknot itself.
Type lesser rope of climbing; Level 3; Price 45 gp

an extradimensional space. These spaces each function as a

Bulk; the sleeves grow slightly heavy as you reach maximum
capacity. You can add or remove an item from a sleeve with a
single hand free as an Interact action.
If a sleeve is completely empty, you can place your own
familiar into that extradimensional space. It can survive
comfortably in your sleeve for up to 1 hour, after which it
begins to suffocate. While in your sleeve, it can’t be affected or
targeted by any effects, but you don’t benefit from any master
abilities. A familiar can exit the sleeve of its own volition with a
single action that has the manipulate and move traits. You can’t
place any other creature into your sleeves, nor can you place
your familiar in a sleeve if it’s larger than Tiny. If your familiar is
in your sleeve, you can’t place any items in the sleeve.
Type sleeves of storage; Level 4; Price 100 gp

only when you’re creating an infused alchemical item, and some
can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait
is always followed by a level, such as “additive 2”. An additive adds
its level to the level of the alchemical item you’re modifying; the
result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture’s item level must
be no higher than your advanced alchemy level. CR 75

fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either conjure or
manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no effect in an area
without fire. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a
magical connection to that element.
flourish (trait) Flourish actions are actions that require too much exertion
to perform a large number in a row. You can use only 1 action with the
flourish trait per turn.
Focus Point If you can cast focus spells, you have a pool of Focus Points
you can use to cast them. You regain a Focus Point using the Refocus

made of pure magical force.
formula A recipe or instructions required to Craft an item. CR 293–294
fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice.
You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If
multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If
a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll,
the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. CR 449
gear 248–49, CR 270–295
general (trait) A type of feat that any character can select, regardless
of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You
can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general

only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by
goblins. 45, CR 46–49
good (trait) Good effects often manipulate energy from good-aligned Outer
Planes and are antithetical to evil divine servants or divine servants of
evil deities. A creature with this trait is good in alignment. An ability
with this trait can be selected or used only by good creatures.

ability with this trait can be used or selected only by half-elves. CR

restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other
debilitating effects.
held item (magic item) 260–265, CR 572–576
heritage A choice made to further define your ancestry. CR 33

versatile heritage 28–29
hex (trait) A hex is a short-term effect generated on the fly from your
patron’s magic, requiring your familiar to draw from your patron. As
such, you can cast only one spell with the hex trait each turn; attempts
to cast a second hex spell on the same turn fail, and the spellcasting
actions are lost. 101
hostile action A hostile action is one that can harm or damage another
creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is
unaware could cause harm.
human (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the human
ancestry. Humans are a diverse array of people known for their
adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only
by humans. 47, CR 54–59

illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with
the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.
CR 298
immunity An immunity causes a creature to ignore all damage, effects,
or conditions of a certain type. CR 451–453

temporary immunity CR 453
incapacitation (trait) An ability with this trait can take a character
completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use
on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait,
any creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result
of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one
degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster
made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any
other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level
than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the
same benefits.
incorporeal (trait) An incorporeal creature or object has no physical
form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside
an object, an incorporeal creature can’t perceive, attack, or interact
with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object,
it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal
creature, but they can’t end their movement in its space.
An
incorporeal
creature
can’t
attempt
Strength-based
checks against physical creatures or objects—only against
incorporeal ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch
property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can’t attempt
Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.
Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions
that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision
damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except
force damage and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property
rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.
infused (trait) You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using
your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert.
Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with
the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you
make your daily preparations again. CR 72, 75
injury (trait) This poison is delivered by damaging the recipient. CR 550
Invest an Item (activity) You invest your energy in an item as you don
it. CR 531
invested (trait) A character can wear only 10 magical items that have
the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if
the character hasn’t invested it, nor can it be activated, though the
character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical
item (like a hat keeping rain off their head). CR 531
investigator (class) 54–65

multiclass archetype 151

kobold (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry.
Kobolds are reptilian humanoids who are usually Small and typically
have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only
by kobolds. 12–15
lawful (trait) Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned
Outer Planes and are antithetical to chaotic divine servants or divine
servants of chaotic deities. A creature with this trait is lawful in
alignment. An ability with this trait can be selected or used by lawful
creatures only.
light (trait) Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and
can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness
magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but
some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.
lineage (trait) A feat with this trait indicates a character’s descendance
from a particular type of creature. You can have only one lineage feat.
You can select a lineage feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into
or out of these feats. 28
linguistic (trait) An effect with this trait depends on language
comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if
the target understands the language you are using.
litany (trait) Litanies are special devotion spells, typically used by
champions and requiring a single action, that usually give temporary
immunity to further litanies.
magical (trait) Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical
energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item
radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic.
Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of
magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal
trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the
item is magical. CR 535
manipulate (trait) You must physically manipulate an item or make
gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable
appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions
often trigger reactions.
master spellcasting benefits These benefits are granted by spellcasting
archetypes. 150
mechanical (trait) A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object.
CR 521
mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect
on an object or a mindless creature.
metamagic (trait) Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from
metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a
metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter.
If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than
Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic
action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of
the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
minion (trait) Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature.
A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t
use reactions. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per
turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal
companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or
magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or
Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal
command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits.

================================================================================

If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend
themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long
enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals
follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.
misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll
your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a
single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides
which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune
effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and
you roll normally. CR 449
monk (class) 128–131, CR 154–165

ki spells 229, CR 401–402
monk (trait) Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon
with this trait is primarily used by monks.
morph (trait) Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph
trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical.
You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph
the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts
to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects,
described in that trait).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the
polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM
determines which morph effects can be used together and which can’t.
mount An animal companion with this special ability supports its rider.
CR 214
mounted combat CR 478
move (trait) An action with this trait involves moving from one space to
another. CR 473–475
multiclass (trait) Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent
diversifying your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t
select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are a member of
the class of the same name. 149–154, CR 219
mutagen (trait) An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies
the subject’s body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one
or more beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects.
Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only
one at a time. 253, CR 546
necromancy (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are associated
with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life
and death.
negative (trait) Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative
energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate
negative energy.
negative healing (trait) A creature with negative healing draws life from
negative energy rather than positive energy. It is damaged by positive
damage and is not healed by positive healing effects. It does not take
negative damage, and it is healed by negative effects that heal undead.
nonlethal (trait) An effect with this trait is nonlethal. Damage from a
nonlethal effect knocks a creature out rather than killing it. CR 453
nonlethal (weapon trait) Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal,
and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them.
You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2
circumstance penalty.
oath (trait) Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually
have only one feat with this trait. CR 109
occult (trait) This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon
bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.
CR 299
occult spell list 212–213, CR 311–314
oil (trait) Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are
typically applied to an object and are used up in the process. 258,
CR 561–562
ooze (trait) Oozes are creatures with simple anatomies. They tend to
have low mental ability scores and immunity to mental effects and
precision damage.
open (trait) These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn.
You can use an open only if you haven’t used an action with the attack
or open trait yet this turn.
oracle (class) 66–81

multiclass archetype 152

revelation spells 229–234
oracle (trait) This trait indicates abilities from the oracle class.
orc (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. These
green-skinned people tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait
can be used or selected only by orcs. An item with this trait is created
and used by orcs. 16–19
orichalcum (material) CR 579
parry (weapon trait) This weapon can be used defensively to block
attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is
trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your
weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the
start of your next turn. CR 283
physical (damage type) A grouping of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage. CR 452
planar scion These versatile heritages represent people descended from a
distant planar ancestor or tied strongly to another plane. 34–41
plant (trait) Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct
from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or
conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Effects that manipulate
plants have no effect in an area with no plants.
poison (trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison
damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an
affliction. 254, CR 457–458, 550–554
polymorph (trait) These effects transform the target into a new form. A
target can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect
at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect,
the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it
succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that
target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are
magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the
target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but
rather just a generic creature of a type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special
statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status
bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form
prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most
manipulate actions that require hands. (If there’s doubt about
whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is
absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function,
but you can’t activate any items.
positive (trait) Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive
energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate
positive energy.
potion (trait) A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it.
257–259, CR 562–564
prediction (trait) Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen
in the near future. Most predictions are divinations.
press (trait) Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks.
An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently
affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait
also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure
don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can
choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish
to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Because
a press action requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one
when it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.
primal (trait) This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting
to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.
CR 299
primal spell list 213, CR 314–315

initial proficiencies CR 68
rage (trait) You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they
end automatically when you stop raging. CR 87
ranged trip (weapon trait) This weapon can be used to Trip with the
Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon’s first range increment. The
skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon’s
item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee
weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn’t deal any damage when used to
Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon. 248
ranger (class) 132–133, CR 166–177

warden spells 234–235
ranger (trait) This indicates abilities from the ranger class.
rare (trait) This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to
find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available
to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically
through discovery during play. CR 13
ratfolk (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the ratfolk ancestry.
Ratfolk are humanoids who resemble rats. An ability with this trait can
be used or selected only by ratfolk. 20–23
Refocus (activity) Regain 1 Focus Point. CR 300
resistance Reduces damage you take of a certain type. CR 453
revelation (trait) Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.
revelation spell Revelation spells are focus spells cast by oracles.
Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, which means they
progress the severity of your oracular curse when cast, and you can’t
cast them if you don’t have an oracular curse. 69–70, 229–234
rogue (class) 134–137, CR 178–189
rogue (trait) This indicates abilities from the rogue class.

rune (magic item) 260–265, CR 580–585
scrying (trait) A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory
information from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than
your own eyes and ears.
secret (trait) The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret. CR 450
shadow (trait) This magic involves shadows or the energy of the
Shadow Plane.
shield (magic item) 260–262, CR 586–588
shove (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics
skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if
different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack
rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a
check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take
the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
silver (material) CR 579
skill (trait) A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their
actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can
be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype
feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you
have that archetype’s dedication feat.
snare (trait) Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow special rules
that allow them to be constructed quickly and used on the battlefield.
256, CR 589–591
social (trait) Actions and abilities with the social trait can be used only
while a vigilante is in their social identity. 196
sonic (trait) An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound,
meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is
different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target
can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.

spell attack roll You attempt a spell attack roll when targeting a creature
with aimed magic. Your multiple attack penalty applies. Spell attack
roll modifier = spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus + other
bonuses + penalties. CR 447–448
spell DC Your spell DC measures how hard it is to resist your spells with
saving throws or to counteract them. Spell DC = 10 + spellcasting ability
modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. CR 448
spirit (trait) Spirits are ephemeral creatures defined by their spiritual self
and often lacking a physical form.
splash (trait) When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you
don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with
a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures
within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed
splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of
the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together
with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s
weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a
critical hit. CR 544
staff (trait) This magic item holds spells of a particular theme and allows
a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing the staff. 263–264,
CR 592
stance (trait) A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by
using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some
time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements
(if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new
stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance
trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a
stance only in encounter mode.
staves (magic item) 263–264, CR 592–595
structure (trait) An item with the structure trait creates a magical building
or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a
plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the
natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built
there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds
or spires of rock, but it can’t be created on water or other nonsolid
surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with
a solid surface underneath, the structure’s foundation (if any) reaches
the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but
unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll
a DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink
or collapse.
The structure doesn’t harm creatures within the area when it
appears, and it can’t be created within a crowd or in a densely populated
area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when the
item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and
always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when
the activation ends isn’t harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground
if it was on an upper level of the structure.
summoned (trait) A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains
the summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other
creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It
has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level
than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic,
causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise,
the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of
its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities.
If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but
the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature
uses its 2 actions for that turn. A summoned creature can't control any
spawn or other creatures generated from it, and such creatures return
to their unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once
the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would
be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various
spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit
Points or if the spell that called them ends.
Sustain an Activation [one-action] (action) Extend a magic item activation with a
sustained duration to the end of your next turn. CR 534
Sustain a Spell [one-action] (action) Extend a spell with a sustained duration.
CR 304
sustained A spell with this duration can be extended with Sustain a
Spell. CR 304
swashbuckler (class) 82–93

multiclass archetype 153
swashbuckler (trait) This trait indicates abilities from the
swashbuckler class.
talisman (trait) A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or
a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing
an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a
talisman burns out permanently. 256, CR 565–570
teleportation (trait) Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously
move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not
usually trigger reactions based on movement.
temporary immunity An effect that makes a creature temporarily
immune lets that creature avoid new effects of the same name, but
it doesn’t end anything caused by the effect that gave the temporary
immunity. CR 453
temporary items Some archetypes allow you to prepare temporary
items. These temporary items last only a short time before becoming
useless. 150
tengu (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry.
Tengus are humanoids who resemble birds. An ability with this trait
can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is
created and used by tengus. 24–27
thrown (weapon trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it
is a ranged weapon when thrown. You add your Strength modifier to
damage as you would for a melee weapon. When this trait appears on
a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged weapons
with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
tiefling (trait) A creature with this trait has the tiefling versatile heritage.
Tieflings are planar scions descended from fiends. An ability with this
trait can be used or selected only by tieflings. 39–41
transmutation (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing
something’s form.
trap (trait) A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder
interlopers. CR 520
trigger A specified event when you can use a reaction or free action.
CR 462
two-hand (weapon trait) This weapon can be wielded with two hands.
Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This
change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice, such as those from
striking runes.
unarmed attack Any attack with the unarmed trait, typically those made
using a part of your body rather than a weapon or spell. CR 283

or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character

choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to
allow access for anyone. CR 13
undead (trait) Once living, these creatures were infused after death with
negative energy and soul-corrupting evil magic. When reduced to 0
Hit Points, an undead creature is destroyed. Undead creatures are
damaged by positive energy and are healed by negative energy, and
don’t benefit from healing effects.
unique (trait) A rules element with this trait is one-of-a-kind. CR 13
until the next time you make your daily preparations A spell with this
duration lasts until you next prepare, and you can extend it by leaving
its spell slot open. CR 305
versatile (weapon trait) A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different
type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait
indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon
that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You
choose the damage type each time you make an attack.
versatile heritage Versatile heritages can be selected by characters of
nearly any ancestry in place of a heritage specific to a single ancestry.

the GM.

day. 265, CR 597–598
water (trait) Effects with the water trait either manipulate or conjure

water. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a
magical connection to the element.
