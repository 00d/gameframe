A HOME IN EVERY PORT
FEAT 11
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
Prerequisites Charisma 16
You have a reputation in towns and villages you’ve visited, and
residents are always willing to open their doors to you. When
in a town or village, during downtime, you can spend 8 hours
to locate a resident willing to provide lodging for you and up
to six allies for up to 24 hours at no charge. The standard of

you can reduce an ally’s frightened or sickened condition by
2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical
success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC
for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that
caused the condition.

================================================================================

You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial
stunts. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks
to Maneuver in Flight and can combine two maneuvers into
a single action, such as reversing direction while making a
steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The
DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most
difficult maneuver + 5. If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you can
combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of
the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult
maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers
rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.
ARMOR ASSIST
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics or Warfare Lore
After your service aiding armored combatants, you are practiced
in helping yourself and others don heavy gear. You can attempt
an Athletics or Warfare Lore check with a DC determined by the
GM (but usually 15 for common armor, DC 20 for uncommon
armor, and DC 25 for rare armor) to halve the time you take to
don armor. You can halve an ally’s time to don armor by working
with them to don the armor and succeeding at an Athletics or
Warfare Lore check against the same DC.
ARMORED STEALTH
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You have learned techniques to adjust and modify your armor
and movements to reduce the noise you make. When you wear
non-noisy armor with which you are trained, your penalty to
Stealth checks is reduced by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). If
you’re a master in Stealth, reduce the penalty by 2, and if you’re
legendary, reduce the penalty by 3. If your armor has the noisy
trait, instead of reducing the penalty to Stealth checks, you
ignore the effects of the noisy trait, enabling you to remove the
penalty with a sufficient Strength score as normal.
ASSURED IDENTIFICATION
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature,
Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a
critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify
a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical success
(Gamemastery Guide 90), you simply can’t identify it instead.
BATTLE PLANNER
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Warfare Lore
You are constantly drawing up plans and battle scenarios,
assembling strategies and gathered intelligence for later use.
When you scout an enemy’s position or receive a detailed
report from an ally who scouted the enemy’s position, if you
have a clear indication of the number, position, and identities
of your potential foes, you can spend 1 minute to come up with
a battle plan that takes such potential factors into account and
reduces the role luck plays in the equation. Roll a Warfare Lore
check. As long as the information was accurate and remains
accurate when you roll initiative against those enemies, you
can use the Warfare Lore result you previously rolled for your
initiative roll; if you do, this is a fortune effect.
BIOGRAPHICAL EYE
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SECRET
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Society
In even a brief conversation or social interaction, you pick
up on subtle social and visual cues to learn a great deal
about a person’s origin and history. You might notice bits of
green under the person’s fingernails and determine they’re
an herbalist, a pin indicating their membership in a secret
society, or something similar. You pick up on only details that
have to do with their societal role, so you might learn the city
district where a vampire lives, but wouldn’t learn any of their
weaknesses, nor necessarily even that they are a vampire.
Spend 1 minute in the presence of someone you haven’t
met before, or haven’t met since you first gained Biographical
Eye, then attempt a DC 30 Society check. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to the check if you engaged the person
in conversation during this time. If the person is deliberately
trying to conceal their nature or present a false identity, you
learn about their false biography rather than their true one
unless the result of your Society check exceeds their Will DC.
Critical Success You learn the creature’s profession, their
specialty within that profession, and a major accomplishment
or controversy from their career. You also learn the nation
and settlement where they live, as well as the district in a
city large enough to have districts. In addition, you learn the
nation or settlement where they spent their formative years.
Success You learn the creature’s profession and specialty
within that profession. You learn the nation or settlement
where they normally live.
Failure You learn the creature’s profession and the region of
the world they hail from, but no more.
Critical Failure You learn a piece of erroneous information
about the creature.
BON MOT [one-action]
FEAT 1
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
GENERAL
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose
a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the
target’s Will DC.
Critical Success The target is distracted and takes a –3 status
penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. The target
can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This
can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait
or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM
determines which skill actions qualify, though they must
take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a
linguistic Charisma-based skill action.
Success As critical success, but the penalty is –2.
Critical Failure Your quip is atrocious. You take the same

penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends
after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.
CARAVAN LEADER
FEAT 11
GENERAL
Prerequisites Constitution 18, Pick Up the Pace
You know how to get the most effort out of your allies on
the road. When Hustling in a group during exploration mode,
your group can Hustle for as long as the member who could
Hustle longest on their own, plus an additional 20 minutes
beyond that.
CONCEALING LEGERDEMAIN
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won’t
search, you’re skilled at keeping the object on the move so
it’s never where they look. When you Conceal an Object of
light Bulk or less, you can use Thievery instead of Stealth for
your checks and for the DC of an active searcher’s Perception
check. You roll the check only once, but you must continue to
use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.
CONSULT THE SPIRITS
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SECRET
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Frequency once per day
You have learned rites or meditations that enable you to
perceive minor, invisible spirits within a place. Choose
Nature, Occultism, or Religion when you select this feat.
Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that
form leshies, who are born of pure life essence rather than
spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural
features like the location of nearby water or plant life.
Religion reveals the presence of angelic, demonic, or other
spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information
about sources of powerful positive or negative energy, sacred
or profane influences, or the presence of undead. Occultism
allows you to contact lingering spirits, psychic echoes of the
departed dead, and spirits from beyond reality, who tell you
about things like strange auras, effects, or the presence of
unnatural occult beings.
Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to Recall Knowledge
with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually
a very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you
might encounter in the area). If you’re legendary in the chosen
skill, you can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once
per day, but you can’t use it again on any area that overlaps a
previous area.
Critical Success The spirits reveal themselves to you and
have a helpful attitude toward you. Only you can perceive
these spirits. They answer three simple questions about
the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the
skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact.
Their answers are almost always a single word, and their
knowledge is limited to within their area of interest.
Success As with a critical success, but the spirits are indifferent
to you and answer only one question.
Failure You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.
Critical Failure You contact one or more malevolent spirits.
They are hostile toward you, though they may not
immediately appear so. They answer up to three questions
but give you information that is harmful to you in some
way, as determined by the GM.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, each
time picking a different skill in which you have the master
proficiency rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per
day (or once per hour, if you’re legendary).
CRAFTER’S APPRAISAL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
Your knowledge of items’ construction allows you to discern
their magical effects as well. You can use Crafting instead of
a skill associated with a magic tradition to Identify Magic on
magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.
CRIMINAL CONNECTIONS
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Society, Streetwise
You have dealings with a variety of unsavory characters,
which you can leverage to trade favors or meet powerful
people. When you’re in an area where you have connections
(typically a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building
connections or possibly another area in the same nation), you
can attempt a Society check to arrange a meeting with an
important criminal, such as a thieves’ guild leader, or ask for
a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact’s choice.
The GM decides the DC based on the difficulty of the favor and
the figure’s prominence.
DECEPTIVE WORSHIP
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as
worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead
of Deception to Impersonate a typical worshipper of another
faith or to Lie specifically to claim you are a member of
the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the
Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to
perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie
about any other matter.
DISCREET INQUIRY
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception or Diplomacy
You are subtle in your efforts to learn the things you need
to know. When Gathering Information, you can hide the true
subject of your inquiry among other topics of little interest to
you without increasing the difficulty of the check or taking
more time to Gather Information. Anyone trying to Gather
Information to determine if someone else was asking around

================================================================================

about the topic in question must exceed your Deception DC
or the normal DC to Gather Information about your inquiries,
whichever is higher, or else they don’t learn of your efforts.
DISTRACTING PERFORMANCE
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Performance
Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your
allies to Sneak away with ease. When you Aid an ally who is
trying to Create a Diversion, instead of the usual effects of
Aid, you can roll a Performance check and use that result to
determine the outcome of the diversion, instead of the ally
rolling a Deception check.
DISTURBING KNOWLEDGE [two-actions]
FEAT 7
EMOTION
FEAR
GENERAL
MENTAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Occultism
You utter a litany of dreadful names, prophecies, and descriptions
of realms beyond mortal comprehension, drawn from your
study of forbidden tomes and scrolls. Even those who don’t
understand your language are unsettled by these dire secrets.
Attempt an Occultism check and compare the result to the Will
DC of an enemy within 30 feet, or to the Will DCs of any number
of enemies within 30 feet if you are legendary in Occultism.
Those creatures are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Critical Success The target becomes confused for 1 round and
frightened 1.
Success The target becomes frightened 1.
Failure The target is unaffected.
Critical Failure You get overly caught up in your own words
and become frightened 1.
DOUBLESPEAK
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master at Deception
You are skilled at saying one thing while meaning something
different. You disguise your true meaning behind other words
and phrases, relying on subtle emphasis and shared experience
to convey meaning that only your allies understand. Any
allies who have traveled alongside you for at least 1 full week
automatically discern your meaning. Other observers must
succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC
to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must
critically succeed to understand the message itself.
EXHORT THE FAITHFUL
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Religion, follower of a specific religion
Your knowledge of the tenets of your faith gives you insight
into the best ways to get others of your faith to help you
or to follow your directions. When you Request something
of or Coerce members of your own faith, you can attempt a
Religion check instead of Diplomacy or Intimidation, and you
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. On a critically

failed attempt to make a Request, the target’s attitude
toward you doesn’t worsen.
EXPRESS RIDER
FEAT 1
EXPLORATION
GENERAL
MOVE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Nature
You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground
quickly. When calculating your travel speed (Core Rulebook
479) for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature
check to Command an Animal to increase your mount’s travel
speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based
on the mount’s level or the difficulty of the environment,
whichever is harder. On a success, increase your mount’s travel
speed by half. This has no effect on your mount’s movement
in encounters.
EYE FOR NUMBERS [one-action]
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You’ve learned to subitize, quickly estimating the number of
items in a group with relative accuracy at only a glance. You
immediately learn the number of visually similar items in a
group you can see (such as coins, books, or people), rounded
to the first digit in the total number. For example, you could
look at a case of potion vials and learn that it held about 30
vials, but you wouldn’t know that it was exactly 33 vials,
how many different types of potions there were, or how
many of which type. Similarly, you could look at a pile of
2,805 coins and know that there were about 3,000 coins in
all. You can use this ability only on items that can typically
be counted, so you can’t use it on grains of sand or stars in
the sky, for example.
In addition, when you attempt to Decipher Writing
that is primarily numerical or mathematical, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your check.
FORENSIC ACUMEN
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Medicine
You understand the principles of forensic medicine, making
you better at examining a body to determine the cause of
death or injury. You can perform a forensic examination on a
body, as described under Recall Knowledge in the Medicine
skill, in half the normal amount of time it would take (to a
minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check, you can
attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to follow up
on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus. This
check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such
as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon that was
used or an additional Medicine check to identify a specific
disease. If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall
Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you were
examining, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same
circumstance bonus.
The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master
proficiency in Medicine and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.
GLEAN CONTENTS
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You are adept at quickly scanning loose papers and carefully
discerning the contents of sealed letters without damaging
the seal. You can attempt Society checks to Decipher Writing
on a message that is only partially glimpsed, upside down or
reversed from your perspective, or even sealed. However, on
a critical failure, the recipient is made aware of your efforts
(for instance, you damage the seal or disturb the papers in
some way). When using this feat to decipher sealed letters,
your attempt to Decipher Writing gains the manipulate trait.
This feat doesn’t prevent witnesses from noticing your efforts,
particularly with sealed letters which you must manipulate
directly in order to read; you might need to attempt Deception
or Stealth checks to avoid being noticed.
HIRELING MANAGER
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Prerequisites Charisma 14
You are able to find and secure better labor than most.
When securing a hireling for a service, that hireling gains a
+2 circumstance bonus to all skill checks. This circumstance
bonus applies to both trained and untrained hirelings and has
no effect on the cost of the service or labor provided.
IMPROVISE TOOL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can jury-rig solutions when you don’t have the proper
tools on hand. You can attempt to Repair damaged items
without a repair kit.
If you have the raw materials available, you can Craft a basic
caltrop set, candle, compass, crowbar, fishing tackle, flint and
steel, hammer, ladder, piton, rope, 10-foot pole, replacement
thieves’ picks, long or short tool, or torch without consulting
a basic crafter’s book.
IMPROVISED REPAIR [three-actions]
FEAT 3
GENERAL
You are skilled at making quick fixes to damaged equipment,
but your fixes aren’t meant to last forever. You make a quick
repair to a broken non-magical item in your possession. Until
the item takes damage again, you can still use it as a shoddy
item of its type. This repair restores no Hit Points, so the item
is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such
that it is no longer broken, it is also no longer shoddy.
INCREDIBLE SCOUT
FEAT 11
GENERAL
Prerequisites master in Perception
When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting
your allies precious moments to prepare to fight. When using
the Scout exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2
circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1
circumstance bonus.

INFLUENCE NATURE
FEAT 7
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Nature
With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game
trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type
of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days
to come. The GM determines the DC of any check required
and the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a
day or two of downtime). While you can’t directly control how
you’ve influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects,
such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is
approaching. If you’re legendary in Nature, you can elicit these
same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending
only 10 minutes.
INOCULATION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
HEALING
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Medicine
You have practice combating plague, and your patients are
less likely to succumb to the same disease again for a time.
When you successfully Treat a Disease on someone and they
fully recover from the disease, they gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to saving throws against that same disease for 1 week.
KEEN FOLLOWER
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Your keen observation of your allies has made you better at
following their lead. When using the Follow the Expert activity
in exploration mode, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus if the
ally you are following is an expert and a +4 circumstance
bonus if your ally is a master.
LEAD CLIMBER
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Athletics
When climbing, you can prepare routes for others to follow,
and you can pull your allies up to avoid disaster. When your
allies attempt to Climb a route you set using the Follow the
Expert exploration activity, if any of them critically fail their
checks to Climb, you can attempt an Athletics check against
the same DC. If you succeed, your ally fails instead of critically
failing. If you also critically fail, you both experience the
consequences of the critical failure.
LEGENDARY GUIDE
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Survival
You know the wilderness so well that you can help your party
travel through it with ease. When you are setting the path
for your party through wilderness terrain, your party gains a
+10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for the purpose of
calculating the party’s travel speed, your party’s travel speed
doesn’t decrease in difficult terrain, and greater difficult terrain
halves your party’s travel speed instead of reducing it to a third.

You attempt to reduce panic. Attempt a Diplomacy check,

immune for 1 hour.
Critical Success Reduce the creature’s frightened value by 2.
Success Reduce the creature’s frightened value by 1.
PICK UP THE PACE
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Prerequisites Constitution 14
You lead by example and can help others push themselves
beyond their normal limits. When Hustling in a group during
exploration mode, your group can Hustle for up to 20 additional
minutes, to a maximum of the amount of time the character
with the highest Constitution modifier could Hustle alone.
PILGRIM’S TOKEN
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Religion
You carry a small token of protection from a site holy to your
faith, or you touched your religious symbol to a relic or altar at
such a site. So long as this token is in your possession, when
you tie an adversary’s initiative roll, you go first.
Special If you select this feat at 1st level, you receive your
pilgrim’s token for free. Alternately, if you have a religious
symbol, it is already attuned, as described above.
If you select this feat at a later level, or if you lose your
pilgrim’s token, you must purchase or Craft a replacement and
attune it at a holy site. Such a token usually costs at least 2 sp,
and the attunement takes 10 minutes of prayer and requires
a successful DC 20 Religion check. Your GM might adjust the
price and DC depending on the token’s material and quality
and the religious significance of the site; the more significant
the location, the easier the attunement.
PRESCIENT CONSUMABLE
FEAT 7
GENERAL
Prerequisites Prescient Planner
You can predict which consumables you might need in advance.
When using Prescient Planner, you can procure a consumable
item from your backpack, instead of a piece of adventuring
gear. The consumable item must still be common with a level
no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough
that carrying it wouldn’t have made you encumbered.
PRESCIENT PLANNER
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Cost the Price of the chosen item
Requirements You haven’t used this ability since the last time
you were able to purchase goods.
You regularly create convoluted plans and contingencies, using
your resources to enact them. You take 1 minute to remove your
backpack, then carefully remove an item you hadn’t previously
declared that you purchased—you intuited that you would come
to need the item and purchased it at the latest opportunity. The
item must be a piece of adventuring gear (from the table on page
288 of the Core Rulebook or other sources of adventuring gear),
and can’t be a weapon, armor, alchemical item, magic item, or
other treasure. It must be common with a level no higher than
half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it
wouldn’t have made you encumbered.
QUICK CONTACTS
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Society; Connections or Underworld
Connections
You know where to go, who to talk to, and how to make
new connections, fast. Upon entering a new settlement,
spending 1 day of downtime allows you to build enough
connections to make use of the Connections or Underworld
Connections feats. If you’re legendary in Society, you can
form the required connections within 1 hour of entering a
new settlement.
RAPID AFFIXTURE
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Crafting
You take only 1 minute to Affix a Talisman. If you’re legendary
in Crafting, you can Affix a Talisman as a 3-action activity.
RISKY SURGERY
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Medicine
Your surgery can bring a patient back from the brink of death,
but might push them over the edge. When you Treat Wounds,
you can deal 1d8 slashing damage to your patient just before
applying the effects of Treat Wounds. If you do, you gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your Medicine check to Treat Wounds,
and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
ROOT MAGIC
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
Your talismans ward against foul magic. During your daily
preparations, you can assemble a small pouch with bits of
herbs, hair, sacred oils, and other ritual ingredients, which
you give to one ally. The first time that day the ally attempts
a saving throw against a spell or haunt, they gain a +1
circumstance bonus to the roll. This bonus increases to +2 if
you’re an expert in Occultism or +3 if you’re legendary.
SCHOOLED IN SECRETS
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
You notice the signs and symbols that members of mystery
cults and other secret societies use to declare their affiliation

to fellow members. You can use Occultism in place of
Diplomacy to Gather Information about such groups. If you
belong to a secret cult, lodge, sect, or similar organization, you
automatically recognize members of your group unless they
are specifically attempting to conceal their presence from you.
SEASONED
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Alcohol Lore, Cooking Lore, or Crafting
You’ve mastered the preparation of many types of food and
drink. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Craft
food and drink, including potions. If you are a master in one of
the prerequisite skills, this bonus increases to +2.
SHADOW MARK
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You have learned special tricks that help you follow individuals
without them noticing you. When you attempt a Stealth check
to Avoid Notice while following a specific target, the target
takes a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DC. If you
have master proficiency in Stealth, the penalty is –3 or –4 if
you’re legendary. If you start an encounter with the target
while shadowing them, the target takes this penalty to their
initiative roll and to their Perception DC to determine if they
notice you, as normal for Sneak.
SKITTER
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Prerequisites Dexterity 16, Fleet
You can scoot swiftly across the ground. You can Crawl up to
half your Speed.
SUPERTASTER
FEAT 7
GENERAL
Prerequisites master in Perception
You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of
taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of
food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage,
you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which
might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such
as poisons. The GM rolls a secret Perception check using the
poison’s level to determine the DC; on a success, you learn that
the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used.
If you lick or taste something while Investigating or
attempting to Recall Knowledge to identify something, if the
taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM’s
discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.
TERRIFYING RESISTANCE
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
The spells of those you have Demoralized are less effective on
you. If you succeed in Demoralizing a creature, for the next
24 hours you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against that creature’s spells.
THOROUGH SEARCH
FEAT 3
GENERAL
Prerequisites expert in Perception
You take your time searching to ensure you find everything.
When Searching, you can take twice as long to search.
Normally this means you Search at up to one quarter of
your Speed, to a maximum of 150 feet per minute to check
everything, or 75 feet per minute to check everything before
you walk into it. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to your Perception checks to Seek.
TRUE PERCEPTION
FEAT 19
GENERAL
REVELATION
Prerequisites legendary in Perception
Your perceptive abilities and ability to process sensory
information are so far beyond the pale that you notice minute
discrepancies in all sorts of illusions and transmutations. You
are constantly under the effects of a 6th-level true seeing
spell, using your Perception modifier for the counteract check.
UNDERGROUND NETWORK
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Society, Streetwise
You’re connected to groups that know what’s going on in the
streets, and you can get information out of them quickly.
When you use Society to Gather Information in an area
where you have a network (typically a settlement where
you’ve spent at least a week or spent a day of downtime to
build a network faster), you can contact a member of these
groups to get information directly from them. This usually
takes about an hour, and it doesn’t draw as much attention
as Gathering Information in public might. The check and
information gained otherwise follow the normal rules for
Gather Information.
In addition, if you have successfully consulted the
underground network, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to the
next check to Recall Knowledge you attempt about the subject
you were Gathering Information on, or a +2 circumstance
bonus if you’re using Underworld Lore for the check. The GM
might change the Lore skill related to the network depending
on your location or the specifics of the network you’re
tapping into.
WATER SPRINT
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Athletics
Experience and training have taught you that water has just
enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the
surface. When you Stride in a straight line, if you move at
least half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount
of the remaining distance across a level body of water. If you
don’t end your Stride on solid ground, you fall into the water.
If you’re legendary in Athletics, as long as you start on solid
ground, any part of your Stride can cross the water’s surface,
even if you aren’t moving a straight line, though you still fall
into the water if you don’t end your movement on solid ground.

Your Spellcasting Style
If you’re playing a spellcaster, it can be fun to consider your personal
spellcasting style. Casters of different traditions have the biggest gulf in how
they cast spells, but there’s also differentiation between—and within—classes!
PREPARING YOUR SPELLS
If you prepare spells, consider what it looks like as you do so. Typically, arcane
spellcasters consult their books, self-reflect, or otherwise study; divine casters
pray to fill their heart with spells that will serve their deity; occult casters
attempt to decipher cryptic messages, often while referencing occult texts; and
primal casters might seek natural places to contemplate their magic, such as a
grove or underground cavern.
Spontaneous spellcasters, not needing to prepare, tend to wake up with their
magical reserves restored. This might be a refreshed or vivacious feeling, a
teeming thrum throughout the body, or even a sense of impending dread or awe.
CASTING YOUR SPELLS
For one spellcaster, casting a spell is a stressful, painful process. For another,
it’s a moment of triumph as they outsmart their enemy with just the right trick.
The Spell Components sidebar describes how spell components might impact
the way you cast spells. Think about what they might mean for you. Do your
verbal components use your own voice? Resonate out with a different timbre
due to the magic in your words? Resemble the voice of your deity? For somatic
components, what gestures do you make? They could be abstract, like forming
quick sigils that look like hand signals. Or maybe they’re direct: pointing your
finger or raising a fist. The particulars of material components are abstracted, so
you can customize those you like best for your spells.
REFOCUSING
Your class briefly describes what you need to do to Refocus, such as communing
with a familiar for the witch or meditating for the monk. Start out with some
idea of what this looks like for you, and refine it during play. What you need to
do to Refocus is broadly defined to allow a variety of methods that make sense
in the story. One witch might share a treat to commune with their familiar, while
another might endure a lecture from their familiar on their patron’s virtues.
CHAPTER 5: SPELLS
Here you’ll find spells beyond those listed in the Core Rulebook, including ones that
dispense horrid curses, make you immune to nearly all types of harm, and manifest
mischievous monkey spirits to vex your foes! The following pages contain new magical
powers for casters of every tradition.
SPELL COMPONENTS
The rules about how spell components
work when casting are located on page
303 of the Core Rulebook. But it can
also help to understand what these
components might mean to spellcasters.
Shouting out verbal components
forces magic out into the world via a
word laden with magical power. Spells
that require only a verbal component
tend to be direct and forceful, such as
power word kill or power word stun.
Verbal components are especially
unsubtle, so spells that benefit from
stealth, such as invisibility, might not
have any verbal components in favor of
having somatic components, material
components, or both.
Somatic components, such as
twisting your hand in a complex
gesture, shape magical energy
into directed forms. While verbal
components bring forward powerful
forces, somatic components compel
those forces to obey the spellcaster’s
wishes. Spells that have only somatic
components typically have a physical
effect or require touching a creature.
Material components aren’t
ubiquitous like somatic and verbal
components. They’re used primarily for
spells with physical effects, especially
ones with a longer duration or that alter
or control a large area, such as walls or
zones of dangerous terrain. A material
component pouch typically contains
everything you need. This doesn’t mean
the materials are interchangeable,
though—one spell might need powdered
iron and another a particular gemstone.
Certain spells have focus components,
objects of concentrated power that
don’t get used up in the same way that
material components do. Essential for
shaping and attuning the magic of the
spell, these might be intriguing and
elegant items in their own right.
