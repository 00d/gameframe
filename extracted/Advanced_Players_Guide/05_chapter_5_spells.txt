CHAPTER 5: SPELLS
Here you’ll find spells beyond those listed in the Core Rulebook, including ones that
dispense horrid curses, make you immune to nearly all types of harm, and manifest
mischievous monkey spirits to vex your foes! The following pages contain new magical
powers for casters of every tradition.
SPELL COMPONENTS
The rules about how spell components
work when casting are located on page
303 of the Core Rulebook. But it can
also help to understand what these
components might mean to spellcasters.
Shouting out verbal components
forces magic out into the world via a
word laden with magical power. Spells
that require only a verbal component
tend to be direct and forceful, such as
power word kill or power word stun.
Verbal components are especially
unsubtle, so spells that benefit from
stealth, such as invisibility, might not
have any verbal components in favor of
having somatic components, material
components, or both.
Somatic components, such as
twisting your hand in a complex
gesture, shape magical energy
into directed forms. While verbal
components bring forward powerful
forces, somatic components compel
those forces to obey the spellcaster’s
wishes. Spells that have only somatic
components typically have a physical
effect or require touching a creature.
Material components aren’t
ubiquitous like somatic and verbal
components. They’re used primarily for
spells with physical effects, especially
ones with a longer duration or that alter
or control a large area, such as walls or
zones of dangerous terrain. A material
component pouch typically contains
everything you need. This doesn’t mean
the materials are interchangeable,
though—one spell might need powdered
iron and another a particular gemstone.
Certain spells have focus components,
objects of concentrated power that
don’t get used up in the same way that
material components do. Essential for
shaping and attuning the magic of the
spell, these might be intriguing and
elegant items in their own right.

AGONIZING DESPAIR
SPELL 3
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] verbal, somatic
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will
Your target’s mind tumbles down a deep well of dread,
dwelling so intently on deep-seated fears that it’s painful. The
target takes 4d6 mental damage with a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage and becomes frightened 1.
Failure The target takes full damage and becomes frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and becomes
frightened 3.
Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 2d6.
ANIMATE DEAD
SPELL 1
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Your magic dredges up a corpse or skeleton and fills it with
necromantic life, and you force the dead to fight at your
command. You summon a common creature that has the
undead trait and whose level is –1; this creature gains the
summoned trait. Heightening the spell increases the maximum
level of creature you can summon.
Heightened (2nd) Level 1.
Heightened (3rd) Level 2.
Heightened (4th) Level 3.
Heightened (5th) Level 5.
Heightened (6th) Level 7.

ANIMATE ROPE
SPELL 1
TRANSMUTATION
 Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 100 feet; Targets up to 50 feet of rope or a nonliving
rope-like object
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You cause a length or section of rope or a rope-like object to
animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two
commands when you Cast the Spell, and one command each
time you Sustain the Spell.
• Bind (attack) The rope attempts to partially bind a
creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target’s
Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to its Speed (–20-foot on a critical
success). This ends if the target Escapes against your
spell DC or breaks the rope. (A standard adventuring rope
has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)
• Coil The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.
• Crawl The rope inches along the ground like a snake,
moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along
a surface, but that surface doesn’t need to be horizontal.
• Knot The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.
• Loop The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or
straightens itself back out.
• Tie The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an
object that’s unattended or attended by a willing creature.
• Undo The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.
Heightened (+2) The range increases by 50 feet, and you can
animate 50 more feet of rope.
ANIMATED ASSAULT
SPELL 2
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You use your mind to manipulate unattended objects in the
area, temporarily animating them to attack. The objects hover
in the air, then hurl themselves at nearby creatures in a chaotic
flurry of debris. This assault deals 2d10 bludgeoning damage
(basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area. On subsequent
rounds, you can Sustain this Spell, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning
damage (basic Reflex save) to each creature in the area.
Heightened (+2) The initial damage increases by 2d10 and the
subsequent damage increases by 1d10.
AQUEOUS ORB
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A sphere of water 10 feet in diameter forms in an unoccupied
space in range, either on the ground or on the surface of a
liquid. When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the
Spell, you can roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the
ground or the surface of a liquid. Unlike most spells, you can
gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining
the Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces
of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn’t stop the flow of
water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its
size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires
it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can’t
counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.
The orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large
or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through
can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being
engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the
orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb’s path
into a space of the creature’s choice) or allow itself to be pushed
in front of the orb to the end of the orb’s movement. The orb can

================================================================================

try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you
roll it onto a creature’s space more than once.
A creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It
becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold
its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water).
An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to
affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles
(Core Rulebook 478). An engulfed Large creature is usually
big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it
can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free
either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check
or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically
failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to
Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb’s space
and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many
creatures as can fit in its space.
When the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are
automatically released.
BESTIAL CURSE

POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal

You tap into the target’s inner being and curse it to become a
bestial version of itself. The effect is based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor bestial features. Its
insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be
clumsy 1 for 1 round. When it recovers from the clumsy
condition, its features revert to normal and the spell ends.
Failure The target transforms into a bestial form for 1 hour.
The target becomes clumsy 1 and gains weakness 1 to silver.
It gains a claw, hoof, horn, or jaws Strike (your choice) that
uses the target’s unarmed Strike statistics except that the
damage type changes to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing,
as appropriate. Whenever the target attempts to use any
manipulate action, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or
the action is lost.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
BLANKET OF STARS
SPELL 6
ILLUSION
Traditions occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Saving Throw Will; Duration 10 minutes
A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with
pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of
the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth
checks to Hide and Sneak. While outside under a starry night
sky, you’re also invisible as long as you remain still. When
moving under a starry night sky, you are concealed instead.
Gazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature

always shifts to match the environment, even if there are drastic
changes. If any piece of gear or clothing affected by the spell is
removed from a creature, the spell ends for that creature.
Heightened (6th) If a creature affected by this spell rolls a
critical failure on its Stealth check to Sneak within 30 feet
of a creature that would spot it, it instead only fails its

give away its possessions. The target must attempt a Will
save. If the target has no items on its person, the spell fails.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stunned 1 as it wrestles with the urge.
Failure On its next turn, before it does anything else, the
target must present the nearest creature with an item in
its possession; the target chooses which item to give, and if
the only item it has is one that it's currently using to defend
itself, such as a weapon during a combat encounter, it can
choose to be stunned for 1 round instead of giving up the
item. This might require the target to Interact to retrieve an
item or move to reach the nearest creature, and handing the
item to the target always requires an Interact action.
Critical Failure As failure, except the duration is 4 rounds,
and the target must repeat the effects of failure on each
of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target can
attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration
by 1 round, ending it entirely on a critical success.

Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 round.
Failure The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute and drained
1. The target is also filled with listlessness and ennui. For
1 round, if the target tries to use a move action, it must
succeed at a Will save against your spell DC or the action is
lost; this effect has the mental and emotion traits.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is permanently
enfeebled 2 and drained 2 (although magic such as
restoration can reduce or remove these conditions).
COUNTLESS EYES
SPELL 4
DIVINATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
Eyes form across the touched creature’s body, allowing it to
see in all directions at once. The subject can’t be flanked for
the spell’s duration. In addition, when the subject Seeks, it can
Seek in a 30-foot burst centered on itself or up to four 15-foot
bursts within line of sight.
COZY CABIN
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 30 feet
Duration 12 hours
You shape a cabin 20 feet on each side and 10 feet high. This
cabin has the structure trait and the same restrictions as
magic items that create structures. The walls of the hut are
simple and wooden, with small, square glass windows, and it
has one wooden door. It doesn’t include its own lock, but it has
a fastener to which a lock can be applied.
The interior contains three cots, one chamber pot, and a
small fireplace holding a magical fire. The interior is lit with a
small magical light that you can light or extinguish at will using
a single action, which has the concentrate trait. The climate
inside the hut is comfortable and allows creatures inside it
to withstand most hostile weather conditions, but incredible
heat or cold, powerful storms, and winds of hurricane force or
greater destroy the hut. Other creatures can freely enter and
exit the hut without damaging it, but if you exit the hut, the
spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell.
CRASHING WAVE
SPELL 3
EVOCATION
WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

You summon a crashing wave that sweeps away from you. You

constructs made of precious materials, as determined by
the GM, are immune.
• Object If the object is attended, its bearer can attempt
a Fortitude save. If the bearer fails or the object is
unattended, the object immediately takes 4d6 damage
(applying Hardness normally) and the item is cursed with
an unlimited duration. Until the curse ends, the item
becomes shoddy and can’t be Repaired, and the curse
attempts to counteract any spell that would restore
the object’s Hit Points. Remove curse can target an item
affected by this spell.
• Construct The construct takes 4d6 damage (basic
Fortitude save). On a failure, for 1 hour the construct
is clumsy 1, is enfeebled 1, and can’t be Repaired, and
the curse attempts to counteract any spell that would
restore the construct’s Hit Points. On a critical failure,
these effects have an unlimited duration.
• Living Creature The living creature must attempt a
Fortitude save. Ageless creatures are immune.
Critical Success The living creature is unaffected.
Success The living creature briefly ages, becoming
clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for 1 round.

DÉJÀ VU
SPELL 1
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 2 rounds
You loop a thought process in the target’s mind, forcing it to
repeat the same actions over again. The target must attempt
a Will save. If the target fails, whatever actions the target
uses on its next turn, it must repeat on its following turn. The
actions must be repeated in the same order and as close to the
same specifics as possible. For example, if the target makes
an attack, it must repeat the attack against the same creature,
if possible, and if the target moves, it must move the same
distance and direction, if possible, on its next turn.
If the target can’t repeat an action, such as Casting a Spell
that has been exhausted or needing to target a creature that
has died, it can act as it chooses for that action but becomes
stupefied 1 until the end of its turn.
DISMANTLE
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 non-magical object in your possession
of 1 Bulk or less
Duration 1 minute
You touch an object, and it immediately disassembles itself into
its component pieces. The spell fails if the target lacks component
pieces (such as a statue carved from one block of stone), and
using it on a dangerous object like a snare or trap typically
triggers it. The object gains the broken condition, and the
component pieces become small enough to be hidden under
normal clothing and armor. You can Dismiss the spell.
When the spell ends, the object reassembles itself into
its original form, appearing in your hand or hands if you have
them free, or on the ground in front of you otherwise. Once
reassembled, the object loses the broken condition and its Hit
Points return to the value the object had when you Cast the Spell.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts for 10 minutes.
Heightened (6th) The spell lasts until your next daily preparations.

SPELL 4
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You curse the target to fail in all avenues of its life that require
drive and ambition, as it inadvertently undermines its own
goals at every turn. The effect is based on the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success For 1 hour, the target rolls twice and uses the lower
result on initiative rolls.
Failure For 1 day, the target rolls twice and uses the lower
result on initiative rolls and any check to determine the
success of a downtime activity.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
ENERVATION

Extending a finger, you fire a beam of negative energy that
weakens the life force of any creature it touches. Each living
creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 2d8 persistent negative damage.
Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent negative damage
and becomes drained 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes 4d8 persistent negative

its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses.

================================================================================

If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your
senses, such as see invisibility, while this spell is active, you gain
the benefit of the spell through the target’s senses instead of your
own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much
like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of
the target’s growls or squawks. You can use Command an Animal
on the target as part of Sustaining this Spell. You don’t need line
of sight or line of effect to your target when you Cast this Spell.
FINAL SACRIFICE
SPELL 2
EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature with the minion trait that
you summoned or permanently control
You channel disruptive energies through the bond between
you and your minion, causing it to violently explode. The
target is immediately slain, and creatures within 20 feet of it
take 6d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save).
If the target has the cold or water trait, the spell instead
deals cold damage and gains the cold trait in place of the fire
trait. If used on a creature that isn’t mindless, this spell has
the evil trait. Attempting to cast this spell targeting a creature
that you temporarily seized control of, such as an undead
commanded by command undead, automatically fails and
breaks the controlling effect.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
FORCE CAGE
SPELL 7
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 1 cube 20 feet on each side
Saving Throw Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create an immobile, invisible prison of sheer force. The
cage is a 20-foot cube made of bands of force, each a half
inch thick and a half inch apart, that extend to the Ethereal
Plane. Each creature in the area where you create the cage
must attempt a Reflex save. If such a creature fails, it becomes
trapped inside the cage. If it succeeds, it’s pushed outside the
cage into a space of its choice. If a creature in the area is too
big to fit inside the prison, the spell automatically fails.
The cage has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points, and
it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. A creature
capable of passing through the space between the bars
(typically a Tiny creature) can leave; all others are confined
within. Attacks with a weapon too large to fit between
the bars can’t pass through the cage, and the bars provide
standard cover even against attacks that can pass through
the gaps. Spells and breath weapons can pass through the
cage uninhibited.
Force cage is immune to counteracting effects of its level
or lower, but it is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate
spell of any level, or by contact with a rod of cancellation (page
262) or sphere of annihilation (Gamemastery Guide 113).

FUNGAL INFESTATION
SPELL 2
CONJURATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Area 15-foot cone
Saving Throw Fortitude
Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them
to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths
deal 2d6 persistent poison damage, and each creature must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half the persistent poison damage.
Failure The target takes the full persistent poison damage.
While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has
weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
Critical Failure As failure, but double the persistent poison
damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it
has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.
Heightened (+2) The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and
the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
GHOSTLY TRAGEDY
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast (1 minute) material, somatic, verbal
Area 60-foot emanation
Duration 10 minutes
This spell compels local spirits to reenact a violent event of
the recent past that you’re aware of and name as you Cast the
Spell. You take the role of the primary victim. The reenactment
plays out the final 9 minutes leading up to the death or injury
of the victim and the minute after their death or injury. The
spirits don’t change form, so this doesn’t help determine
perpetrators by their look. Spiritual forms of missing creatures
necessary for the event manifest as needed, and missing items
appear as shadowy outlines.
Once the scene ends, you take 2d6 negative damage
for each ghostly apparition that participated in the scene
(typically equal to the number of creatures involved other
than the victim). Any creature that observed the ghostly
recreation, including you, can attempt checks to investigate
the event to discover new clues and information.
GRISLY GROWTHS
SPELL 5
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
This gruesome spell causes the target to grow excess limbs
and organs, whether it be fingers multiplying until hands
resemble bushes, eyes popping open in bizarre places, legs
sprouting from the side of the body, or some other result.
The target takes 10d6 piercing damage (basic Fortitude
save) as the new features erupt. This spell has no effect on
a target with a mutable anatomy or no limbs, such as an
ooze or a protean. The growths rot rapidly and fall away
after 1 round.
In addition, unless the initial target critically succeeds,
creatures within 30 feet of the target, including the target,
must attempt Will saves, after which they are temporarily
immune to this secondary effect of grisly growths for 1 hour.
This additional effect is a mental and visual effect.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is sickened 1.
Critical Failure The character is sickened 2.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HEAT METAL
SPELL 2
EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 metal item or metal creature
This spell heats the targeted metal to become red-hot for a
moment. This is usually harmless to an unattended metal item,
which doesn’t get a saving throw, though the GM might rule
that flammable materials connected to the object catch fire
or melt. If you target an item worn or carried by a creature,
or you target a creature made primarily of metal, the heat
deals 4d6 fire damage and 2d4 persistent fire damage to the
creature, which must attempt a Reflex saving throw.
If you target an item held by the creature, the creature
can Release the item to improve their degree of success by
one step from the result of their saving throw. The persistent
damage is associated with the object and damages whichever
creature is holding or wearing it. It has no effect if no one is
holding the item, but you continue to attempt flat checks to
end the persistent damage as normal, since the item remains
hot and can sear someone who picks it up.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and the object deals
no persistent fire damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and the object deals
full persistent damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature takes double
damage and the object deals double persistent damage.
Heightened (+1) The initial damage increases by 2d6 and the
persistent damage increases by 1d4.
ICE STORM
SPELL 4
COLD
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration 1 minute
You create a gray storm cloud that pelts creatures with an
icy deluge. When you Cast the Spell, a burst of magical hail
deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 cold damage to each
creature in the area below the cloud (basic Reflex save). Snow
and sleet continue to rain down in the area for the remainder
of the spell’s duration, making the area difficult terrain,
causing creatures in the storm to be concealed, and making

creatures outside the storm concealed from those inside the
storm. Any creature that ends its turn in the storm takes 4
cold damage. If you Cast this Spell outdoors, you can create
two non-overlapping clouds instead of one.
Heightened (+2) The initial bludgeoning damage and cold
damage increase by 1d8 each, and the cold damage
creatures take at the end of their turns increases by 2.
ILL OMEN
SPELL 1
CURSE
DIVINATION
MISFORTUNE
Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 round
The target is struck with misfortune, which throws it off
balance. The target must attempt a Will save.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The first time during the duration that the target
attempts an attack roll or skill check, it must roll twice and
use the worse result.
Critical Failure Every time during the duration that the target
attempts an attack roll or skill check, it must roll twice and
use the worse result.
IMPALING SPIKE
SPELL 5
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Reflex; Duration 1 minute
You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath
a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made
of cold iron and deals 8d6 piercing damage. The target must
attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.
Success The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.
Failure The target is impaled through a leg or another
non-vital body part. The creature takes full damage and,
if it’s standing on solid ground, becomes immobilized. It
can attempt to Escape (the DC is your spell DC). While it
remains impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to
cold iron it has at the end of each of its turns.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is impaled through
a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage,
and it is flat-footed as long as it’s impaled.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
IMPRINT MESSAGE
SPELL 1
DIVINATION
Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You project psychic vibrations onto the target object,
imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your
design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who
casts object reading (page 222) on the target object, replacing
any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is
in the area of a retrocognition spell, the imprinted messages
appear as major events in the timeline, but they don’t interfere
with any other visions.
If the object is targeted with read aura of a higher spell
level than imprint message, the caster learns that the object
has been magically modified. When you Cast this Spell, any
prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of
imprint message fade.
INDESTRUCTIBILITY
SPELL 10
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration until the start of your next turn
You can’t be affected by anything unless you choose to be.
For the duration of the spell, you are immune to any effect
or damage that would harm you, excluding effects caused by
artifacts, deific power, and similarly powerful sources. You can
still be affected by anything you’re willing to have affect you.
INVISIBLE ITEM
SPELL 1
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range touch; Targets 1 object
Duration 1 hour
You make the object invisible. This makes it undetected to
all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the
target, making it hidden to them instead if they succeed. If
the item is used as part of a hostile action, the spell ends after
that hostile action is completed. Making a weapon invisible
typically doesn’t give any advantage to the attack, except
that an invisible thrown weapon or piece of ammunition can
be used for an attack without necessarily giving information
about the attacker’s hiding place unless the weapon returns
to the attacker.
Heightened (3rd) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
Heightened (7th) The duration is unlimited.
LIGHTNING STORM
SPELL 5
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
Traditions primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a black, rumbling storm cloud and call down
one lightning bolt. The bolt is a vertical line from the storm
cloud to the ground below, dealing 4d12 electricity damage
to creatures in the spell’s area (basic Reflex save). The first
time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can call another
lightning bolt within the area. If you Cast this Spell outdoors,
you can create two non-overlapping clouds instead of one,
though you can still call down only one bolt per turn.
Heightened (+1) The damage of each bolt increases by 1d12.

MAD MONKEYS
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Magical monkey spirits fill the area as they pile and climb on top
of one another. Because the monkeys are magical spirits, they
can’t be attacked or hurt. Casting calm emotions or a similar
effect over the monkeys makes them docile, causing them to
cease making mischief for the duration of mad monkeys.
Choose the kind of mischief your monkeys make when you
Cast the Spell. They produce the effect listed for that mischief
when you Cast the Spell and each round when you Sustain the
Spell. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the area of
the monkeys by 5 feet.
• Flagrant Burglary The monkeys try to Steal any one item
from one creature in the area. Use your spell DC – 10
as the monkeys’ Thievery modifier. Their attempt relies
more on distraction than subtlety, so the victim knows
what item the monkeys were trying to take and whether
it was taken. Getting a stolen item from the monkeys—
even for the caster—requires Stealing it from them or
Disarming them, using your spell DC. When the spell
ends, any stolen items fall to the ground in any square of
the spell’s area you choose.
• Raucous Din The monkeys screech loudly, potentially
deafening creatures in the spell’s area. Each creature in
the spell’s area must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is
temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is deafened for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is deafened for 1 minute.
• Tumultuous Gymnastics The monkeys jump and climb
all over creatures in the spell’s area, interfering with
complex movements. Each creature in the spell’s area
must attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is
temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure For 1 round, the creature must succeed at a DC 5
flat check whenever it attempts a manipulate action. If
it fails this check, the creature loses that action.
Critical Failure As failure, but the monkeys cling to the
creature tenaciously, and the effect lasts until the spell
ends, even if the creature leaves the spell’s area.
MAGIC STONE
SPELL 1
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [one-action] to [three-actions] (verbal, somatic)
Range touch; Targets 1 to 3 non-magical stones or sling bullets
Duration 1 minute
You pour positive energy into ordinary stones, granting them
temporary magical properties. You can target 1 non-magical
stone or sling bullet for every action you use Casting this Spell.
The stones must be unattended or carried by you or a willing
ally. The stones become +1 striking disrupting sling bullets. Each
stone can be used only once, after which it crumbles to dust.
NOXIOUS VAPORS
SPELL 1
EVOCATION
POISON
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 10-foot emanation
Saving Throw basic Fortitude; Duration 1 round
You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you
from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you
Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save).
A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes
sickened 1. All creatures in the area become concealed, and all
creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures
within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
OBJECT READING
SPELL 1
DIVINATION
Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 object
You place a hand on an object to learn a piece of information
about an emotional event that occurred involving the object
within the past week, determined by the GM. If you cast
object reading on the same item multiple times, you can either
concentrate on a single event to gain additional pieces of
information about that event, or gain a piece of information
about another emotional event in the applicable time frame.
Heightened (2nd) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last month.
Heightened (4th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last year.
Heightened (6th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last decade.
Heightened (8th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the last century.
Heightened (9th) You can learn about an event that occurred
within the entirety of the object’s history.

SPELL 1
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature that is your animal
companion or familiar
Duration 8 hours
You open your cloak or create a gap with your hands, drawing
the target into a pocket dimension just large enough for its basic
comfort. No other creature can enter this extradimensional
space, and the target can bring along objects only if they were
designed to be worn by a creature of its kind. The space has
enough air, food, and water to sustain the target for the duration.
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 224

You can Dismiss the spell. The spell also ends if you die
or enter an extradimensional space. When the spell ends, the
target reappears in the nearest unoccupied space (outside of
any extradimensional space you may have entered).
PHANTASMAL TREASURE
SPELL 2
EMOTION
ILLUSION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
A phantasmal image of the most precious thing imaginable
to the target appears in a location of your choice within the
spell’s range. Only the spell’s target can see the treasure,
though you can see the vague shape of the treasure—be it a
pile of items, a deific avatar, or a cherished loved one or hero.
The target’s response to the treasure is based on the outcome
of the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes fascinated with the treasure, and
the duration is until the end of its turn. The target can also try
to disbelieve the illusion if it touches the treasure, Seeks to
examine it, or speaks to it if the illusion appears to be a person
or the like. If the target disbelieves the illusion, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
Critical Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. The
target finds the treasure so appealing that until the spell
ends, it must spend each action focused on it. This can
include moving toward the treasure if the target isn’t next
to it, and Interacting with the treasure if the target is next
to it. (If the illusion appears to be a person or the like, the
target can also Interact to converse with it.)

QUENCH
SPELL 2
ABJURATION
WATER
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration sustained
You cause the air in the area to become supersaturated
with water vapor. Non-magical fires within the area are
automatically extinguished. Fire creatures within the area
take 4d8 damage (basic Fortitude save). Choose one magical
fire, fire spell, or fire item in the area and attempt to counteract
it. If you succeed against an item, the item loses its fire
properties for 10 minutes (for instance, a +1 flaming longsword
would become a +1 longsword). If the target is an artifact or
similarly powerful item, you automatically fail to counteract it.
When you Sustain this Spell, you can move the area of
vapor anywhere within range, but the only effect when you
do so is to automatically extinguish non-magical fires.
If you have the Counterspell reaction, you can use quench
to counter any spell with the fire trait instead of needing to
have the triggering fire spell prepared or in your repertoire.
Heightened (+1) Increase the damage to fire creatures by 2d8.
REAPER’S LANTERN
SPELL 2
DEATH
LIGHT
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 5-foot emanation
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You call forth a ghostly lantern that guides the living toward
death and the undead toward true death. It sheds bright light
in the spell’s area, and dim light to twice that area. Though the
lantern is insubstantial, you must keep a hand free to hold
it or the spell ends (though using the hand for somatic spell
components doesn’t end the spell). Living creatures and undead
in the area when you Cast the Spell, or that enter the area later,
must attempt Fortitude saves. Living creatures that fail their
Fortitude saves gain only half the normal benefit from healing
effects while within the area. Undead targets that fail their
Fortitude saves become enfeebled 1 while within the area. Once
a creature attempts a save against reaper’s lantern, it uses the
same outcome if it leaves the area and enters it again.
Once per turn, starting on the turn after you cast reaper’s
lantern, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate
trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet. When
you do so, you force creatures in the area that haven’t yet
attempted a save against reaper’s lantern to attempt one.
RUSTING GRASP
SPELL 4
TRANSMUTATION
Tradition primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 metal creature, 1 non-magical metal
hazard, or 1 non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk
You cause the target to rapidly rust. This magical rust can
affect nonferrous materials, but the target must be all or
mostly metal. Skymetals such as adamantine and orichalcum
are immune to this rust, and the GM might determine other
precious materials are similarly resilient. Ultimately, the GM
decides if an object or creature can be targeted with this spell.
All damage from this spell ignores Hardness. If the spell
causes persistent damage from rust, a creature can attempt

to scrape off the rust to assist the target in recovering from
the persistent damage (reducing the DC of the flat check to
end persistent damage to 10 and granting an immediate flat
check). The effect of the spell depends on its target.
• Creature or Hazard A creature or hazard must be made
of all or mostly metal to be affected (this includes many
mechanical traps). It takes 8d6 damage (basic Fortitude
save), plus 2d6 persistent damage on a failed save.
Touching a hazard to affect it with this spell might trigger
the hazard, as determined by the GM.
• Item The rust deals 2d6 damage, subject to a basic Reflex
save by the creature wearing or holding the item; if the
item is unattended, it automatically gets a critical failure.
On a failed save, the item also takes 1d6 persistent
damage. For an attended item, this persistent damage
occurs at the end of the attending creature’s turns; if
the item was unattended when you Cast the Spell, the
damage happens at the end of your turns.
When targeting armor someone is wearing, its Bulk is 1
higher than the listed value, since carrying armor is more
cumbersome than wearing it. Thin iron or steel items,
such as weapons, have 20 HP and a Broken Threshold of
10, and thicker iron or steel items, such as most suits of
armor, have 36 HP and a Broken Threshold of 18. Other
materials’ statistics can be found on pages 577–579 of
the Core Rulebook.
Heightened (+1) Increase the initial damage to creatures or
hazards by 2d6, and increase the maximum Bulk of an item
you can target by 1.
SAFE PASSAGE
SPELL 3
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range touch; Area 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 60-foot-long
section of terrain
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You repel dangers from all around you, making passage
through the chosen area safe for a brief amount of time.
Anyone passing through the area gains the following benefits
against harmful effects of the terrain and environment,
including environmental damage, hazardous terrain, and
hazards in the area. The spell grants a +2 status bonus to AC
and saves against such effects, and resistance 5 to all damage
from such effects. Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in
the area that’s prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an
unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain
that would collapse a normal structure of its type.
Safe passage protects only against harm, not inconvenience,
and it doesn’t reduce difficult terrain, remove the concealed
condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nor does it
protect against creatures within the spell’s area.
Heightened (5th) The granted resistance increases to 10, and
the area can be 120 feet long.
Heightened (8th) The granted resistance increases to 15, and
the area can be 500 feet long.
SCINTILLATING SAFEGUARD
SPELL 6
ABJURATION
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [reaction] somatic; Trigger An effect would deal physical or
energy damage to you or a creature in range.
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 5 willing creatures who would be
harmed by the triggering effect
A sparkling magical barrier envelops each target, shielding
them against the triggering effect. Choose one type of
physical or energy damage the triggering effect deals. Each
target gains resistance 10 against that damage type for the
triggering effect. The resistance applies only against the initial
damage, not against any persistent damage or other lingering
effects of the effect.
Heightened (+1) The resistance increases by 1.
SCULPT SOUND
SPELL 3
ILLUSION
Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, material
Range touch; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration 10 minutes
You change the sounds made by a creature or object. Choose
how you’re altering the sounds when you Cast the Spell; you
can’t alter it later. You can cause something that didn’t create a
sound to make sound, alter the voice of a creature, amplify or
deaden a sound, or transform one sound into another. A creature
who succeeds at a Perception check against your spell DC can
determine that the sound was altered by an illusion, including
hearing faint sounds if you deadened the sound, but they can’t
determine the true sound unless they critically succeed at the
Perception check. You can Dismiss the spell.
Because this spell obscures sound instead of preventing it,
using the spell to quiet a creature doesn’t prevent that creature
from using verbal spell components, though it does prevent
most auditory effects that rely on another creature hearing
them accurately. An unwilling target can attempt a Will save.
Success The affected sound from the creature isn’t altered.
Failure The affected sound from the creature is altered in the
way you determine.
Critical Failure The affected sound from the creature is altered
and the target becomes stupefied 2 for 1 minute as it
struggles with the disorienting effects of its altered sound.
Heightened (5th) You can target up to 6 creatures or 6 objects,
altering the sounds of all affected creatures or objects in
the same way.
SEAL FATE

You utter a curse that a creature will meet a certain end—a death
by freezing, stabbing, or another means you devise. Choose one
type of damage from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold,

electricity, fire, negative, piercing, slashing, or sonic. The effect
is based on the target’s Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target gains weakness 2 to the chosen damage
type until the end of your next turn.
Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute. If the creature
is reduced to 0 HP by the chosen damage and its level is 7
or less, it dies.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is unlimited.
Heightened (+2) The weakness increases by 1, and the
maximum level of creature that can be automatically killed
increases by 4.
SECRET CHEST
SPELL 5
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 container and its contents, totaling 10
Bulk or less
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You banish a container and its contents to the Ethereal Plane,
where you can retrieve it from later. The container’s physical
properties—the material from which it is made, any locks, or
other features—are irrelevant to the casting of this spell, but the
container can’t contain any creatures. When you Cast this Spell,
the container and all its contents are transported to a random
location deep in the Ethereal Plane. Time passes normally for
the container and its contents, and the environmental effects
of the Ethereal Plane apply to it. Though very unlikely, it’s
possible for a creature on the Ethereal Plane to stumble upon
the chest.
You can Dismiss the spell to return the chest to your current
location. If the spell ends by any other means, the container is
lost on the Ethereal Plane and you can no longer recall it with
this spell, though you could search for it in other ways.

You open your mind to the metaphysical, enabling you to sense
nearby spirits. Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check to
find haunts and spirits in the area. You gain a +1 status bonus
to the following checks regarding haunts or spirits: Perception
checks to Seek, attempts to Recall Knowledge, skill checks to
determine the reason for their existence, and skill checks to
disable a haunt. You also gain a +1 status bonus to AC and
saving throws against haunts and spirits.

you make your daily preparations.
STRANGE GEOMETRY
SPELL 5
ILLUSION
Traditions occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 4 cubes, each 10 feet on a side
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You cause the areas to appear to swell, bend, and break,
twisting together in a bizarre spatial geometry. The cubes of
the spell’s area can’t be adjacent to one another. A creature
must attempt a Will save if it’s in one of the cubes when you
Cast the Spell, or if it later enters one of the areas, with the
following effects. A creature interacting with the illusion can
also attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion, as normal.
Success The creature disbelieves the illusion.
Failure All terrain in the cubes is difficult terrain for the creature,
including the air if the creature is flying, walls if it’s climbing,
and so on. When the creature would exit one of the cubes,
it exits from one randomly determined by the GM. This is a
teleportation effect. It can exit from any edge of that cube it
chooses. When selecting a random cube, the GM excludes
any that don’t match the creature’s terrain; for instance, if
the creature were exiting along the ground, the GM would
exclude any cube that didn’t have an exit on the ground.
SUDDEN BLIGHT
SPELL 2
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living
creature in the area takes 2d10 negative damage (basic
Fortitude save). A creature afflicted by a disease takes a –2
circumstance penalty to this save.
You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny
non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical
undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and
concealment. Sudden blight attempts to counteract any
magical effect on the plants before withering them.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10.
SUMMON INSTRUMENT
CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
You materialize a handheld musical instrument in your grasp.
The instrument is typical for its type, but it plays only for
you. The instrument vanishes when the spell ends. If you cast
summon instrument again, any instrument you previously
summoned disappears.
Heightened (5th) The instrument is instead a virtuoso
handheld instrument.
THOUGHTFUL GIFT
SPELL 1
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your
hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target’s
hand, if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don’t. The
target knows what object you are attempting to send them.
If the target is unconscious or refuses to accept your gift, or
if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is
inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range increases to 500 feet.
Heightened (5th) As 3rd level, and the object’s maximum Bulk
increases to 1. You can Cast the Spell with 3 actions instead
of 1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile and you don’t
need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely
familiar with the target.
THREEFOLD ASPECT
SPELL 3
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions occult, primal
Cast 1 minute
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
This spell allows you to change between three versions of
yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother
(adult), or a matriarch (elderly). Choose one when you Cast
the Spell. While the spell lasts, you can change the age to
any of the three or to your natural age with a single action,
which has the concentrate trait. Your form always looks like
you regardless of the age, and creatures who know you still
recognize you and can tell your age is different.
Threefold aspect alters your physical appearance and
personality to present an authentic version of yourself at
various ages. This grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception
checks to pass as the chosen age, and you can add your
level as a proficiency bonus to these checks even if you’re
untrained. Furthermore, unless a creature specifically uses a
Seek action or otherwise carefully examines you, it doesn’t get
a chance to notice that you aren’t at your true age. You can
Dismiss this spell.

Range 60 feet; Area 2 adjacent 10-foot cubes
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 228
================================================================================

You warp the structure of earthen material, turning rock into
mud or mud into rock. Choose one of these two options when
you Cast the Spell.
• Rock to Mud You transform non-magical, unworked, and
unattended stone in the area into an equal volume of
mud. If you Cast this Spell on a stone floor, it becomes
difficult terrain; if the resulting mud is at least 3 feet
deep, it is greater difficult terrain, or the creature can
try to Swim through it (DC 10 Athletics). If the mud is
deep enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the
creature must Swim to move through it. If you Cast this
Spell on a ceiling, the falling mud deals 8d6 bludgeoning
damage (basic Reflex save) and spreads out, creating
difficult terrain in an area 10 feet larger in radius than
the original spell’s area. Once the rock is transformed into
mud, the mud is non-magical and remains until natural
conditions cause it to dry out or otherwise disperse.
• Mud to Rock Mud in the area turns into unworked stone.
If creatures are in the mud when it is transformed to
stone, they must attempt a Reflex saving throw.
Critical Success The creature escapes the mud and is atop
the stone, unaffected.
Success The creature climbs out of the mud as it turns to
rock and is prone atop the stone.
Failure The creature is partially stuck in the mud and is
grabbed for 1 round or until it Escapes, whichever
comes first.
Critical Failure The creature is entirely stuck. It is
restrained for 1 round or until it Escapes, whichever
comes first.
Heightened (+2) Add an additional 10-foot cube to the area,
adjacent to at least one of the other cubes.
VAMPIRIC MAIDEN
SPELL 4
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude
A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains
its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and
4d4 negative damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude
save. You gain temporary HP equal to the negative damage
the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and
the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric
maiden. The target takes full damage and is immobilized by
the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an Interact action
to extricate itself, whichever comes first.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is
immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it
Escapes (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.
Heightened (+1) The piercing and negative damage increase
by 1d4 each.
VOMIT SWARM
SPELL 2
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot cone
Saving Throw basic Reflex
You belch forth a swarm of magical vermin. You evoke and
shape the creatures from your own imagination, allowing you
to change the appearance of the creatures (typically a mix
of centipedes, roaches, wasps, and worms), but this doesn’t
change the effect of the spell. The vermin swarm over anyone
in the area, their bites and stings dealing 2d8 piercing damage
(basic Reflex save). A creature that fails its saving throw also
becomes sickened 1. Once the spell ends, the swarm disappears.
Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 1d8.
WALL OF FLESH
SPELL 5
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 20 feet
Duration 10 minutes
You craft a 20-foot-tall wall of living flesh in a straight line up to
30 feet long. The wall is 3 feet thick, and each 5-foot-long section
has AC 10 and 75 HP. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller
length or height. You must create the wall in an unbroken open
space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects,
or the spell is lost. The wall can’t be Repaired but can be healed
by positive energy and healing spells and abilities.
When you Cast the Spell, choose one of the following
features for your wall.
• Mouths The wall has countless toothy mouths along its
surface. The mouths Strike any creature that ends its turn
within 5 feet of the wall, using your spell attack roll for
these Strikes and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. The mouths are capable
of consuming potions; since the wall is alive, it can recover
Hit Points from a potion of healing, but it can’t benefit from
any effect that would give it the ability to move. Otherwise,
the GM determines which potions can affect the wall.
• Eyes The wall sprouts hundreds of unblinking eyes. You
can see through these eyes, gaining a +2 circumstance
bonus to visual Perception checks within the wall’s line
of sight. You can also use the eyes for determining line
of sight for ranged attacks and spells, but you don’t have
line of effect through the wall.
• Arms The wall is a mass of grasping arms. Any creature
that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall must attempt
a Reflex save.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is grabbed by the wall for 1 round
or until it Escapes against your spell DC, whichever
comes first.
Critical Failure The creature is restrained by the wall
for 1 round or until it Escapes against your spell DC,
whichever comes first.

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 round
You give a speech that fills your target with a drive to improve
themself to the exclusion of assisting others. A creature that
wants to gain the benefit of this spell and doesn’t care about
its limitations can voluntarily fail the save. The target then
becomes temporarily immune to all your litanies for 1 minute.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target gains a +2 status bonus to attack rolls,
Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks. The
target can’t Aid other creatures, consider any creature an
ally, or use spells or abilities that directly benefit another
creature (as determined by the GM), even if they also benefit

on a failed save, the target also takes a –2 status penalty to
AC for 1 round.
If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead
regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also
gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

You adopt the stance of clinging shadows. You can make shadow
grasp Strikes. These deal 1d4 negative damage; are in the brawling

While in clinging shadows stance, you gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to Athletics checks to Grapple, and to the DC for creatures
to Escape from you.
KI FORM
FOCUS 9
UNCOMMON
MONK
POLYMORPH
Cast [one-action] verbal
Duration 1 minute
Drawing from deep wells of spiritual power, you take on a
special ki form. In your ki form, your hair, feathers, skin, or
scales change color and begin to glow. In this form you gain a
fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Choose force, lawful (only
if you are lawful), negative, or positive damage. All your Strikes
deal 1d6 additional damage of the chosen type. Your entire body
is also surrounded by a glowing corona of the same color as your
inner ki; this is a light effect. Your corona is a 5-foot emanation
that deals 2d6 damage of the chosen type to creatures who
start their turn within the emanation. If the emanation overlaps
with a darkness effect, the corona’s glow attempts to counteract
the darkness effect. Regardless of the outcome, the corona can’t
attempt to counteract that effect again for 1 day. As a single
action, which has the concentrate trait, you can flare your
corona out to become a 30-foot emanation.
In your ki form, your emotions surge to the forefront and it’s
difficult to moderate your attacks. Your weapons and unarmed
attacks lose the nonlethal trait. You take a –2 status penalty
to saves against emotion effects but gain a +2 status bonus to
saves against all other mental effects.

You make an attack filled with a medusa’s petrifying power.
Make an unarmed Strike with the following additional effects.
Critical Success The target is slowed 2 and must attempt a
Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing
save has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed
condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful
save reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature
is unable to act due to the slowed condition from medusa’s
wrath, it is petrified permanently. The spell ends if the
creature is petrified or the slowed condition is removed.

restore 6d8 Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches
you with an Interact action you can allow it to gain the
same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily
immune to life-giving form’s healing for 1 minute. This is
a positive healing effect. You can’t heal yourself with
life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage
(such as an undead) that touches you or damages you
with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon
instead takes 3d4 positive damage, and it doesn’t become

invisible while you are in the water. You can electrically
charge yourself by taking a single action, which has the

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You reshape the target’s shadow into a deadly form, such as
strangling hands, a dangerous weapon, harrying runes, or the
like, and command it to attack the target. When you Cast the
Spell, and each time you Sustain the Spell, the shadow makes
a Strike against the target. The shadow moves along with the
foe, always remaining within reach. If you Sustain the Spell
multiple times in a round, you gain this effect each time. The
shadow uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.
The shadow’s Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless
of its shape, the shadow’s Strikes deal damage equal to 1d10
plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You choose the type of
damage when you Cast the Spell, choosing from bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage. The shadow doesn’t take up
space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature
would. The shadow can’t make any attacks other than its Strike.
The shadow vanishes if the target moves into an area
of complete darkness or enters an area with light from all
directions such that the target doesn’t cast a shadow. If
another effect is controlling the target’s shadow when you
cast malicious shadow, you can attempt to counteract that

Cast 1 hour; Cost one jacinth worth a total value of the target’s
level (minimum 1) × 5 gp, for each target; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary
Checks Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the
primary check), Survival
Range touch; Targets yourself and up to 5 willing creatures
Duration see text
You project the targets’ spiritual essences into the Astral Plane,
leaving their inanimate physical forms behind. These astral
forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while
the targets’ bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where
the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can’t
be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact
with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and
all targets must be selected from these casters.
A target’s astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything
they’re carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item
happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend,
destroy, lose, or give away an item’s duplicate, the original vanishes
from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the
targets can spend a single action to Dismiss their astral form and
immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster,
when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the
other targets’ astral forms as part of the same action, returning
all targets to their physical forms simultaneously. While in the
Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without
you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for
your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual
ends, the targets’ astral forms vanish.
A target’s astral form and corresponding physical form are
linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the
Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as a conduit
and safety line; if it is severed, the target’s astral and physical
forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by
an external force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target’s
physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly
returned to their physical body. If a target’s astral form is slain,
the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical
body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with
the same DC as the ritual’s primary check. On a failure, the
creature dies; on a success, they become clumsy 2, drained 2,
doomed 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be
removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A
target’s physical body remains in suspended animation for the
duration of the ritual, but if it is destroyed, they die and their
astral form also vanishes.
This ritual only projects a portion of the targets’
consciousnesses onto the Astral Plane. To travel physically
to the Astral Plane (to reach the Outer Planes, for example)
requires spells such as plane shift.
Critical Success All targets are able to navigate independently
in the Astral Plane. Each target’s silver cord is stronger than
usual, providing them a +4 circumstance bonus to their
Fortitude save to avoid dying if their astral form dies.
Success You successfully project the targets.
Failure You fail to project the targets.
Critical Failure The process of separating the targets’ spirits
from their bodies is complicated, and something goes
catastrophically wrong. All casters become doomed 1, are
immediately reduced to 0 Hit Points, and begin dying.
CLONE
RITUAL 9
RARE
NECROMANCY
Cast 7 days; Cost rare laboratory supplies and reagents worth
the target’s level (minimum 1) × 100 gp; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Crafting (legendary); Secondary Checks
Arcana, Occultism, Medicine
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 living creature up to 20th level
You remove 1 cubic inch of flesh from the target, who must be
present throughout the ritual and can be one of the casters.
You then use that flesh to grow a duplicate of the target’s
physical form that will house the target’s soul upon death.
This duplicate is physically identical to the original creature.
In order to perform the ritual, you need an expanded
alchemist’s lab (Core Rulebook 288) or a superior set of
equipment. Once the ritual is successfully completed, the
duplicate grows within the laboratory equipment for 2d4
months. While direct involvement isn’t required during this
period of growth, you must prevent any interference or
interruption or the ritual fails. When the duplicate is complete,
the original creature’s soul enters it as soon as their original
body dies, or immediately if the creature died during the
RITUALS
Rituals take much longer to cast than most spells and can be performed by anyone who
is skilled enough, not just spellcasters. The rules for casting rituals appear on page 408
of the Core Rulebook.

intervening months, as long as the soul is free and willing. If
Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come or the
target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return, the duplicate
remains empty until the impediment is removed. While
unoccupied, the inert duplicate must be preserved in suitable
alchemical equipment to prevent it from rotting.
Critical Success The cloning process is successful. When the
soul occupies the completed clone, it is clumsy 1, drained 1,
doomed 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week; these conditions
can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the week
has passed.
Success As critical success, but each condition value is 2.
Failure You fail to form the clone.
Critical Failure The clone appears to be successful, but
something went horribly wrong. Once it grows to its full
size, it can’t hold the target’s soul and instead houses a
malevolent intelligence or an invasive creature such as an
invidiak demon (Bestiary 2 65).
CREATE DEMIPLANE
RITUAL 8
RARE
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Cast 9 days; Cost precious materials worth a total value of
800 gp; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
(legendary); Secondary Checks Arcana, Nature, Occultism,
Religion (whichever three aren’t used for the primary check)
Few incantations are as renowned as the power to create worlds.
To cast this ritual, you must be on the Astral Plane, the Ethereal
Plane, or a plane that connects to one of the two.
A demiplane created with this ritual exists on the Astral or
Ethereal Plane. It can have the appearance of any mundane
environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a
clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything
else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable
boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something
more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.
Demiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate
for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a
general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane
experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has
no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and
plants will grow in a demiplane’s light.
When you first cast create demiplane, the casters are
teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access
to other worlds, so plane shift or similar abilities are necessary to
access it. As part of casting the ritual to create a new demiplane,
you create a key to the demiplane which serves as a plane shift
tuning fork for that demiplane. Most resemble ornate keys, but
some take the forms of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.
If you have the original key to an existing demiplane and
are on that demiplane, you can instead use this ritual to
either expand the demiplane or add special traits or features
described on page 242. See pages 136–138 of the Gamemastery
Guide for more information about these planar features.
• Alignment The demiplane gains one alignment trait, such
as lawful or good.
• Bounteous The demiplane has a functional ecosystem,
with plants and animals appropriate to the environment.
This ecosystem doesn’t require any additional effort on
your part to maintain.
• Elemental The demiplane gains the air, earth, fire, or water
planar essence trait.
• Gravity The demiplane gains a gravity trait of your choice.
• Key You create an additional key that can be used to
access the demiplane with plane shift and improve it
with create demiplane.
• Portal You create a permanent gateway between the
demiplane and a single other location. You must spend
the ritual’s casting time constructing the gateway on
the external side, which typically resembles an arch or
doorway of some sort. The gate is always active, but it can
be secured as you would any door.
• Scope The demiplane can be unbounded instead of finite,
though still with the same size.
Critical Success You create a new demiplane whose area
consists of two contiguous squares, each 100 feet on a side.
The ceiling is 20 feet high. If modifying an existing demiplane,
you can instead either add this area to the demiplane’s size or
add two special traits or features.
Success As critical success, but the demiplane’s area is a single
square, 100 feet on a side and a ceiling 20 feet high. If
modifying an existing demiplane, you can add one special trait
or feature.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Something goes horribly wrong, and all casters
are teleported to an unknown but likely hostile plane.
Heightened (10th) The ritual creates a square area 1,000 feet on
a side, with a ceiling 20 feet high (two contiguous areas of
this size on a critical success). The cost of the ritual increases
to 20,000 gp.

Duration unlimited
You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the
target settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell
of the structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the
ritual is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures
and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures.
For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the
target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a
thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view,
or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you
create the facade, you determine which illusory elements
remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags
blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for

example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with
marching band). You’re unable to alter the programs after you
create the facade.
You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same
effects as a 3rd-level illusory disguise. If a creature affected by
the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after
1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers
are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise
appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week.
A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way
that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade,
such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or
climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an
illusory river of lava wouldn’t cause damage, nor could thorns
on an illusory rose bush prick someone.
Critical Success You create the facade as described, and you
can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day
to reprogram them.
Success You create the facade as described.
Failure Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Your ritual produces unexpected and
uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned,
such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the
buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as
skeletons. These effects fade after 1 month.
Heightened (10th) The cost increases to 100,000 gp and the
radius can be up to 5 miles.
HEARTBOND
RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Cost fine wine and a set of matching rings or other
tokens worth 40 gp total; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Diplomacy, Society
Range 20 feet
You create a magical bond between two willing creatures, who are
secondary casters of the ritual and must share genuine affection
for one another. As part of the ritual, both members of the bond
receive a ring, amulet, or similar token to symbolize their shared
connection. They lose the effects of the ritual when not wearing
the token, and the bond is broken if either token is destroyed.
Creatures benefiting from a successful heartbond ritual can
later participate in a heightened version of the ritual without
requiring new checks by spending the required time and paying
the difference of the two costs. A creature can be under the
effects of multiple heartbond rituals at once.
Critical Success Once per day, each bonded creature can use
a 2-action activity, which has the concentrate trait, to learn
the present state of the other bonded creature. The creature
knows the other creature’s direction and distance and any
conditions affecting them. Both of the participants can cast
message as a divine innate spell at will, but can only target
the other participant.
Success As a critical success, except the bonded creatures
can’t cast message as a divine innate spell.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure Magical backlash creates discordant energy
among the participants. For 1 week, each ritual participant
is clumsy 2 and stupefied 2 whenever they are within 30
feet of another ritual participant.
Heightened (6th) Increase the cost to a total value of 600 gp. On
a success, secondary casters in the ritual permanently gain the
effects of a 6th-level telepathy spell, but only with each other.
HEROES’ FEAST
RITUAL 5
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
Cast 4 hours; Cost 25 gp; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature, Religion, or Occultism (expert);
Secondary Checks Diplomacy or Society
Range 40 feet
You conjure otherworldly beings to serve you and your companions
a feast with restorative properties. These mysterious beings may
be fey, divine, or other supernatural servitors, as appropriate
for the primary check. After the first hour of the ritual, these
servants appear and serve a massive feast, complete with an
exquisite table and up to 10 place settings. The bounteous spread
consists of all manner of dishes, including the guests’ childhood
comfort foods, modern delicacies, and preferred drinks. The
summoned servants spend the next 3 hours waiting on you and
the other guests, fetching additional food, pouring drinks, and
so forth. During this time, you and the other guests must strive
to be as polite and gracious as possible to avoid offending your
mysterious hosts. At the feast’s end, the ritual is completed and
you and the secondary caster attempt your checks as normal. If
the feast is interrupted at any point, the servants immediately
vanish with their provisions and the ritual is disrupted.
Critical Success The feast is nourishing and revitalizing. The
magical food casts neutralize poison, remove disease, and
remove fear on each guest for each relevant affliction, using
your modifier for the primary skill check as the counteract
modifier. Each guest also recovers 100 Hit Points and gains
20 temporary Hit Points for the next 12 hours. Guests also
gain a +2 status bonus to saves against disease, fear, and
poison effects for the next 12 hours.
Success As critical success, except guests recover only 50 Hit
Points, gain only 10 temporary Hit Points, and don’t gain the
status bonus to saves.
Failure You and the other guests taste ash in your mouths
and realize that the feast contained nothing of sustenance.
Critical Failure The otherworldly servants were offended by
your behavior or the hubris you demonstrated in summoning
them and poisoned the feast. You and your guests become
sickened 4 and can’t reduce the condition for 12 hours.
Heightened (+1) Increase the Hit Points recovered by 10 and
the temporary Hit Points by 2 (or twice each amount on a
critical success).

================================================================================

Primary Check Nature (expert); Secondary Checks Occultism,
Religion
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level
You call forth the target’s soul and attempt to incarnate it into a
brand-new body. As the soul won’t be returning to the original
body, only a small portion of the creature’s remains are required.
These remains must have been part of the original body at
the time of death, and the target must have died within the
past week. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has
come or the target’s soul is trapped or doesn’t wish to return,
this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after you
succeed at the Religion check and can end the ritual without
paying the cost.
If the ritual is successful, the target’s new body has a random
ancestry. First roll 1d20. On a result of 1 through 14, the new
body is one of a common ancestry, while on a 15 through 20
they become a member of an uncommon or rare ancestry. The
GM chooses possible ancestries based on those found in the
region and then rolls randomly between them. For instance,
the GM could roll 1d6 to choose a common ancestry from the
Core Rulebook. The target replaces their ancestry Hit Points,
size, Speeds, ability boosts, ability flaws, traits, and special
abilities with those of their new ancestry. The target loses
their heritage and ancestry feats, selecting replacements from
their new ancestry. The target’s background, class features,
and known languages remain unaltered.
Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult body.
This new body has full HP and has the same spells prepared
and points in their pools as the original did when it died.
Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and
no spells prepared or points in any pools. The soul takes
some time to adjust to their new body, leaving them clumsy
2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions
can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the week
has passed.
Failure You fail to reincarnate the target.
Critical Failure The target’s soul becomes trapped in an
unintelligent animal creature of the GM’s choosing, with a
level no greater than half the target’s level. While trapped,
the target has an Intelligence score of 1 (–5 modifier) and
can’t use any of their own abilities.
Heightened (4th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 10. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 40 gp.
Heightened (5th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 12. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 75 gp.
Heightened (6th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 14. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 125 gp. The
target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 16. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 200 gp.
The target must have died within the past month.
Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 18. The cost is the target’s level (minimum 1) × 300 gp.
The target must have died within the past year.

REST ETERNAL
RITUAL 4
UNCOMMON

Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils to anoint the body worth a total value
of the target’s level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Occultism, Religion
Range 20 feet; Targets 1 dead creature
You call upon gods, spirits, and stranger beings to bar a
creature’s spirit from ever returning. A spirit that doesn’t wish
to be so constrained can attempt a Will save to resist this
ritual; on a critical success, it fools you into believing the ritual
succeeded. This ritual has no effect on a target who is undead
or whose soul is otherwise not in the afterlife.
Critical Success You sequester the subject’s spirit to the
afterlife. Attempts to communicate with the dead creature,
return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb
its afterlife fail unless the effect’s counteract level is at
least 2 higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an
artifact or a deity. Successfully returning the creature to life
ends the restrictions placed by rest eternal.
Success As critical success, but effects to interact with the
spirit fail unless the effect’s counteract level is higher than
that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the spirits you appealed to
are angered by your meddling. All casters become doomed
1 for 1 week.
SIMULACRUM
RITUAL 4
RARE
ILLUSION
Cast 1 day; Cost a piece of hair, drop of blood, or other part of
the creature to be duplicated, plus rare oils, minerals, and
pigments with a total value of 300 gp; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master, the check has the
secret trait); Secondary Checks Arcana, Nature, Occultism,
Religion, or Society (whichever is required to Recall Knowledge
about the creature being duplicated); Crafting; Deception
Targets 1 living creature
You create an illusory duplicate of the target creature by
animating ice or snow sculpted in its shape. The simulacrum is a
4th-level creature with no special abilities. If it needs to attempt
a roll or use a DC, use the moderate number for a monster
(Gamemastery Guide 57), except as noted below. It doesn’t
have any specific memories from the target, but it can use
information about the creature gained from any of the casters
to Impersonate the target. It looks exactly like the target and
has a Deception modifier to Impersonate that creature equal
to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the
Deception check, with a +4 status bonus.
While it doesn’t have any of the original’s special abilities,
like a dragon’s breath weapon, the illusions that make up
the simulacrum allow it to appear to use those abilities; they
just never seem to have an effect. For instance, against a
simulacrum dragon’s breath weapon, all creatures in the area
seem to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no
damage. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by
attempting a Perception check against the Deception DC of
the secondary spellcaster who rolled the Deception check.
Critical Success You bring the simulacrum to life. It has the minion
trait and is under your absolute control. You gain a direct
mental link with the simulacrum and can spend an action to
command the simulacrum via this link, even at a distance.
Success As a critical success, but there is no special link
between you and the simulacrum. You must spend an action
to command it verbally or by some other means.
Failure The ritual fails and has no effect.
Critical Failure The simulacrum awakens, but it isn’t your
minion and is hostile to all the casters. It does everything it
can to destroy them, but if it can’t immediately slay them,
the simulacrum tries to escape and plots their demise.
TELEPORTATION CIRCLE
RITUAL 7
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense, precious metals, and purified
chalk worth 500 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary
Checks Crafting, Survival
Range 20 feet
Duration 1 day
You create a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground, which acts
as a portal to a destination determined at the time of the ritual.
You designate the destination of the teleportation as part of the
ritual. This destination can’t be changed. The destination must
be a location within 1,000 miles and be on the same plane as
the teleportation circle. You must be able to identify the location
precisely both by its position relative to the location where you
create the teleportation circle and by the destination’s appearance
(or other identifying features). The destination must also be
a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn’t overlap with any solid
structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous.
A secondary caster attempting a Survival check for this ritual
can be located at the exact site of the destination, instead of
with you at the point of origin. If the secondary succeeds at
their check at the destination and you roll a success, the ritual
is a critical success instead.
While the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully
within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A
creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will save
to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature must
attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns.
The teleportation circle normally goes only in one direction,
though you can double the Cost to make the teleportation
work in both directions.
Critical Success You create the teleportation circle, and it’s
extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled.
Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point.
Success As a critical success, but the destination of the
teleportation circle is slightly inaccurate, and is off target

by roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum
of 10 miles off target.
Failure The teleportation circle doesn’t function.
Critical Failure The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate. It
leads to a random destination roughly the same distance
from the origin point, and the chances of some other
unusual mishap are much greater.
Heightened (9th) The cost increases to 2,000 gp, the duration
increases to 1 month, and the destination can be anywhere
on the same planet.
Heightened (10th) The cost increases to 10,000 gp, the
duration is unlimited, and the destination can be anywhere
on the same planet.

Checks Arcana or Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the
primary check), Diplomacy
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 20 feet high
Duration 1 year
You create a site-bound, long-lasting unseen servant spell
effect, forming entities of pure force to carry out basic tasks
at a fixed location.
Critical Success The ritual creates six unseen servants (Core
Rulebook 380). You don’t need to concentrate on them, and
they aren’t summoned minions. You can spend an action, which
has the concentrate trait, to command one to perform a basic
task; it continues to perform the task until commanded again.
Success As critical success, but the ritual creates three unseen
servants.
Failure The ritual fails to create any servants.
Critical Failure The ritual creates six unseen servants, but
these creatures are hostile and capable of making fist
Strikes with an attack bonus equal to your skill modifier
for the primary skill check, dealing 1d6 force damage. They
attack you and your allies and attempt to break objects
belonging to you and your allies within the area.
Heightened (6th) If destroyed, the unseen servants reform the
next morning. The cost increases to 30 gp.
WARD DOMAIN
RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incenses, oils, and powdered silver, worth
150 gp total; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana, Nature, or Occultism (master);
Secondary Checks Lore (any), Survival, Thievery
Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 50 feet high
Duration 1 week
This ritual has long been used to guard the private sanctums of
powerful rulers, spellcasters, and other figures of import. You
and the other casters spend the casting time burning incense,
anointing doorframes, and drawing lines of powered silver
across entryways. The ritual creates the following magical
effects within the area; these effects are heightened to the level
of ward domain and remain throughout the duration.
All gates, doors, windows, and similar apertures in the area
(if any) are locked, with the effects of lock. In addition, you can
obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within
the area with the effects of illusory object to appear as plain
walls. Scrying spells can’t perceive any stimuli from the area,
and ward domain attempts to counteract teleportation effects
into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures
into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual’s save DC – 10.
A successful dispel magic used on a specific effect removes
only that effect (such as the lock effect on one window). A
successful disjunction ends the entire ritual.
Critical Success You create the effects described above, and
you protect an area twice as large.
Success You create the effects described above.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The area becomes trapped and hostile to you
and your allies in a way you didn’t anticipate.
Heightened (+1) The ward covers an additional area 100 feet ×
100 feet, up to 50 feet high, which must be contiguous with
the original area.

level or lower
Duration 1 year
You bind yourself and your allies to the specific safe location
where you perform the ritual. This allows the participants to
return later by simply speaking a word.
Success You form the connection with the designated
sanctuary. Any participant in the ritual can spend a single
action, which has the concentrate trait, to utter a word of
power you choose when you cast the spell. When they do,
all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary
from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane
as the sanctuary. Each participant arrives in the position in
which they were standing during the casting of the ritual.
When the word is spoken, all other participants know it, and
each can choose whether or not to return to the sanctuary
at that time. The ritual then immediately ends.
Failure You fail to form the connection between the participants
and the sanctuary and are aware that the ritual has failed.
Critical Failure The ritual inadvertently forms a connection
with a location on another plane. The casters are unaware
of this misalignment. When the word is invoked, all ritual
participants are shifted to this extraplanar location.
Heightened (+1) The cost increases by 5,000 gp, the ritual
can target one more creature, and the maximum level of
creature it can target increases by 2.

CHAPTER 6: ITEMS
The investigator’s trusty detective kit, a swashbuckler’s flashy dueling cape, and a witch’s
effervescent cauldron are nearly as iconic as the characters who use them. For any hero,
the gear and treasure they wield and collect throughout their adventures can play as
important a role as any other facet of their character, from weapons steeped in cultural
history to fantastic treasures of unparalleled worth!
This chapter presents a variety of brand-new equipment and treasure that
expands on and supplements the options provided in Chapter 6: Equipment
and Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure of the Core Rulebook. In particular,
the gear that follows is especially suitable for the new ancestries and classes
presented in this book, but the multitude of new items can enhance and
enrich all types of characters.
As it combines material from two chapters of the Core Rulebook, this
chapter is divided into the following sections.
Weapons and Adventuring Gear
New weapons and adventuring gear begin on page 248. This section includes
class kits for the new classes presented in this book, so you can quickly
equip a new character with the armor, weapons, and gear they’ll need to
start adventuring! The full rules for weapons and adventuring gear appear in
Chapter 6 of the Core Rulebook.
Crafting and Treasure
The second portion of this chapter consists of a catalog of new alchemical
items, snares, and both consumable and permanent magic items, including
runes. Table 6–4: Treasure by Level, on pages 250–251, presents all the
new items appearing in this book. These tables are organized by level and
item category (see the Item Categories margin note) to help you find the
appropriate gear for your character or adventure.
ALCHEMICAL ITEMS
Alchemical items are consumable, non-magical items that rely on the properties
of volatile alchemical reagents to produce their effects. Rules for alchemical
items, including the rules for bombs, elixirs, and poisons, begin on page 543
of the Core Rulebook. The alchemical items in this book are presented by level
on Table 6–5: Alchemical Items by Level, as a reference for alchemists and
other characters with alchemical abilities.
SNARES
Snares are small, simple traps to damage or hamper your foes that you can
create and deploy quickly enough to utilize on a battlefield. Snares are non-
magical consumable items. The full rules for creating and using snares are on
page 589 of the Core Rulebook.
MAGIC ITEMS
The remainder of this chapter contains the descriptions of dozens of new magic
items. These items are divided into two subcategories for ease of reference:
consumable magic items, including ammunition, oils, potions, and talismans,
begin on page 256. Permanent items, beginning on page 260, consist of armor,
held items, runes, shields, staves, wands, weapons, and worn items.
Items are organized alphabetically within each section. Rules for activating
and investing items, for sustaining and dismissing activations, and for reading
an item’s stat block begin on page 531 of the Core Rulebook.
ITEM CATEGORIES
Items in this chapter are grouped into
the following categories.
• Weapons and Adventuring Gear
(page 248) details new non-magical
weapons and equipment suitable
for ancestries, classes, and other
options presented in this book.
• Alchemical Items (page 252)
consists of bombs, elixirs
(including mutagens), poisons, and
alchemical tools.
• Snares (page 256) are simple,
single-use traps.
• Consumable Magic Items (page 256)
contains ammunition, oils, potions,
talismans, and other single-use
magical items.
• Permanent Magic Items and Runes
(page 260) provide new armor, held
items, runes, shields, staves, wands,
weapons, and worn items.
