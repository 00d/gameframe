CHAPTER 3: ARCHETYPES
Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an
archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers from the sentinel archetype? Are
you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you’re a medic, tending to the
fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer.

Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast
cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic
spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master
spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the
archetype; for instance, the witch’s master spellcasting
feat is called Master Witch Spellcasting. All spell slots
you gain from spellcasting archetypes are subject to
the restrictions within the archetype. For instance, the
eldritch archer archetype allows you to pick a spell list
when you take its dedication feat. If you pick arcane
spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots you can
use only to cast arcane spells from your eldritch archer
repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with occult spells in
your sorcerer repertoire.
Basic Spellcasting Feat: Usually available at 4th level,
these feats grant a 1st-level spell slot. At 6th level, they
grant you a 2nd-level spell slot, and if you have a spell
repertoire, you can select one spell from your repertoire
as a signature spell. At 8th level, they grant you a
3rd-level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as
the “basic spellcasting benefits.”
Expert Spellcasting Feat: Typically taken at 12th
level, these feats make you an expert in spell attack rolls
and DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant
you a 4th-level spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire,
you can select a second spell from your repertoire as a
signature spell. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-level
spell slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-level
spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“expert spellcasting benefits.”
Master Spellcasting Feat: Usually found at 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and
DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant
you a 7th-level spell slot. If you have a spell repertoire,
you can select a third spell from your repertoire as a
signature spell. At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-level
spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“master spellcasting benefits.”
ALCHEMICAL ARCHETYPES
Some archetypes give you abilities to use alchemy
in a similar manner to an alchemist and say that you
get the basic alchemy benefits. This means you get the
Alchemical Crafting feat, infused reagents (a pool of
reagents usable to make alchemical items), and advanced
alchemy (allowing you to make alchemical items during
your daily preparations without the normal cost or time
expenditure). The individual archetype might impose
special restrictions or benefits, or adjust the number of
reagents you get or your advanced alchemy level. The
rules for these are in the Core Rulebook: Alchemical
Crafting on page 258, and rules for infused reagents and
advanced alchemy are on page 72.
If you gain infused reagents from more than one
source, you use the highest number of reagents to
determine your pool rather than adding them together.
For instance, at 2nd level an alchemist with a +4
Intelligence modifier would normally get six batches of
infused reagents per day from the class, and a character
with the Herbalist Dedication feat would normally get
two batches. A character who is both an alchemist and
an herbalist has six batches—the higher number from
alchemist—but is able to use them for abilities in the
class or the archetype. Your advanced alchemy level
always depends on which ability you’re using. In the
example above, the herbalist’s advanced alchemy level
for their herbalist abilities is 1st, though it’s 2nd for
alchemist abilities.
TEMPORARY ITEMS
Several archetypes allow you to prepare temporary items.
Much like the infused items created by alchemists, these
temporary items last only a short time before becoming
useless. Examples include temporary scrolls created by
the scroll trickster and temporary weapons, armor, or
adventuring gear created by the scrounger.
Temporary items are clearly not up to the same
quality as other items, so they typically can’t be sold. If
an ability doesn’t list how long a temporary item lasts,
the item lasts until the next time you make your daily
preparations. Any effect created by a temporary item
also ends at that time if it hasn’t already (unless it’s a
permanent effect).
KEY TERMS
You’ll see these terms within this chapter’s archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use the metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.
Open: These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in
the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action
with the open trait only if you haven’t used an action with
the attack or open trait yet this turn.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts
until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any)
are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a
new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action
with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round.
You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

characters who want to be a bit flashier or for

Archer
Bows of all types are powerful weapons. Generals and
hunters alike recognize the power in dealing death from
long distances, and from behind cover. Those dedicated to
the bow—from mysterious cloaked strangers to heartless
snipers—are often viewed with a mixture of respect and
fear. Like any weapon adept, the archer’s skill is forged
through experience and constant practice. A true archer
becomes one with the bow and is able to accomplish with
that weapon things that most would consider impossible,
or at least nearly magical.

mark takes 6d6 extra precision damage with a basic Fortitude
save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
If the mark critically fails, they die. This is an incapacitation
effect. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to your
Assassinate for 1 day.

Bastion
Some say that a good offense is the best defense, but
you find such boasting smacks of overconfidence. In
your experience, the best defense is a good, solid shield
between you and your enemies. You’ve focused your
training on how best to use a shield to protect yourself
and those around you.
Additional Feats: 6th Shielded Stride (Core Rulebook
146); 8th Reflexive Shield (Core Rulebook 148), Shield
Warden (Core Rulebook 149); 10th Quick Shield
Block (Core Rulebook 149); 12th Mirror Shield (Core
Rulebook 151)
BASTION DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Shield Block
You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You
gain the Reactive Shield fighter feat (Core Rulebook 145).
This fulfills any prerequisites requiring Reactive Shield
as normal.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the bastion archetype.
DISARMING BLOCK [free-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication, trained in Athletics
Trigger You Shield Block a melee Strike made with
a held weapon.
You attempt to Disarm the creature whose
attack you blocked of the weapon they
attacked you with. You can do so even if
you don’t have a hand free.
NIMBLE SHIELD HAND
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You are so used to wielding a shield that you
can do so even while using the hand that’s holding
it for other purposes. The hand you use to wield a
shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of
the Interact action. You can also hold another
object in this hand (but you still can’t use it to
wield a weapon). This benefit doesn’t apply to tower
shields, which are still too cumbersome.
DESTRUCTIVE BLOCK
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can protect yourself more effectively, at the expense
of your shield. When you Shield Block, you can reduce
the damage to yourself by double the shield’s Hardness,
but if you do, the shield takes double the normal amount
of damage it would have taken (before applying its
Hardness). You can’t use Destructive Block if your shield
can’t be broken or destroyed, such as if you’re using an
indestructible shield.
SHIELD SALVATION
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bastion Dedication
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after
a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to
damage taken during your Shield Block, the shield remains
intact at 1 Hit Point instead. Its construction is weakened
until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from
using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your
next preparations.

Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature
animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Core

Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still
use 1 action on your turn to either Stride or Strike.
BEASTMASTER’S TRANCE
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
You can enter a trance that allows you to briefly inhabit the
body of one of your animal companions and share its senses.
You gain the focus spell beastmaster trance (page 157).
Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
INCREDIBLE BEASTMASTER COMPANION
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion
Your mature animal companions continue to grow and develop.
They each become nimble or savage animal companions (your
choice, choose for each companion, including those that become
mature after you take this feat), gaining additional capabilities

Beastmaster
You attract the loyalty of animals, and as your powers
increase you can command more of them, briefly inhabit
their body to perceive what they perceive, and even
communicate with them over vast distances. Your animals
may see you as a beloved parent, teacher, and mentor, or
they may consider you a poor, defenseless cub that needs
protection. Regardless, they will fight for you and alongside
you, even sacrificing their lives for you if necessary.
Additional Feats: 4th Magic Hide (page 132), Wild
Empathy (Core Rulebook 172); 6th Companion’s Cry
(Core Rulebook 172); 10th Enlarge Companion (page
132); 14th Side by Side (Core Rulebook 175). Warden
spells granted by these feats are beastmaster focus spells
for you.
BEASTMASTER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Nature
You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels
with you and obeys your commands. The rules for animal
companions appear on page 214 of the Core Rulebook, with
additions on page 144 of this book. Contrary to the usual rules
for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal
companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion,
you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster
Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.
Certain beastmaster feats give you primal focus spells. The
rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.
When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you
become trained in primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and
your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. Feats
that grant beastmaster focus spells tell you to increase the
number of Focus Points in your pool, but if you don’t already
have a focus pool, you instead get a focus pool with 1 Focus
Point. You can Refocus by grooming, feeding, playing with, or
otherwise tending to an animal companion.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the beastmaster archetype.
ADDITIONAL COMPANION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal
companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster
Animal Companions for rules on how having multiple animal
companions works.
Special You can select this feat more than once, gaining
an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum
of four total companions (including the one you gained from
Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from
sources other than the beastmaster archetype).
HEAL ANIMAL
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication
BEASTMASTER ANIMAL COMPANIONS
If you’re playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics
and abilities of your animal companions according to
the rules on pages 214–217 of the Core Rulebook. As a
beastmaster, it’s possible for you to have more than one
animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but
only one of those companions, your “active companion,”
follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest
are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as
you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster
archetype, you also gain Call Companion to switch your
active companion. These rules apply to all your companions,
regardless of whether you got the animal companion from
the beastmaster archetype or from another source.
CALL COMPANION
EXPLORATION
You spend 1 minute calling for a different animal
companion, switching your active companion for another
of your animal companions.

anywhere on the planet.
BEASTMASTER’S CALL [one-action]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
PRIMAL
Prerequisites Beastmaster Dedication, Call Companion
Frequency once per turn
You quickly call in a primal projection of a non-active
companion to provide the companion’s support benefit. The
projection arrives in an unoccupied square of your choice
within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then
disappears on your next turn. The projection has the same AC
and saving throw modifiers as the real companion, and if it
would take any damage before your next turn, it disappears
and the support benefit ends immediately.
SPECIALIZED BEASTMASTER COMPANION
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Incredible Beastmaster Companion
Your nimble and savage animal companions become
cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion
gains one specialization of your choice (Core Rulebook 217,
choose separately).
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each time,
add a different specialization to your nimble and savage
companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up
to three specializations each.
LEAD THE PACK
FEAT 16
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mature Beastmaster Companion, you have
multiple animal companions
You can have up to two animal companions active at once.
However, when you do, it’s slightly more difficult to Command
them. If you don’t Command either of your companions, one
of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn
to Stride or Strike, as per Mature Beastmaster Companion,
but not both. When you Command an Animal, either choose
one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else
both companions can take 1 action to Stride or Strike.
Either way, you can’t Command an Animal to make either
companion act again until your next turn.

FOCUS 3
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
DIVINATION
MENTAL
Cast [three-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 1 mile; Targets one of your animal companions you
can perceive
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You enter a magical trance that allows you to perceive
through the senses of the target companion. You attempt
Perception checks using your own Perception, but you
have any special senses the target has, such as low-light
vision or darkvision. This spell grants no special method of
communication with the chosen animal, so it follows any
instructions you gave it before you entered the trance and,
failing that, it does as it wishes.
For the duration of the trance, your own senses are
muted, though you can still communicate. This lack
of awareness makes you flat-footed. You can’t take
actions with the attack or move traits.
Heightened (6th) Increase the range to 100 miles
and the duration to sustained up to 10 minutes. The
target can hear you through the spell, allowing you to
Command the Animal or use other actions that have the
auditory trait.
Heightened (8th) Increase the range to planetary and the
duration to sustained up to 1 hour. You can communicate
telepathically with the target for the duration of the trance.

Blessed One
Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry
the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the
ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions,
and exists independent of worship. You might offer
thanks daily to the deity whose power you wield, or
you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to
avoid responsibility or even acting to defy the deity’s
influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity’s
order, or you might give little thought and even less
reverence to the source of your powers. However you
feel about these gifts, there can be no doubt that you
wield a special power. Good-aligned deities are most
likely to empower a blessed one. However, deities of any
alignment can grant such a blessing, as long as they are
capable of granting a positive divine font to their clerics.
This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant a foul
version of the blessed one’s powers.

DEDICATION
You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to
alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the lay on hands
devotion spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell.
This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can
recover using the Refocus activity (Core Rulebook 300). You
can Refocus by meditating, whether you reflect on the deity
granting the blessing or not, allowing your blessing to refill
your focus pool. Your devotion spells from the blessed one
archetype are divine spells.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the blessed one archetype.

Frequency once per 10 minutes
When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful
conditions. If your next action is to Cast a Spell from a spell slot,
and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to
remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must
be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including
those granted by later feats such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a
counteract check based on the spell’s DC and level. This effect
is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.

Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information
about your prey; you can still designate a creature you’re
tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.

the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey.
This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey
dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting
you loses this benefit if they’re out of your presence for too
long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but
is determined by the GM.

CAVALIER PLEDGES
Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific
organization or individual, such as a noble family or
sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization,
or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or
ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any
anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the
druid’s animal order would be tied to that anathema,
while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would
be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If
you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated
anathema, you should work with your GM to determine
the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge.
Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain
access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as
Cavalier’s Banner. If you violate the anathema of your
pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit
from an atone ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge
is equivalent to retraining a class feature.
Cavalier
You are a skilled and dedicated warrior of the battlefield
who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal
companion that serves as your mount. You and your
mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared
intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield.
You might wield a banner in the name of a greater
organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you
might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige,
reputation, and coffers.
CAVALIER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Nature or Society
You gain a young animal companion (Core Rulebook 214)
that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal
companions with the mount special ability, as well as any
additional options from your pledge, as determined by your
GM. You must choose an animal companion that’s at least one
size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small,
you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing
no statistics other than its size).
Special You cannot select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the cavalier archetype. This
restriction is waived if you have pledged to the organization
associated with the other dedication feat. For example, if you
are pledged to a Hellknight order, you could take Hellknight
dedication feats without needing to gain other feats from the
cavalier archetype first.

within the area attempting to use a visual effect that involves
focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a medusa’s
Focus Gaze) must succeed at a Will save against your class DC
or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature

target’s Will DC. Regardless of your
result, the target is temporarily
immune to your Distracting Flattery
for 10 minutes.
Success
The
target’s
attitude
doesn’t decrease as a result of
your ally’s social blunder.
Failure
The
target’s
attitude
decreases, as normal.
Critical Failure Your attempt makes
matters worse, decreasing the
target’s attitude toward you
by one step, in addition to any
changes from the behavior
that triggered this reaction.
GOSSIP LORE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dandy Dedication
Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed
on every topic. You are trained in Gossip Lore, a special Lore
skill that can be used only to Recall Knowledge, but on any
topic. If you fail a check to Recall Knowledge with Gossip
Lore, you get the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat
(Core Rulebook 260).
If you have legendary proficiency in Society, you gain
expert proficiency in Gossip Lore, but you can’t increase your
proficiency rank in Gossip Lore by any other means.
FABRICATED CONNECTIONS
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in
Deception
You can lie about having taken an action so
convincingly that you acquire all the tangible
benefits of having successfully completed it.
You can roll Deception in place of a different
skill when attempting to Earn Income, Make
an Impression, Request, or Subsist. You can
use Fabricated Connections to Make an
Impression or Request once per day, and
you can also use it once per week to Earn
Income or Subsist.
PARTY CRASHER
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Dandy Dedication,
master in Society
You attend all the fashionable
society parties, no matter how
exclusive they might be. Any
time you encounter a social
event you would ordinarily
be denied access to, such as
a coronation, royal gala, or
other society function, you
can spend 1d4 hours to
secure entry without the
need for a skill check. You
find invitations, invitees
looking for fashionable
dates,
temporary
jobs
with the caterers, event
staff willing to look the
other way, or some
other mode of access for
yourself and your allies.
This ability doesn’t apply
to secret events or other
small private gatherings
with no staff, dates, or
outsiders involved.

Dragon Disciple
The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales,
and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of
a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these
creatures makes them worthy of reverence—or even
outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves
to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple
striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of
draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct,
and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic
predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who
has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might
follow this path.
As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the
example of dragons, but that doesn’t necessarily mean
that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most
dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon,
countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great
personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury.
These disciples have transformed themselves into what
they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their
draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.
DRAGON DISCIPLE DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Access You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled
heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic
bloodline sorcerer.
You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your
focus grants you a measure of its power. Choose one color of
dragon when you select this feat; if you are a sorcerer with
the draconic bloodline, this must be the same type as your
bloodline. You gain resistance equal to half your level against
one type of damage determined by the chosen dragon type.
The GM may allow you to choose a dragon type not listed
below, and will determine the damage type appropriate for
that dragon.
• Black or Copper Acid
• Blue or Bronze Electricity
• Brass, Gold, or Red Fire
• Green Poison
• Silver or White Cold
You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against sleep effects and effects that would make you paralyzed.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you have gained two other feats from the dragon disciple
archetype. If you later take the sorcerer archetype, you must
choose the draconic bloodline.
CLAWS OF THE DRAGON
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication
Your fingernails grow into razor-sharp claws, and scales
speckle your fingers, hands, and wrists. Your claws are agile,
finesse unarmed attacks that deal 1d6 slashing damage and
are in the brawling weapon group.
If you’re a draconic sorcerer, when you cast dragon claws,
increase the spell’s slashing damage die from d4 to d6 and
increase the resistance to 10 at 1st level, 15 at 5th level, and
20 at 9th level.
DRACONIC SCENT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication
Your sense of smell is uncanny, much like a dragon’s. You
gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. The GM might
double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or
halve the range if you’re upwind, at their discretion.
DRAGON ARCANA
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites ability to cast spells from spell slots, Dragon
Disciple Dedication
You’ve discovered how to add the magic of dragons to
your tradition. Add the draconic bloodline’s granted spells
to your spell list; you must still learn them or add them
to your repertoire as normal. These spells are shield, true
strike, resist energy, haste, spell immunity, chromatic
wall, dragon form, mask of terror, prismatic wall, and
overwhelming presence.
INSTINCT OF THE WYRM
The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon
disciple’s body and give them magical abilities, as reflected
in the archetype’s feats, but the mind often changes as
well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple’s normal
personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of
dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost
emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the
influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm
a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling
levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled,
it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.
Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of
compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more
focused on cooperation and might take on leadership
roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued
by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in
the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to
these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.
Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet
they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their
draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath
weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple
sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental
transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a
dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe
they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a
draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.

SCALES OF THE DRAGON
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication
Scales grow across your body, protecting you against physical
and magical threats. When you’re unarmored, the scales give

resistance from Dragon Disciple Dedication increases to 3 +
half your level.
BREATH OF THE DRAGON
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication
You can use a powerful breath weapon, much like the
dragon you emulate. You gain the dragon breath sorcerer

focus pool, increase your number of
Focus Points by 1.
SHAPE OF THE DRAGON FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication
You’ve discovered how to transform
yourself into a dragon. Once per day,
you can cast 7th-level dragon form as
an innate arcane spell, transforming into
your chosen type of dragon. The spell
automatically heightens to 8th level if
you’re 16th level and 9th level if you’re 18th level.
Any time you score a critical hit with an unarmed Strike
gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell’s breath
weapon immediately.
DISCIPLE’S BREATH [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication, dragon breath
sorcerer bloodline spell
You unleash your breath weapon without spending focus. This
has the effects of your dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell,
though it deals 9d6 damage instead of its usual damage, and
you don’t have to cast it or spend a Focus Point. You can’t use
Disciple’s Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
MIGHTY DRAGON SHAPE
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Shape of the Dragon
You’ve practiced and increased your draconic might,
allowing you to take your draconic form more often. You

Dual-Weapon Warrior
You’re able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons
simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a
storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the
best form of defense, and you leave little room for your
foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons.
Additional Feats: 6th Twin Parry (Core Rulebook 147);
12th Twin Riposte (Core Rulebook 151); 16th Improved
Twin Riposte (Core Rulebook 153), Two-Weapon Flurry
(Core Rulebook 153); 18th Twinned Defense (Core
Rulebook 153)
DUAL-WEAPON WARRIOR DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You’re exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the
Double Slice fighter feat (Core Rulebook 144). This serves as
Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
gain two other feats from the dual-weapon warrior archetype.
DUAL THROWER
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with
them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to
make a melee Strike, you can instead make a ranged Strike
with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are
wielding. Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed
melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed
ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.
DUAL-WEAPON RELOAD [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements You are wielding two one-handed weapons,
each in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload
while holding two weapons. You Interact to reload a one-handed
ranged weapon you’re holding. Unlike most Interact actions, you
don’t need a free hand to reload your ranged weapon in this way.
FLENSING SLICE [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements Your last action was a Double Slice, and both
attacks hit the target.
When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense
the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target
takes 1d8 persistent bleed damage per weapon damage die of
whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon
damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a major striking weapon). The
target becomes flat-footed, and its resistances to any
physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two
effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
DUAL-WEAPON BLITZ [two-actions]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
Requirements You are wielding two one-handed melee
weapons, each in a different hand.
You attack as you dash among foes. Stride up to your Speed. At
any point during this movement, you can Strike once with each
of the two required weapons. These Strikes can be against the
same or different targets, as you see fit.
DUAL ONSLAUGHT
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Dedication
When you lash out with both weapons, you
leave no room for the target to escape your
attack. When you use Double Slice, if you miss with both
Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the
effects of a hit with that weapon. You can’t choose
a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was
a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if
both attack rolls were critical failures.

Duelist
Across the world, students in martial academies practice
with their blades to master one-on-one combat. The
libraries of such schools hold deep troves of information
detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances,
and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain
admission to such schools might train in formalized
duels—and that’s certainly the more genteel route to
take. However, others assert that there’s no better place
to try out dueling techniques than in the life-and-death
struggles common to an adventurer’s life.
Additional Feats: 4th Dueling Parry (Core Rulebook
146); 8th Disarming Stance (Core Rulebook 147); 10th
Dueling Riposte (Core Rulebook 149); 12th Disarming
Twist (Core Rulebook 150); 14th Dueling Dance (Core

DUELIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in light armor and simple weapons
You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel,
no matter the circumstances. You gain the Quick Draw ranger
feat (Core Rulebook 172), enabling you to both draw and
attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw
for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
Special You cannot select another dedication feat
until you have gained two other feats from the duelist
archetype.
DUELIST’S CHALLENGE [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
OPEN
Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
Select one foe that you can see and proclaim a challenge. That
foe is your dueling opponent until they are defeated, flee, or
the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single
one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are
free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the Strike’s damage
equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals.
If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent,
you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the
number of damage dice your weapon deals.
SELFLESS PARRY
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Dueling Parry, Duelist Dedication
You protect those near you with a flash of steel. When
you’re benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to
you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have
Dueling Riposte, you can use it when an enemy within
your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally
adjacent to you, not just against yourself.
STUDENT OF THE DUELING ARTS
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Duelist Dedication
You have studied a great many combat techniques, which you
can review each day. During your daily preparations, you can
swap out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other
duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which you
are qualified. You can’t swap out Duelist Dedication or Student
of the Dueling Arts in this way.
In addition, you can enter a stance from a duelist archetype
feat you don’t have (such as one listed under Additional Feats)
by increasing the number of actions it takes to enter the
stance by 1 (typically to 2 actions). You must still meet the
feat’s prerequisites.

are among their number. Bolstering your athletic and
martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve
rare heights with the bow or crossbow—transforming
arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending
arrows zig-zagging nearly unerringly to their target,
and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even
instant death.
While having some spellcasting ability increases your
potential flexibility and power as an eldritch archer,
you might learn the secrets of these arts without being
independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning
the magic of the bow for its own sake.
Additional Feats: 20th Impossible Volley (Core
Rulebook 153)
ELDRITCH ARCHER DEDICATION
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
MAGICAL
Prerequisites expert in at least one type of bow
You blend magic with your archery, leading to
powerful results.
If you don’t already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to
cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You
gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from
a spell list of your choice. You choose this cantrip from the
common spells on your chosen spell list or from other spells to
which you have access on that list. This cantrip must require
a spell attack roll. You’re trained in spell attack rolls and spell
DCs for that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for these
spells is Charisma.
If you already cast spells from spell slots, you learn one
additional cantrip from that tradition. If you’re a prepared
caster, you can prepare this spell in addition to your usual
cantrips per day; if you’re a spontaneous caster, you add this
cantrip to your spell repertoire.
You also gain Eldritch Shot.
Eldritch Shot [three-actions] Requirements You are wielding a bow;
Effect You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast
and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do
not occur immediately but are imbued into the bow you’re
wielding. Make a Strike with that bow. Your spell flies with
the ammunition, using your attack roll result to determine
the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts
as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you
don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed
both attacks.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you have
gained two other feats from the eldritch archer archetype.
BASIC ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You gain the basic spellcasting benefits (page 150). Each time
you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a
spell of the appropriate spell level to your repertoire, either a
common spell of your chosen tradition or another spell of that
tradition you have learned or discovered.

ARCHETYPE
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your
ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.
Make a bow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional
2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes
stunned 1. The mental damage increases to 3d6 if your bow
has a greater striking rune, or to 4d6 if your bow has a major
striking rune.
MAGIC ARROW [free-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per round
You imbue your ammunition with eldritch power. When
you select this feat, choose three types of common magical
ammunition of 4th level or lower from the Core Rulebook (page
559) or this book (pages 256–259). Your GM might allow you
to choose from other types of magical ammunition, such as
uncommon ammunition, or ammunition from other books.
When using Magic Arrow, you transform a non-magical
arrow or bolt into a piece of ammunition of one type you
chose. You must shoot the ammunition before the end of
your turn or the magic dissipates. If the ammunition has an
Activate entry, you still need to spend the required actions
to activate the ammunition before shooting it. When you use
Magic Arrow, you can choose a type of magical ammunition
that is typically not available to the type of ammunition you’re
using—for example, you can use climbing bolt on an arrow,
even though that magical ammunition is normally only found
on bolts.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time
you do, select three additional types of ammunition as
described above.
PRECIOUS ARROW [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence
of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain
creatures’ weaknesses. Choose cold iron or silver; if you
shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as
that material. At 14th level, add adamantine to the list of
materials you can choose from.
EXPERT ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING

SEEKER ARROW [one-action]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles
to reach your target. Make a bow Strike against a foe you
can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around
corners. You ignore the target’s concealed condition and
all cover.
PHASE ARROW [one-action]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
CONJURATION
MAGICAL
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create
a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but
your target. Make a bow Strike against a foe who is observed
or hidden to you (but not undetected). The ammunition
travels to your target in a straight line, passing through
any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical
barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the
concealed condition, the hidden condition, and circumstance
bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit
creatures wearing any type of armor. The Strike’s damage
can’t be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a
non-magical shield.
ARROW OF DEATH [three-actions]
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in
a single potent hit. Make a bow Strike. On a hit, you deal an
additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the target
must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your
class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be immediately
slain; this save has the death and incapacitation traits.
MASTER ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting
You gain the master spellcasting benefits (page 150).
ELVEN ARROWS
The ability to infuse eldritch energy into bow shots
is often seen as a kind of elven magic. While it may
be true that elves first developed eldritch archery as
a martial art, and many eldritch archers are elves and
half-elves, other peoples have learned and developed
their own forms of eldritch archery.
Some whisper that remote regions to the south
have their own dedications that rely on elemental
archery, while the strange and shadowy hunters
of the Uskwood use a form that relies on tenebrous
shadow magic. Disturbing rumors circulate claiming
that devils have developed a diabolical form of magical
archery that can trap the soul and bind it to Hell, albeit
for a short time. Like any form of magic, the discipline
of eldritch archery will continue to develop among its
practitioners across the multiverse.

as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being
rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades
until the end. You gain a familiar (Core Rulebook 198). If you

one or more of the following abilities for other abilities
on this list: amphibious, burrower, climber, darkvision,
fast movement, manual dexterity, resistance (page
146), and scent. You can reselect only familiar abilities
you would normally be able to reselect each day, not
required familiar abilities for your familiar. You can’t

your familiar has (for instance, you can’t remove manual
dexterity if the familiar has lab assistant).

Herbalist
The plants around you can provide more remedies than the
finest hospital or temple, and you are skilled in their use.
HERBALIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Nature, Natural Medicine
You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain
the basic alchemy benefits (page 150), though they apply only
for herbal items: alchemical items with the healing trait, plus
antidote and antiplague. You gain batches of infused reagents per
day equal to your level or half your level if you didn’t make your
daily preparations in the wilderness. Your advanced alchemy
level for creating these is 1 and doesn’t increase on its own.
You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead
of Crafting to Craft herbal items. You don’t need to be trained in
Crafting or have the Alchemical Crafting feat to do so, and you
can use healer’s tools instead of alchemist’s tools.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you have
gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype.
FRESH INGREDIENTS
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, expert in Nature
When using Natural Medicine to Treat Wounds, you can spend
a batch of herbs to gain the +2 circumstance bonus from having
fresh ingredients, even if not in wilderness. If you spend a batch
of herbs in wilderness, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead.
POULTICE PREPARATION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication
When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a
poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains
alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested
traits. You can apply a poultice by Interacting with one hand.
When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal
effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to
recover from a single source of persistent acid, bleed, or fire
damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
ENDEMIC HERBS
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, trained in Survival
During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants
endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can
spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item
you create with your herbalism. The benefit of the special herbs
affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is
not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This
adjustment counts as an additive (Core Rulebook 75), so you
can’t include another additive without spoiling the item.
• Aquatic Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
• Arctic For 1 hour, treat environmental cold effects as if they
were one step less severe.
• Desert For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if
they were one step less severe.
• Forest Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against
disease and poison effects.

gained two other feats from the horizon walker archetype.
ACCLIMATIZATION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Horizon
Walker Dedication
Your time spent in the hostile parts of the world
has inured you to extreme climates. In your favored terrain,
you gain resistance equal to half your level to all environmental
damage and are affected by temperature effects as though
they were one step less severe (incredible heat or cold becomes
extreme, extreme heat or cold becomes severe, and so on).

your favored terrain, they too treat temperature effects as one
step less severe.

checks to Fly in windy conditions, and so forth.
PERPETUAL SCOUT
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Horizon Walker Dedication
You spot anything out of place in the areas you know
best. While in your favored terrain, you always gain
the benefits of the Scout exploration activity,

gain these benefits in any terrain.
MAGICAL ADAPTATION
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE

When an obstacle bars your path, you pull a trick from your
sleeve to overcome it. You can cast darkvision, spider climb,

WILD STRIDER
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Horizon Walker Dedication
Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the
ranger’s wild stride class feature. This allows you to ignore
the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater
difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you
an additional benefit from Favored Terrain based on
the terrain.

Linguist
Whether you study to further your own ambitions or
simply out of fascination with the intricacies of language,
your way with words is unparalleled.
LINGUIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites You speak at least three languages.
You have studied languages and their development. You
become trained in Society; if you were already trained in
Society, you instead become an expert in Society. You gain the
Multilingual skill feat twice.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you

MULTILINGUAL CIPHER
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE

take a –2 circumstance penalty unless they speak all
the languages you used when you created
the writing.
PHONETIC TRAINING
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Linguist Dedication,
expert in Society
You can pronounce and repeat
words with near-perfect accuracy
even if you don’t understand their
meaning, and you can write them
down in a phonetic script that allows
you or another creature with
Phonetic Training to read it
later. Even if the words are in
a language with sound you
can’t pronounce, you can
faithfully transcribe them.
Memorizing long sequences
of words remains just as
difficult as it is normally.
SPOT TRANSLATE [reaction]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
LINGUISTIC
Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Trigger Another creature within 60
feet uses a linguistic effect in a
language you understand.
You interpret a creature’s words,
repeating their message in a
different language that you know. If
the triggering effect’s targets speak
either the original language or the one
you translated into, they are affected.
ANALYZE IDIOLECT
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, expert in Deception and
Society
You break down a specific individual’s idiolect, memorizing their
speech mannerisms and habits. If you interact with someone
for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to Impersonate
that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your
Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study
required, you can’t remember more than one idiolect at a time.
READ SHIBBOLETHS
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
LINGUISTIC
SKILL
Prerequisites Linguist Dedication, master in Society
All communication is filled with slight tells and signals. If you
interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional
words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you
with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their
hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of
this ability is being deceptive about their social environment,
such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must
attempt a Deception, Society, or appropriate Lore check against
your Society DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent
with their assumed identity on a success.
Once you’ve gleaned one or more true minor facts
about a person, you can then incorporate these
mannerisms into your speech to present yourself
in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1
circumstance bonus to your Diplomacy and Deception
checks with them.
CRUDE COMMUNICATION
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Linguist Dedication
Even if you don’t speak a creature’s
language, you can rely on inflection,
root words, and body language to infer
rudimentary meaning. If you interact with
a creature for at least 10 minutes and
that creature can speak a language,
the GM rolls a secret Society check
with a DC appropriate for the
language’s rarity. On a success,
you understand the gist of the meaning
and can communicate basic concepts
back to the creature; on a failure,
you are mistaken or communicate
incorrect concepts. If you’re
legendary in Society, you can
communicate instantly without
needing to attempt a Society check;
even if you didn’t know the medium
of communication the creature uses
(speech, sign language, and so on),
you intuit this information as soon as
they try to communicate.

Loremaster
Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that
power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure
some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions. You
specialize in secrets, both uncovering them and hiding
them away, and your command of the written word
borders on the supernatural. As you discover deeper secrets
of lore, you might develop a power over knowledge that
becomes outright magical, allowing you to understand
and disguise information even more effectively.
Additional Feats: 4th Loremaster’s Etude (Core
Rulebook 100); 8th Assured Knowledge (page 113);

expert proficiency in Loremaster
Lore, but you can’t increase your
proficiency rank in Loremaster Lore
by any other means. You can take
feats in the loremaster’s additional
feats entry even if you don’t meet
the enigma muse prerequisite.

required skill.
QUICK STUDY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Loremaster Dedication
During your daily preparations, you can study a particular
subject to gain the trained proficiency rank in one Lore skill
of your choice. You must have interacted with that subject
in some way on the previous day, whether by reading
about it, talking to someone knowledgeable on the topic,
or experiencing it yourself. Alternatively, you can reference
your notes to instead choose a Lore skill you’ve prepared
before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you
prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t
use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent
character option like a feat.
GREATER MAGICAL EDIFICATION
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Magical Edification
You’ve continued to expand your compendium of tools to
compile knowledge. You can cast comprehend language,
mindlink, and secret page as innate occult spells, each once
per day. When you cast secret page, it is automatically
heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from

Marshal
Marshals are leaders, first and foremost. Marshals
can come from any class or background, though they
all share a willingness to sacrifice their own glory for
the greater good of the team. Some marshals lead from
the front, sword and shield raised, while others may
call instructions and encouragements from the rear
while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support.
Regardless of their preferred method of combat,
marshals’ ability to bring the best out in every ally is a
valuable addition to any group.

emanation, and it grants you and allies a status bonus to

of the unarmed attack or weapon you are wielding that
has the most weapon damage dice. When you or an ally in
the aura critically hits an enemy with a Strike, that enemy

You give a quick shout, hoping to shake the fog clouding
your ally’s thoughts. Choose one target ally within your
marshal’s aura who is affected by a mental effect that
allowed a Will save and has a duration of no longer than 1
minute. That ally can immediately attempt a Will save with
a +1 circumstance bonus against the effect’s DC, ending
the effect on a success. This can’t end the effect for any
creatures other than your target ally. Regardless of the
result of the save, your ally is temporarily immune to Snap

TACTICAL CADENCE
FEAT 14

Martial Artist
You have trained in the martial arts, making your unarmed
strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor enlightenment,
and you don’t view this training as some greater path to
wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist striking flesh, the hand
turning aside the blade, and the devastating kick taking
your enemy down. Your training is focused and practical,
and since you have turned every part of your body into a
weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you
might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school
focused on training the body, you might just as easily have
learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining
instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination.

GRIEVOUS BLOW [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
FLOURISH
Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication
You know how to deliver focused, powerful blows that bypass
your enemies’ resistances. Make an unarmed melee Strike.
This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple
attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal two extra weapon
damage dice. If you are at least 18th level, increase this to
three extra weapon damage dice.
This attack also ignores an amount of resistance to
physical damage, or to a specific physical damage
type, equal to your level.

the chosen square, Strike that foe with the required weapon.
Then attempt to Trip every foe in the chosen square plus each
square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip’s requirement that
you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your
multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until

You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. Stride,
then use one of the following: Battle Medicine or Treat Poison. You
can spend a second action to instead Stride and then Administer
First Aid or Treat a Condition (if you have it; see below).
TREAT CONDITION [two-actions]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
HEALING
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites Medic Dedication
Requirements You are holding healer’s tools, or you are wearing
them and have a hand free.
You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the
clumsy, enfeebled, or sickened condition. If a creature has
multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a
counteract check against the condition, using your
Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the
condition’s source to determine the DC. You can’t treat
a condition that came from an artifact or effect above
20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if
you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating
a Condition that is continually applied under certain
circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a
good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has
no effect as long as the circumstances continue.
Critical Success Reduce the condition value by 2.
Success Reduce the condition value by 1.
Critical Failure Increase the condition value by 1.
HOLISTIC CARE
FEAT 6

SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy, Treat Condition
You provide emotional and spiritual care.
Add frightened, stupefied, and stunned

a hand free. Also, the target’s body
is mostly intact.
You can use Medicine to resuscitate the
dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check to
revive a dead creature that has been dead for
no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to
life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded
condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it
wasn’t wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the
target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.

Pirate
You live a life of freedom, taking by force and intimidation
all that you desire. You may be a privateer, raiding and
plundering on behalf of a particular nation or another
authority, or you may answer to no one but your own
capricious whims. Either way, you rely on intimidation,
wits, and combat prowess to take what you want from
those you deem less deserving.
Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers,
and many pirates have the swashbuckler class (page 82)
or archetype (page 153). Much like a swashbuckler’s
daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often
showy feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain
panache. For example, if you have the panache class
feature and your Acrobatics check for a Boarding
Assault exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you
would gain panache.
PIRATE DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to
plunder. You become trained in Sailing Lore, or become
an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the
effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by
a ship’s movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding
Assault action.
Boarding Assault [two-actions] (flourish) Either Stride twice or
attempt an Acrobatics check (DC determined by the
GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice
your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat
or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a
melee Strike that deals one additional weapon damage die.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype.
PIRATE WEAPON TRAINING
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You’re particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate
weapons. You become trained with the following weapons:
hatchet, rapier, scimitar, and whip. Whenever you gain a class
feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with
a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency
rank for these weapons.
ROPE RUNNER
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics and Athletics, Pirate
Dedication
You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily
as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only
on ship’s rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at
an Athletics check to Climb a rope or an Acrobatics check
to Balance on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You
aren’t flat-footed while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.
WALK THE PLANK [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pirate Dedication
You frighten a foe into moving where you want them,
traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to
Demoralize an opponent; this check gains the incapacitation
trait. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can
also force the target to Stride up to its Speed. You choose the
path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the
Plank action. You can’t force the target to move into a harmful
space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions,
or similar) unless the result of your check to Demoralize was a
critical success. The target then becomes temporarily immune
to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.

Poisoner
People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the
glories of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes
the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone, suitably
powdered, causes hallucinations and delirium. The sap
of a tree inflicts such pain that death seems preferable.
You are a student of such dark wonders, making you a
dangerous foe indeed.

POISONER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You make a point of always having a few toxins near at
hand—you never know when some arsenic or the like might
prove useful. You gain the basic alchemy benefits (page 150),
though they can be used only for alchemical poisons. You
gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level.
Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and
doesn’t increase on its own.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you have
gained at least two other feats from the poisoner archetype.
POISONER’S TWIST [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, trained in Medicine
Requirements Your last action was a successful melee Strike
that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a
poison, and you know which poison.
Poisons attack specific parts of the body—one venom might
target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another
deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage
of such weaknesses. You deal 1d6 damage of the required
Strike’s damage type and 1d6 poison damage to the target. If
you’re at least 18th level, you deal 2d6 damage of each type.
EXPERT POISONER
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, expert in Crafting
Your advanced alchemy level for poison increases to your
level – 3.
POISON COAT [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Trigger A creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee
unarmed Strike.
Requirements You have prepared your clothing to poison
attackers (see below).
In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines,
such that even touching them is deadly. To use this reaction,
you must have brushed poison onto your clothing or woven
sharp poisoned needles into the garment’s fabric. This takes
10 minutes and uses one dose of contact or injury poison. You
can have only one such poison suffused into your clothing at
a time.
When you use this reaction, the triggering creature is
exposed to the suffused poison.
ACQUIRED TOLERANCE [reaction]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
FORTUNE
Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication
Trigger You fail a save against a poison.
A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can
help the body build up a resistance against a more deadly
dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the
second result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance,
you can continue to use it against the same type
of poison that day, but you can’t use it against
a different type of poison until after you make
your next daily preparations. For instance, if
you used the reaction on a save against giant
scorpion venom, you could use it again against giant
scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but
you couldn’t use it against nettleweed residue, lich dust, or
another poison.

Ritualist
While some learn the art of ritual casting through rigorous
study, other gifted individuals may find that a combination
of natural talent and luck gives them surprising skill at
performing rituals, whether they want that power or not.
RITUALIST DEDICATION
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to
perform a ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals with a level
no higher than half your level; you must meet all prerequisites
for casting the ritual to choose it. At 8th level and every 4
levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual with a
level no higher than half your level and for which you meet
the prerequisites. You can cast these as the primary caster,
but you can’t teach them to anyone else or allow someone else
to serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the ritualist archetype. If you retrain
out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it.
FLEXIBLE RITUALIST
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you cast
a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1.
When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary
caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed
by that secondary caster. You can’t replace a secondary caster
who is the target of the spell (as in the atone ritual).
RESOURCEFUL RITUALIST
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just
beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual
that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master
proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary
proficiency if you are a master.
EFFICIENT RITUALS
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication
You can perform some rituals in less time. If the
ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast
it in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast
it in half the number of days, rounded up.
ASSURED RITUALIST
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Flexible Ritualist
You can cover for a secondary caster’s error. If
you are the primary caster, after rolling all the
secondary checks, choose one check on which the
secondary caster rolled a failure or critical failure, and treat the
result as one degree of success better.
SPEEDY RITUALS
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Efficient Rituals
You can perform rituals in only a fraction of the usual time. If
a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in
an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than
8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal
for a ritual.

Scout
You’re an expert in espionage and reconnaissance,
able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather
intelligence, sneak through enemy lines to report to
your comrades, or suddenly and decisively strike your
foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you
and your companions and keep you all on guard when
you’re approaching danger.

SCOUT DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Stealth and Survival
You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your
allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the Scout’s
Warning ranger feat (Core Rulebook 172). When you’re
using the Scout exploration activity, you grant your allies a
+2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a
+1 circumstance bonus.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the scout archetype.
SCOUT’S CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
FLOURISH
Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your
opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. Stride,
Feint against that opponent, and then make a Strike against
that foe. For your Feint, you can attempt a Stealth check
instead of the Deception check that’s usually required,
because you use the terrain around you to catch your
foe off-guard.
TERRAIN SCOUT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Scout Dedication
You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat (Core Rulebook 267)
twice, choosing a different terrain each time. If you Avoid

allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat
you have.

You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. Stride
up to your Speed, then Strike twice. If you were hidden
or unnoticed by the target of these Strikes, your foe is
flat-footed against both attacks. Your multiple attack
penalty applies normally for both attacks.

Scroll Trickster
Magic has long been written down, and in myriad
forms. From the classic rolled parchment to strings tied
with a hundred intricate knots, from baked clay tablets
covered with incisions to bound collections of bamboo
slips, magic is everywhere. You just need to know how
to read it.
SCROLL TRICKSTER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or
Religion
You’ve studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a
comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of
education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls
and try not to explode anything you didn’t mean to explode.
You gain the Trick Magic Item feat (Core Rulebook 268), and
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick
scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item
that’s a scroll, you get a failure instead.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat
until you have gained two other feats from the scroll
trickster archetype.
BASIC SCROLL CACHE
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll
scraps, riddled with errors and misspellings and
leaking energy like a sieve. With enough care, you
can coax these scroll scraps into functioning—briefly.
Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a
single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell. The spell
must be a common spell from the Core Rulebook, or another
spell you learned via Learn a Spell, and it must come from a
tradition in which you have the corresponding skill trained.
This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its
magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you
haven’t already used it. It can’t be used to Learn the Spell.
At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a
2nd-level spell.
SKIM SCROLL [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication
You can activate the magic of a scroll with a cursory read
as you draw it from your belt. You Interact to draw forth a
scroll, then use Trick Magic Item on the scroll.
EXPERT SCROLL CACHE
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Basic Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection is more powerful. In addition to your
daily scrolls from Basic Scroll Cache, add a scroll with a
3rd-level spell. At 14th level, add a scroll with a 4th-level
spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a 5th-level spell.
MASTER SCROLL CACHE
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Expert Scroll Cache
Your scroll collection is incredible,
brimming with eldritch power,
and you can prepare far more
of them than an ordinary scroll
trickster. In addition to your
daily scrolls from the Basic
and Expert Scroll Caches, add
a single scroll with a 6th-level
spell. At 20th level, add a
scroll with a 7th-level spell.

Scrounger
You have spent countless hours disassembling and
rebuilding complex items to learn how they work,
giving you the skill to create just about anything from
the most unlikely materials. While your improvised
items don’t last long, they tend to be just what you need
in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might
be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you
that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate
situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and
the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use
to improvise your own solution.
SCROUNGER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can Craft items even without appropriate tools or a
workshop, though you take a –2 item penalty to your
Crafting check. Additionally, you don’t need a physical
formula book to remember all of your formulas; you pay
the same cost as normal to learn them, but you memorize
them all.
You can Craft temporary items out of anything, anywhere,
with whatever materials happen to be on hand, spending
only 10 minutes to perform the initial Crafting check. The
temporary item must be common, non-magical, 1st level or
lower, and must be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable
piece of adventuring gear (nonconsumable adventuring gear
appears on Table 6–9 on page 288 of the Core Rulebook).
Instead of a single item, you can create 10 pieces of a single
type of ammunition. This is a shoddy item, but you don’t take
the normal penalty when using shoddy items you made using
this feat. Your temporary item lasts for 1d4 hours before
falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number
of hours secretly. You can create only the physical item, not
any information or magic, so for example, while you could
create a blank journal or one of random pages, you couldn’t
use it as a scholarly journal or a religious text.
You can incorporate any materials or items that you have
on hand, even if they’re not the type of materials that would
ordinarily be used to Craft a given item, though you must have
enough volume of material to make the item you want. Unless
all the materials you used were an appropriate type to make
the item, you take a –5 penalty to the Crafting check (or a –10
penalty if the materials you used were particularly unsuitable,
as determined by the GM).
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the scrounger archetype.
REVERSE ENGINEERING
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Crafting, Scrounger Dedication
You are able to reverse engineer items into formulas
more effectively than most. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to Crafting checks to reverse engineer a formula
from an item. Additionally, if you get a critical success on
your Crafting check, you can opt to not only create the
formula but also reassemble the original item at the same
time, leaving you with the formula and the item instead of
the formula and raw materials equal to half the item’s value.
HIGH-QUALITY SCROUNGER
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication
When you Craft a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication,
it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item must still
be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring
gear). You can instead Craft it for someone else’s use, allowing
them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item
when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you
use it.
EXPERT DISASSEMBLY
FEAT 7

objects to disable them. You can use Crafting instead of
Thievery to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock.

Sentinel
Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and
as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you
have made it your business to get the most out of your
defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in
the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens,
your solid defenses will safely get you, and possibly
your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might
be a member of an order of knights or bodyguards that
trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor.
On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who
took one too many scrapes and decided that enough was
enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate
you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers
have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase
their survivability.
Additional Feats: 10th Sacrifice Armor (page 120);
16th Greater Interpose (page 121)
SENTINEL DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You have trained carefully to maximize the protective
qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor
and medium armor. If you already were trained in light armor
and medium armor, you gain training in heavy armor as well.
Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or
greater proficiency in any type of armor (but not unarmored
defense), you also gain that proficiency in the armor types
granted to you by this feat. If you are at least 13th level and
you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency in
unarmored defense, you also become an expert in the armor
types granted to you by this feat.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the sentinel archetype.
STEEL SKIN

ARMORED REBUFF [reaction]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication
Trigger An adjacent foe critically fails an attack roll to Strike
you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.
Requirements You are wearing medium armor or heavier.
You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your
foe. Attempt an Athletics check to Shove the triggering foe,
even if you don’t have a hand free. If you succeed, you can’t
Stride to follow the foe, as you’re knocking the foe back with
the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.
MIGHTY BULWARK

SHADOW POWER
FEAT 14

You can focus the shadows into a powerful blast. You can cast
shadow blast (Core Rulebook 367) as an innate occult spell
once per day. Its level is always 1 level lower than the level
of your shadowdancer focus spells. You become an expert in
occult spell attack rolls and DCs.
SHADOW MASTER
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication
The shadows protect you better than any armor can, and they
give you power to plunge others into darkness. Whenever you
are in an area of dim light or darkness, you gain resistance 5
to all damage except force and damage from Strikes with the
Shadowdancer
Shadow has always been the cousin of fear. Within the
darkness, monsters dwell, plans are hatched, and enemies
strike with fang and dagger and dark magic. But some
embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance
within its shifting dark.
A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge
of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness,
shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and
emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship
with the dark for good, while others embrace the
primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal.
Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the
shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn,
gradually transforming them into something inky,
nebulous, and mysterious.
Additional Feats: 10th Uncanny Dodge (Core Rulebook
229); 14th Spring from the Shadows (Core Rulebook
188); 16th Sense the Unseen (Core Rulebook 188); 18th
Cognitive Loophole (Core Rulebook 188)
SHADOWDANCER DEDICATION
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites master in Stealth, expert in Performance
You dedicate yourself to the shadows. Your coloring becomes
gray and gloomy, your senses adjust to the darkness, and
you can sneak through darkness with ease. You gain greater
darkvision. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth
checks when you are within dim light or darkness.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the shadowdancer archetype.
SHADOW SNEAK ATTACK
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication
You gain the sneak attack class feature (Core Rulebook 181),
except you deal 1d6 precision damage regardless of your level.
Sneak attack from multiple sources isn’t cumulative. If you
have sneak attack from more than one source, use only the
highest number of dice when you sneak attack rather than
adding the amounts together.
SHADOW MAGIC
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication
You gain the ability to fuse and play with shadows by
using focus spells specific to shadowdancers. You learn a
shadowdancer focus spell of your choice: dance of darkness
(page 191) or shadow jump (page 191). If you don’t already
have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you
can Refocus by meditating within an area of dim light or
darkness. The rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of
the Core Rulebook.
Shadowdancer focus spells are occult spells. You become
trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your
spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma.
CALL OF SHADOWS
The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a
myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear—fear of the dark,
fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety
and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many
potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in
their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the
mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true
calling becomes more lucid and more compelling.
In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder
setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax,
organizations search for and recruit those called by
the shadows, eager to transform them into spies
and assassins. But the call can come to any creature
anywhere. It’s just a question of whether the creature
heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows.
Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise,
given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working
for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically
evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but
not without its champions for good and even law, though it
is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between.

DANCE OF DARKNESS
FOCUS 5
DARKNESS
EVOCATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration varies
You dance, Striding up to half your Speed. At either the start or
end of your Stride, you create an area of magical darkness in a
10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with
magical darkness that works the same way as that created
by a darkness spell of the same level. When you create the
darkness, attempt a Performance check to
dance, with a standard DC for your level, to
determine the duration of the darkness.
Critical Success 1 minute
Success 2 rounds
Failure 1 round
SHADOW ILLUSION
FOCUS 6
AUDITORY
ILLUSION
SHADOW
VISUAL
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet
Duration sustained
You create a shadowy illusion of a
creature or a stationary object, but the
illusion can exist only in an area of dim light
or darkness. The spell ends if the illusion is
ever out of an area of dim light or darkness. If the
illusion is an object, it must fit within a 20-foot burst,
and the creature can be of any size up to Gargantuan,
filling a 20-foot-by-20-foot space.
The object or creature appears to animate
naturally; it even generates the appropriate
sounds and smells, and feels believable to the
touch, though its coloring is always muted.
If the illusion is a creature, shadow
illusion has the effects of an illusory
creature spell of the same level,
except it deals 2d8 damage plus
your spellcasting ability modifier,
instead of the amount listed in
illusory creature.
Heighten (+2) The area that an illusory
object can fit in increases by 10 feet.
The damage of the illusory creature’s
Strike increases by 1d8.
SHADOW JUMP
FOCUS 5
CONJURATION
SHADOW
TELEPORTATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements You are
in dim light or darkness.
Range 120 feet
You instantly transport yourself from one shadow to another.
Teleport yourself and any items you’re wearing and holding
from your current space to a clear space you can see that’s in
dim light or darkness and within range. You can transport your
familiar with this spell, but if shadow jump would bring any
other creature with you—even if you’re carrying the creature in
an extradimensional container—the spell is disrupted.
Heightened (8th) When you arrive at your destination, you can
become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you are
no longer in an area of dim light or darkness, whichever comes
first. The invisibility is an illusion effect.

Snarecrafter
You’re able to take ordinary materials and use them to
create deadly snares, special traps that you can rig up
quickly when the situation demands. While traps might
grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than
weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair.
Instead, when a battle takes place at a location of your
choice, you have a major advantage thanks to your
well-placed snares. Once your foes come to realize that
you may have trapped any location on the battlefield, their
fear of walking into another trap can help you corral them
toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make
them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place.
Additional Feats: 8th Quick Snares (Core Rulebook
173); 10th Powerful Snares (Core Rulebook 174); 14th
Lightning Snares (Core Rulebook 175)
SNARECRAFTER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Crafting, Snare Crafting
You’ve learned to create a limited number of snares at
no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can
prepare four snares from your formula book for quick
deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to Craft, you can
Craft them with 3 Interact actions. The number of snares
increases to six if you’re a master in Crafting and eight if
you’re legendary. Snares prepared in this way don’t cost you
any resources to Craft.
Special The feat counts as Snare Specialist for the purpose
of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist
ranger feat, the quick snares from both feats are cumulative.
You can’t select another dedication feat until you have
gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype.
SURPRISE SNARE [three-actions]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
MANIPULATION
Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment
in a space that’s occupied by an opponent. It must be a
snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to Craft. The
snare automatically triggers, but it takes a –2 circumstance
penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls
or other checks the snare attempts.
REMOTE TRIGGER
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You’ve learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating
ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing
you to disarm enemies’ snares harmlessly. You can Strike
a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare,
you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a
ranged Strike against the Crafting DC, triggering the snare
only if you hit.
GIANT SNARE
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication
You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making
it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares.
When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can
prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes
up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick
deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature
entering any portion of its area, and all its
effects apply over the full area.
PLENTIFUL SNARES FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites
Snarecrafter
Dedication
You can prepare incredible
numbers of snares each day
out of simple ingredients.
Double the number of
prepared snares granted by
Snarecrafter Dedication.

Talisman Dabbler
The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard, poring
over a crumbling book of spells. But magic is so much
more than that—it is thought, will, and action, and with
the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword
a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical
talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make
and use the perfect talismans for any job.
TALISMAN DABBLER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical
paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal
classroom or been an agglomeration of folk magic picked up
over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas for
all common talismans in the Core Rulebook of your level or
lower. You remember talisman formulas and
don’t need a formula book for them.
Additionally, you carry a collection of
magical baubles you can turn into temporary
talismans. Each day during your daily
preparations, you can make two talismans
with an item level no higher than half your
level. You must know each talisman’s formula.
A talisman created this way is a temporary
item and loses its magic the next time you
make your daily preparations if you haven’t
already used it.
Finally, when you Affix a Talisman, you can
(in any combination) affix or remove up to four
talismans in the 10-minute span.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you have gained two other feats from the talisman
dabbler archetype.
QUICK FIX
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and
some string. You gain the Rapid Affixture skill feat
(page 208), even if you don’t meet the prerequisites.
When you use it, you can affix or remove up to
four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one.
You gain the ability to Affix a Talisman as
a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level,
regardless of your Crafting proficiency.
DEEPER DABBLER
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
With some streamlining to your process and a deeper
collection of talisman materials, you make a greater number of
talismans every day. You can create two additional talismans
during your daily preparations.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are
14th level or higher.
TALISMANIC SAGE
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication
You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors
have ever known. Normally, affixing more than one talisman
to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when
you Affix a Talisman, you can specially treat one item you’re
working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once.
This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat
a new item for this ability.

Vigilante
As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and
a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions
from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure
and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the
civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose—
fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos—your
vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and
a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip.
Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Pathfinder Core
Rulebook 172)
VIGILANTE DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Deception
You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment,
and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of
society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning
warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really
are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can
be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance,
you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the
other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts
to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action
to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC,
as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception
DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier
instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don’t
have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone
to conceal your other identity—a check happens only if
someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.
Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute
and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this
process involves both physical changes such as clothing and
makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects
that change your appearance don’t reduce the time required
to change identities.
Your two identities are completely distinct. You have
your current identity’s alignment for effects that rely on
alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require
a certain alignment (such as a cleric’s deity) only if both of
your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about
one of your identities don’t reveal information about the
other unless the person attempting the check knows both
identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based
on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work
only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to
detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn’t exist.
To maintain the separation between your identities, some
of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante.
You can use social feats only while in your social identity.
Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your
vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity
risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were
particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat,
your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your
identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of
Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can
otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either
identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You
can use feats that don’t have either trait regardless of your
current identity.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype.
HIDDEN MAGIC
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion;
Vigilante Dedication
You’ve learned to hide the magical auras of your gear.
During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any
or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects
adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.
A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed
at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see
through your obfuscations.
MINION GUISE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
SOCIAL
Prerequisites animal companion or familiar, expert in
Deception, Vigilante Dedication
When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a
social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other
minion you gained from a class feature. When changing
to your social identity, you also change your minion’s
appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its
type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or
disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding
your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it
gained from your class features or feats while in this social
identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.
SAFE HOUSE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
You establish a safe house—a secure space in which to
hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house
is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It’s in a location you
have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or
structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The
safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical
detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your
Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level
rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving
your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the
safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you’re an expert
in Deception, eight cubes if you’re a master, and 16 cubes if
you’re legendary.
SOCIAL PURVIEW
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
Advanced Player's Guide
196
196

PAGE 198
================================================================================

You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity.
Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for.
You gain that archetype’s dedication feat and can select feats
from that archetype, even if you haven’t yet gained enough
feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication
feat. These feats become part of your social identity and
gain the social trait—for instance, a fighter vigilante could
take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social
identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn’t
risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your
vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.
STARTLING APPEARANCE [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
EMOTION
FEAR
MENTAL
VIGILANTE
Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication
Requirements You are completely unnoticed by the target
creature.
You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.
Make a Strike against your target. That creature is flat-footed
against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target
remains flat-footed for the rest of your turn and is frightened
1 (frightened 2 on a critical hit).
QUICK CHANGE
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication
You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead
of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can
now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary
in Deception, you can perform this change as a
1-action activity.
SUBJECTIVE TRUTH
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Deception, Vigilante
Dedication
Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that
detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point
of view of your current identity, you can say it even under
effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth.
MANY GUISES
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication
You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever
you change your identity, instead of taking on your social
or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely
ordinary. This identity isn’t a specific individual—rather,
you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any
gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation
such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and
abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity,
rather than either of your two real identities, unless they
succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC.
You can’t use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while
in this identity.
FRIGHTENING APPEARANCE
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
VIGILANTE
Prerequisites expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance
Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When
you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to
Demoralize each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were
unnoticed before your Strike.
STUNNING APPEARANCE
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
VIGILANTE
Prerequisites Startling Appearance
Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond.
When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe’s level is equal
to or lower than yours, they are also stunned 1 on a hit, or
stunned 2 on a critical hit.

Viking
To go “a-viking” is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have
spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very
communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel
in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard
their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call
it, the “whale-road”) to ambush coastal communities. Once
they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering
all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in
their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.
Additional Feats: 4th Reactive Shield (Core Rulebook
145); 6th Shielded Stride (Core Rulebook 146); 10th Quick
Shield Block (Core Rulebook 149)
VIKING DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from
their boats at a moment’s notice, charge through the surf, and
take their enemies by storm. You’re trained in Sailing Lore.
When moving through water using your land Speed, you
ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in
bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your
Athletics check to Swim, you get a critical success instead.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the viking archetype.
HURLING CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Viking Dedication
You make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon you already
have in your hand, Stride, and then Interact to draw another
weapon. If you are raging, you can add the additional damage
with melee weapons you receive from raging to your damage
with the thrown weapon.
VIKING WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Viking Dedication
From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional
viking weapons, and you soon learned to handle them in
battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows.
You are trained with the battle axe, hatchet, longsword, and
shortsword. In addition, you gain the Shield Block reaction.
VIKING WEAPON SPECIALIST
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Viking Weapon Familiarity
You are even more skilled in the weapons of your
people. You gain the critical specialization effects of
the battle axe, hatchet, longsword, and shortsword.
Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you
expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons,
you also gain that proficiency rank in the above
four weapons.
SECOND SHIELD [free-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Viking Dedication
Trigger Your Shield Block causes your shield to break or
be destroyed.
You’re used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle,
and you’re prepared to use a backup or any convenient
nearby object to defend yourself. You can Interact to draw
a shield on your person or an unattended shield within
your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could
serve as an improvised shield—for example, a table or chair—
you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if
something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield
isn’t raised until you use the Raise a Shield action, as normal.

Weapon Improviser
As far as you’re concerned, the best weapon to wield
is the one that your opponents never see coming. By
knowing how to fight effectively with whatever’s at hand,
you ensure that you’re never caught unarmed, and you
often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly think
they’ve caught you off guard.
Whether you’re smashing someone over the head with
a bar stool, tossing a mug of ale in their face to blind
them, or stabbing your foes with a broken
bottle, you can find weapons anywhere
and employ them creatively whenever
a fight breaks out. Because you
fight with disposable weapons,
you don’t need to be as careful
with your weapons as other
warriors do, and you can
break them when needed to
win a fight without feeling
any regrets later.
WEAPON IMPROVISER
DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in all martial
weapons
You don’t take the normal –2 penalty to attack
rolls with improvised weapons. Additionally,
whenever you gain a class feature that grants
you expert or greater proficiency with any
weapon, you also gain that proficiency with
improvised weapons.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat
until you have gained two other feats from the
weapon improviser archetype.
IMPROVISED PUMMEL [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
Requirements
You
are
wielding
an
improvised weapon.
You make a Strike with your wielded
improvised weapon. You gain a +1 item
bonus to the attack roll, and the Strike deals
two weapon damage dice if it would have dealt
fewer. If the attack is a critical hit, in addition to
the effect of the critical hit, the improvised weapon
breaks. If the item has a Hardness greater than your
level, or if it’s an artifact, cursed item, or
other item that’s difficult to break or destroy,
the item doesn’t break and the attack is a hit
instead of a critical hit.
At 12th level, your item bonus to the attack roll increases
to +2 instead of +1, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three
weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer, instead
of two.
SURPRISE STRIKE
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
Whenever you make a Strike with an improvised weapon
against a creature that hasn’t seen you make a Strike using
an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of your
skill with improvised weapons, the creature is flat-footed
against you for that Strike.
IMPROVISED CRITICAL
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication
You can apply critical specialization effects to
improvised weapons you wield. For any given
improvised weapon, the GM determines which
critical specialization effect is most applicable,
based on the type of object it is.
MAKESHIFT STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites
Improviser
Weapon
Dedication
You quickly snatch up whatever’s
nearby and then attack with it as
an improvised weapon. You Interact
to pick up a nearby object you could use as an
improvised weapon. It must be located at around
your chest level, such as a mug on a table, rather
than an object on the floor. You then either
Strike or make an Improvised Pummel
with the improvised weapon.
SHATTERING STRIKE [reaction]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Improvised Pummel
Trigger An improvised weapon
that you are wielding becomes
broken as a result of a critical
success on an Improvised
Pummel.
The improvised weapon shatters,
destroying it completely but dealing an
additional 3d6 piercing damage to the
creature you hit with the Improvised
Pummel. This extra damage you apply
on the critical hit doesn’t double from
the critical hit, as normal.
IMPROVISED WEAPON IDEAS
Cavern: broken stalagmites, large
mushrooms, old bones
Docks: barrel, crate, hook
Forest: branch, needles or thorns
Market: box, fruit, scale, sign
Noble Court: gavel, goblet, quill, lectern
