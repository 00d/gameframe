INTRODUCTION
Pathfinder is a game of imagination where you can bring nearly any idea to life. The Core
Rulebook provides classic options to play a countless variety of customizable characters.
This book expands those core options, giving you even more ways to play the character
you want!
More of Everything
The Advanced Player’s Guide expands upon the options
for player characters provided in the Pathfinder Core
Rulebook. Along with the new ancestries and classes
summarized on the following page, there are also expanded
rules for the existing ancestries and classes. Following
these new options is an entire chapter of new archetypes,
including multiclass archetypes for the four new classes as
well as a huge selection of archetypes suitable for any
character. New backgrounds, additional general feats
and skill feats, and a bevy of new spells, equipment, and
treasure round out your character’s adventuring kit.
How to Use This Book
The options in this book expand upon the rules
contained in the Core Rulebook, and that book is
required to use the Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide.
Some rules of this book indicate other material found
in this book with page references. Other products
referencing the rules in this book may do so using the
superscript citation “APG.”
ACCESS ENTRIES
Sometimes, a stat block for an uncommon rules element
includes an Access entry that lists specific criteria. A
character who meets the criteria listed in the Access
entry, such as hailing from a particular locale or being
a member of a particular organization, gains access to
the rules element. For instance, a draconic bloodline
sorcerer gains access to the dragon disciple archetype
(page 168), even though the archetype is uncommon.
As always, the GM has the final say on who can
access uncommon or rarer options, or whether specific
options are allowed in the game at all. They may decide
that a character’s upbringing or abilities make sense for
a specific rules option and grant them access even if the
character doesn’t automatically qualify, or they may
decide that same option can’t be taken by anyone at all.

This chapter expands your starting character options from those in the Core
Rulebook, including each of the following sections.
Ancestries
Expand beyond the populous ancestries found in the Core Rulebook. The
ancestry entry format is described on page 33 of the Core Rulebook.
• Catfolk (page 8), or amurruns, are humanoid felines who believe they were
created to protect the wilderness from great danger.
• Kobolds (page 12) are small reptiles connected to dragons and fond of traps.
• Orcs (page 16) are warlike and honest people who respect strength,
toughness, and survival above all.
• Ratfolk (page 20), or ysoki, pack into tight spaces and are markedly
industrious and fastidious.
• Tengus (page 24) are corvid-like humanoids with an affinity for blades
and the rumored mystical ability to absorb bad luck.
Versatile Heritages
While the Core Rulebook presented heritages as subgroups of a particular
ancestry, certain heritages can occur across all ancestries. For instance, if your
mother was a hag, you could be a changeling whether you’re a human, orc, or
catfolk. Rules for versatile heritages are found on page 28.
• Changelings (page 30) are the children of hags, left as foundlings and
subject to the danger of their mother’s tempting call.
• Dhampirs (page 32) are part vampires due to an early connection to
vampire blood.
• Planar Scions (page 34) are descended from a distant planar ancestor or
tied strongly to another plane. This book details the celestial aasimars,
psychopomp-tied duskwalkers, and fiendish tieflings.
Ancestry Options
New heritages and ancestry feats expand on the Core Rulebook ancestries.
• Dwarves (page 42)
• Elves (page 43)
• Gnomes (page 44)
• Goblins (page 45)
• Halflings (page 46)
• Humans (page 47)
Backgrounds
This chapter contains new backgrounds for characters from all walks of
life, from bandits to teachers. This section also includes a set of special rare
backgrounds that you and your GM might agree to use in a campaign.
• Common Backgrounds (page 48)
• Rare Backgrounds (page 50)
