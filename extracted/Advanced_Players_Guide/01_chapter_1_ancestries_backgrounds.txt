# Chapter 1: ANCESTRIES & BACKGROUNDS
# Pages: 9-54

CHAPTER 1:
ANCESTRIES & BACKGROUNDS
Your character’s ancestry and background tell the story of who you were before you
became an adventurer, as well as who you might strive to become one day. But not
everyone fits neatly into the most common ancestries or backgrounds. You might be a
birdlike tengu, a scaled kobold, or a curious catfolk, with a one-of-a-kind background in
your story. Perhaps your ancestry has mixed with the blood of angels or demons. Only
you can decide!
UNCOMMON ANCESTRIES
AND HERITAGES
Each new ancestry in this book is
uncommon. Though uncommon
elements of the game are usually
acquired during play, you choose your
ancestry and heritage at the beginning
of the game. This means you should
talk to your group and GM about
which uncommon ancestries and
heritages make sense for the story.
In the piratical Shackles, tengus are a
regular sight. But they’re even more
common in the eastern continent of
Tian Xia, where halflings and dwarves
are uncommon! Even if your chosen
ancestry isn’t particularly common
in the area where the story takes
place, most times you can work
with your GM and the other players
to find a great way to incorporate
that character into the narrative.
For these options, the uncommon
trait just means you should take
that extra step to talk about it first.
In a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the
accompanying player’s guide might
include information about additional
uncommon options that make sense
for that story and its region and grant
you automatic access to play them
during those adventures.
RARE AND UNIQUE BACKGROUNDS
Some backgrounds have enough story
weight that you need to work with
the rest of your group to determine if
they’re right for a particular story, like
being heir to a throne. You can find
more information about these special
backgrounds on page 50.

CATFOLK
Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine features of felines and humanoids in
both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales
and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as
chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the
face of overwhelming opposition.
Catfolk are outgoing, active humanoids who delight in
discovery, whether of hidden ruins or a comfortable place
to nap. They are exceptionally social, both within their
tight-knit communities and with other creatures they meet.
Remarkably brave, catfolk see themselves as guardians
of the world against forces that would assail it, and they
believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and
continual self-improvement aid them in this fight.
Catfolk have fast reflexes and are even able to twist
themselves in the air while falling to land on their feet. As
quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers,
shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant.
Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when
pleased and growl when surprised or angry.
If you want a character who is curious, brave, friendly,
and nimble in body and mind, you should play a catfolk.
YOU MIGHT...
• Demonstrate genuine interest by asking a lot of
enthusiastic questions.
• Avoid interpersonal conflict by giving someone a
cold shoulder or by simply leaving the area.
• Carefully scout a target or problem before
striking at it quickly.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Think you monopolize conversations
with
your
incessant
queries
or
opinions.
•  Consider you haughty or prideful.
•  Ascribe more emotion than you
feel to your involuntary purrs or
growling.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Although all catfolk walk upright and
have soft fur, a long tail, large ears, and
vertical pupils, they show at least as much
variety as ordinary felines. Catfolk have
nimble fingers with short claws that are usually
retractable. Most catfolk take great pride in maintaining
their appearance and rarely suffer the indignity of being
wet or dirty if they can avoid it.
Catfolk mature quickly and are able to walk at only
a few months old, but they otherwise start their careers
at roughly the same age as humans do and live to be
60 or 70 years of age. Catfolk are rarely taller than the

average human and, because of their lean builds, almost never weigh as
much as a human of similar height.
SOCIETY
Catfolk call themselves amurruns, although many consider this name to be
private. They raise their children in large extended families, where they are
given what many other humanoids see as a distressing latitude to explore and
get into trouble from a remarkably young age. Catfolk learn a trade in a loose
apprenticeship, and the majority learn several trades over their lives.
Catfolk societies are often led by an appointed leader who speaks on behalf
of the community and mediates disputes. A catfolk leader is most often a
spellcaster and usually female. Catfolk prefer to deal with grievances by
making an elaborate showing of disinterest, or even leaving a community for
a time so the problem can die away or work itself out.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Catfolk aren’t a particularly religious people, but most do believe they were
uplifted from great primeval cats to confront the evil abominations despoiling
natural places and laboring to unmake reality. The gods blessed catfolk with
language, the use of tools and weapons, and a strong sense of community.
Most catfolk are good. They enjoy the freedom to travel and like to set their
own paths in life, so more catfolk are chaotic than lawful. Religious catfolk
most often practice a nebulous form of animism, appeasing the spirits of the
land and the creatures they hunt to preserve the natural order.
NAMES
Catfolk are given short names in their youth. Adolescent catfolk are free
to choose a different name when they first leave home, though some
simply keep the name they’ve gotten used to. Catfolk love to add titles and
honorifics to their names. Some catfolk use their titles exclusively among
non-catfolk, and so become known by epithets like Six Fates, Fiend Killer,
or Mistcloak.
Sample NameS
Alyara, Crinto, Drewan, Espes, Ferrus, Gerran, Halhat, Hoya, Ruun, Sevastin,
Tespa, Yonsol, Zakkar, Zathra
Catfolk Heritages
Catfolk have ancestors as varied as any felines. Choose one of the following
catfolk heritages at 1st level.
CLAWED CATFOLK
Your family has particularly long, sharp claws capable of delivering bleeding
wounds with a wicked swipe. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6
slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile,
finesse, and unarmed traits.
HUNTING CATFOLK
You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a
particularly keen sense of smell. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30
feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s
location, as explained on page 465 of the Core Rulebook. The GM will usually
double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if
you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Track a creature or object
if you’ve smelled it before.

JUNGLE CATFOLK
You’re descended from jungle stalkers and can move
swiftly through scrub and underbrush. You ignore
difficult terrain from undergrowth, and greater difficult
terrain from undergrowth is only difficult terrain for you.
NINE LIVES CATFOLK
Your family has always seemed to bounce back from
disaster, not through physical hardiness or specialized
skill, but from sheer luck. Other catfolk whisper that you
have nine lives. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a

of dying 2.

CATFOLK ADVENTURERS
Catfolk delight in venturing into
unexplored areas, whether untrammeled
wildernesses or ancient dungeons.
They like finding treasures and
baubles, but for most catfolk, the
experience of the journey itself is the
true reward.
Typical catfolk backgrounds include
acrobat, artist, gambler, hunter, nomad,
and scout from the Core Rulebook, plus
bandit, courier, insurgent, outrider, and
root worker from this book. Catfolk’s
inherent curiosity and agility mean they
excel as swashbucklers, bards, fighters,
and rogues. Their love of the natural
world and drive to puzzle out secrets
of all types leads many to become
investigators, druids, or sorcerers.

================================================================================

Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded
warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them
as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic
reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and
nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their
secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface
settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring
life, or validating awe from followers of their own.
If you want a character with oversized confidence,
deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing
through their veins, you should play a kobold.
YOU MIGHT...
• Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you
believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.
• Analyze your surroundings, always looking for
ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.
KOBOLD
Every kobold knows that their slight frame belies true, mighty draconic power. They are
ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their
territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of
a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove
happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to their benefit, combining caution
and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.
• Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics,
whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume that you are cowardly and won’t stick around
in the face of danger.
• Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness,
especially when it comes to building defenses.
• Consider your claims of draconic power to be
overblown, delusional, or endearing.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids
with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant
draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more
draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth,
or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They
mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and
living to about 60.
The color of a kobold’s scales can vary widely. Most
often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic
dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that
create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched
kobolds often reflect the community’s draconic exemplar
(page 13), whether that’s the dragon they currently serve
or the dragon type from which they’re descended.
SOCIETY
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps
them alive. They’re secretive or subservient around
powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims.
This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a
formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source
of supernatural power (like an artifact or
sorcerous leader). They often achieve
an unshakable fervor and loyalty to
their new cause or leader. However,
kobolds are infamous for sensing a
proverbial sinking ship, and once
their source of power fails
or seems doomed, their
morale breaks swiftly.
Whether led by a
dragon or not, kobolds
almost
always
identify
themselves with a type of

you have, using the Draconic
Exemplars table.
dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt
laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar’s personality.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and
rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful
neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.
Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity
assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar’s
order or Shelyn’s artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and
other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also
common subjects of worship (for more about these two deities, see Pathfinder
Lost Omens Gods and Magic page 130). Kobolds also often find themselves
drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.
NAMES
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as
they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables
to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have
surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they
typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.
Sample NameS
Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka,
Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz
Kobold Heritages
Proud, opportunistic, and crafty, kobolds manifest draconic power and
diminutive tenacity. Choose one of the following kobold heritages at 1st level.
CAVERN KOBOLD
You hatched into a warren among narrow tunnels and countless kin. Your
body is flexible. When Climbing rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone
features, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical
success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have Quick Climb).
This doesn’t affect you if you’re using a climb Speed. If you roll a success on an
Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.
DRAGONSCALED KOBOLD
Your scales are especially colorful, possessing some of the same resistance a
dragon possesses. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1)
to the damage type associated with your draconic exemplar (see Table 1–1).
Double this resistance against dragons’ Breath Weapons.

attacker is then immune to your Cringe for 24 hours.
DRAGON’S PRESENCE
FEAT 1

As a member of dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence
(that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes).
When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear
effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure

threat. You attempt to Feint against a creature. Unlike a normal Feint, the creature can
be within 30 feet instead of in your melee reach, and you make your check against its
Will DC instead of its Perception DC.
SNARE GENIUS
FEAT 5
KOBOLD
Prerequisites expert in Crafting, Snare Crafting
Your expertise makes your snares more powerful, and you can place them quickly
and efficiently. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare three snares
from your formula book for quick deployment; if the snare normally takes 1 minute to
Craft, you can Craft it with 3 Interact actions. Snares prepared in this way don’t cost
you any resources to Craft. The number of snares you can prepare this way increases
to four if you are a master in Crafting, and to five if you are legendary.
When you Craft and deploy a snare that deals damage, any creature that critically
fails its saving throw against the snare’s initial effect and takes damage becomes
flat-footed until the end of its next turn.

KOBOLD
Your inborn arcane power manifests as your exemplar’s
most time-honored spells. Choose one 1st-level spell and one
2nd-level spell from those listed for a dragon spellcaster of your
draconic exemplar’s type, as presented on pages 104–126 of the
Bestiary (such as alarm, blur, invisibility, and true strike for a black
dragon exemplar). You can cast each of these spells once per day as arcane
innate spells. You gain the trained proficiency rank in arcane spell attack rolls
and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
DRAGON’S BREATH
FEAT 9
KOBOLD
Prerequisites Kobold Breath
You can put more effort into your Kobold Breath to channel greater draconic power,
though it takes more out of you. When you use Kobold Breath, you can increase the

draconic exemplar’s type, as on pages 104–126 of the Bestiary (such
as paralyze and stinking cloud for a black dragon exemplar). You can
cast each of these spells once per day as arcane innate spells.
KOBOLD ADVENTURERS
Kobolds often adventure in pursuit

they feel befit their disproportionately
large egos. When adventurers, militias,

community, the survivors often latch

solace—and sometimes revenge.
Typical kobold backgrounds include
artisan, artist, criminal, hunter,
miner, scout, and tinker from the
Core Rulebook, plus bandit, cultist,
scavenger, and servant from this
book. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers,
rogues, and sorcerers, though they
also often channel their ingenuity as
alchemists or wizards.

ORC
Orcs are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born.
As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength
against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community
for dominance or raiding a neighboring settlement. Many orcs seek glory as soon as they
can walk and carry a blade or club, taming wild beasts or hunting deadly monsters.
Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other
communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those
who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn
that an orc’s fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc
barbarians, fighters, and rangers are prized as gladiators
and mercenaries. While some human settlements might
be hesitant to accept an entire orc community into their
midst, a small handful of orc mercenaries can do the job of
an entire squad of human conscripts, so long as the orcs are
well fed and well paid. Though the belief that orcs are only
suited for battle is pervasive among other humanoids, the
harsh orc mentality comes from a long history of conflict
rather than a lack of ability in other areas.
Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the
challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the
most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and
great triumphs command immense respect.
If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and
excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.
YOU MIGHT...
• Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a
physical contest.
• Believe that lies and treachery are for those who lack
the strength to seize what they want.
• View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a
mundane death from old age or illness.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• See you as violent or lacking in discipline.
• Underestimate your intellect, cunning, and knowledge.
• Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and
stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though
they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances
and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination
makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level
with most humanoids while simultaneously towering
over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-
hard muscles, making them suited to war and other
physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of
their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great
pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color
is typically green and occasionally gray, though some
orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to
their environments.
Orcs consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin
attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful orc makes

the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived.
Similarly, many orcs consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than
smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many orcs also
find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a
significant amount of skin.
SOCIETY
Most orc communities define themselves through two things: pain and glory.
Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with
stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg
draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield.
Power in an orc hold comes from strength or family lineage. The structure
tends to be feudal, with weaker orcs working at the behest of the strong. The
Hold of Belkzen is the largest such society, and power changes hands there
quickly. One mighty orc dying in battle can shake up an entire power structure,
leading to squabbling and duels to decide control. Many orcs who tire of being
subservient split off to form their own warbands, traveling to new territory.
Young orcs are typically raised by the entire community. Indeed, it would
be almost impossible for orcs to raise their young any other way, since twins,
triplets, and even quadruplets are quite common in orc families, as are deaths
among orcs in their child-rearing years. Many orc holds conduct ceremonies
when a young orc comes of age, typically around their tenth or eleventh
birthday, during which the new adults are told what their role in the hold will
be. For communities that practice ritual scarification or tattooing, this is often
when the young orcs receive their first hold-scar or tattoo as well.
Orcs fear very little, but most distrust magic. Magic is seen as a tool that
bypasses the physical and allows the weak to contend with the strong, a belief
that runs at odds with orc values. While they respect the physical might of
Gorumite warpriests, and even druids who take on the forms of great beasts,
they find arcane and occult magic questionable at best and unethical on the
whole. All but the most depraved orc communities see necromancy as a foul art
that steals glory from the dead, and their growing struggles against the undead
have given them newfound common ground with their humanoid neighbors.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
A common orc saying is, “You are the scars that shape you.” Violent, chaotic
lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend heavily toward chaotic
alignments. Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug are all commonly worshiped
among orc communities, though less violent holds worship nature deities like
Gozreh or gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all
hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.
While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among
orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and
so their own deities are targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds
teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc
deities for a place amid the pantheon. Most orcs don’t waste their dying moments
praising the divine or praying for a place in the afterlife, but spitting a blood-
flecked warning at their deities, promising a new challenger through broken teeth.
NAMES
Orcs have a harsh, guttural language, and their naming conventions are no
exception. Many orc names are simply the Orcish word for a particularly
desirable trait, such as great strength, height, or ferocity. Orcs commonly
use either their hold name or a name referencing a particularly memorable
accomplishment as their surname.

Orc Heritages
Orcs have a long history on the surface of the world,
and a far longer history underground. Their hardy
physiques and demanding lifestyles have led to various
adaptations. Choose one of the following orc heritages
at 1st level.
BADLANDS ORC
You come from sun-scorched badlands, where long legs
and an ability to withstand the elements helped you
thrive. You can Hustle twice as long while exploring
before you have to stop, and you treat environmental
heat effects as if they were one step less extreme
(incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes
severe, and so on).
DEEP ORC
Your calloused hands and red eyes speak to a life spent
in the deep darkness of mountain caverns, where you
learned to battle on rocky cliffs and survive with minimal
resources. You gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat for
underground terrain and the Combat Climber skill feat.
HOLD-SCARRED ORC
You are part of an orc community that participates in
ritual scarification or tattooing. The marks on your skin
show your exceptional hardiness and vitality. You gain 12
Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 10. You also gain
the Diehard feat.
RAINFALL ORC
You were born in a rain forest with only tangles of trees
providing protection from torrential rainstorms and flash
floods. You’ve learned to move adeptly through jungle
terrain and resist the various ailments common in humid
environs. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics
checks to Climb or Swim and a +1 circumstance bonus to
saving throws against diseases.
Orc Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th level). As an orc, you can select from
among the following ancestry feats, plus the feats with the
orc trait listed in the Half-Orc Ancestry Feats section on
page 59 of the Core Rulebook.
1ST LEVEL
BEAST TRAINER
FEAT 1
ORC
You have an impressive innate ability to tame and command
ferocious beasts. You become trained in the Nature skill and
gain the Train Animal skill feat.
IRON FISTS
FEAT 1
ORC
Your fists have been forged by battle, your naturally tough
skin and dense bone further hardened by conflict. Your fist
unarmed attacks no longer have the nonlethal trait and gain
the shove weapon trait.
ORC LORE
FEAT 1
ORC
The hold elders taught you your people’s histories, told tales
of great athletic feats, and shared with you the hardships your
ancestors endured so that you can pass this wisdom down
to future generations. You become trained in Athletics and
Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one
of those skills (from your background or class, for example),
you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also
become trained in Orc Lore.
TUSKS
FEAT 1
ORC
You have particularly long, jagged tusks perfect for tearing
meat from bone. You gain a tusks unarmed attack that deals
1d6 piercing damage. Your tusks are in the brawling group and
have the finesse and unarmed traits.

can’t retrain into this feat. You can retrain out of this feat only
through drastic measures such as breaking or filing your tusks.
5TH LEVEL
ATHLETIC MIGHT

mobility. Whenever you roll a success on an Athletics check to
Climb or Swim, you get a critical success instead.
BLOODY BLOWS
FEAT 5
ORC
Your lethal unarmed attacks leave bloody gouges or cause
severe internal bleeding. When you critically hit with a Strike
using an unarmed attack that isn’t nonlethal, the target takes
1d4 persistent bleed damage. This can be because you’re
taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because
you have an unarmed attack without the nonlethal trait due to
Iron Fists, Tusks, or a similar ability.
HOLD MARK
FEAT 5
ORC
You bear scars or tattoos enhanced by the mark of your
community’s prowess. When you select this feat, choose one
of the options on the following page. When you critically hit

ORC ADVENTURERS
An orc’s drive to overcome challenges
and prove themself spurs many orcs
to become adventurers, though orcs
are more likely to set out on their
own or with other orcs than alongside
adventurers of other ancestries.
Common orc backgrounds include
gladiator, hunter, martial disciple, nomad,
and warrior from the Core Rulebook,
plus bandit, outrider, and refugee from
this book. Orcs thrive in martial classes
like barbarian and fighter.

own blood. Animal companions or bonded animals
you have gain the Orc Ferocity feat, and they gain
a reaction they can use only for Orc Ferocity. If you

companions or bonded animals you have also gain the
benefits of that feat when using the Orc Ferocity reaction.
SPELL DEVOURER
FEAT 13
ORC

Most surface-dwelling humanoids call ysoki “ratfolk” and
know them as a communal people who prefer cramped
conditions, with up to 100 individuals living in a given
house. If they can’t find homes in town, ysoki may instead
live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great
storage for the many and varied goods they bring back
from trading expeditions.
Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on
the road in merchant caravans. They’re good with their
hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the
ordinary, from threats to treasures. They’re also inveterate
hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds
and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed
away in preparation for some future emergency.
If you want a character who is smart, fast, well-traveled,
and adaptable, try playing a ysoki!
RATFOLK
Ysoki—as ratfolk call themselves—are a clever, adaptable, and fastidious ancestry who
happily crowd their large families into the smallest of living spaces.
YOU MIGHT...
• Have pride in your large extended family, and stay in
contact with everyone in it.
• Like to travel near and far in search of new
experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way.
• Work well with others.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Mistake you for a wererat or another monster.
• Are surprised by your careful grooming and other
fastidious habits.
• Think you’re crowding them and invading their
personal space.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless
tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black
fur. A common ysoki is 4 feet tall and weighs around
80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a
single family group can exhibit substantial variation in
hair color, eye color, or size.
Instinct
drives
ysoki
to
maintain
cleanliness, though this is also reinforced
through their strong social structures.
Other condescending humanoids often
presume ratfolk are dirty or diseased, but
in actuality, they are meticulous about
personal hygiene. Because their appearance
is often considered unnatural—and other
people mistake them for wererats—ysoki often
conceal their physical features with hoods,
gloves, shoes, long-sleeved tunics, robes, and
other layers of clothing when moving through
spaces dominated by other ancestries.
SOCIETY
Ysoki culture values cooperation and community.
Every ysoki learns—through communal games, social
occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and
connections with ysoki outside their family. You may
never know whose help you’re going to need, but when
you do, you’re going to need it now.
With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers,
ysoki travel frequently from one town to another. Their
wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a
dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally
large giant rats; many ysoki can speak to such animals.
Discrimination against ysoki has shaped their culture,
prompting them to rely on each other and strengthening
their family and communal bonds. Ysoki are very good

at differentiating between bad actors and those who are simply acting out of
ignorance, modeling good behavior and slowly working to reverse generations
of discrimination for those willing to learn. They are always on the lookout
for members of other ancestries who don’t judge them for their appearance,
embracing these individuals as true friends and welcoming them into their
communities. But they also can quickly spot determined bigots prone to violence
and steer clear of such individuals, minimizing any opportunity for tragedy.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Ysoki care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil.
Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they
also obey strict social codes. Most ysoki are neutral.
Though ysoki revere their ancestors and tend to acknowledge whatever
deity is prevalent in their local area, Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki
culture. Grandmother Rat, as she is sometimes known, embodies many things
that are otherwise antithetical to ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own
interests above others, and she encourages deceit and trickery. To most ysoki,
Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those things ratfolk need done, but which no
reasonable ratfolk would wish to do. For more information about Lao Shu Po,
see page 132 of Lost Omens Gods and Magic.
NAMES
Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down
from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative
nicknames. A grandfather might be Grivver, for example, while his daughter
goes by Griva and her son is simply Griv. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames
and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most ysoki find these
names distasteful and endure them only when outside ysoki communities.
Sample NameS
Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak,
Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess
Ratfolk Heritages
Ysoki are native to underground regions, but they are a highly adaptable
ancestry that has been found in almost every environment. Choose one of the
following ratfolk heritages at 1st level.
DEEP RAT
Your ancestors lived deeper underground than other ratfolk, granting you the
ability to see in the dark. You gain darkvision.
DESERT RAT
You are native to arid plains and likely grew up traveling the roads. You have
a leaner build than other ratfolk, with longer limbs and short fur. If you have
both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you, and
you can go 10 times as long as normal before you are affected by starvation or
thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental
cold effects are one step more extreme for you.
LONGSNOUT RAT
The long snouts that run in your family give you a keener sense of smell than
most ratfolk. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you
can use your sense of smell to determine a creature’s location, as explained
on page 465 of the Core Rulebook. The GM will usually double the range if

you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if
you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks to Seek a creature or object within the
range of your scent.
SEWER RAT
You come from a long line of ysoki from a community
based in the sewers beneath a large settlement. You are
immune to the disease filth fever. Each of your successful
saving throws against a disease or poison reduces its stage
by 2, or by 1 for a virulent disease or poison. Each critical
success against an ongoing disease or poison reduces its
stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent disease or poison.
SHADOW RAT
Your ancestors lived in dark spaces underground, granting
you dark fur and a vaguely unnatural mien that unnerves
sapient creatures and frightens animals. You gain the trained
proficiency rank in Intimidation and can use Intimidation
to Coerce animals. When you Demoralize an animal, you
don’t take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If
you would automatically become trained in Intimidation
(from your background or class, for example), you become
trained in another skill of your choice.
Animals’ attitudes toward you begin one degree worse
than normal, usually starting at unfriendly instead of
indifferent for domesticated animals, and hostile instead
of unfriendly for wild animals.
Ratfolk Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a ysoki, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
CHEEK POUCHES
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
Your cheeks are stretchy, and you can store up to four items of
light Bulk or less in these cheek pouches. None of these items
can have a dimension longer than 1 foot. As long as you have at
least one item in your cheek pouches, your speech is noticeably
difficult to understand. Placing an item in your cheek pouch or
retrieving one is an Interact action. You can empty your mouth
with a single action, causing everything you had stored in your
cheek pouches to fall to the ground in your square.
PACK RAT
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
Years of packing for travel have taught you how to cram vast
quantities into small spaces. You can fit an additional 50%
of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers
or vehicles. For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack,
or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn’t alter the items’ Bulk, nor
does it change how much you can store in a magical or
extradimensional storage space, such as a bag of holding.
RAT FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
You have a pet rat that has become magically bonded to you.
You gain a familiar using the rules on page 217 of the Core
Rulebook, and this familiar must be a rat. It still gets the
benefits of familiar abilities, but its base form remains a rat.
RATFOLK LORE
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
Years of experience among ratfolk communities have made
you nimble, and you’ve learned to run and hide when enemies
threaten. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics
and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one
of those skills (from your background or class, for example),
you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also
become trained in Ratfolk Lore.
RATSPEAK
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
To you, the squeaking of rats and other rodents makes a
strange kind of sense. You can ask questions of, receive
answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with rodents,
including beavers, mice, porcupines, rats, and squirrels,
but not with other mammals, such as dogs or bats. The GM
determines which animals count as rodents.
TINKERING FINGERS
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
You’re good with your hands and can quickly improvise a fix
for broken or damaged equipment. You’re trained in Crafting.
If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice. You can Repair an item without
using a repair kit without taking the –2 circumstance penalty,
improvising tools from whatever you have at hand.
VICIOUS INCISORS
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
You’ve let your incisors grow long enough to serve as
formidable weapons. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that
deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling
group and have the finesse and unarmed traits. Unlike most
creatures, you can file down your teeth and regrow them later
on, enabling you to select this feat at any level, and to retrain
into and out of this feat.
WARREN NAVIGATOR
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
You’re particularly good at solving mazes and navigating twists
and turns. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Survival.
If you would automatically become trained in Survival (from
your background or class, for example), you become trained
in another skill of your choice. When you Sense Direction or

LAB RAT
FEAT 5
RATFOLK
You’ve spent more than your share of time in an alchemy lab. You might have been an
alchemist yourself, an assistant, or perhaps even a test subject. Either way, you have
been exposed to a wide variety of alchemical poisons and elixirs, leaving you with
increased tolerance of their effects. You have a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against
poison and harmful effects from elixirs. If you roll a success on your saving throw
against an elixir or poison, you get a critical success instead.
QUICK STOW [free-action]
FEAT 5
RATFOLK
Prerequisites Cheek Pouches
Frequency once per round
You are adept at quickly moving items into your cheek pouches. You Interact to
store one held item in your cheek pouches (provided it fits).
RAT MAGIC
FEAT 5
There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages for you. You can
cast animal messenger once per day as a primal innate spell. When you do, the
animal that responds is always a rat. If there are no rats within
range, the spell is lost.

four items of Light Bulk in your cheek pouches, you can store up to 1
Bulk worth of items. The maximum size of a given item is unchanged.

FEAT 9
RATFOLK
Your physiology is slight, and you can pack into small spaces with others of
similar stature. As long as you are Small, you can end your movement in
the same square as a Small ally. Only two creatures total can share the
same space when using this ability or a similar one.
RAT FORM [one-action]
FEAT 9
CONCENTRATE POLYMORPH PRIMAL
RATFOLK
TRANSMUTATION
You can transform into an innocuous-looking rat to scout an

form of a Tiny rat.
13TH LEVEL
WARREN DIGGER
FEAT 13
RATFOLK
You’ve learned to put your sturdy claws to work digging
through the earth. You gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet.
RATFOLK ADVENTURERS
Ratfolk might take up the adventuring
life to explore and travel, to defend
their family or community, or for any
number of other reasons.
Their natural wit and nimble fingers
make ratfolk excellent alchemists and
rogues, while some specialize in ranged
weapons as fighters or rangers.
Typical ratfolk backgrounds include
animal whisperer, artisan, merchant,
medic, nomad, scout, and tinker from
the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, barber,
scavenger, and teacher from this book.

TENGU
Tengus are a gregarious and resourceful people that have spread far and wide from their
ancestral home in Tian Xia, collecting and combining whatever innovations and traditions
they happen across with those from their own long history.
Tengus are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at
home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense
cities. They accumulate knowledge, tools, and companions,
adding them to their collection as they travel.
The tengu diaspora has spread across Golarion in search
of a better life, bringing their skill with blade crafting to
lands far from their home. In maritime regions, tengus
notably work as fishers, blacksmiths, and “jinx eaters”—
members of ships’ crews who are believed, accurately
or otherwise, to absorb misfortune. Having lived in a
variety of conditions and locations, tengus tend to be
nonjudgmental, especially with regard to social station,
though their willingness to associate with lawbreakers has
often led some to look at them with suspicion.
If you want to play a character hailing from a rich
history of artisanship and tradition, but who happily
picks up new practices, companions, words, and items as
needed, you should play a tengu.
YOU MIGHT...
• Be gregarious and eager to find a flock of your own.
• Voraciously absorb the practices of those around you,
sometimes even forgetting where they came from.
• Be willing to take on any task or job, no matter
what others think.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Look to you as a source of eclectic skills and
knowledge, especially relating to languages.
•  Get confused by your simultaneous respect for and
disregard of tradition.
•  Have trouble reading your expressions or regard
you with suspicion and superstition.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Tengus have many avian characteristics. Their faces
are tipped with sharp beaks and their scaled forearms
and lower legs end in talons. As closed footwear
tends to fit poorly unless custom made, many
tengus wear open sandals or simply go barefoot.
Tengus are rarely more than 5 feet tall, and they
are even lighter than their smaller frames would
suggest, as they have hollow bones. A small number
of tengus have vestigial wings incapable of true flight.
Tengus hatch from eggs and are featherless for their first
year of life, during which they rarely leave home. They
soon grow a downy gray coat, which is replaced by a dark
covering of adult feathers by the time they come of age at
around 15 years. Tengus use their shed feathers in a variety
of tools, from simple writing quills to magical fans to focus
their ancestral magic. Many tengus modify their appearance
by dyeing patterns into their feathers or talons, which
amplifies their body language and has the added benefit of
aiding other humanoids in understanding their expressions.
SOCIETY
Tengus are extremely social, banding together in extended
communities with many families living in adjacent houses

and sharing the work of the household. In cities, a community may also contain
members of other ancestries. Tengu children raised in the same unit consider each
other siblings, usually forgetting which of them share a biological connection.
The greatest divide in tengu society is between tengus remaining in their
ancestral home and those who have dispersed across the world. Tengus refer
to these two groups as those “in the roost” and those “migrating,” respectively.
Roosted tengus tend to be more traditionalist and conservative and are especially
concerned with preserving their culture in the face of years of erosion from
oppression. Migrating tengus, on the other hand, voraciously absorb the culture
of the various nations and settlements that they now call home.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Tengus often follow the faith of the region in which they were raised, though the
tengu ancestral deity is the storm god Hei Feng. This god’s notorious drunken
carousing and emotional swings causes many tengus to instead focus their
attention on gods of freedom and travel, such as Desna or Cayden Cailean, or
deities of nature, such as Gozreh. Besmara is also a common subject of tengu
worship, especially among tengus who live on the sea. More about Besmara
and Hei Feng can be found in Lost Omens Gods and Magic (pages 55 and 63).
Before their diaspora, tengus practiced a syncretic faith that blended a
polytheistic worship of the deities responsible for creating the natural world.
As tengu folklore posits that tengus long ago descended from the night sky
on shooting stars to rest upon Golarion’s highest peaks, animist rites were
practiced on mountains and other great natural features. Even today, tengus
rarely differentiate between divine and primal worship.
Tengus are far more concerned with the balance between traditionalism and
adaptability than they are with good and evil, with lawful tengus more common
among the roosted and chaotic tengus more common among the migratory.
NAMES
Though roosted tengus tend toward more traditional names with the hard
consonants often seen in the Tengu language, migrating tengus’ tendency to
readily absorb and repurpose the culture of those around them has led to names
that combine elements of whatever languages suited the namer’s fancy.
Sample NameS
Arkkak, Chuko, Dolgra, Dorodara, Kakkariel, Kora, Marrak, Mossarah,
Pularrka, Rarorel, Ruk, Tak-Tak, Tsukotarra
Tengu Heritages
As a fluid people scattered from their original homes, there are a wide variety
of tengus on Golarion. Choose one of the following tengu heritages at 1st level.
JINXED TENGU
Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now, they slide off your
feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or misfortune
effect, you get a critical success instead. When you would gain the doomed
condition, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, reduce the value of the
doomed condition you would gain by 1.
MOUNTAINKEEPER TENGU
You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits
of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the disrupt undead cantrip
as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to
half your level rounded up. Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage or
ancestry feat, you can decide whether it’s a divine or primal spell.

SKYBORN TENGU
Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare
tengu with wings, or your connection to the spirits of
wind and sky might be stronger than most, slowing
your descent through the air. You take no damage from
falling, regardless of the distance you fall.
STORMTOSSED TENGU
Whether due to a blessing from Hei Feng or hatching
from your egg during a squall, you are resistant to
storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to half your
level (minimum 1). You automatically succeed at the flat
check to target a concealed creature if that creature is
concealed only by rain or fog.
TALONED TENGU
Your talons are every bit as sharp and strong as your
beak. You gain a talons unarmed attack that deals 1d4
slashing damage. Your talons are in the brawling group
and have the agile, finesse, unarmed, and versatile
piercing traits.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a tengu, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
SCAVENGER’S SEARCH
FEAT 1
TENGU
You’re always on the lookout for supplies and valuables. Each
time you use the Seek action to search for objects (including
secret doors and hazards), you can search for objects in your

15-foot-by-15-foot area, rather than a single adjacent
10-foot-by-10-foot area.
SQUAWK! [reaction]
FEAT 1
TENGU
Trigger You critically fail a Deception, Diplomacy, or
Intimidation check against a creature that doesn’t have the
tengu trait.
You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake
some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux
pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a
critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
STORM’S LASH
FEAT 1
TENGU
Wind and lightning have always been close friends to you.
You can cast the electric arc cantrip as a primal innate spell at
will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your

TENGU
You learned skills for surviving in the place where your

for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice. You also become trained in Tengu Lore.
TENGU WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
TENGU
You’ve trained with a blade and other tengu weapons ever
since you hatched. You gain access to khakkaras (page 248).
Additionally, choose two weapons from the sword group.
You can choose from among all common martial swords, plus
the katana, temple sword, and wakizashi (page 248). For
the purpose of determining your proficiency, that weapon
is a simple weapon, and if the weapon isn’t common, you
gain access to it. If you are trained in all martial weapons,
you add common advanced swords to the swords you can
choose from.

================================================================================

Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages. Some
are born to unusual creatures or arise through specific
mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many, however,
result from an infusion of extraplanar energy, whether
through direct parentage, more distant ancestors, or
simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that plane.
These individuals are known as planar scions.
Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile
heritages aren’t limited to a single ancestry, a versatile
heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any
ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common
among some ancestries than others, and some might list
additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM
may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use
a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting.
Playing a Versatile
Heritage
To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select
your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You
gain Hit Points, size, Speed, ability boosts and ability flaws,
languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry.
Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally
available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile
heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile
heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics,
abilities, or traits from your ancestry.
Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have
only one, and you can’t have any other heritage in
addition to your versatile heritage.
Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an
ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry.
In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting
abilities your character has.
When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from
those available to your ancestry as well as those
specific to your versatile heritage.
LINEAGE FEATS
Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have
the lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological
lineage your character has—such as the type of hag
that birthed a changeling character, or the type of fiend
that influenced a tiefling’s birth. You can have only one
lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at 1st level,
and you can’t retrain into or out of this feat.
VERSATILE HERITAGES
The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling. The
inevitable offspring of these mixed unions share physiological features with both their
parents, manifesting as a specific heritage. The most common of these by far are the half-elf
and half-orc human ancestries. Some individuals, however, are born under far stranger
circumstances, such as a monstrous, undead, or extraplanar parent, a powerful curse, or an
incursion of extraplanar energies. As these circumstances aren’t unique to a single ancestry,
these heritages—called versatile heritages—are likewise shared by many ancestries.
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 30
================================================================================

MANY ANCESTRIES
Though a character can have only one
heritage, it doesn’t mean characters
with lineages tracing back to multiple
ancestries or heritages don’t exist.
It’s certainly possible for a dhampir
to be born to a half-elf mother, or
for a duskwalker to appear in a
community of death warden dwarves.
In these cases, the influence of the
versatile heritage overshadows the
other heritage—the dhampir heritage
overshadows the half-elf heritage, and
the duskwalker abilities replace those
of the death warden dwarf heritage. So
while, superficially, a character might
bear a resemblance to both heritages,
mechanically, they only gain the
benefits of the versatile heritage.
SUPERNATURAL ORIGINS
The circumstances that give rise to
individuals with versatile heritages
vary widely, from direct biological
descendance to clandestine rituals,
planar incursions, or unique mystical
phenomena. It’s up to you to decide
the details of your character’s heritage
and how they came into being. The
sections in this book provide some
broad suggestions that you can use as
a jumping-off point, but these aren’t
restrictions. Hags, for example, typically
give birth to mammalian offspring,
but they are devious creatures and
might just as easily change form to
that of a kobold long enough to hatch a
changeling kobold child—or perhaps your
changeling character arose as a result
of a hag’s occult meddling rather than
direct lineage. It’s your story to tell!
In This Book
This book includes the rules for five versatile heritages, including three
planar scions.
CHANGELING
Children of the malevolent, magical crones known as hags, changelings share
some of their mothers’ abilities, such as sharp claws and occult magic. Many
changelings experience or dread the psychic summons of their hag mothers,
known as the Call, urging them to seek out their mothers so they might be
transformed into hags themselves.
Changeling lineages affect the appearance of one of the changeling’s eyes,
and are as follows: brine may for the child of a sea hag, callow may for a green
hag, dream may for a night hag, and slag may for an annis hag.
DHAMPIR
The mortal offspring of undead vampires are caught between life and
undeath, mortality and immortality, mundane existence and powerful magic.
Dhampirs enjoy long life spans and otherworldly charm, but their ghostly
pallor and the nature of their parentage make their lives in humanoid
societies difficult.
The two lineages for dhampirs found here are the svetocher, who come
from the most common vampires called the moroi, and the straveika, born
of the aged and unsettling nosferatu.
PLANAR SCIONS
Life is present everywhere across the planes of the Great Beyond, and the
intermingling of Material Plane mortals and extraplanar beings is no rare thing.
The resultant children of these relationships—and sometimes the descendants
of those children—are known as planar scions. There are numerous types of
planar scions, just as there are countless types of beings across the planes that
might consort with mortals. This book focuses on the following three.
aaSimar
These planar scions bear the blood of celestial beings—angels, archons, azatas,
and other benevolent extraplanar entities. Though this grants aasimars certain
abilities and characteristics, it also places tremendous pressure upon them to
meet expectations due to the assumptions others hold of their heritage.
Aasimar lineages found here include the angelkin, the lawbringers who
come from archons, and the musetouched born of azatas.
DuSkwalker
A duskwalker isn’t born; they are instead created, each manifesting as a mortal
child in a location with close ties to death. They embody the somber powers
of the psychopomps, immortal guardians and shepherds of the dead, and they
maintain a fascination with and deep understanding of death throughout their
lives. More singular than other versatile heritages, duskwalkers don’t have
different lineages.
TiefliNg
The influence of fiendish blood or energy gives rise to tieflings. A tiefling’s
heritage is boon and bane, as none can contest the powers they command,
but few communities are willing to overlook the physical features that
accompany fiendish blood—horns, hoofed feet, and tails being but a
few examples.
The lineages for tieflings in this book are hellspawn born of devils, pitborn
made with the influence of demons, and the grimspawn of daemonic origin.

================================================================================

Though a changeling generally resembles a member of their
father’s ancestry, their distinctive eyes—each a different
color—set them apart. One of their eyes matches that of
their father’s lineage, while the other matches the color of
their hag mother’s, often in an unnatural shade such as
violet or a vivid green. Not everyone with differently colored
eyes is a changeling, but this manifestation of changeling
heritage makes it difficult for them to hide their nature and
can lead to banishment from their community. As they come
of age, they manifest other characteristics from their mother,
including supernatural abilities. Darkvision, clawlike
fingernails, and innate magic are the most common, but
stranger abilities specific to the hag mother can also arise.
Changelings can be any gender, but women in particular
are vulnerable to the Call, a psychic influence that urges
them to abandon their mortal life, join the hag’s coven, and
eventually become a hag. Changelings who understand their
heritage often fear the Call and work to resist its pull. Those
who remain ignorant of their origin may find themselves
subject to a terrible compulsion without knowing why.
YOU MIGHT...
• Cherish and protect those friends and family
who accept you as you are.
• Seek to better understand your hag mother and the
gifts she gave you, for good or ill, or distance yourself
from your heritage.
• Fear the day you hear the Call and worry you might
not be able to resist—or perhaps you already fight to
resist it every day.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you practice occult or primal magic, or that
you participate in a coven.
• Worry that you might secretly be a monster, or
become one, and turn on them.
•   Notice and speculate about your distinctive eyes.
CHANGELING (UNCOMMON HERITAGE)
Your mother was a hag. Your heterochromatic eyes
are the most obvious signifier of this parentage, but
you likely also have a slighter build, paler skin, and
darker hair than most members of your other parent’s
ancestry. You gain the changeling trait. You also
gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already has low-light vision. You can select
from changeling feats and feats from your other
parent’s ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Changeling Feats
The following feats are available to changeling
characters.
CHANGELING
Tales of children stolen away and replaced by monsters exist across countless cultures—
but the true monsters are the hag mothers of these strange children. After the hag seduces,
uses, and disposes of their father, the changeling child is usually abandoned in their
father’s community to be raised among them. Such a child faces no end of challenges,
often beginning life as an orphaned outsider.

DHAMPIR
Many call vampires the children of the night, but it is dhampirs who can truly claim that
title. These mortal offspring of vampires walk the line between life and undeath not just
physiologically, but also in their social standing, temperament, and worldview.
The circumstances surrounding a dhampir’s birth are rare,
complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors stoked
by societal revulsion at the idea of an undead monstrosity
producing mortal offspring. Some dhampirs are the child of
one mortal and one vampiric parent, while others are born
to those who were turned into vampires while pregnant.
Still others rise from dark rituals or other supernatural
influences that impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal
infant. The life of a dhampir is often difficult: few vampiric
parents have the time or inclination to raise a mortal child,
while mortal communities find a dhampir’s sallow flesh,
piercing eyes, and unnerving presence off-putting at best.
Despite being living creatures, dhampirs respond
to positive and negative energy as if they were undead,
making them unwelcome in many holy communities and
often driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs
aren’t immortal, but age far more slowly than
most mortals, with a lifespan similar to that of
an elf. Dhampirs have difficulty producing
children of their own, and those few born to
a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves.
A dhampir generally resembles a member of their
non-vampire parent’s ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor
and eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and
no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly
as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace,
beauty, and charm, despite their unsettling appearance.
YOU MIGHT...
• Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to
blend into society or even hunting undead.
• Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to
“helpful” healing magic.
• Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste
of blood.
OTHERS PROBABLY...

and elongated incisors. You gain the dhampir trait, in
addition to the traits from your ancestry. You have the
negative healing ability, which means you are harmed by
positive damage and healed by negative effects as if you

You can choose from dhampir feats and feats from your
ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

PLANAR SCIONS
Countless legends tell of mortals and immortals entwined, and of the children born
to those lovers. These children, known as planar scions, are mortals who inherit the
supernatural essence of another plane, which manifests through their distinctive physical
features and otherworldly powers. There are as many types of planar scions as there
are creatures in the Great Beyond, but this section presents rules for three: the celestial
aasimars, psychopomp-infused duskwalkers, and fiend-blooded tieflings.
Aasimar
Born with the power of benevolent celestial entities,
aasimars are thought to be supremely blessed with strength
of will, extraordinary beauty, and innate magical gifts. But
many aasimars find that these perceived talents—whether
they actually have them or not—set them apart from their
friends and family, fostering loneliness in themselves and
jealousy in others. Aasimars with a positive outlook face
these challenges by serving their communities, populating
the environment with kindness or artwork, or simply
supporting those who are less fortunate. Some aasimars
hold a more hostile worldview, however, and risk falling
into resentment, despair, or even the temptations of evil.
Even then, the stereotypes surrounding an aasimar cling
close, causing others to view them as tragic figures in need
of redemption.
The powers and physical appearances passed down
from celestial beings vary according to an aasimar’s
lineage. Those who descend from archons are sometimes
known as lawbringers, while those who possess angelic
blood are called angelkin, and those related to azatas are
referred to as musetouched.
If you want a character brimming with celestial power,
unique physical characteristics and the potential for
strong faith, you should play an aasimar.
YOU MIGHT...
• Possess a strong sense of fashion, favor exquisitely
crafted tools, or carry yourself with instinctual grace.
• Feel a strong kinship with outcasts, orphans, or others
who have been misunderstood or marginalized.
• Have a beloved pet or a close relationship with a
sibling or childhood friend.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you are a supernatural messenger from beyond
or whole-heartedly enjoy your supernatural legacy.
• Treat you with worship or reverence, but distance
you by putting you on a pedestal.
• Think you can provide simple and free supernatural
solutions for all their problems.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
An aasimar’s physical appearance depends as much upon
the features of their parents as it does upon the nature of
their celestial heritage. While an aasimar is recognizably
a member of their humanoid ancestry, they always bear
a few physical traits that set them apart, such as glowing
eyes, a faint halo of light above their head, feathers for
hair, antennae on the brow, a metallic sheen to the skin,
lack of a belly button, a strangely musical voice, or a
naturally pleasing floral scent. It’s a common stereotype
that all aasimars are handsome or beautiful—another
assumption aasimars face throughout their lives.
SOCIETY
Aasimars are too widely dispersed in most regions to create
societies of their own, and they instead tend to assimilate
into the society and culture of their mortal parents. They
thrive in societies that hold freedom, civility, and justice as
virtues. Whether due to inborn charm and confidence or
others’ tendency to ascribe greater weight to their words,
aasimars often find themselves in positions of leadership,
even when they don’t seek out such roles, and they must
take care that their actions and words don’t unduly
influence others. When aasimars gather in numbers large
enough to develop their own societies, they tend to be
tightly knit but open and friendly to visitors, yet swift in
their justice against proven enemies.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
An aasimar’s celestial nature doesn’t force goodness or
faith into their life—each aasimar is free to form their own
personality and beliefs. In many cases, these beliefs are
shaped by the nature of their upbringing, their parents, and
the society in which they were raised. Most aasimars are
good, whether because society tends to accept, foster, and
support aasimars, or because the influence of the celestial
planes is enough to subtly encourage them down such
paths. Good faiths are more likely to draw an aasimar’s
attention, particularly those with portfolios associated
with celestial concerns, such as Desna, Erastil, or Sarenrae.
Those who choose lives of evil tend to be particularly cruel
or sadistic, almost as if they feel the need to work that
much harder to justify and pursue their life choices.
AASIMAR (UNCOMMON HERITAGE)
You descend from celestials or were touched by the
celestial realms, gaining an air of awe and grace, as
well as features distinctive to your celestial forebears.

from which you trace your lineage (usually Elysium
Lore, Heaven Lore, or Nirvana Lore).

bonus to saves against emotion effects, and if you roll a
success on a save against an emotion effect, you get a
critical success instead.

success instead.

effects similar to those of holy water (Core Rulebook 571).
Whenever a fiend, undead, or creature with a weakness to

creature takes 1d6 good damage. You gain a +4 circumstance
bonus to Crafting checks to Craft holy water using your own
blood as one of the ingredients.
CELESTIAL RESISTANCE
FEAT 5
AASIMAR
Your growing connection to your celestial forebears has
granted you one of their resistances as well. Choose one of
the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire,
or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.
Though you can choose any of these energy damage
types, the damage type typically matches a celestial
associated with your bloodline. For instance, an angelkin
might choose resistance to cold or fire with a cassisian
forebear, resistance to fire with a balisse forebear, or
resistance to sonic with a choral forebear.
EMPYREAL BLESSING

Duskwalker
The first duskwalkers manifested as the result of a bargain
between two powerful psychopomps, the immortal
guardians and guides of souls after death. One believed
that certain souls who helped preserve the cycle of life
and death but had their own lives cut short deserved
reincarnation, while the other felt this would too greatly
violate that same cycle. In the end, the duskwalkers rose
from a concession between the two that allowed such
rebirths to occur but limited their frequency—only a finite
number of duskwalkers ever exist at any one point in time.
When they were first created by psychopomps,
duskwalkers were expected to perform roles that would
serve the goddess of death, Pharasma, and by extension
her realm, the Boneyard. But now duskwalkers have
found themselves with more freedom of choice and
after a century, have only now come to terms with the
fact that their destinies are their own to choose. As they
are created, not born, most duskwalkers either struggle
to integrate with society or seek out communities and
organizations to serve as a surrogate family.
Duskwalkers have an inherent understanding of the
cycle of life and death. In most cases this manifests as
a deep respect for that cycle and pushes the duskwalker
toward occupations that help them to protect it, such as
hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.
If you want a character who has a mysterious
background, seeks a society or organization to
join, or looks to fight against undead, you should
play a duskwalker.
YOU MIGHT...
• Seek out opportunities to form strong friendships
with a diverse array of companions.
• Become focused on preventing the spread of undeath.
• Be intrigued at finding your identity in a previous life.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you’re a necromancer or have some other
strange interest in death or the dead.
• Want to know if you remember your past life or ask
you about the secrets of death or the afterlife.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
As a reincarnated soul, a duskwalker retains many of the
physical traits they possessed in their previous life and is a
member of that ancestry, though as a duskwalker they have
distinctive ash-gray or dark blue skin. However, sometimes
a duskwalker forms from an unusual creature, like a
dragon. These duskwalkers appear to be of a humanoid
ancestry, but have features like draconic scales or horns.
When a duskwalker perishes and faces final judgment,
a new one incarnates within a year from a deserving soul,
typically somewhere far from the previous duskwalker’s
birthplace. Duskwalkers manifest in locations with
a sanctified connection to death, such as graveyards
or temples, and begin their lives at adolescence. No
duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological
children, but this doesn’t prevent them from establishing
families, typically through adoption.
SOCIETY
It’s not uncommon for a duskwalker to go their entire
life without encountering another of their kind. Despite
their overall rarity, duskwalkers are likely to become
adventurers, both due to the strange conditions of their
creation and common feelings of social isolation.

ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Most duskwalkers are neutral or have a neutral
component to their alignment. While the typical
duskwalker worships or at least respects Pharasma and
her powerful psychopomp ushers, any deity associated
with death, society, or the occult might attract a
duskwalker’s attention.
DUSKWALKER (UNCOMMON HERITAGE)
Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn
as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to
psychopomps and the Boneyard. You gain the duskwalker
trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You
also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body
nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can choose
from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry
whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
DUSKWALKER FEATS

you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also
become trained in Boneyard Lore.

as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as

RESIST RUIN

BONEYARD’S CALL
FEAT 17

You have a powerful connection to the Boneyard and its
courts, granting you the ability to travel to and from the
Boneyard. You gain plane shift as a divine innate spell. You can
cast it twice per week. This can be used only to travel to the
Boneyard or from the Boneyard to the Material Plane. Due to

Tiefling
When the influence of a demon, devil, or other fiend
infiltrates the bloodline of a mortal family, tieflings
are the inevitable result. Tieflings carry the sinister
mark of the fiendish planes upon their flesh, and their
specific abilities and physical qualities vary according to
their heritage. Hellspawn are those who descend from
devils, grimspawn hail from daemonic influences, and
pitborn bear the influence of demons, though these are
only the three most common among a wide variety of
tiefling lineages.
Generations might pass between a fiend’s direct
influence and the time a tiefling child is born. For
those born to ignorant or fearful parents, childhood is
particularly hard, but even those whose families accept
and nurture them face fear and prejudice from society
as a whole. In some cases, this rejection encourages a
tiefling to embrace the evil within their heritage, though
others carve out a place and live a fulfilling life despite the
challenges facing them.
If you want a character who is supernaturally infused
with sinister forces, might have a unique appearance, and
can fill the role of a complicated or unexpected hero, you
should play a tiefling.
YOU MIGHT...
• Have a strong sense of self-confidence born from a
life of having to rely on yourself.
• Feel a kinship with society’s underprivileged or
criminal elements, or even seek positions of power
on the wrong side of the law.
• Place incredible value on hard-won friendships and
hold these companions closer than your blood family.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume you’ve faced numerous challenges due to
your heritage.
• Mistake you for an evil agent of a sinister cult, a
fiend worshipper, or even a fiend yourself.
• Think you have associations with powerful fiends,
potentially trying to bargain with you for power of
their own.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Two tieflings, even siblings or twins, might not look
similar at all, for the influence of fiendish lineage manifests
in unique and unusual ways. These variations never make
a tiefling’s appearance so strange as to obscure their
humanoid ancestry, but horns, a forked tongue, vestigial
wings, a tail, or a cloven hoof in place of a foot are all
common and obvious signs of their heritage.
SOCIETY
Tieflings tend to adopt the society and culture they
were born into. Since most societies consider them to
be untrustworthy or even monstrous, tieflings typically
gravitate toward those segments of society willing to
overlook them entirely, or where their reputation can
assist rather than hinder them. With determination
and persistence, however, tieflings can earn respect and
prestige despite their heritage, finding people who accept
them as they are. In regions where worship of fiends is
widespread, tieflings can live more openly and achieve
great power and respect, although exceptions exist—in
the Asmodean nation of Cheliax, for example, tieflings
are seen as shameful proof of a failure to maintain control
in the face of fiendish influence, and as such are cast out.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
A tiefling’s fiendish heritage doesn’t force evil or cruelty
into their being, and each tiefling ultimately chooses their
own faith, goals, and personality. But every tiefling feels
their forbear’s influence in the back of their mind, always
ready to tempt and goad when the world appears cruel
and unjust. That so many societies hate and fear tieflings
only pushes them further toward evil, and many tieflings
gravitate toward religions that value and admire fiends,
such as the churches of Asmodeus or Lamashtu. Tieflings
who choose a path of good face their own challenges,
finding they must be more diplomatic, understanding, and
patient than members of other ancestries since they are so
often faced with ignorance and suspicion. Such tieflings
embrace faiths and philosophies that uphold empathy
and eschew judgment, finding that even followers of good
faiths sometimes struggle to see past fiendish features.
TIEFLING (UNCOMMON HERITAGE)
You descend from fiends or bear the mark of the fiendish
realms, manifesting as some unusual feature that belies
your heritage, such as horns or a tail. You gain the tiefling
trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You
also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose
from tiefling feats and feats from your ancestry whenever
you gain an ancestry feat.
TIEFLING FEATS
The following feats are available to tiefling characters.

Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you
can’t retrain into or out of this feat, nor can you change the
type of attack you gained.
GRIMSPAWN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
Your lineage traces back to a daemon, one of the manifestations
of horrific forms of death that devour souls within their foul
home of Abaddon. As a result, you cling tenaciously to the last
shreds of your own life force. You gain the Diehard feat.
HELLSPAWN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
Your lineage descends from devils, the conniving schemers of
Hell’s malevolent hierarchy. You’re as skilled at noticing lies
and twisted wordings as you are at constructing them. You
are trained in Deception and Legal Lore. If you were already
trained in Deception (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
You also gain the Lie to Me skill feat.
NIMBLE HOOVES
FEAT 1
TIEFLING
Your legs end in hooves rather than feet, with joints and
tendons that allow you to move with great haste. Your Speed
increases by 5 feet.
Special The Speed increase from this feat isn’t cumulative
with any Speed increase from your ancestry feats (such as
Nimble Elf).
PITBORN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
Your blood bears the mark of a demon, a living embodiment
of sin from the fetid depths of the Abyss. Demonic power
pulses through your veins and manifests in a different way
for each pitborn, whether you have webbed fingers and thrive
in the water, large hands capable of wrestling larger foes, or
some other manifestation. You are trained in Athletics. If you
were already trained in Athletics (from your background or
class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of
your choice.
You also gain any one common 1st-level skill feat
with a prerequisite of trained in Athletics, as reflects the
manifestation of your Abyssal blood.
5TH LEVEL
FIENDISH RESISTANCE
FEAT 5
TIEFLING
Your connection to your fiendish forebears has granted you
one of their resistances as well. Choose one of the following
energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You
gain resistance 5 to that damage type.
Though you can choose any of these, the damage type
typically matches a fiend associated with your bloodline.
For instance, a hellspawn might choose resistance to fire,
or a pitborn with a vrock ancestor might choose resistance
to electricity.
MALICIOUS BANE
FEAT 5
TIEFLING
Whether your heart is pure or corrupt, you can call forth a
malediction upon your foes. You can cast bane once per day as
a 1st-level divine innate spell.
SKILLFUL TAIL
FEAT 5
TIEFLING
You’ve always had a tail, but with practice, you’ve learned to
use it for more than signaling your mood. You can perform
simple Interact actions with your tail such as opening an
unlocked door. Your tail can’t perform actions that require
fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action
that would require a check to accomplish, and you can’t use
it to hold items.
9TH LEVEL
DAEMON MAGIC
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Grimspawn
The magic of Abaddon runs through your blood, and you can
wield that power. You can cast death knell and false life each
once per day as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
DEMON MAGIC
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Pitborn
You can channel the power of the Abyss through your
heritage, producing terrible tangible effects. You can cast
paranoia and shatter each once per day as 2nd-level divine
innate spells.

DEVIL MAGIC
FEAT 9

invisibility and misdirection each once per day as 2nd-level
divine innate spells.
FIENDISH WINGS [two-actions]
FEAT 9
DIVINE
MORPH
TIEFLING
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
You can strain to call forth bat-like or otherwise fiendish
wings from your back, similar in appearance to those of your
fiendish ancestors. Once manifested, these wings remain for
10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed
while you’ve manifested your wings.
LIGHT FROM DARKNESS
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
You’ve battled the fiendish power within your nature and
come out on top; whatever you decide to do with your life,
for good or evil, will be your choice and your choice alone.
This struggle has granted you powerful resistance against the
divine. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws
against divine effects.
13TH LEVEL
FIEND’S DOOR
FEAT 13
TIEFLING
Like many fiends, you have the supernatural ability to teleport
yourself to safety. Once per day, you can cast dimension door
as a 5th-level divine innate spell.
FIENDISH STRIKES
FEAT 13
TIEFLING
Your festering connection to the forces of evil infuses
your weapons with debilitating malevolence, tearing down
creatures of good with every attack. All your weapon and
unarmed Strikes deal 1 additional evil damage and have
the evil and magical traits.
SUMMON FIENDISH KIN
FEAT 13
TIEFLING
Prerequisites any tiefling lineage feat
You have a deep connection to the fiendish realms, allowing
you to summon a fiend matching your own lineage. Once per
day, you can cast summon fiend as a 5th-level divine innate
spell. The fiend you summon must match your own lineage.
17TH LEVEL
FIENDISH WORD
FEAT 17
TIEFLING
You can call forth a blasphemous word from the fiendish
realms to punish your foes. Once per day, you can cast divine
decree as a 7th-level divine innate spell. You must choose evil
for the spell, and you can Cast the Spell regardless of whether
you have a deity or what their alignment is.
RELENTLESS WINGS
FEAT 17
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Fiendish Wings
Your wings are now a permanent part of your physiology. You
gain the effects of Fiendish Wings at all times, rather than just
once per day for 10 minutes.

Dwarf Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
DWARVEN DOUGHTINESS
FEAT 1
DWARF
You are either naturally calm and collected in the
face of imminent danger, or you are very good
at faking it. At the end of your turn, reduce
your frightened condition by 2 instead of 1.
EYE FOR TREASURE
FEAT 1
DWARF
You know good artisanship when you
see it and can wax poetic about
crafting techniques and forms.
You become trained in Crafting
and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on
all Crafting checks made to Recall Knowledge.
If you would automatically become trained in Crafting
(from your background or class, for example), you instead
become trained in a skill of your choice. In addition, you gain
the Crafter’s Appraisal skill feat (page 204), enabling you to
identify magic items using the Crafting skill.
5TH LEVEL
DEFY THE DARKNESS
FEAT 5
DWARF
Prerequisites darkvision
Using ancient dwarven methods developed to fight enemies
wielding magical darkness, you’ve honed your darkvision
and sworn not to use such magic yourself. You gain greater
darkvision, enabling you to see through magical darkness
even if it normally hampers darkvision (such as the darkness
created by a 4th-level darkness spell). You can’t cast spells
with the darkness trait, use item activations with the darkness
trait, or use any other ability with the darkness trait.
DWARVEN REINFORCEMENT
FEAT 5
DWARF
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
You can use your knowledge of engineering and metalwork
to temporarily strengthen thick objects and structures. By
spending 1 hour working on an item, you can give it a +1
circumstance bonus to its Hardness for 24 hours. If you’re a
master in Crafting, the bonus is +2, and if you’re legendary,
the bonus is +3. You can reinforce a portion of a structure,
though 1 hour usually reinforces only a door, a few windows,
or another section that fits within a 10-foot cube.
SHELTERING SLAB
FEAT 5
DWARF
The stone around you is your ally, and you have learned to
use it to shore up your weaknesses. As long as you remain on
the ground and are adjacent to a vertical stone wall that rises
to your height or taller, you aren’t flat-footed against attacks
as a result of being flanked. This works even if you are at the
outside corner of the wall.
9TH LEVEL
ECHOES IN STONE [one-action]
FEAT 9
CONCENTRATE
DWARF
Requirements You are standing on a stone or
earthen surface.
You pause a moment to attune your senses
to the stone around you. Until the start
of your next turn, you gain a new
sense: imprecise tremorsense with a
range of 20 feet.
RETURNING THROW [two-actions] FEAT 9
DWARF
You have mastered the technique of arcing
a projectile so that it returns to your hand
after being thrown, though this requires a
moment to precisely calculate the trajectory and possible
ricochets. Make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon. Once
the Strike is complete, the weapon arcs or ricochets back to
your hand. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it
falls to the ground in your space.
STONE BONES [reaction]
FEAT 9
DWARF
Trigger You are struck by a critical hit that deals physical
damage.
Your intractable nature can help you shrug off even the
most grievous injuries. Attempt a DC 17 flat check. If you are
successful, the attack becomes a normal hit.
13TH LEVEL
TELLURIC POWER
FEAT 13
DWARF
You channel strength from the earth beneath your feet to
pummel your enemies. When making a melee Strike against
a target who is standing on the same earth or stone surface
as you are, you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll
equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
17TH LEVEL
STONEGATE
FEAT 17
DWARF
Prerequisites Stonewalker
Earthen barriers no longer impede your progress. You gain
passwall as a 7th-level divine innate spell that you can cast
once per day. Unlike the spell, however, this ability can be
used only to open passages through barriers of earth or stone.

Elf Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL LINGUISTICS
FEAT 1
ELF
Prerequisites at least 100 years old
Over your extensive lifespan, you’ve studied many
languages. During your daily preparations, you
can recede into old memories to become fluent in
one common language or one other language you
have access to. You know this language until you
prepare again. Since this knowledge is temporary,
you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a permanent
character option.
ELVEN ALOOFNESS
FEAT 1
ELF
As much as you might care for
them, you’ve come to terms with
the ephemeral nature of non-elves,
and it makes their threats feel less
troublesome. If a non-elf rolls a failure on
a check to Coerce you using Intimidation, it gets a critical
failure instead (and thus can’t try to Coerce you again for 1
week). When a non-elf attempts to Demoralize you, you
become temporarily immune for 1 day, instead of 10 minutes.
KNOW YOUR OWN
FEAT 1
ELF
You’ve spent countless hours studying the history of elves
on your world and beyond and are a studied expert in
your people’s ways. If you critically fail a check to Recall
Knowledge about elves, elven society, or elven history, you
get a failure instead.
5TH LEVEL
ANCESTRAL SUSPICION
FEAT 5
ELF
Long-lived elves have seen civilizations rise and fall, often at
the hands of outside forces. As a result, they have developed
a wariness of others who might seek to influence or control
them. You’ve been trained to resist such manipulation, gaining
a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects
that would make you controlled, such as dominate, and to
Perception checks to Sense Motive when trying to determine
if a creature is under the influence of such an effect. When
you roll a success on a saving throw against such an effect,
you get a critical success instead.
MARTIAL EXPERIENCE
FEAT 5
ELF
You’ve crossed blades with a wide variety of foes wielding
a wide variety of weapons, and you’ve learned the basics
of fighting with nearly any of them. When wielding a
weapon you aren’t proficient with, treat your level as your
proficiency bonus.
At 11th level, you become trained in all weapons.
9TH LEVEL
OTHERWORLDLY ACUMEN
FEAT 9
ELF
Prerequisites at least one innate spell gained
from an elf ancestry feat
The arcane magic you possess grows in power
and complexity. Choose one common 2nd-level
spell from the same tradition as an innate
spell you previously gained from another
elf ancestry feat (from the arcane list if you
have Otherworldly Magic, for example).
You can cast that spell as an innate
spell once per day, using the same
tradition as the list you chose the
spell from.
Your magic is adaptable. By spending 1 day
of downtime, you can change the spell you chose to a
different common 2nd-level spell from the same tradition.
TREE CLIMBER
FEAT 9
ELF
You’ve spent much of your life among the treetops and have
become an expert at quickly and safely climbing them. You
gain a climb Speed of 10 feet.
13TH LEVEL
AVENGE ALLY [one-action]
FEAT 13
ELF
FORTUNE
Frequency once every 10 minutes
Requirements You are adjacent to an ally with the dying
condition.
Though you know that you will eventually outlive your
companions, seeing them at death's door brings clarity to your
attacks. Make a Strike. Roll twice on the attack roll and use
the higher result.
17TH LEVEL
MAGIC RIDER
FEAT 17
ELF
Your people used powerful magic to travel between
distant worlds, and the remnants of that magic make such
transportation easier for you. When you are the target of
a teleportation spell that transports more than one person,
it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit,
chosen by the caster. Additionally, when you’re the target of a
teleport spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than
1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.

1ST LEVEL
EMPATHETIC PLEA [reaction]
FEAT 1
AUDITORY
EMOTION
GNOME
MENTAL
VISUAL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
Trigger You are attacked by a creature that
you haven’t yet acted hostile toward.
You must use this reaction before the
creature rolls its attack.
The way you cringe or use those puppy-
dog eyes you’ve been practicing elicits
an empathetic response in the attacker.
Attempt a Diplomacy check against your
attacker’s Will DC.
Critical Success The creature pulls its attack, wasting its
action, and can’t use hostile actions against you
until the beginning of its next turn.
Success The creature takes a –2 circumstance
penalty to damage on the triggering Strike
and all its Strikes against you until the beginning
of its next turn. The penalty is –4 if you’re an expert in
Diplomacy, –6 if you’re a master, and –8 if you’re legendary.
Failure The creature’s attack is unaffected, and the creature is
temporarily immune to your Empathic Pleas for 24 hours.
RAZZLE-DAZZLE [free-action]
FEAT 1
GNOME
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You blind or dazzle a creature.
You’ve spent considerable time practicing the manipulation
of light, weaponizing your blade’s reflection or bolstering the
luminosity of magical displays to unconventional heights.
Extend the duration of the blinded or dazzled condition you
give the target by 1 round.
5TH LEVEL
PROJECT PERSONA [one-action]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
GNOME
ILLUSION
PRIMAL
VISUAL
Where others etch their armor to serve as a conduit for their
imaginations, your vivid mind and bold personality allow you to
project a more fitting persona over your lackluster armor. You
change the shape and appearance of your armor to appear as
ordinary or fine clothes of your imagining. The armor’s statistics
don’t change. This effect lasts as long as you remain conscious
and are wearing the armor. A creature can disbelieve the illusion
by Seeking or touching your armor. The DC equals your Will DC.
9TH LEVEL
CAUTIOUS CURIOSITY
FEAT 9
GNOME
Prerequisites at least one arcane or occult innate spell gained
from a gnome heritage or gnome ancestry feat
You’ve learned a few magical techniques for getting
yourself both into and out of trouble unnoticed.
You gain misdirection and silence as 2nd-level
arcane or occult innate spells. The tradition of
these spells must match the tradition you
use for your gnome ancestry options.
You can cast each spell once per day
and can target only yourself.
LIFE LEAP [one-action]
FEAT 9
GNOME
MOVE
NECROMANCY
TELEPORTATION
Requirements You must be adjacent to a living
creature.
You phase through a space that a living creature
occupies in a flash, spontaneously appearing
on the opposite side of it in a vibrant display
of colorful light. You move from your
current location to another location that’s
still adjacent to the same living creature,
but on the opposite side or corner of the creature’s space. To
determine whether a position is valid, use the same rules as
for flanking: a line through the center of the two spaces must
pass through opposite sides or corners of the creature’s space.
You pass through the creature’s life force, appearing in
the selected location; this doesn’t trigger reactions based on
movement. You must be able to see your destination, and you
can’t move farther than your Speed would allow.
13TH LEVEL
INSTINCTIVE OBFUSCATION [reaction]
FEAT 13
GNOME
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Prerequisites at least one arcane or occult innate spell gained
from a gnome heritage or gnome ancestry feat
Frequency once per day
Trigger You are attacked by a foe.
The magic within you manifests as a natural reaction to
threats. You gain the effects of mirror image but with two
images instead of three. The tradition of this action matches
the tradition of your gnome ancestry options.
17TH LEVEL
HOMEWARD BOUND
FEAT 17
GNOME
Frequency twice per week
The connection between you and the First World resonates
within your body stronger than it does for most gnomes,
allowing you to cross the threshold between the Material
Plane and the First World. You gain plane shift as a primal
innate spell. You can cast it twice per week. This can be used
only to travel back and forth between the First World and the
Material Plane. Due to your body’s natural resonance, you can
act as the spell focus, and you don’t require a tuning fork.

Goblin Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
EXTRA SQUISHY
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
Prerequisites unbreakable goblin heritage
Your rubbery physique makes it easier
for you to wedge yourself into
tight spaces and more
difficult for your enemies
to dislodge you. You become
trained in Acrobatics. If you would automatically
become trained in Acrobatics (from your
background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of
your choice. If you roll a success to
Squeeze, you get a critical success
instead. While you’re Squeezing, you
gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your
Fortitude or Reflex DCs against attempts to
Shove you or otherwise move you from your space.
TWITCHY
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
You are naturally suspicious and wary of danger, especially
when you suspect someone might be leading you into an
ambush. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saves
against hazards, and to all of your initiative rolls. If at least
one of your opponents is using Deception or Diplomacy to
determine their initiative, your bonus to initiative from this
feat increases to +4.
5TH LEVEL
KNEECAP [one-action]
FEAT 5
GOBLIN
You deliver a punishing blow to an enemy’s knee, shin, or
other vulnerable anatomy within your reach. Make a Strike
with one of your melee weapons or melee unarmed attacks.
This attack doesn’t deal damage. On a hit, the target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed or a –15-foot status
penalty on a critical hit. This penalty applies only if the
target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other
targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all
penalties to Speed, this can’t reduce a creature’s Speed
below 5 feet.
LOUD SINGER
FEAT 5
GOBLIN
Prerequisites Goblin Song
Staying on pitch, proper breath control, and remembering
the words are all less important than the real measure of
a good singer: volume! The range of your Goblin Song is
increased to 60 feet, and you can target one additional
enemy when you use it.
VANDAL
FEAT 5
GOBLIN
You have a knack for breaking and dismantling
things. Putting them back together is the
boring part, so you largely don’t bother with
that. You become trained in Thievery. If
you would automatically become
trained in Thievery (from your
background or class, for
example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice.
In addition, whenever you hit
with a Strike against a trap or an unattended
object, you ignore the first 5 points of the
object’s Hardness.
9TH LEVEL
CLING [one-action]
FEAT 9
GOBLIN
Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike.
You hang onto a foe to harry them into submission. If your
target moves while you’re hanging onto it, you can choose
to move with the target. The target is released if you
choose not to move with it, at the start of your next turn,
or if the target Escapes. Attempts to Escape from a Cling
follow the rules for Escape, but use your Acrobatics DC and
end the Cling instead of the conditions normally ended by
the Escape action.
Special You can use this action without a free hand
if your preceding Strike was made with your jaws or a
similar unarmed attack you could use to hang on. The GM
determines which unarmed attacks apply. Hanging on in this
way prevents you from using that unarmed attack.
17TH LEVEL
RECKLESS ABANDON [free-action]
FEAT 17
FORTUNE
GOBLIN
Frequency once per day
Despite a lifetime filled with questionable decisions, you’ve
managed to survive, as though you have uncanny luck that
lets you avoid the consequences of your own actions. For the
remainder of your turn, if you roll a failure or critical failure
on a saving throw against a harmful effect, you get a success
instead. Further, enemies and hazards that would damage
you this turn roll the minimum possible damage.
These benefits apply only to harmful effects incurred
entirely during your turn in which you activate Reckless
Abandon, such as running through a prismatic wall.
Persistent damage and conditions that were applied prior to
your turn proceed normally, and as soon as your turn ends
you are subject to the full consequences of any dangers still
threatening you.

JINXED HALFLING
UNCOMMON
You were born with a strange blessing: bereft

never take the Halfling Luck feat, and
you gain the Jinx action.
JINX [two-actions]
CURSE
NECROMANCY
OCCULT

You can curse another creature with clumsiness.
This curse has a range of 30 feet, and you must

class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
Success The target is unaffected and is
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Failure The target is clumsy 1 for 1
minute.
Critical Failure The target is clumsy 2
for 1 minute.
Halfling Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
FOLKSY PATTER
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms.
Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey
a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as
“Danger assassin flee” or “Meet me moonrise”). Your intended
listener can attempt a Perception check to discern the message
(DC 20 if an ally, DC 15 if a halfling ally, DC 10 if a halfling ally
with Folksy Patter). Eavesdroppers can also attempt a Perception
check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any
bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to Sense Motive apply.
PRAIRIE RIDER
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You grew up riding your clan’s shaggy ponies and riding dogs. You
become trained in Nature. If you would automatically become
trained in Nature (from your background or class, for example),
you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also get
a +1 circumstance bonus to Command an Animal if the target is a
traditional halfling mount, such as a pony or riding dog.
5TH LEVEL
STEP LIVELY [reaction]
FEAT 5
HALFLING

You are an expert at avoiding the lumbering footsteps of larger
creatures. You Step to another space adjacent to the enemy.
9TH LEVEL
DANCE UNDERFOOT
FEAT 9
HALFLING
Prerequisites Step Lively
You dart under the legs of your enemies in
combat. You can end a successful Tumble
Through action in a Large or larger enemy’s
space. Also, when using the Step Lively feat, you
can Step into the triggering enemy’s space. The
enemy must have limbs or otherwise
leave you enough room for this
maneuver, as determined by the
GM. For instance, you could share
space with a giant or dragon, but not
an ooze.
UNHAMPERED PASSAGE
FEAT 9
HALFLING
You won’t allow others to restrain you. You can cast freedom
of movement on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day.
13TH LEVEL
TOPPLING DANCE
FEAT 13
HALFLING
Prerequisites Dance Underfoot
While sharing a creature’s space using Dance Underfoot, your
weapons and unarmed attacks gain the trip trait, but only
against the creature whose space you share. You can be in
the same space as a Large or larger prone creature, even if it’s
not your ally.
17TH LEVEL
SHADOW SELF
FEAT 17
HALFLING
Prerequisites legendary Stealth
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You successfully use Stealth to Hide and become
hidden from all your current foes, or use Stealth to Sneak
and become undetected to all your current foes.
With a powerful talent for misdirection, you slip from your
adversaries’ notice so thoroughly you appear to be somewhere
else. You become invisible for 1 minute or until you take a
hostile action, whichever comes first. Choose a location within
10 feet of you. Until your invisibility ends, you appear to be
hidden in that location to anyone trying to find you. If the
searcher gets clear evidence that you’re not there, they no
longer think you’re hidden there, but they don’t discover your
actual location.

5TH LEVEL
SENSE ALLIES
FEAT 5
HUMAN
Like many humans raised in a close-knit
community, you have always been strongly
attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies
that you are aware of within 60 feet that would
otherwise be undetected by you are instead
hidden from you. The flat check for you to target
willing allies within 60 feet that are hidden from
you is 5 instead of 11.
9TH LEVEL
GROUP AID
FEAT 9
HUMAN
Your
upbringing
emphasized
teamwork and helping your allies
comes naturally to you. After you
Aid an ally at a skill check that doesn’t have the
attack trait, you can also Aid any other ally who
attempts the same skill check for the same purpose that round.
You do so as a free action rather than a reaction.
The preparation you did to help must still apply to the other
allies, and you can Aid each ally only once. For example, if
you helped lift up an ally to Aid them on an Athletics check to
scale a wall, you could keep the same posture to give a boost
to other allies attempting to scale the wall in the same round.
HARDY TRAVELER
FEAT 9
HUMAN
There’s no journey too far or burden too heavy when your
friends are at your side. Increase your maximum and
encumbered Bulk limits by 1. In addition, you gain a +10-foot
circumstance bonus to your Speed during overland travel.
13TH LEVEL
ADVANCED GENERAL TRAINING
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Over the course of adventuring, your adaptability has let you
pick up numerous useful abilities. You gain a general feat of
7th level or lower. You must meet the feat’s prerequisites.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a
different feat each time.
BOUNCE BACK [free-action]
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Frequency once per day
Trigger You lose the dying condition.
You recover from near-death experiences with astounding
resilience. Don’t increase the value of your wounded condition
due to losing the dying condition.
STUBBORN PERSISTENCE
FEAT 13
HUMAN
Humans are renowned for their ability to persist through
the most grueling of trials. When you would
become fatigued, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On
a success, you aren’t fatigued. If the fatigued
condition has an underlying cause that
you don’t address, such as lack of rest, you
must attempt the check again at an interval
determined by the GM until you fail the flat
check or address the underlying cause.

to dig deep and find a new level of
resolve. You grant up to 10 willing creatures within 30
feet the effects of a 6th-level zealous conviction, though
the effect automatically ends on a target if you give that
target a command they would normally find repugnant. This
action has the auditory trait or visual trait, depending on how
you inspire your allies.
Half-Elf Ancestry Feats
1ST LEVEL
EARNED GLORY
FEAT 1
HALF-ELF
Elves are often skeptical of their half-elven kin, and you are
experienced at telling stories of your accomplishments to
gain their respect. You are trained in Performance. If you
would automatically become trained in Performance (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice.
You gain the Impressive Performance feat (Core Rulebook 262).
When you attempt a Performance check to Make an Impression
on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
9TH LEVEL
PINCH TIME
FEAT 9
HALF-ELF
One of your parents has a human life span and another
an elven life span, with your own somewhere between. As
a result, you have an unusual perspective on time, which
you’ve learned to manifest to aid yourself in moments of
stress. You gain haste as a 3rd-level arcane innate spell,
though you can target only yourself. You can Cast this Spell
once per day.

PAGE 49
================================================================================

The following common backgrounds supplement those
found in the Core Rulebook and are available to any
character during character creation. Some of these
backgrounds grant skill feats from Chapter 4 of this book.
BANDIT
BACKGROUND
Your past includes no small amount of rural banditry, robbing
travelers on the road and scraping by. Whether your robbery
was sanctioned by a local noble or you did so of your own
accord, you eventually got caught up in the adventuring life.
Now, adventure is your stock and trade, and years of camping
and skirmishing have only helped.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and a Lore skill
related to the terrain you worked in (such as Desert Lore or
Plains Lore). You gain the Group Coercion skill feat.
BARBER
BACKGROUND
Haircuts, dentistry, bloodletting, and surgery—if it takes a
steady hand and a razor, you do it. You may have taken to the
road to expand your skills, or to test yourself against a world
that leaves your patients so battered and bruised.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Surgery Lore
skill. You gain the Risky Surgery skill feat (page 208).
BOOKKEEPER
BACKGROUND
You ran the numbers on a large farm, for a merchant’s endeavors,
or with a major guild in the city. You kept track of expenses,
payroll, profits, and anything else that had to do with money,
for better or worse. If better, you might be adventuring to learn
how others ply this trade. If worse, you may be fleeing from
impending consequences, in the hope that no one finds you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Accounting Lore
skill. You gain the Eye for Numbers skill feat (page 206).
COOK
BACKGROUND
You grew up in the kitchens of a tavern or other dining
establishment and excelled there, becoming an exceptional
cook. Baking, cooking, a little brewing on the side—you’ve
spent lots of time out of sight. It’s about time you went out
into the world to catch some sights for yourself.
COMMON BACKGROUNDS
Your character’s abilities don’t spring into existence at the moment they take up the
adventuring life. Their background—the role they had before they became an adventurer—
also provides a number of abilities. Most backgrounds are common and can be selected
by any character, but some adventurers come from more distinctive roots. The particular
histories behind these rare backgrounds provide specialized benefits.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Cooking Lore
skill. You gain the Seasoned skill feat (page 209).
COURIER
BACKGROUND
In your youth, you earned coin running messages for persons
of wealth and influence, darting through crowded cobblestone
streets. Your dogged commitment to deliver your message
was good training for the life of an adventurer.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Lore skill for the
city in which you were raised. You gain the Glean Contents
skill feat (page 206).
CULTIST
BACKGROUND
You were (or still are) a member of a cult whose rites may
involve sacred dances to ensure a strong harvest or dire
rituals that call upon dark powers. You might have taken up
adventuring to further your cult’s aims, to initiate yourself
into the world’s grander mysteries, or to flee unsavory
practices or strictures.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Lore skill related
to your deity or cult. You gain the Schooled in Secrets skill feat
(page 208).
INSURGENT
BACKGROUND
You were more than a rebel; you were a revolutionary, fighting
for the promise of a new or better country. You may or may
not still believe in the cause, or perhaps victory or exile has led
you on this new journey to trumpet your glory... or to escape
the consequences of your defeat.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Warfare Lore
skill. You gain the Lengthy Diversion skill feat.
OUTRIDER
BACKGROUND
In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies,
serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or
another group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst
in you to adventure and explore the world instead of just
racing past it.

================================================================================

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Nature skill and the Plains Lore skill.
You gain the Express Rider skill feat (page 206).
PILGRIM
BACKGROUND
In your youth, you made several pilgrimages to important
shrines and holy sites. You might have been a mendicant friar,
a seller of holy relics (real or fraudulent), or just a simple farmer
following the dictates of your faith. Whatever the aims of your
wanderings now, your faith still protects you on the road.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Lore skill for your
patron deity. You gain the Pilgrim’s Token skill feat (page 208).
REFUGEE
BACKGROUND
You come from a land very distant from the one you now find
yourself in, driven by war, plague, or simply in the pursuit of
opportunity. Regardless of your origin or the reason you left
your home, you find yourself an outsider in this new land.
Adventuring is a way to support yourself while offering hope
to those who need it most.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and a Lore skill related to
the settlement you came from. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.
ROOT WORKER
BACKGROUND
Some ailments can’t be cured by herbs alone. You learned
ritual remedies as well, calling on nature spirits to soothe
aches and ward off the evil eye. Taking up with adventurers
has given you company on the road, as well as protection from
those who would brand you a fake—or worse.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Herbalism
Lore skill. You gain the Root Magic skill feat (page 208).
SCAVENGER
BACKGROUND
You’ve made a living sorting through the things society
throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive,
or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While
you’ve left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the
ground out of habit.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Lore skill for the
settlement you grew up scavenging in. You gain the Forager
skill feat.
SERVANT
BACKGROUND
You held a role of servitude, waiting on nobles and engendering
their trust as one of the confidantes of the household. You
might have walked away on good terms, or perhaps you know
dangerous secrets about your former masters. Regardless, you’re
adventuring for a change and finding that in this new role, the
skills you’ve learned now serve you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Labor Lore skill.
You gain the Read Lips skill feat.
SQUIRE
BACKGROUND
You trained at the feet of a knight, maintaining their gear and
supporting them at tourneys and in battle. Now you search for
a challenge that will prove you worthy of full knighthood, or
you’ve spurned pomp and ceremony to test yourself in honest,
albeit less formal, combat.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and your choice of the
Heraldry Lore or Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Armor Assist
skill feat (page 203).
TAX COLLECTOR
BACKGROUND
Reviled but required, you were sent when taxes were
due. Performing your job might have required travel and
persuasion, or perhaps you were responsible for collecting
taxes on trade. Either way, it sometimes meant dirty hands,
and adventuring seemed the next logical step to you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Lore skill
for the settlement that employed you. You gain the Quick
Coercion skill feat.
TEACHER
BACKGROUND
You are incredibly knowledgeable, skilled, and perhaps even
trained to teach children and adults about the world and
its wonders. From books to classes, you’re committed to
imparting knowledge to all. Not everything can be taught or
learned from a book, though, so you’ve become an adventurer
to learn subjects more directly and bring that wisdom back to
your students.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in your choice of the Performance or Society
skills, along with the Academia Lore skill. You gain the
Experienced Professional skill feat.
WARD
BACKGROUND
When you were young, you became the ward of another
house—boarded, fed, and educated, but never quite a part of
the family. Perhaps you had to tend to their needs in return
for feeding and raising you, or perhaps you were provided for
but disregarded. Now, adventuring is your chance to grow and
roam free.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Genealogy
Lore skill. You gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat.

================================================================================

These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm. Whether
a character with the royalty background is heir to the
throne of the kingdom where your campaign takes place
or to a distant but powerful nation in the same world,
the character is situated in a special position within the
narrative. Your character’s background is an intrinsic part
of where they come from and not something they earn
during the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only
after a discussion between the GM and the other players
as to whether one would apply for a particular character
in your group’s game.
Backgrounds can also be unique, such that no other
character can have them if your character does. To create
unique backgrounds, you can adapt the rare backgrounds
in this section by including more specific details.
AMNESIAC
RARE
Your background is… well… honestly, you can’t remember! You
might have inklings deep within your mind, undercurrents of
unusual emotions or unexpected responses to certain people
or situations, but ultimately you don’t know who you once
were. You might be adventuring specifically to help discover
yourself. It’s up to you and the GM how to handle the truth of
your character’s backstory. You could leave it to the GM so it’s
a secret, work together with the GM, or even choose to leave
it undecided until later. In any case, you and your GM should
determine a few noteworthy details about your character or
their belongings to get the first clues to your past.
You gain three free ability boosts. You choose two, and
the GM chooses the third based on their first inklings of your
character’s possible history.
BLESSED
BACKGROUND
RARE
You have been blessed by a divinity. For an unknown reason,
and irrespective of your actual beliefs, a deity has granted
you a boon to use for good or ill. Your blessing grants wisdom
and insight to aid you in your struggles. You may or may not
even know the identity of the being who blessed you, and the
blessing might come with a cost you discover later on.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You are trained in a Lore skill associated with the deity who
blessed you (such as Shelyn Lore) if you know their identity,
or else in a Lore skill of the GM’s choice if you don’t. Either you
can cast guidance as a divine innate spell at will, or you gain a
similar blessing determined by the GM.
CURSED
BACKGROUND
RARE
You are the victim of a personal or hereditary curse. Through
great effort and occult study, you have learned to fend off
the curse’s worst effects and, by extension, you can protect
yourself against other harmful magic. However, the curse still
hangs over you and sometimes manifests in dangerous ways.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You are trained in Occultism and Curse Lore. You gain the
Warding Sign reaction. You and the GM should determine
the full effects of the curse, though you’ve staved most of
them off for now. The GM determines the curse’s lingering
manifestations on you, which usually include at least a
constant or very frequent thematic effect and occasional more
dangerous effects.
Warding Sign [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per minute;
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect,
but you haven’t rolled yet; Effect You call on the power of
a personal, eldritch sign of protection, which flares brightly
before slowly fading. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
the triggering saving throw, or a +3 circumstance bonus if
the effect is a curse.
FERAL CHILD
BACKGROUND
RARE
You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to
or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical
connection with these animals and gained certain abilities
from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in
mental pursuits.
Choose one ability boost. It must be Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution.
You are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain low-light vision
(or darkvision if you already had low-light vision), imprecise
scent with a range of 30 feet, and the Forager skill feat.
FEYBOUND
BACKGROUND
RARE
You have spent time in the First World or another realm of
the fey and aren’t entirely the same person you were before.
Perhaps you made a purchase at the legendary Witchmarket
or partook deeply of fey food and wine. Whatever the case,
willingly or inadvertently, you made a bargain with the fey,
the benefits of which come at a price.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You are trained in Fey Lore and gain the Fey’s Fortune free
action. You must follow some rule or limitation as part of your
pact with the fey. If you violate the rule, you lose Fey’s Fortune
RARE BACKGROUNDS
While most backgrounds are available to any character, some backgrounds are so unusual
that just having them makes a character rare and extraordinary.

until you receive the effects of a successful atone ritual using
the Nature skill. The exact limitation is up to you and the GM,
but the most common requirement is that you must fulfill a
single request from any fey who knows your name.
Fey’s Fortune [free-action] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per day;
Trigger You attempt a skill check and haven’t yet rolled;
Effect Roll the skill check twice and use the better result.
HAUNTED
BACKGROUND
RARE
You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood
or since a traumatic or momentous event. You may have seen
this entity. Others may have seen it as well. You have studied
esoteric subjects trying to understand your situation, but this
presence in your life remains a mystery. Whatever this entity
is or wants, it influences your life in subtle ways, not always
good. Sometimes the entity helps you, but at other times, its
influence is malevolent or harmful. The entity is most likely to
surface in stressful situations.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You are trained in Occultism and an additional skill in which
the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any
time you attempt a skill check for the entity’s skill, the GM can
offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the
entity were Aiding you. If you accept but fail the check, you
are frightened 2 (frightened 4 on a critical failure). The initial
frightened value can’t be reduced by effects that would reduce
or prevent the condition (such as a fighter’s bravery).
RETURNED
BACKGROUND
RARE
You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the
realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and
undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You gain the Diehard feat and the Additional Lore feat for
Boneyard Lore.
ROYALTY
BACKGROUND
RARE
You are a prominent member of a royal family. You have taken
up the life of an adventurer—perhaps you’re a deposed queen
hoping to regain her throne, a prince seeking a more exciting
life, or a princess on a secret mission.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You are trained in Society. You gain the Courtly Graces skill
feat and can influence commoners in your family’s territory, as
well as nobility anywhere. If you later gain the Connections skill
feat, you automatically have common and noble connections
within any community in your royal family’s territory and have
noble connections in large communities outside your territory.

CHAPTER 2: CLASSES
There are more classes in the world of Pathfinder than those explored in the Core
Rulebook, and each of those classes has near-infinite variety. This chapter introduces the
new investigator, oracle, swashbuckler, and witch classes and offers new options for each
of the 12 Core Rulebook classes.
Alchemist (page 106): You can learn a variety of
new discoveries or study the new toxicologist
research field.
Barbarian (page 108): Achieve new feats of
strength and brutality, or gain your rage from the
new superstition instinct.
Bard (page 112): Perform new compositions, learn
new and unusual tricks, or find a muse in the heat
of battle.
Cleric (page 122): Find new ways to gain additional
power and guidance from your deity, including
premonitions to help protect you from harm.
Druid (page 124): Your connection to nature
teaches you new primal techniques, including
feats to sow seeds into weapons and spells alike.
Fighter (page 126): Learn a variety of new
martial techniques, including flourishes, presses,
reactions, and a new stance.
Monk (page 128): Master new and exciting
forms of martial arts, with many new stances for
monastic archers and clever scrappers alike.
Ranger (page 132): Discover a brand new type
of focus spell called warden spells, as well as
additional martial and wilderness techniques.
Rogue (page 134): Pick up all sorts of new tricks,
or dig into new rackets: the scheming mastermind
or the magical eldritch trickster.
Sorcerer (page 138): Uncover powerful new secrets
in your blood, including four new bloodlines:
genie, nymph, psychopomp, and shadow.
Wizard (page 142): Research powerful new
magical secrets, including the staff nexus thesis.
Champion (page 116): You can engage in new feats
of heroism, or you might even eschew such things
completely and devote yourself to evil tenets.
swashbuckler
Page 82
To a swashbuckler, anything worth
doing is worth doing with style.
This dynamic daredevil performs
bold
feats
of
derring-do
and
mixes their own unique style with
flamboyant attacks. The swashbuckler
tumbles around the battlefield, befuddling
their foes to set them up for powerful finishing moves.
investigator
Page 54
Clever and insightful, the investigator
solves mysteries and teems with
knowledge. In battle, they play out
every possibility in advance, striking
true when the time is right. Their
methodology grants them an edge, and
their high Intelligence and number of skills
mean they almost always have the right tool for the job.
witch
Page 94
The witch is a versatile spellcaster who
learns a variety of magical lessons
from a mystical familiar, sent to them
by a powerful and mysterious patron.
The witch’s mastery of potent hexes
from their patron allows them to supplement
their other spells with special tricks to solve any problem.
oracle
Page 66
The oracle is a paradox of divine magic,
able to tap into and manipulate energies
from disparate sources throughout
the universe that would overwhelm
anyone else. These mysteries grant
unusual powers and revelations, as
well as a double-edged curse—which they
must learn how to simultaneously endure and exploit.
The entries on pages 54–105 describe four new classes,
including all the information you need to play each class
from 1st to 20th level. The chapter continues with new
content for the Core Rulebook classes. If you’re looking
for something new for your favorite Core Rulebook
class, those options are listed to the left. The chapter
concludes on page 144 with new animal companion and
familiar options.
