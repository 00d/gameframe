# Chapter 2: CLASSES
# Pages: 55-150

CHAPTER 2: CLASSES
There are more classes in the world of Pathfinder than those explored in the Core
Rulebook, and each of those classes has near-infinite variety. This chapter introduces the
new investigator, oracle, swashbuckler, and witch classes and offers new options for each
of the 12 Core Rulebook classes.
Alchemist (page 106): You can learn a variety of
new discoveries or study the new toxicologist
research field.
Barbarian (page 108): Achieve new feats of
strength and brutality, or gain your rage from the
new superstition instinct.
Bard (page 112): Perform new compositions, learn
new and unusual tricks, or find a muse in the heat
of battle.
Cleric (page 122): Find new ways to gain additional
power and guidance from your deity, including
premonitions to help protect you from harm.
Druid (page 124): Your connection to nature
teaches you new primal techniques, including
feats to sow seeds into weapons and spells alike.
Fighter (page 126): Learn a variety of new
martial techniques, including flourishes, presses,
reactions, and a new stance.
Monk (page 128): Master new and exciting
forms of martial arts, with many new stances for
monastic archers and clever scrappers alike.
Ranger (page 132): Discover a brand new type
of focus spell called warden spells, as well as
additional martial and wilderness techniques.
Rogue (page 134): Pick up all sorts of new tricks,
or dig into new rackets: the scheming mastermind
or the magical eldritch trickster.
Sorcerer (page 138): Uncover powerful new secrets
in your blood, including four new bloodlines:
genie, nymph, psychopomp, and shadow.
Wizard (page 142): Research powerful new
magical secrets, including the staff nexus thesis.
Champion (page 116): You can engage in new feats
of heroism, or you might even eschew such things
completely and devote yourself to evil tenets.
swashbuckler
To a swashbuckler, anything worth
doing is worth doing with style.
This dynamic daredevil performs
bold
feats
of
derring-do
and
mixes their own unique style with
flamboyant attacks. The swashbuckler
tumbles around the battlefield, befuddling
their foes to set them up for powerful finishing moves.
investigator
Clever and insightful, the investigator
solves mysteries and teems with
knowledge. In battle, they play out
every possibility in advance, striking
true when the time is right. Their
methodology grants them an edge, and
their high Intelligence and number of skills
mean they almost always have the right tool for the job.
witch
The witch is a versatile spellcaster who
learns a variety of magical lessons
from a mystical familiar, sent to them
by a powerful and mysterious patron.
The witch’s mastery of potent hexes
from their patron allows them to supplement
their other spells with special tricks to solve any problem.
oracle
The oracle is a paradox of divine magic,
able to tap into and manipulate energies
from disparate sources throughout
the universe that would overwhelm
anyone else. These mysteries grant
unusual powers and revelations, as
well as a double-edged curse—which they
must learn how to simultaneously endure and exploit.
The entries on pages 54–105 describe four new classes,
including all the information you need to play each class
from 1st to 20th level. The chapter continues with new
content for the Core Rulebook classes. If you’re looking
for something new for your favorite Core Rulebook
class, those options are listed to the left. The chapter
concludes on page 144 with new animal companion and
familiar options.

================================================================================

You seek to uncover the truth, doggedly pursuing leads to reveal the plots
of devious villains, discover ancient secrets, or unravel other mysteries. Your
analytical mind quickly formulates solutions to complicated problems and your
honed senses identify even the most obscure clues. Wielding knowledge as a weapon, you
study the creatures and dangers you encounter to exploit their weaknesses.
HIT POINTS
8 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number
of HP by this number at 1st level and
every level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
INTELLIGENCE
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Intelligence.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
Your keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than your
physical strength would suggest. After spending a moment to study your enemies,
your perceptiveness allows you to act quickly, striking them where it hurts most.
You often assist tougher members of your party, wisely protecting yourself while
providing vital aid.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
Few can stand up against your scrutiny. You might not be the most charming, but
you see things for what they really are and develop an understanding of a social
situation rapidly. Every conversation is an investigation, after all, and you never
know what you might uncover!
WHILE EXPLORING...
You look for clues in your environment. You often prove yourself to be a valuable
ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious
phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information.
IN DOWNTIME...
You study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share information
with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied. You might make a
bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or consulting with the local
constabulary.
YOU MIGHT...
• Start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—immediately
after you’re presented with a conundrum.
• Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and to
identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes.
• Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them trivial.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if difficult to
fully comprehend.
• Get a bit annoyed that you’re such a know-it-all.
• Rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring intellectual
curiosity and reasoning.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an investigator. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
ON THE CASE
As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases
waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction
you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead and Clue In.
PURSUE A LEAD
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
INVESTIGATOR
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You spend 1 minute examining the details of one potential
clue, designating the subject related to that clue as the
target of your active investigation. This subject is typically
a single creature, item, or small location (such as a room or
corridor), but the GM might allow a different scope for your
investigation. You don’t need to know the identity, purpose,
or nature of the subject, but you do need to be aware of
its existence. For instance, finding a footprint is enough
to investigate the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty
sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your
investigation of that subject.
Whenever you attempt a Perception or skill check to
investigate a designated subject, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to the check. The exact checks this applies to depend on
the actions you use to investigate and are determined by the
GM, but checks to investigate are typically Perception checks
or skill checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
You can maintain two active investigations at a time. If you
Pursue another Lead after that, the subject must be different
from any of your current investigations (or rather, they must
be different as far as you know), and you give up on a current
subject of your choice. Once you’ve given up pursuit of a
subject, you can’t Pursue that Lead again until after the next
time you make your daily preparations.
CLUE IN [reaction]
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger Another creature attempts a check to investigate a
lead you’re pursuing.
You share information with the triggering creature. They
gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your
circumstance bonus to checks investigating your subject
from Pursue a Lead. The GM can add any relevant traits to
this reaction depending on the situation, such as auditory
and linguistic if you’re conveying information verbally.
DEVISE A STRATAGEM
You can play out a battle in your head, using brains
rather than brawn to execute an attack.
DEVISE A STRATAGEM [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
INVESTIGATOR
Frequency once per round
You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to
formulate a plan of attack against your enemy. Choose a
creature you can see and roll a d20. If you Strike the chosen
creature later this round, you must use the result of the roll
you made to Devise a Stratagem for your Strike’s attack roll
instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the
Advanced Player's Guide
56
56

PAGE 58
================================================================================

first Strike you make against the creature this round, not any
subsequent attacks.
When you make this substitution, you can also add your
Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your
Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided your Strike uses an
agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed
attack, a ranged weapon (which must be agile or finesse if it’s
a melee weapon with the thrown trait), or a sap.
If you’re aware that the creature you choose is the subject of
a lead you’re pursuing, you can use this ability as a free action.
METHODOLOGY
Your studies have made you savvy in many areas,
but one in particular drew your intense interest.
Choose a methodology. The methodologies
presented in this book are as follows.
AlchemicAl ScienceS
Your methodology emphasizes chemical and
alchemical analysis, collecting information from
unusual particles and fluids found on the scene. You
possess enough alchemical know-how to whip up a
few tinctures to help you with your cases.
You’re trained in Crafting and gain the Alchemical
Crafting skill feat (Core Rulebook 258). In addition,
you gain a standard formula book for free and learn the
formulas for two additional common 1st-level alchemical
items, which must be elixirs or tools. Each time
you gain a level, you learn the formula for one
common alchemical elixir or alchemical tool
of any level of item you can create.
During your daily preparations, you can create
a number of versatile vials—alchemical concoctions
that can quickly be turned into elixirs and tools—
equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use the Quick
Tincture action to turn one of these vials into an elixir or
alchemical tool for which you know the formula.
QUICK TINCTURE [one-action]
INVESTIGATOR
MANIPULATE
Cost 1 versatile vial
Requirements You know the formula for the alchemical
item you’re creating, you are holding or wearing
alchemist’s tools, and you have a free hand.
You quickly brew up a short-lived tincture. You
create a single alchemical elixir or tool of your
level or lower without having to spend the normal
monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to
attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait,
but it remains potent only until the end of the current turn.
empiriciSm
Everything comes down to data. Calculating statistics,
running numbers, and using inductive reasoning allows
you to determine the most likely outcome of any scenario,
and anything out of place draws your keen attention.
You are trained in one Intelligence-based skill of your
choice. You gain the That’s Odd investigator feat (page
60), and you gain the Expeditious Inspection free action.
EXPEDITIOUS INSPECTION [free-action]
INVESTIGATOR
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You observe and assess your surroundings with great speed.
You Recall Knowledge, Seek, or Sense Motive.

ForenSic medicine
You’ve learned that in most cases, especially murders, criminals tend to leave more
evidence of the crime on the body than they’d like to believe. Information from
bruising, bone fractures, blood spatters, and even the life cycle of carrion insects can
provide valuable clues that help reconstruct the scene.
You’re trained in Medicine and gain the Forensic Acumen (page 206) and Battle
Medicine (Core Rulebook 258) skill feats. When you use Battle Medicine, on a
success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to your level, and the target
becomes temporarily immune for only 1 hour, not 1 day.
interrogAtion
People can’t help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your
firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others
talking, and you’ve developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth
of your investigations.
You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the No Cause for Alarm skill feat (page
208). You can also Pursue a Lead over the course of a conversation rather than
spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1
minute or longer. For example, while trying to Make an Impression, you could
pursue the creature you’re conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead
about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also
gain the Pointed Question action.
POINTED QUESTION [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
You ask a question that charms or needles someone in just the right way. Ask a question
of a non-allied creature that you can see and have been conversing with. Attempt a
Diplomacy check against the creature’s Will DC. The creature is then temporarily immune
for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target must directly answer your question. It doesn’t have to answer
truthfully, but you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Perception DC if the creature
attempts to Lie to you.
Success As critical success, but the circumstance bonus is +2.
Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal.
Critical Failure The target can refuse to answer you as normal, and its attitude toward you
decreases by one step due to your aggravating attention.
INVESTIGATOR FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat.
STRATEGIC STRIKE
When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When
making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to
Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.
As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic
strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained
or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
SKILL INCREASES
2ND
You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every
level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which
you’re already trained.
Advanced Player's Guide
58
58

PAGE 60
================================================================================

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
KEEN RECOLLECTION
3RD
You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren’t your
specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks
to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level instead of +0.
SKILLFUL LESSONS
3RD
At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-,
Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you
gained from your methodology.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any check
that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if you’re
untrained in it; you can attempt any check that requires

trained in it; and you can attempt any check that requires
you to have master proficiency in a skill as long as you

clues available. If you’re pursuing the subject of a lead and
you enter a new location that includes another clue toward
solving the mystery, the GM informs you of the existence
of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or
the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that
you’ve done so. If there is more than one clue in the location,
the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find
any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that
you’ve done so, even if it wasn’t the clue they’d chosen or
there are other clues you haven’t found. Your proficiency
rank for your investigator class DC increases to master.
Investigator Feats
At every level that you gain an investigator feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
FLEXIBLE STUDIES
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
You’ve collected a cross-section of information on various
disciplines you can refer to when preparing for various tasks.
During your daily preparations, you can cram on a certain
subject to become temporarily trained in one skill of your
choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. As this
proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for
a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
KNOWN WEAKNESSES
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
Whenever you Devise a Stratagem, you can also attempt a
check to Recall Knowledge as part of that action. If you critically
succeed at the Recall Knowledge check, you notice a weakness
and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll from Devise
a Stratagem. If you immediately convey this information to your
allies as part of the check, each ally gains a +1 circumstance
bonus to their next attack roll against the subject, as long as
their attack is made before the beginning of your next turn.
TAKEDOWN EXPERT
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
You’ve mastered combat practices that let you get up close and
bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence
modifier on attack rolls when you Devise a Stratagem if you’re
using a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club, staff,
or sap), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes
qualify for your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any
of your Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal –2 penalty.
THAT’S ODD
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
When you enter a new location, such as a room or corridor,
you immediately notice one thing out of the ordinary. The GM
determines what it is, or whether there’s nothing reasonable
to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed
without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only
that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it’s suspicious.
For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain
on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it’s
evident to you already, so the GM might note that there’s
something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You
would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out
what specifically is out of the ordinary. That’s Odd doesn’t
reveal whether creatures are suspicious.
You don’t typically get any benefit when you leave
and come back to a place, though if a major change has
happened there and time has passed, the GM might
determine that you do.
TRAP FINDER
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and
presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception
checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to
saves against traps. Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check
to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still
need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.
You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery,
you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of
legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against
traps increase to +2.
UNDERWORLD INVESTIGATOR
FEAT 1
INVESTIGATOR
Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the
criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you
might have gained an understanding of how they operate
from the outside. You become trained in Underworld Lore, and
you gain your Pursue a Lead circumstance bonus to Thievery
checks to investigate the subject of your lead (such as checks
to Steal a clue from a suspect or Pick a Lock to open a safe
with damning documents).
2ND LEVEL
ATHLETIC STRATEGIST
FEAT 2
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body
weight. In addition to using Devise a Stratagem to modify a
Strike, you can use it to modify a Disarm, Grapple, Shove, or
Trip attempt, substituting your Devise a Stratagem roll for the
Athletics check. You must apply the substitution to the first
eligible attack you make, whether it’s a Strike or one of the
Athletics actions.
You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of
Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your
Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you’re using a weapon for the
maneuver and the weapon doesn’t fit the restrictions for using
Intelligence with a stratagem.
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 62
================================================================================

RED HERRING
FEAT 2
INVESTIGATOR
You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry.
When you Pursue a Lead, the GM tells you if the lead you chose
is inconsequential. For example, if you found a splatter of gray
mud on the wall, thought it was suspicious, and Pursued it as
a Lead, the GM would tell you if there was no greater mystery
related to it. When the GM tells you a lead is inconsequential,
you can decline to Pursue the Lead, keeping any leads you
were already pursuing. You still can’t use Pursue a Lead again
for 10 minutes, as normal.
SHARED STRATAGEM
FEAT 2
INVESTIGATOR
The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself.
When you hit a creature with an attack on which you
substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem,
designate one ally. The creature you hit is flat-footed to that
ally on the next attack the designated ally makes against that
creature before the start of your next turn.
SOLID LEAD
FEAT 2
INVESTIGATOR
Sometimes your case splinters into smaller mysteries, but you
never lose sight of the big picture. Once per day when you give
up on the subject of a lead due to using Pursue a Lead again,
you can designate the lead you stopped pursuing as your solid
lead for the day. Even though you stopped following the solid
lead, you can change back to your solid lead any number of
times by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
Doing so ends one of your current leads as normal.
During your next daily preparations, you can maintain your
solid lead or you can remove it; removing it allows you to
designate a new solid lead later that day.
4TH LEVEL
ALCHEMICAL DISCOVERIES
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites alchemical sciences methodology
You’ve devoted extra time in the lab to improve your knowledge
of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two alchemical items
each time you level up instead of one; these must still be
elixirs or tools. The number of versatile vials you can create
each day increases by 1 if you’re an expert in Crafting, 2 if
you’re a master, or 3 if you’re legendary.
DETECTIVE’S READINESS
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
When you’re on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid
tricks your suspect might pull. You gain your circumstance
bonus from Pursue a Lead on saving throws (and their DCs, as
normal) against the subject of a lead, and you can use Clue In
to assist an ally’s saving throw against that subject.

LIE DETECTOR
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites empiricism or interrogation methodology
You’re adept at noticing the tells of a liar—sweat, flushing,
a quavering voice, a quickening pulse. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Sense Motive and
to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. When you
determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to
your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next
Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check you
attempt against that creature within the next minute.
ONGOING INVESTIGATION
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
You’re always investigating what’s around you, even as you
perform other activities. You can move at full Speed while
using the Investigate exploration activity, and you can use
another exploration activity while Investigating.
SCALPEL’S POINT
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites forensic medicine methodology
Your stratagems benefit from your precise knowledge of
anatomy. When you critically hit with an attack on which you
substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, if
your attack dealt piercing or slashing damage, you also deal
1d6 persistent bleed damage to your target.
STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
FEAT 4
INVESTIGATOR
You learn your foes’ strengths and weaknesses by watching
them move. When you critically hit a creature with a Strike
on which you substituted your attack roll due to Devising
a Stratagem, the GM chooses one of the following pieces of
information about the enemy to tell you.
• Which of the enemy’s weaknesses is highest
• Which of the enemy’s resistances is highest
• Which of the enemy’s saving throws is lowest
• One immunity the enemy has
The GM can choose deliberately or at random, but they can’t
choose information that doesn’t apply (such as choosing an
immunity for an enemy that has no immunities). This applies
only the first time you critically hit a given creature.

FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
SECRET
Requirements You must be pursuing at least two leads.
Ephemeral connections between people, places, and
concepts are invisible to most, but seeing them is your
stock and trade. You spend 10 minutes considering two
different leads you’re pursuing. You then attempt a check
to investigate how connected the two are. Unless the GM
determines otherwise, this is a Crafting check if they’re
both items or a Society check for other combinations
Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 64
================================================================================

of leads. If any subjects are creatures, this check usually
uses the highest DC among their Deception and Will DCs.
If no subjects are creatures, but at least one is an item, the
DC is usually a hard DC for the level of the highest-level
item. If neither case applies, the DC is usually a hard expert
or hard master DC (22 or 32). Once you try to Connect the
Dots between two particular leads, you can never try to
Connect the Dots between those same leads again unless
the GM allows it after you’ve learned a substantial amount
of new information.
Critical Success The GM tells you how connected the two leads
are to one another: highly connected, somewhat connected,
tangentially connected, or not connected. The GM also tells
you one specific way in which they’re connected, if they are.
Success As critical success, but the GM doesn’t tell you a
specific connection.
Failure Your results are inconclusive.
Critical Failure You misconstrue the information. As success,
but the GM provides an incorrect degree of connection.
PREDICTIVE PURCHASE
FEAT 6
INVESTIGATOR
You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the Prescient
Planner and Prescient Consumable feats (page 208). When
using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item as a 2-action
activity to remove your backpack (or a similar container) and
draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
THOROUGH RESEARCH
FEAT 6
INVESTIGATOR
When you succeed at a Recall Knowledge check, you learn an
additional fact about the subject. When you critically succeed
at a Recall Knowledge check, you can gain even more additional
information or context than normal, at the GM’s discretion.
8TH LEVEL
BLIND-FIGHT
FEAT 8
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites master in Perception
Your battle insights make you more aware of concealed and
invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat check to
target concealed creatures. You’re not flat-footed to creatures
that are hidden from you (unless you’re flat-footed to them for
reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a
successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature of your
level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
CLUE THEM ALL IN
FEAT 8
INVESTIGATOR
You can clue in all your allies at once. When you use the Clue
In reaction, any of your allies who are attempting the same
check to investigate a lead receive the circumstance bonus from
Clue In. If you use this ability during an encounter, they must
attempt their check within 1 round of when you Clued them In.
WHODUNNIT?
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
INVESTIGATOR
Frequency once per day
You carefully consider your case and narrow down some
of the details. When you Pursue a Lead, you can spend 10
minutes instead of 1 minute to ask two questions of the GM
as you complete the activity. The GM must answer truthfully
with “yes” or “no,” though if the answer would be misleading
or have no practical application to your investigation the GM
can answer “immaterial.” You can’t use Whodunnit? more than
once for the same lead, even across different days.
Your questions must come from the following list, applying
to either the creature or the clue you found:
• Was the clue left by a [creature trait]? (Choose a creature
trait such as humanoid, undead, or dwarf; this trait must
be accurate as of the time the clue was left.)
• Was this clue left within the last hour?
• Was this clue left within the last day?
• Was the creature that left the clue in a heightened emotional
state when it left the clue?
• Did the creature attempt to conceal this clue?
10TH LEVEL
JUST ONE MORE THING [one-action]
FEAT 10
FORTUNE
INVESTIGATOR
Requirements Your most recent action was to Feint, Request,
or Demoralize, and you failed but didn’t critically fail.
After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you
add another bit of information or ask a pointed question,
possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed
check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check
is the subject of a lead you’re pursuing, double your bonus
from Pursue a Lead on the rerolled check. That creature is
temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.
You can also use this action if you failed, but didn’t
critically fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, Make
an Impression, or Coerce. In this case, rather than spending
1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the
amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum
of 1 more round.
ONGOING STRATEGY
FEAT 10
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites strategic strike
You’re constantly studying small aspects of everyone’s
movements, even if you don’t have a stratagem in place
ahead of time. On any Strike for which you didn’t Devise a
Stratagem, you still deal precision damage equal to your
number of strategic strike damage dice so long as the weapon
or unarmed attack you used is one that would have let you
use your Intelligence modifier had you Devised a Stratagem.

SAMPLE INVESTIGATOR
Trigger A foe takes a hostile action against you in combat.
Sometimes something intrudes upon your case unexpectedly,
such as an ambush sent to bring your investigation to a
close. You’ve learned how to compartmentalize your main
lead and pursue a new one for your current predicament.
You Pursue a Lead against the triggering foe, setting aside
but not ending one of your currently active leads, if you
have two leads. At the end of the combat encounter, you
stop Pursuing the Lead against the triggering foe and return
to the original lead, if you have one.
12TH LEVEL
FORESEE DANGER [reaction]
FEAT 12
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
Trigger A creature targets you with an attack and you can see
the attacker.
You perceive every possible way your foe’s attack could land
and attempt to avoid them all. The triggering attack roll targets
your Perception DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you
to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn’t remove any
conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example,
an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to
you for being flat-footed, even though you wouldn’t take the –2
circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
REASON RAPIDLY [one-action]
FEAT 12
INVESTIGATOR
Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You
instantly use up to five Recall Knowledge actions. If you have
any special abilities or free actions that would normally be
triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can’t use them for
these actions.

INVESTIGATOR
PREDICTION
You spend 10 minutes in contemplation to uncannily predict
how events will play out. Choose a particular goal or activity
you plan to engage in within 1 week, or an event you expect
might happen within 1 week. You analyze whether it’s likely
to come to pass, learning whether it’s highly likely, somewhat
likely, somewhat unlikely, or highly unlikely. You also gain a
piece of advice suggesting a course of action you or your allies
could take that might make the chosen event more or less
likely, whichever you prefer. The GM determines the likeliness
of the event and the piece of advice you learn.
SENSE THE UNSEEN [reaction]
FEAT 14
INVESTIGATOR
Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you notice the slightest of cues. Even
though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically

Seeking, making them merely hidden to you.

STRATEGIC BYPASS
FEAT 14
INVESTIGATOR
Your plans account for your foes’ resistances, enabling
you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike
on which you substituted your attack roll due to Devising
a Stratagem, you ignore an amount of resistance equal to
your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies
against your attack.
16TH LEVEL
DIDACTIC STRIKE
FEAT 16
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites Shared Stratagem
When you find a glaring weakness, you can set your allies
up to annihilate your foe. When you use Shared Stratagem,
you can designate up to 10 allies instead of just one. The foe
is flat-footed against the first attack from each designated
ally before your next turn, and each ally’s first attack deals an
extra 2d6 precision damage to the target if it hits.
IMPLAUSIBLE PURCHASE
FEAT 16
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites Predictive Purchase
It seems impossible, but you’ve analyzed every angle and are
able to just keep pulling out exactly the item you need, even
in far-flung locations. You can use Prescient Planner even if
you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can
use it as a single action instead of a 2-action activity, during
which you Interact to draw the item. In addition, five times
per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a common
consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
RECONSTRUCT THE SCENE
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
You spend 1 minute surveying a small location (such as a
single room) to get an impression of events that occurred
there in the last day. This involves moving about the area and
studying footprints, the placement of objects, spilled drinks or
blood, and so forth. You get an indistinct mental impression
of significant events that happened there. This gives you
clues and details of the past, including the overall events and
their time frame, but it’s not a perfect record. This also isn’t
enough to identify who was involved in these events if you
weren’t already aware the person was there. As determined
by the GM, you also pick out various seemingly small details
that could serve as important clues, like a memorable weapon
someone used for a murder or the type of cloak someone wore
when passing through.
18TH LEVEL
LEAD INVESTIGATOR
FEAT 18
EXPLORATION
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites Clue Them All In
You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead
you’re pursuing. Those allies gain the same circumstance
bonus you do from Pursue a Lead to checks to investigate
that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or
for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn’t confer any other
benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance
bonus to your saves with Detective’s Readiness.
TRICKSTER’S ACE [reaction]
FEAT 18
CONCENTRATE
INVESTIGATOR
Trigger You specify the trigger when you make your daily
preparations (see Requirements below).
Requirements When you make your daily preparations, you
must specify a trigger for this reaction using the same
restrictions as the triggers for the Ready action. You also
choose a single spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or primal
list of 4th level or lower. The spell can’t have a cost, nor can
its casting time be more than 10 minutes. The spell must
be able to target a single creature, and you must be a valid
target for it.
Whether from jury-rigged magic items, deduction from the
study of magical interactions, or other means, you have a
contingency in your back pocket for desperate situations.
When the trigger occurs, you cause the spell to come into
effect. The spell targets only you, no matter how many
creatures it would affect normally. If you define particularly
complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger
might fail. Once the contingency is triggered, the spell is
expended until your next daily preparations.
20TH LEVEL
EVERYONE’S A SUSPECT
FEAT 20
INVESTIGATOR
You are so suspicious of everyone you meet that you keep
mental notes on how to defeat them all—even your own allies.
After interacting with a creature for at least 1 minute, you
automatically Pursue a Lead with that creature as the subject.
You can have any number of such leads at any given time, and
when you Pursue a Lead again, you don’t give up any of these
automatic subjects.
JUST THE FACTS
FEAT 20
INVESTIGATOR
Prerequisites Thorough Research
You fundamentally understand everything to the point where
your research can’t possibly be wrong. You are permanently
quickened and can use the extra action to Recall Knowledge.
Your checks to Recall Knowledge are no longer secret.
When you Recall Knowledge, you use the outcome for one
degree of success better than the result of your check, and
if an effect (such as Dubious Knowledge) would give you
inaccurate information from your Recall Knowledge check,
you know which information is inaccurate. When one of
your allies Recalls Knowledge and gains false information,
you also know that information is inaccurate if they share
it with you.

Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer
and servitude—you instead glean divine truths that extend beyond any
single deity. You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in
overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you
perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely.
You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells,
but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you
draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an
instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods.
HIT POINTS
8 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number of
HP by this number at 1st level and every
level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
CHARISMA
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Charisma.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous
effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands
overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your
foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse
to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse
back under control so you can draw upon your mystery’s power again later. You
remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the
future to gain insights.
IN DOWNTIME...
You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel
your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make
it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even
start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery.
YOU MIGHT...
• View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.
• Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.
• Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Don’t realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you
command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.
• Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.
• Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts.

ORACLE

================================================================================

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an oracle. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
DIVINE SPELLCASTING
Your mystery provides you with divine magical power.
You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity,
and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal
components when casting spells. Your unconventional
access to this divine power means you can usually
replace material components with somatic components,
so you don’t need to use a material component pouch
when casting spells.
At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per
day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn
them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of
spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As
you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells
per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you
can cast, as shown on Table 2–3: Oracle Spells per Day
on page 71.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell
attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.
HeigHtening SpellS
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened
version in your repertoire; for example, you can’t cast a
3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire
at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements
when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature
spells class feature (page 71) lets you heighten certain
spells freely.
CantripS
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots.
You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day.
A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of
spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level
oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level
oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
SPELL REPERTOIRE
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of
your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose
these from the common spells from the divine spell list,
or from other divine spells to which you have access. You
can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell
slot of an appropriate spell level.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–3), you add
a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd
level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you
select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add
spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell
you already have, so you can cast a heightened version
of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire,
it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

Swapping SpellS in Your repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want
to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each
time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap
out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same
level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also
swap out spells by retraining during downtime.
MYSTERY
An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine
being. This power could come from a potent concept or
ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of
concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous
conduit to raw divine power. This is the
oracle’s mystery, a source of divine magic
not beholden to any deity.
Choose the mystery that empowers
your magic. Your mystery grants you
special spells called revelation spells and
might later grant you divine domain spells.
It dictates the effects of your oracular
curse, adds an additional cantrip to
your repertoire, and gives you one or
more trained skills. Drawing insight
and power from the collective divine
influences that fuel your magic also provides you
with a special benefit.
The following oracle mysteries are presented in
this book.
Ancestors (page 73): Voices of past generations
teach and haunt you.
Battle (page 74): You embody the virtues upheld by
heroes of legend.
Bones (page 75): Death always seems near, and
the dead speak to you.
Cosmos (page 75): You draw
power from the stars and the
spaces between.
Flames (page 76): You dance
with fire and do your best to
remain unscorched by it.
Life (page 77): The teeming
energies of life flow through you
out into the world.
Lore (page 77): You gain access to
unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.
Tempest (page 78): Wind, waves, and storms
rage at your beck and call.
revelation SpellS
The powers of your mystery manifest in the
form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus
spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point
and increases the effects of your oracular curse
(page 70). You start with a focus pool
of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus
pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain
1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus
activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional
nature of your divine mystery.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots,
and you can’t cast them using spell slots (see Divine
Spellcasting on page 68). Taking feats can give you
more focus spells and increase the size of your focus
pool, though your focus pool can never hold more

than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the
Core Rulebook.
Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait
means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You
can’t cast a cursebound spell if you don’t have an oracular curse.
You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell
determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from
one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation
spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.
oraCular CurSe
Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible
stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells
you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting
energies can also provide you with divine benefits.
The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the
same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that
you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies,
first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.
Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation
spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it
remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations.
If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to
the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor
effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the
specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells,
progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger
curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When
you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce
your curse’s severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.
Drawing upon your mystery’s power while your curse is at its worst causes an
irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after
casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are
overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can’t Cast or Sustain any revelation spells—
you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects
of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn’t allow you to cast further
revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily
preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels,
you can grow to withstand your curse’s major and even extreme effects, enabling
you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.
Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can’t mitigate, reduce,
or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and
resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you,
you can’t negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true
strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell).
Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don’t affect your curse at all.

================================================================================

SIGNATURE SPELLS
3RD
Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of
that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn
heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a
signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when
you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower).
You can also retrain specifically to change a signature
spell to a different spell of that level without swapping
any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell
normally does.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
EXPERT SPELLCASTER
7TH
The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer
over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack
rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
RESOLVE
7TH
You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
MAGICAL FORTITUDE
9TH
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
ALERTNESS
11TH
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
MAJOR CURSE
11TH
You’ve learned to better balance the conflicting powers
wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after
completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are
affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses
to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This
effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to
its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under
the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by
your curse.

In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in
your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus
Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus

WEAPON EXPERTISE
11TH
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of
your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons

You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and

LIGHTNING REFLEXES
13TH
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
13TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and
4 if you’re legendary.
MASTER SPELLCASTER
15TH
You truly understand the deep and complex divine power
within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine
spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.
EXTREME CURSE
17TH
You have mastered a perilous balance between the
conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the
power to change your fate, but straining both body and
soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by
your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme
effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share
the same effects for their extreme curse.
When affected by your extreme curse, you become
doomed 2 (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if
you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes,
when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or
saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result.
The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn’t require you
to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even
if you can’t act. These effects are in addition to all the
effects of your major curse, and they can’t be removed by
any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its
minor effect.
If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of
this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse,
and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.
Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before
you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you
Refocus instead of 1.
GREATER RESOLVE
17TH
Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency.
Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical
success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will
save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save
against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
LEGENDARY SPELLCASTER
19TH
You can harness divine power at a level few others can
match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls
and spell DCs increase to legendary.
ORACULAR CLARITY
19TH
You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power
behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to
miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can
use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting.
You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up,
unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-level slots
with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you
cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the
Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.
Mysteries
Choose the divine mystery that fuels your mystical power.
Your mystery might represent a pantheistic devotion to all
the deities with power over the subject of your mystery,
veneration of a particular ideal, or a conduit to raw divine
energy. Whatever its origin and nature, your mystery
determines the revelation spells you can cast and the
oracular curse that overtakes your body when you do. You
learn skills related to that mystery, gain access to a cantrip,
and gain a special benefit drawn from the combined divine
knowledge and experience of your mystery.
READING A MYSTERY ENTRY
A mystery entry contains the following information,
followed by a description of that mystery’s curse.
Mystery Benefit The mystery benefit is a special ability (or
abilities) you gain from your mystery.
Trained Skill You become trained in the listed skill. A few
mysteries make you trained in more than one skill.
Granted Cantrip You automatically add this cantrip to your
spell repertoire, in addition to those you gain through
divine spellcasting.
Revelation Spells You automatically gain your mystery’s initial
revelation spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the
Advanced Revelation, Greater Revelation, and Diverse Mystery
oracle feats. These spells appear starting on page 229.
Related Domains These are the cleric domains associated
with your mystery. You select one initial domain spell from
one of these domains at 1st level, which you can cast as a
revelation spell with the cursebound trait. The domains and
their domain spells appear on page 441 of the Core Rulebook.

================================================================================

ANCESTORS
The voices of generations past speak to you, and
you hear their words. You might resent the constant
interruption, or you might revere the spirits of those
who came before. Perhaps you hail from a culture with
strong ancestral traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-
Quah (Skull Clan), a traditional dwarven community
that worships Torag’s family pantheon, or a group that
reveres Erastil or Pharasma. You might commune with
powerful psychopomps who shepherd souls to the
afterlife, with the River of Souls itself, or with those
spirits who have become trapped outside of the great
cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their whispers
and the fragments of their memories, but opening your
mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them
to meddle in your worldly affairs.
Mystery Benefit The whispers of your ancestors have
bestowed additional knowledge upon you. You gain an
additional ancestry feat at 1st level and another additional
ancestry feat at 11th level. These feats can’t be ones that
grant physiological effects, such as additional senses or
unarmed attacks.
Trained Skill Society
Granted Cantrip guidance
Revelation Spells initial: ancestral touch; advanced: ancestral
defense; greater: ancestral form
Related Domains death, family
CurSe of anCeStral Meddling
The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you
and meddle with your belongings and actions, either
out of a well-intentioned (but ultimately detrimental)
attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity
in circumventing the traditional means of achieving
divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of
the above. Your hair, clothing, and belongings constantly
shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.
Minor Curse One of your ancestors becomes predominant
in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each
day, roll 1d4 on Table 2–4: Ancestral Influence on page 75 to
determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This
predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type
of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions
listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a DC 4 flat
check. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect
(though you don’t lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell).
If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it’s long enough
that you can overcome the meddling, and you don’t need to
attempt a flat check.
During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter,
other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you
roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during
the encounter, roll 1d4 and change your predominant ancestor
appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the
influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.

predominant ancestor in Table 2–4.
Major Curse (11th) The flat check DC is 8, and you get the
major curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor
instead of the moderate curse benefit.
BATTLE
Warlike forces fill you with physical might and tactical
knowledge, aiming to have you uphold the glory of combat,
fight to improve the world, prepare against the necessity
of conflict, or endure the inevitability of war. You might
draw upon deities such as Gorum, Iomedae, Rovagug, the
Horseman of War Szuriel, the Queen of the Night Eiseth, the
Vudrani god Diomazul, and others, or you might find power
in the unending conflict between the armies of Heaven and
Hell, the Elemental Planes, the Outer Gods, or even the
collective spirits of those who fought in wars over the ages.
Mystery Benefit You are no stranger to the trappings of
warfare. You are trained in medium and heavy armor. At
13th level, if you gain the light armor expertise class feature,
you also gain expert proficiency in these armors.
Choose one weapon group that embodies your mystery. You
are trained in all martial weapons of that group. At 11th level,
if you gain the weapon expertise class feature, you also gain
expert proficiency for martial weapons in your chosen group,
and you become trained in advanced weapons in that group.
Trained Skill Athletics
Granted Cantrip shield
Revelation Spells initial: call to arms; advanced: battlefield
persistence; greater: heroic feat
Related Domains might, zeal
CurSe of tHe Hero’S Burden
You thrive while adrenaline flows and your life depends on
your might alone, but holding the collective battle prowess
of the ages within you leaves your body weakened after a
fight. You smell faintly of steel and blood no matter how
you try to remove or mask the scent, you appear more
muscular than you actually are, and you hear the faint clash
and clamor of battle in the distance at all times.
Minor Curse Your body languishes when you aren’t
bringing harm to your foes. You take a –2 status penalty to
AC and saving throws, but each time you make a Strike, you
can suspend these penalties until the start of your next turn.
Moderate Curse The strain of conflict wears upon your
body, even though you gain vitality from it. Making a Strike
reduces the penalty from your minor curse to –1 rather than
suspending it entirely. You gain a +2 status bonus to weapon
and unarmed damage rolls. You also gain fast healing equal to
half your level while in a non-trivial combat encounter.
Major Curse (11th) Your body proves capable of truly heroic
feats, but doing so interferes with your mental focus. Your
moderate curse’s fast healing is equal to your level, and its
damage bonus is +6. You gain a +1 status bonus to weapon and
unarmed attack rolls, but you are stupefied 2.

BONES
Your mystery imparts an understanding of death and
undeath in all their macabre complexity. You might have
had a brush with death yourself—maybe even dying and
returning to life—or carry the touch of undeath in your
blood. If you commune with deities, you might speak with
guardians of death like Pharasma and the psychopomp
ushers (the most powerful among creatures that guide
souls through the afterlife); a bringer of death like the
Mantis God Achaekek or the Horseman of the Apocalypse
Charon; or a herald of undeath such as Urgathoa.
Mystery Benefit You can cleverly leverage the subtleties of life
and death to your benefit. Each day during your preparations,
you can choose to align yourself in the confluence of positive
and negative energy so as to gain negative healing, which
means you are harmed by positive damage and healed by
negative effects as if you were undead. If you already have
negative healing, instead the DC of your recovery checks is
equal to 9 + your current dying value.
Trained Skill Medicine
Granted Cantrip chill touch
Revelation Spells initial: soul siphon; advanced: armor of
bones; greater: claim undead
Related Domains death, undeath
CurSe of living deatH
Your body is slowly decaying even though you are alive,
and using your powers furthers this unnatural living death.
You carry a touch of the grave about you, manifesting as
bloodless pallor, a faint smell of earth, or deathly cold skin.
Minor Curse Bones protrude through your skin and your
flesh rots, combining with a stench of decay and an unearthly
chill. Non-magical effects that would restore your Hit Points
only grant you half as many HP as normal.
Moderate Curse Your dead flesh continues to rot, affecting
your health. You become drained 1, and this drained condition
is cumulative with any other drained conditions you gain.
This drained condition is removed only when you Refocus;
effects that normally remove the drained condition reduce
your drained condition to drained 1 instead. In addition, you
gain resistance to poison equal to half your level. You gain a
+4 status bonus to saves against diseases, poisons, and death
effects, and if you roll a success on such a save, you get a
critical success instead.
Major Curse (11th) You stand just steps from the grave. You
become wounded 1. This wounded condition is removed only
when you Refocus; effects that normally remove the wounded
condition reduce your wounded condition to wounded 1 instead.
When you would attempt a recovery check, you can choose
to get an automatic success instead of rolling, and if you roll
a critical failure on a save against a disease, poison, or death
effect, you get a failure instead.
COSMOS
Celestial bodies great and small exert influence on you,
giving you sublime cosmic power. Perhaps you see the
glittering stars as a divine blessing, or perhaps you feel
drawn to the infinitely dark spaces between. You might
uphold deities like Desna, Sarenrae, or the deific lovers
Shizuru and Tsukiyo who represent the sun and the
moon—or you might draw power from dark entities from
beyond the stars, like certain Outer Gods, or destructive
gods of the night like Zon-Kuthon or the rat goddess Lao
Shu Po.
Mystery Benefit Your body is as much an astronomical one as
it is physical. You gain resistance equal to 2 + half your level
against all physical damage.
Trained Skill Nature
Granted Cantrip dancing lights
Revelation Spells initial: spray of stars; advanced: interstellar
void; greater: moonlight bridge
Related Domains darkness, moon
CurSe of tHe SkY’S Call
You have your head in the clouds—and not just
figuratively. Your body is drawn toward the heavens,
making you lighter and less substantial than you should
be. Your eyes glow with starry light, and your hair and
clothing float and drift around you.
Minor Curse Your unnatural lightness makes it hard to keep
your footing and interact with other physical objects. You are
enfeebled 1 and take a –2 penalty to saves and DCs against
Grapple, Shove, and other forms of forced movement.
Moderate Curse Your body is drawn further skyward.
You are enfeebled 2, and the penalty from your minor curse
increases to –3. You are treated as one size smaller for wind
effects. You gain a +2 status bonus against Trip attempts, you
only take half as much damage from falls, and you gain the

effects of the Powerful Leap and Quick Jump skill feats. You
weigh only half as much, and your Bulk, should someone need
to carry you, is also half as much.
Major Curse (11th) As your body rises, you float just above
the ground beneath you. You become enfeebled 4, and the
penalty from your minor curse increases to –4. You can walk
on liquids as if they were solid; you gain the effects of the
Cloud Jump skill feat; and you don’t leave tracks, trigger
weight-sensitive pressure plates, or otherwise connect with
the ground below you.
FLAMES
Fire lives at the center of the world, the center of the
sun, and the center of civilization. You might revere this
elemental force, siphon power from the Elemental Plane of
Fire, or venerate a collection of deities such as Asmodeus,
Sarenrae, the Tian goddess of disasters and volcanoes Lady
Nanbyo, or the elemental lord of fire Ymeri.
Mystery Benefit Like fire itself, you flicker and dance, avoiding
effects that would quench your vitality. You have expert
proficiency in Reflex saves. At 13th level, if you gain the
lightning reflexes class feature, your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to master, and when you roll a
success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
Trained Skill Acrobatics
Granted Cantrip produce flame
Revelation Spells initial: incendiary aura; advanced: whirling
flames; greater: flaming fusillade
Related Domains fire, sun
CurSe of engulfing flaMeS
You see flames and smoke wherever you look. These
flames might be imagined, or they might be a preternatural
glimpse of the metaphorical fires that empower the
entire multiverse—but you always see them. Fires flare
noticeably (though not dangerously) in your presence,
you occasionally smoke slightly, and your body is almost
painfully hot to the touch.
Minor Curse The smoke, heat, and crackling flames of your
curse fill your vision and all your other senses. Creatures
further than 30 feet are concealed from you. You can’t benefit
from effects that would allow you to ignore or mitigate this
concealment, as normal for effects of an oracular curse.
Moderate Curse Smoke and flickering visions of flame
fill your senses more completely, and harmless flickers of
obscuring flames also fill your space. You are concealed
from other creatures, though as the other creatures aren’t
cursed themselves, they can benefit from effects that would
allow them to ignore or mitigate the concealed condition, as
normal. All other creatures and objects are concealed from
you regardless of distance; however, when casting a fire spell,
you automatically succeed at the flat check for this concealed
condition for targets within 30 feet.
All your senses become imprecise beyond 30 feet, meaning
everything past 30 feet that you’d normally be able to see is
hidden from you.
LIFEBRINGER
You channel divine power into healing energy for your
allies, though it taxes your body to do so.
ABILITY SCORES
Focus on Charisma to boost your skills, and Constitution
to better withstand the effects of your curse. Wisdom
helps you understand and treat the ailments your magic
can’t heal.

================================================================================

Major Curse (11th) The flames surrounding you are no
longer simply visions. An aura of fire surrounds you in a
10-foot emanation, dealing 4d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save)
to all other creatures in the aura at the end of each of your
turns. You lose 1d6 Hit Points at the end of your turn each
round, with no save; if you have a weakness to fire, increase
the number of HP you lose by that weakness.
You can suppress your aura until the start of your next
turn by spending a single action, which has the concentrate
trait, to diminish the flames, causing neither you nor anyone
in the aura to take damage. While Refocusing to reduce your
curse, you are continually diminishing the flames, so you don’t
lose HP. The flames subside if you fall unconscious, but they
resume when you wake up unless you rested for long enough
to reset your curse. As usual for oracular curses, you can’t
mitigate or reduce the lost Hit Points in any way, though you
can still heal the lost HP normally after the fact.
LIFE
The never-ending flow of positive energy within living
beings is palpable to you. You might uphold the sanctity
of life, or perhaps you seek to undermine it. You might
draw power from the collective vitality of the world’s living
creatures, hold some connection to the Positive Energy
Plane, or revere a collection of deities including Irori,
Pharasma, Sarenrae, and the god of medicine Qi Zhong.
Mystery Benefit Your body is a deep reservoir of life energy.
At each level, you gain Hit Points equal to 10 + your
Constitution modifier from the oracle class, instead of 8 +
your Constitution modifier.
Trained Skill Medicine
Granted Cantrip stabilize
Revelation Spells initial: life link; advanced: delay affliction;
greater: life-giving form
Related Domains death, healing
CurSe of outpouring life
Life energy flows outward from you and connects you
to all living things, but you expend your vital essence to
do so. Your presence comforts the ill and injured, causes
scars to fade slightly, spurs new growth in plants, and
otherwise infuses your surroundings with vitality.
Minor Curse As your life force seeps outward, it becomes
more difficult to keep your body functioning. Effects that
restore Hit Points to you take a status penalty equal to half
your level (minimum 1) to the number of HP you recover.
Moderate Curse The flow of life energy away from you can’t
be reversed. In addition to the effects of your minor curse,
you can’t be healed by magical effects originating from other
creatures. However, if you are unconscious, magical effects
can restore you to 1 HP (but no higher). You are affected
normally by healing elixirs, potions, and other items. When
you cast heal and all your targets are living creatures, you roll
d12s instead of d8s for the amount of healing.
Whenever you finish casting a non-cantrip spell, you restore
Hit Points equal to the spell level to your choice of either one
KEY TERMS
You’ll see these key terms in many oracle class features.
Cursebound: Spells with this trait increase the severity
of your oracular curse when cast. Usually only revelation
spells have this trait. You can’t cast a cursebound spell if
you don’t have an oracular curse.
Fortune and Misfortune: Fortune and misfortune effects
can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more
than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play
on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you
must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the
GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune
effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll,
the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.
OTHER FOCUS SPELLS
You might gain focus spells that aren’t revelation spells and
don’t have the cursebound trait (by taking an archetype,
for instance). Since these spells aren’t drawing on the
same divine mystery as your revelation spells, casting
them doesn’t increase the effects of your curse. They still
cost Focus Points as normal, and you still can’t increase
your focus pool to hold more than 3 Focus Points.
target of the spell or the creature nearest to you. You can’t heal
yourself in this way. This healing has the healing, necromancy,
and positive traits, as well as the tradition trait of the spell.
Major Curse (11th) Life energy tears through you to empower
your magic. Some of your spells carry positive energy with
them. Each time you use a spell slot to cast a 5th-level or higher
spell that takes 2 or more actions to cast, you disperse positive
energy in a 30-foot burst with the effects of a 3-action heal spell
with a level 4 lower than that of the spell you cast. This healing
occurs immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. You don’t
benefit from this healing. Instead, you lose double the number
of Hit Points rolled for the heal spell.
LORE
Knowledge and information come freely to you. You
might use this lore to gain power or perhaps to understand
the divine mysteries of the multiverse. You might have a
conduit to the fabled Akashic Record, maintain a subtle
telepathic connection to the collective subconscious of
all living creatures, or follow in the footsteps of deities
such as Abadar, Irori, Nethys, Irori’s scholarly nephew

Gruhastha, the fey triune goddess of fate Magdh, or the
lawful aeon god-figure known as the Monad.
Mystery Benefit You hold more mystical knowledge within
you than most. You have one additional spell in your
repertoire of each level you can cast.
Trained Skill Occultism and one Lore skill of your choice
Granted Cantrip read aura
Revelation Spells initial: brain drain; advanced: access lore;
greater: dread secret
Related Domains knowledge, truth
CurSe of torrential knowledge
You have a link to true divine knowledge, but your mortal
mind struggles to process and act on what you know.
Loose materials around you, such as dust, grains of rice,
and droplets of water, slowly shift to form strange runes
or faint indecipherable writing, and you sometimes speak
unintelligible truths or statements in unknown languages
without realizing it.
Minor Curse You take a –4 penalty to initiative, as trying to
process a surge of information about what’s happening around
you slows your ability to respond to it.
Moderate Curse The flow of information through your mind
grows. The attention you divert to process this huge influx
of information means you are always flat-footed. At the start
of each of your turns, you automatically make one check to
Recall Knowledge as a free action. This uses a skill of your
choice that has the Recall Knowledge action, using a result
equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus in that skill (with no other
bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
Major Curse (11th) The massive flow of information
clouding your mind overwhelms your ability to communicate
with others. You can understand all languages, but you can’t
speak, use linguistic effects, or otherwise communicate with
your allies. If you Cast a Spell with a verbal component, you
must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell is lost. You gain
a +4 status bonus on saving throws against linguistic effects.
TEMPEST
The fury of the wind and waves pounds in your heart,
whether your power flows from natural storms, a conduit
to the elemental Planes of Air and Water, or through
reverence of deities such as Gozreh, the tengu god of
storms Hei Feng, the demon lord Dagon, or the elemental
lords of air and water.
Mystery Benefit You can see perfectly through wind and
water, and you send electric charges through both air and
water. You never take penalties to Perception from wind,
rain, fog, or other precipitation, or from looking through
water or being underwater, and such conditions don’t cause
anything to be concealed from you.
When you deal physical damage with a non-cantrip air
or water spell, you deal an additional 1 electricity damage
per spell level.
Trained Skill Nature
Granted Cantrip electric arc
Revelation Spells initial: tempest touch; advanced: thunderburst;
greater: tempest form
Related Domains Air, Water
CurSe of tHe perpetual StorM
You are the center of your own tiny tempest, ever
surrounded by wind and rain that worsens the more you
tap into your elemental powers. Even when you are calm
and at rest, your hair and clothing are blown about by
gentle winds, you are slightly damp, and your touch often
comes with a static shock.
Minor Curse An aura of a whirling storm whips up in a
5-foot emanation around you and in your space. The aura puts
out small non-magical fires 1 round after they’re lit or brought
into your aura.
Electrical energy builds up within your storm, turning you
into a lightning rod; you gain weakness 2 to electricity, and
electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a
creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you
were wearing metal.
Moderate Curse Your minor curse’s aura expands to a 10-
foot emanation and carries rain on the winds. The whirling
winds impose a –2 circumstance penalty on ranged attack
rolls using physical ammunition that target you or originate
from you. Your weakness to electricity increases to 5 or half
your level, whichever is greater, but torrential rain grants you
an equal amount of fire resistance.
Major Curse (11th) Your minor curse’s aura expands to a
15-foot emanation and grows stronger. High winds blowing
outward in the aura impede creatures’ progress. The aura is
difficult terrain for Large and smaller creatures on the ground,
and for Huge or smaller flying creatures. You aren’t affected by
this difficult terrain.
The electricity arcing through you becomes dangerous. Any
creature that touches you, including with a touch spell or a
melee unarmed attack, takes 1d6 electricity damage.
Oracle Feats
At every level that you gain an oracle feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
GLEAN LORE [one-action]
FEAT 1
DIVINATION
DIVINE
ORACLE
SECRET
You tap into the collected lore of the divine, accessing a variety
of potentially useful information. Attempt a Religion check to
understand the information you gain. The GM sets the DC
(similar to the DC to Recall Knowledge), potentially adjusting
the DC of the check for topics far removed from your mystery.
Critical Success You comprehend the lore accurately or gain a
useful clue from the divine about your situation.
Success You learn two pieces of information about the topic,
one true and one erroneous, but you don’t know which
is which.

or misleading clue.
Critical Failure You recall two pieces of incorrect information
or gain two erroneous or misleading clues.
REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
You can extend your spells’ range. If the next action you use is
to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by
30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell
normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
WIDEN SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn’t have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst
with a smaller radius isn’t affected). Add 5 feet to the length
of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and
add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
ORACLE
Study broadens your range of simple spells. Add two additional
cantrips from your spell list to your repertoire.
DIVINE AEGIS [reaction]

ABJURATION
DIVINE
ORACLE
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect,
but you haven’t rolled yet.
You summon divine energy to shield yourself, offering
protection against other traditions but leaving you exposed
to other divine effects. Until the beginning of your next turn,
you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against
non-divine magical effects, but you also take a –1 circumstance
penalty to saves against divine effects.
DOMAIN ACUMEN
FEAT 2
ORACLE
Every oracle’s mystery touches on a divine domain of the
deities that fuel it; you can access that power. Choose one of
the domains associated with your mystery for which you don’t
already have an initial domain spell. You gain an initial domain
spell from that domain, which you cast as a revelation spell.
It gains the cursebound trait. Increase the number of Focus
Points in your focus pool by 1.
4TH LEVEL
BESPELL WEAPON [free-action]
FEAT 4
ORACLE
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-
cantrip spell.
You siphon the residual energy from the last spell you cast
into one weapon you’re wielding. Until the end of your turn,
the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of a type depending on
the school of the spell you just cast.
• Abjuration force damage
• Conjuration or Transmutation same type as the weapon
• Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental damage
• Evocation a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the
spell didn’t deal damage
• Necromancy negative damage
DIVINE ACCESS
FEAT 4
ORACLE
Your ability to tap into divine magic surpasses the spells
traditionally available to you (the divine spell list). Choose one
deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains. Add
up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to
your spell list. You can select from these spells when you add
or swap spells in your spell repertoire.
Special You can select this feat more than once. You can’t
choose the same spells more than once, but you can choose
a different domain or a different deity with the same domain
you’ve previously selected with this feat.
VISION OF WEAKNESS
FEAT 4

points. You learn the vision of weakness revelation spell (page
234). Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
6TH LEVEL
ADVANCED REVELATION
FEAT 6
ORACLE
Prerequisites initial revelation spell
You learn an advanced revelation spell associated with your
mystery. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus
pool by 1.
SPIRITUAL SENSE
FEAT 6
DIVINATION
DIVINE
ORACLE
You have a vague connection to the Ethereal Plane that
enables you to notice spirits. While you’re exploring but not
Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts
that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures
on the Ethereal Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual
essence such as celestials, fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and
spirits inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet
of you. This applies while Searching, while Seeking, and on
the automatic secret check you gain while exploring even
if you aren’t Searching. You can still notice spirits only on a
successful check, and you can’t see them if they’re more than
5 feet inside an object.

When you notice a creature with your Spiritual Sense,
you also learn its location, making it hidden to you if it had
been undetected.
STEADY SPELLCASTING
FEAT 6
ORACLE
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your
concentration when you Cast a Spell. If another creature’s
reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC
15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
DEBILITATING DICHOTOMY
FEAT 8
ORACLE
You can give others a glimpse of the impossible conflicts and
unchecked power that courses through your body. You learn
the debilitating dichotomy revelation spell (page 231). Increase
the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
READ DISASTER
FEAT 8
DIVINATION
EXPLORATION
ORACLE
PREDICTION
You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine
mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents
of the future. You gain the effects of augury, except you
learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of “weal” are
instead “nothing,” and results of “weal and woe” are instead
“woe.” If you are legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute
to Read Disaster.
10TH LEVEL
ORACULAR WARNING [free-action]
FEAT 10
DIVINATION
DIVINE
ORACLE
Trigger You are about to roll initiative.
You have a flash of insight about impending danger related
to one ally, and you can shout or gesture to warn that ally of
the threat a moment before it materializes. One ally of your
choice can roll twice for initiative and use the better result;
this is a fortune effect. If you are legendary in Religion, you
receive two visions and can warn two allies, granting them
both this benefit.
You are momentarily thrown off by the divine insight,
however, and you must roll twice for your initiative roll
and use the worse result. This is a misfortune effect.
The two effects are tied together; if you would avoid the
misfortune effect for any reason, or if any of your allies
would negate their fortune effect, your Oracular Warning
does nothing. Depending on whether you use gestures
or call out, this action gains either the visual or auditory
trait, respectively.
QUICKENED CASTING [free-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
Frequency once per day
If your next action is to cast an oracle cantrip or an oracle spell
that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level oracle
spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by
1 (minimum 1 action).
SURGING MIGHT [one-action]
FEAT 10
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your
spell to overcome enemies’ resistances. If the next action
you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of
the target’s resistance equal to your level against all the
following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful,
negative, and positive. This applies to all damage the spell
deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by
an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy
within a field of life. This doesn’t cause the spell to ignore
immunities, only resistances.
12TH LEVEL
DOMAIN FLUENCY
FEAT 12
ORACLE
Prerequisites initial domain spell
You command a deep understanding of the divine domains
related to your mystery. Choose one of the domains associated
with your mystery for which you have an initial domain spell.
You gain an advanced domain spell from that domain, which
you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound
trait. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool
by 1.
GREATER REVELATION
FEAT 12
ORACLE
Prerequisites initial revelation spell
You learn a greater revelation spell associated with your
mystery. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus
pool by 1.
MAGIC SENSE
FEAT 12
DETECTION
DIVINATION
DIVINE
ORACLE
You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your
vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though
you were always using a 1st-level detect magic spell. This
detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you
gain the benefits of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things
you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You
can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or
the end of your turn.
14TH LEVEL
FORESTALL CURSE [one-action]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
Frequency once per day
You’ve learned to forestall the effects of your curse somewhat.
If the next action you use is to cast a revelation spell, the
severity of your curse doesn’t increase.
Advanced Player's Guide
80
80

PAGE 82
================================================================================

MYSTERIOUS REPERTOIRE
FEAT 14
ORACLE
Your mystery holds unknowable depths of magic not always
associated with the divine. You can have one spell in your
spell repertoire not on the divine spell list, in addition to
spells you’ve added to your spell list from feats like Divine
Access. You cast that spell as a divine spell. You can swap
which spell you add and from which tradition as you could
any other oracle spell, but you can’t use this feat to have more
than one spell from another tradition in your spell repertoire
at the same time.
16TH LEVEL
DIVERSE MYSTERY
FEAT 16
ORACLE
Prerequisites Advanced Revelation
You have broadened your understanding of the divine and
can tap into the wonders of a different mystery. Select one
revelation spell from a mystery other than your own. You
can choose only an initial revelation spell or an advanced
revelation spell.
When you cast this revelation spell, you gain the effects
of the minor curse from that mystery in addition to the
normal curse effects you gain from casting a revelation
spell. This additional minor curse effect remains until
your next daily preparations. Any ability that lets you
cast a revelation spell without increasing the severity of
your curse also prevents you from gaining this additional
curse effect.
You can’t cast your chosen revelation spell if any of the
following conditions are true: its mystery’s curse effects
directly conflict with or negate the effects of your own
mystery’s curse, the curse would have no effect on you (for
example, removing an ability from your original mystery
that you lack), or either of these criteria would be met once
you finish Casting the Spell.
PORTENTOUS SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 16
MANIPULATE
MENTAL
METAMAGIC
ORACLE
VISUAL
Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, esoteric gestures,
and other captivating effects that befuddle your foes. If
the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, any creature that
attempts to use a reaction triggered by your Cast a Spell
activity takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and
skill checks rolled as part of the reaction. In addition, if the
spell includes a spell attack roll or requires a saving throw,
creatures you hit or that fail their saves are fascinated with
you until the start of your next turn.
18TH LEVEL
BLAZE OF REVELATION
FEAT 18
ORACLE
Your mind and body can, for a short time, withstand the
devastation of overdrawing your curse. When you would
become overwhelmed by your curse, you can forestall the
effects for up to 1 minute. On each of your turns during
that time, you can cast one revelation spell granted by
your mystery (but not domain spells, spells from Diverse
Mystery, or other revelation spells you gained from other
abilities) without spending Focus Points or taking any
further negative effects.
At the end of the minute, the durations of any revelation
spells you cast during that time end, you take the normal
effects from being overwhelmed by your curse, and you
must attempt a DC 40 Fortitude save.
Critical Success You aren’t otherwise affected.
Success You are drained 2 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Failure You are drained 4 and can’t reduce or remove this
condition until your next preparations.
Critical Failure You die.
DIVINE EFFUSION
FEAT 18
ORACLE
The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of
divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles. Twice per
day, you can cast a spell after you’ve run out of spell slots of
the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this
feat must be of different spell levels.
20TH LEVEL
MYSTERY CONDUIT
FEAT 20
ORACLE
The power of your mystery enables you to cast more than just
revelation spells. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower
that has no duration, instead of spending a spell slot, you can
advance the effects of your oracular curse in the same manner
as when you cast a revelation spell. A spell cast in this way
gains the cursebound trait.
ORACULAR PROVIDENCE
FEAT 20
ORACLE
Prerequisites oracular clarity
Your mystery grants you access to deep reserves of truly
miraculous divine power. You gain an additional 10th-level
spell slot.
PARADOXICAL MYSTERY
FEAT 20
ORACLE
Prerequisites Greater Revelation
The truest depths of your divine mystery are fathomless
and contradictory, granting you changing powers that even
you can barely begin to fathom. Each day during your daily
preparations, choose one basic or advanced domain spell from
any domain from the Core Rulebook or another domain to
which you have access, or any initial or advanced revelation
spell from another mystery. You gain that spell as a revelation
spell until your next daily preparations, and it has the
cursebound trait.

Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons.
For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace.
You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves
with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant
ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm
fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.
HIT POINTS
10 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number of
HP by this number at 1st level and every
level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
DEXTERITY
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Dexterity.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing
moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers
while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your
swashbuckler’s style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or
beguile, distract, or frighten them.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept
socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to
leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold,
sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection.
IN DOWNTIME...
You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to
learn new techniques. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an
organization in your name or establish a following of admirers.
YOU MIGHT...
• Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live
up to the image you present.
• Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation.
• Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade.
• Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your style.
• Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your
deadly blade.

SWASHBUCKLER

PAGE 85
================================================================================

Class Features
You gain the following abilities as a swashbuckler.
Abilities gained at higher levels list the level next to the
features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
PANACHE
You care as much about the way you accomplish something
as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place.
When you perform an action with particular bravado, you
can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular,
deadly maneuvers. This state of flair is called panache, and
you are either in a state of panache or you are not.
You gain panache by successfully performing the skill
check associated with specific actions that have a bit of
flair, including Tumble Through (Core Rulebook 240)
and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler’s
style (see below). At the GM’s discretion, after succeeding
at a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as
swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, you
also gain panache if your result is high enough (typically
the very hard DC for your level, but the GM can choose a
different threshold).
While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus
to your Speeds and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks
to Tumble Through or to take any actions that give you
panache due to your style. The precise strike class feature
(page 85) also causes you to deal extra precision damage
while you have panache. Powerful finisher actions, including
Confident Finisher (page 85), can be used only while you
have panache and cause you to lose your panache.
Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat
encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.
SWASHBUCKLER’S STYLE
As a swashbuckler, you have your own distinctive style that
enables you to gracefully handle everyday events and life-
or-death situations alike. Choose a swashbuckler’s style.
This style determines the additional actions you use to gain
panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that
action. The styles presented in this book are as follows.
Battledancer
To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you
command your foes’ attention with mesmerizing motions.
You are trained in Performance and gain the Fascinating
Performance skill feat (Core Rulebook 261). You gain
panache during an encounter when the result of your
Performance check to Perform exceeds the Will DC of an
observing foe, even if the foe isn’t fascinated.
Braggart
You boast, taunt, and psychologically needle your foes.
You are trained in Intimidation. You gain panache
during an encounter whenever you successfully
Demoralize a foe.
Fencer
You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to
lead your foes into inopportune attacks. You are trained
in Deception. You gain panache during an encounter
whenever you successfully Feint or Create a Diversion
against a foe.
gymnast
You reposition, maneuver, and bewilder your foes

Advanced Player's Guide

PAGE 88
================================================================================

KEY TERMS
You’ll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities.
Finisher: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that
use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have
panache, and you lose your panache immediately after
performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can’t use
actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.
Some actions with the finisher trait also grant an effect on
a failure. Effects added on a failure don’t apply on a critical
failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose
to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might
do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you
enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you
remain in that stance for some time. A stance lasts until you
get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance,
whichever comes first. After you use an action with the
stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can
enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
Battledancer: You can Step as a free action immediately
after the finisher.
Braggart: If the foe was temporarily immune to your
Demoralize, their temporary immunity ends.
Fencer: The foe is flat-footed until your next turn.
Gymnast: If the foe is grabbed, restrained, or prone,
you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal
to twice the number of weapon damage dice.
Wit: The foe takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack
rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
SWASHBUCKLER EXPERTISE
9TH
You perform swashbuckling techniques with exceptional
flair, making them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank
for your swashbuckler class DC increases to expert.
CONTINUOUS FLAIR
11TH
While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat,
you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation.
Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that
would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would
grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the
exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by
the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.
VIGILANT SENSES
11TH
Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
for Perception increases to master.
IMPROVED EVASION
13TH
Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency
rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you
roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure
instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against
a damaging effect, you take half damage.
LIGHT ARMOR EXPERTISE
13TH
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and
unarmored defense increase to expert.
WEAPON MASTERY
13TH
You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency
ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed
attacks increase to master.
GREATER WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
15TH
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
KEEN FLAIR
15TH
You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even
well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or
unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency,
if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you
critically succeed instead.
RESOLVE
17TH
You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
ETERNAL CONFIDENCE
19TH
As a swashbuckler at the peak of your skill, you swell
with confidence and bravado in every attack. Your
proficiency rank for your swashbuckler class DC
increases to master.
When you Strike as part of a finisher or Opportune
Riposte, you can give the Strike the failure effect from
the Confident Finisher action, including the increase from
Precise Finisher (page 91) if you have that feat. You can
do so only if the Strike uses a weapon or unarmed attack
that you could use for Confident Finisher.
LIGHT ARMOR MASTERY
19TH
Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your
ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light
armor and unarmored defense increase to master.
Swashbuckler Feats
At each level that you gain a swashbuckler feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.

all attack rolls against you before the end of its next turn.

NIMBLE DODGE [reaction]
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger A creature you can see targets you with an attack.
Requirements You aren’t encumbered.
You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance
bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
ONE FOR ALL [one-action]
FEAT 1
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster
an ally’s efforts. Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action
counts as sufficient preparation to Aid that ally. When you use
the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll Diplomacy in place
of the usual check. If your swashbuckler’s style is wit and your
Diplomacy check to Aid meets or exceeds the very hard DC for
your level, you gain panache.
YOU’RE NEXT [reaction]
FEAT 1
EMOTION
FEAR
MENTAL
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
Trigger You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points.
After downing a foe, you promise another you’re coming after
them next. Attempt an Intimidation check with a +2 circumstance
bonus to Demoralize a single creature that you can see and that
can see you. If you’re legendary in Intimidation, you can use this
as a free action with the same trigger.
2ND LEVEL
AFTER YOU [free-action]
FEAT 2
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger You’re about to roll initiative.
You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of
incredible confidence. You don’t roll initiative; instead you
voluntarily go last. You gain panache. If more than one
character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use
the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters
act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can
choose whichever order they want.
ANTAGONIZE
FEAT 2
SWASHBUCKLER
Your taunts and threats earn your foes ire. When you
successfully Demoralize a creature, its frightened condition
can’t decrease to less than 1 at the end of its turn until it either
uses a hostile action against you or can no longer observe or
sense you for at least 1 round.
1ST LEVEL
BUCKLER EXPERTISE
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
You’ve learned a flexible way to position your buckler to provide
more protection. When you Raise a Shield to gain a circumstance
bonus to AC from a buckler, increase the bonus from +1 to +2.
DISARMING FLAIR
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
It’s harder for your foes to regain their grip when you knock
their weapon partially out of their hands. When you succeed
at an Athletics check to Disarm, the circumstance bonus and
penalty from Disarm last until the end of your next turn, instead
of until the beginning of the target’s next turn. The target can
use an Interact action to adjust their grip and remove this effect.
If your swashbuckler’s style is gymnast and you succeed at
your Athletics check to Disarm a foe, you gain panache.
DUELING PARRY [one-action]
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Requirements You are wielding only a single one-handed melee
weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
You can parry attacks against you with your weapon. You gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn
as long as you continue to meet the requirements.
FLYING BLADE
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites precise strike
You’ve learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown
weapons as easily as melee attacks. When you have panache,
you apply your precise strike damage on ranged Strikes you
make with a thrown weapon within that weapon’s first range
increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or finesse
weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged
Strike for Confident Finisher and any other finisher that includes
a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.
FOCUSED FASCINATION
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Fascinating Performance
When you use Fascinating Performance in a combat encounter,
you need only a success, rather than a critical success, to
fascinate your target. This works only if you’re attempting
to fascinate one target. For example, if you were an expert in
Performance, you could choose to target multiple creatures
normally or target one creature and fascinate it on a success.
GOADING FEINT
FEAT 1
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites trained in Deception
When you trick a foe, you can goad them into overextending
their next attack. On a Feint, you can use the following success
and critical success effects instead of any other effects you
would gain when you Feint; if you do, other abilities that

CHARMED LIFE [reaction]
FEAT 2
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Charisma 14

When danger calls, you have a strange knack for coming
out on top. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the
triggering save.
FINISHING FOLLOW-THROUGH
FEAT 2
SWASHBUCKLER
Finishing a foe maintains your swagger. You gain panache
if your finisher brings the target to 0 HP (or brings the
highest-level target to 0 HP, if your finisher attacks multiple
targets).
TUMBLE BEHIND
FEAT 2
SWASHBUCKLER
Your tumbling catches your foe off guard. When you Tumble
Through successfully, the foe you Tumbled Through is flat-
footed against the next attack you make before the end of
your turn.
UNBALANCING FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 2
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
You attack with a flashy assault that leaves your target off
balance. Make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the
target is flat-footed until the end of your next turn.
4TH LEVEL
FLAMBOYANT ATHLETE
FEAT 4
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites expert in Athletics
Your panache allows you to perform incredible feats: climbing,
swimming, and leaping far beyond your normal capacity. While
you have panache, you gain the following benefits.
• You gain climb and swim Speeds equal to half your
land Speed.
• The DCs of your High Jumps and Long Jumps decrease by
10. This doesn’t combine with other abilities that reduce
those DCs.
• The distance you can move with a vertical Leap increases
to 5 feet. Your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to
15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or to 20 feet if your
Speed is at least 30 feet.
GUARDIAN’S DEFLECTION [reaction]
FEAT 4
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger An ally within your melee reach is hit by an attack,
you can see the attacker, and a +2 circumstance bonus to
AC would turn the critical hit into a hit or the hit into a miss.
Requirements You are wielding a single one-handed melee
weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
You use your weapon to deflect the attack against your ally,
granting a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the

or the triggering hit into a miss.
IMPALING FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 4
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
You stab two foes with a single thrust or bash them together
with one punch. Make a bludgeoning or piercing melee Strike
and compare the attack roll result against the AC of up to two
foes. One foe must be adjacent to you, and the other foe must
be adjacent to and directly behind the first foe, in a straight
line from your space. Roll damage once and apply it to each
creature you hit. An Impaling Finisher counts as two attacks
when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
LEADING DANCE [one-action]
FEAT 4
MOVE
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites trained in Performance
Requirements You are adjacent to an enemy.
You sweep your foe into your dance. Attempt a Performance
check against an adjacent enemy’s Will DC. If your
swashbuckler’s style is battledancer and you succeed, you
gain panache.
Critical Success Your foe is swept up in your dance. You both
move up to 10 feet in the same direction, remaining adjacent
to one another. Your movement doesn’t trigger reactions
from the target (and the target’s movement doesn’t trigger
reactions because it’s forced movement).
Success As critical success, but you both move only 5 feet.
Failure The foe doesn’t follow your steps. You can move 5 feet
if you choose, but this movement triggers reactions normally.
Critical Failure You stumble, falling prone in your space.
SWAGGERING INITIATIVE [free-action]
FEAT 4
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger You are about to roll initiative.
You swagger readily into any fight—even an ambush. You
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your initiative roll and can
Interact to draw a weapon.
TWIN PARRY [one-action]
FEAT 4
SWASHBUCKLER
Requirements You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.
You use your weapons to parry. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to AC until the start of your next turn, or a +2 circumstance bonus
if either weapon has the parry trait. You lose this circumstance
bonus if you no longer meet this feat’s requirement.

ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY [reaction]
FEAT 6
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You swat a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and
the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty,
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
COMBINATION FINISHER
FEAT 6
SWASHBUCKLER
You combine a series of attacks with a powerful finishing blow.
Your finishers’ Strikes have a lower multiple attack penalty: –4
(or –3 with an agile weapon) if it’s the second attack on your turn,
or –8 (or –6 with an agile weapon) if it’s the third or subsequent
attack on your turn, instead of –5 and –10, respectively.
PRECISE FINISHER
FEAT 6
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Confident Finisher
Even when your foe avoids your Confident Finisher, you can
still hit a vital spot. On a failure with Confident Finisher, you
apply your full precise strike damage instead of half.
VEXING TUMBLE [one-action]
FEAT 6
SWASHBUCKLER
You tumble around your foes, expertly avoiding their
reactions. Stride up to half your Speed and roll an Acrobatics
check. Compare the result to the Reflex DC of each foe

the foe, the foe is flat-footed to you until the end of your turn,
and you gain panache.
Success This movement doesn’t trigger reactions from the foe,
and you gain panache.

enter the creature’s reach; if you began in the creature’s
reach, you don’t move.
8TH LEVEL
BLEEDING FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 8
FINISHER

DUAL FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 8
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
Requirements You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.
You split your attacks. Make two melee Strikes, one with each

Strike is made with a non-agile weapon, it takes a –2 penalty.
Increase your multiple attack penalty only after attempting
both Strikes.
NIMBLE ROLL
FEAT 8
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Nimble Dodge
You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save,
in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance
bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.
When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack
fails or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically
succeed at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10
feet as part of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains
the move trait. You can use Nimble Roll while Flying or
Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.
STUNNING FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 8
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
You attempt a dizzying blow. Make a melee Strike. If you
hit, your foe must attempt a Fortitude save against your

FORTUNE
SWASHBUCKLER
When you compound panache with even more derring-do,
it somehow tends to work out. When you already have
panache, you can roll twice and use the higher result on
checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache
applies (Tumble Through and any skill actions listed in your
swashbuckler’s style).

The target is enfeebled 2. On a critical hit, it is also
enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
• Head The target is stupefied 2. On a critical hit, it is also
stupefied 1 for 1 minute.
• Legs The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its
Speeds. On a critical hit, it also takes a –5-foot status
penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.
12TH LEVEL
CHEAT DEATH [reaction]
FEAT 12
SWASHBUCKLER
Trigger You take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points.
Somehow you always escape the reaper by a hair’s breadth.
You avoid being knocked out or killed and remain at 1 Hit Point,
but you become doomed 1 (or increase your doomed value by
1 if you were already doomed). You can’t reduce or ignore the
doomed condition from Cheating Death. The doomed condition
from Cheating Death lasts for 10 minutes, though this doesn’t
affect the duration of any other doomed condition you have.
MOBILE FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 12
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
You attack in motion. Stride and then Strike. You can use Mobile
Finisher while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead
of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

FEAT 14
SWASHBUCKLER

When you make an Opportune Riposte, roll twice on the
attack roll and take the better result.
18TH LEVEL
INCREDIBLE LUCK
FEAT 18
FORTUNE
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Charmed Life
You always seem to bounce back from the worst. When you use
Charmed Life, roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance
bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.
LETHAL FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 18
DEATH
FINISHER
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites precise strike 6d6
You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them
outright. Make a Strike. On a success, you forego your precise
strike damage from the finisher. Instead, your target takes
additional precision damage based on a Fortitude save against
your class DC. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target’s
saving throw outcome is one degree worse.
Critical Success You deal 6 precision damage.
Success You deal 6d6 precision damage.
Failure You deal 12d6 precision damage.
Critical Failure You deal 18d6 precision damage.
PARRY AND RIPOSTE
FEAT 18
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the
slightest provocation. You can use Opportune Riposte against
an enemy who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically
fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a
finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance
bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait, Dueling Parry, or
Twin Parry.
20TH LEVEL
INEXHAUSTIBLE COUNTERMOVES
FEAT 20
SWASHBUCKLER
You can react whenever a foe leaves a gap in their
defenses. At the start of each enemy’s turn, you gain an
extra reaction you can use only during that turn to perform
an Opportune Riposte, or an Attack of Opportunity if you
have that reaction.
PANACHE PARAGON
FEAT 20
SWASHBUCKLER
You find opportunities to perform stylish feats in the
moments between others’ heartbeats and eye blinks. You are
permanently quickened. You can use the extra action only
to Tumble Through or perform the skill action listed in your
swashbuckler’s style as one that allows you to gain panache,
or other actions that would allow you to gain panache at the
GM’s discretion.
You stylishly leap and deliver a powerful finisher. Make a
Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump and attempt one single-action
finisher at any point during your jump; the finisher can’t be
one that includes other movement, such as Mobile Finisher.
Immediately after the finisher, you fall to the ground if you’re
in the air, even if you haven’t reached the maximum distance
of your jump. If the distance you fall is no more than the height
of your jump, you take no damage and land upright. When
attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a Flamboyant
Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and increase
the maximum distance to double your Speed, rather than just
your Speed.
IMPOSSIBLE RIPOSTE
FEAT 14
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Opportune Riposte
Your ripostes can deflect attacks back at their source. You can
use Opportune Riposte with a trigger of “A foe outside of your
reach critically fails an attack roll against you” in addition to
its usual trigger. When you use Opportune Riposte with this
new trigger against a ranged attack, your Strike deflects some
of the triggering effect back toward its source. Compare the
result of your attack roll to the AC of the triggering foe. On
a hit, you deal the normal amount of damage for your Strike,
but the damage type changes to that of the triggering attack.
For instance, if you used Opportune Riposte to deflect a ray of
frost, your Strike would deal cold damage instead of its normal
damage type.
PERFECT FINISHER [one-action]
FEAT 14
FINISHER
FORTUNE
SWASHBUCKLER
You focus your panache into an impeccable assault. Make a
Strike, rolling the attack roll twice and using the better result.
TWINNED DEFENSE [one-action]
FEAT 14
STANCE
SWASHBUCKLER
Prerequisites Twin Parry
Requirements You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.
You’re always ready to use your off-hand weapon to interfere
with attacks against you. While you are in this stance, you
constantly gain the benefits of the Twin Parry action.
16TH LEVEL
DEADLY GRACE
FEAT 16
SWASHBUCKLER
Your graceful attacks are especially powerful. When you
score a critical hit with an agile or finesse melee weapon
that has the deadly trait, you double the number of dice
from that trait. When you wield an agile or finesse melee
weapon that doesn’t have the deadly trait, it gains the
deadly d8 trait instead.
FELICITOUS RIPOSTE
FEAT 16
FORTUNE
SWASHBUCKLER
You take advantage of your foe’s openings with uncanny odds.

You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal,
but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you
don’t entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful
fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural
being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a
special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see
fit, though you’re never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron’s larger plan.
HIT POINTS
6 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number of
HP by this number at 1st level and every
level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
INTELLIGENCE
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Intelligence.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies
and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or
harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters,
and you might call upon your patron’s magic to charm or deceive others.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells
to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through
its own considerable set of exceptional abilities.
IN DOWNTIME...
You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to
learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers,
and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community.
YOU MIGHT...
• Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron’s goals, why they
chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans.
• Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the
spells your patron provides.
• View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance,
depending on its personality.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying
you’ll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power3).
• Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping
them directly or by hampering their adversaries.
• Take care not to offend you, fearful that you’ll place a malicious hex on them if
you’re angered.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a witch. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to the class features you gain at 1st level, you
have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
PATRON
You weren’t born with the power to cast spells, nor have
you spent years in devotion to tomes, deities, or mystical
secrets. Your power comes through a potent being that has
chosen you as their vessel to carry forth some agenda in
the world. This entity is typically mysterious and distant,
revealing little of their identity and motivations, and they
grant you spells and other magical powers through a
familiar, which serves as a conduit for their power.
A patron might be a deity or demigod, a coven of
powerful hags, a fey lord, an archdevil, or a similarly
powerful entity, or perhaps multiple such figures working
in tandem. As you gain more of your patron’s power, you
might learn more about who or what they are—certain
combinations of themes and lessons suggest particular
patrons or agendas—but patrons empower witches for
their own secretive reasons, which they rarely reveal in full.
At 1st level, choose your patron’s theme, which determines
your spellcasting tradition, a skill, a special cantrip you
gain, and a spell added to your familiar. The patron themes
presented in this book are found on page 99.
FAMILIAR
Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature
that teaches you and facilitates your spells. This familiar
follows the rules beginning on page 217 of the Core
Rulebook, though as it’s a direct conduit between you and
your patron, it’s more powerful than other familiars. Your
familiar gains an extra familiar ability, and gains another
extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.
Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells
your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must
commune with your familiar to prepare your spells
each day using your witch spellcasting (see below).
Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-
level spells, and one additional spell determined by your
patron’s theme. You choose these spells from the common
spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from
other spells of that tradition you gain access to.
Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your
familiar two new spells of any level you can cast, chosen
from common spells of your tradition or others you gain
access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.
Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your
patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition’s spell list
by physically consuming a scroll of that spell in a process
that takes 1 hour. You can use the Learn a Spell exploration
activity to prepare a special written version of a spell,
which your familiar can consume as if it were a scroll. You
and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach
your familiar a spell from another witch’s familiar. Both
familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the
spell must be on your spellcasting tradition’s spell list, and
you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in
the form of an offering to the other familiar’s patron. You
can’t prepare spells from another witch’s familiar.
If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during
your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be
a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a
new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your
former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar’s death
doesn’t affect any spells you have already prepared.
WITCH SPELLCASTING
Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides
you the power to cast spells. You can cast spells using
the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material,
somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.
Advanced Player's Guide
96
96

PAGE 98
================================================================================

At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells
and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar
knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you
cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The
number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a witch, your number of
spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from
spell slots increase, as shown in Table 2–7: Witch Spells
per Day on page 98.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies
roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell
attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.
HeigHtening SpellS
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the
spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when
they are heightened to certain levels.
CantripS
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell
slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened
to half your level rounded up—this is
usually equal to the highest level of
spell you can cast as a witch. For
example, as a 1st-level witch, your
cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as
a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are
3rd-level spells.
HEXES
Your patron and familiar teach you
special spells called hexes. A
hex is a short-term effect drawn
directly from your patron’s
magic. As such, you can cast
only one hex each turn; attempts to
cast a second hex spell on that turn fail
and the spellcasting actions are lost.
Hexes are a type of focus spell.
It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a
focus spell, and you start with
a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You
refill your focus pool during your daily
preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus
Point by spending 10 minutes using the
Refocus activity to commune with your familiar.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to
half your level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require
spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots.
Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase
the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can
never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for
focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook.
You learn the phase familiar hex (page 239), which you
can cast as a reaction to protect your familiar from harm.
You learn most other hexes from witch lessons (page 99).

Hex CantripS
Hex cantrips are special hexes that don’t cost Focus Points,
so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still
cast only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition
to the cantrips you choose with your witch spellcasting and
aren’t counted toward your prepared cantrips. Your hex
cantrips are determined by your patron theme (page 99).

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to

score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.

can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting.
Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can’t be used
for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell
slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You don’t
gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can
take the Patron’s Truth feat (page 105) to gain a second slot.
Patron Themes
Each patron has a theme, regardless of their nature or
identity. This theme describes the forces over which

You can select from these lessons when a feat or other effect grants you a major lesson.
Lesson of Death: You gain the curse of death hex, and your familiar learns raise dead.
Lesson of Renewal: You gain the restorative moment hex, and your familiar learns
field of life.
Witch Feats
At each level that you gain a witch feat, you can select one of the following feats. You
must satisfy any prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
CACKLE
FEAT 1
WITCH
You can extend one of your spells with a quick burst of laughter. You learn the cackle hex
(page 237). Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
CAULDRON
FEAT 1
WITCH
You can use the Craft activity to create oils and potions. You immediately gain the formulas
for four common 1st-level oils or potions. At 4th level and every 2 levels beyond that, you
gain the formula for a common oil or potion of that level or lower (a 4th-level potion if you’re
4th level, a 6th-level potion if you’re 6th level, and so on). If you have a familiar, you can
have your familiar learn these formulas rather than storing them in a formula book. Your
familiar can learn new formulas in the same way it learns new spells, and these formulas are
transferred from a slain familiar to a new familiar in the same way spells are.
You can brew a great deal of magic within your cauldron. When you Craft a batch of oils or
potions, you can make up to six in a batch instead of the usual four per batch.
COUNTERSPELL [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
WITCH
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared.
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic
to disrupt it. You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of

that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast
the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the
triggering spell.
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, primal, or occult).
REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WITCH
You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you
use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s
range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if
the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range
to 30 feet.
WIDEN SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WITCH
You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn’t have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst
with a smaller radius isn’t affected). Add 5 feet to the length
of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and
add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
WORTWITCH
FEAT 1
WITCH
You have a particular affinity for leafy plants. Your patron
grants you a leshy familiar. If you already had a familiar,
this leshy replaces your previous familiar, as if your previous
familiar had been slain. In addition, you gain the ability to
see through leaves, vines, and other foliage. You don’t take
circumstance penalties to ranged spell attacks or Perception
checks caused by foliage, and your targeted attacks don’t
require a flat check to succeed against a target concealed only
by such vegetation.
2ND LEVEL
BASIC LESSON
FEAT 2
WITCH
Your patron grants you a special lesson, revealing a hidden
facet of its nature. Choose a basic lesson from the list on page
100. You gain its associated hex, and your familiar learns the
associated spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your
focus pool by 1.
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
WITCH
Your patron recognizes your need for flexibility and versatility,
and grants you the power to prepare a wider range of simple
spells. You can prepare two additional cantrips each day.
CONCEAL SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 2

METAMAGIC
WITCH

KEY TERMS
You’ll see these key terms in many witch class features.
Hex: A hex is a short-term effect generated on the fly
from your patron’s magic, requiring your familiar to draw
from your patron. As such, you can cast only one spell with
the hex trait each turn; attempts to cast a second hex spell
on the same turn fail and the spellcasting actions are lost.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.
IN SERVICE TO THE UNKNOWN
A witch’s patron is a mysterious entity, rarely known or
understood even by the witch in that patron’s service.
The nature of the relationship between a witch and their
patron can serve as details for character development and
storytelling. When playing a witch, work with your GM to
determine the nature of your patron and how much of that
nature you know, both as a player and a character. There are
countless ways to handle a witch’s patron; the following are
just a few approaches you might take.
For a character who truly doesn’t know their patron,
you might have your GM choose your patron’s theme
and which lessons your witch learns, as the patron
determines what powers to bestow upon you as their
emissary—and these can provide clues to your patron’s
nature. You could instead give your GM a list of lessons
you’d like for your character and let the GM choose
between them, representing a negotiation between your
witch and the patron. In this case, you might choose your
patron’s theme to indicate which aspect of the patron
relates to your character, or let your GM choose the
theme. If you want to be fully in control of your abilities,
you can choose the lessons you most prefer and let the
GM tailor the identity of your patron accordingly.
Another approach is for you to craft the details of your
witch’s patron yourself. You can then provide those details
to the GM to incorporate into a larger narrative or to provide
additional flavor and roleplaying context for your character.
Your character might still remain ignorant of that patron’s
identity, even if you as a player know it. Perhaps your
character knows the nature of their patron but is cursed to
never reveal it to others. You might have willingly sworn
a pact to your patron but fear the repercussions should
others learn of that pact. Or perhaps you and your patron
are entirely forthcoming about your relationship.
Every witch is different, and no story is wrong so long
as it’s fun and engaging for everyone involved!

your speech and movement in an attempt to conceal the fact
that you are Casting a Spell. If the next action you use is to
Cast a Spell, attempt a Stealth check against one or more
observers’ Perception DCs; if the spell has verbal components,
you must also attempt a Deception check against the
observers’ Perception DC. If you succeed at your check (or
checks) against an observer’s DC, that observer doesn’t notice
you’re Casting a Spell, even though material, somatic, and
verbal components are usually noticeable and spells normally
have sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting
obvious to those nearby.
This ability hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a
ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air.
ENHANCED FAMILIAR
FEAT 2
WITCH
Prerequisites a familiar
You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can
select four familiar or master abilities each day instead of two.
Special Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a
witch to this amount.
FAMILIAR’S LANGUAGE
FEAT 2
DIVINATION
WITCH
Prerequisites a familiar
You’ve learned to speak with your familiar and other creatures
like it. You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and
use the Diplomacy skill with creatures of the same family of
animals as your familiar. For example, if your familiar were a
cat, you could gain the effects of speak with animals for any
felines (including leopards, lions, and tigers, among others).
This ability doesn’t make them more friendly than normal.
If your familiar ever changes to a different creature, you
can’t use this ability for 1 week while you absorb your new
familiar’s language.
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
LIVING HAIR
FEAT 2
WITCH
You can instantly grow or shrink your hair, eyebrows, beard,
or mustache by up to several feet and manipulate your hair
for use as a weapon, though your control isn’t fine enough for
more dexterous tasks. You gain a hair unarmed attack that
deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; is in the brawling group; and
has the agile, disarm, finesse, trip, and unarmed traits.
4TH LEVEL
ELDRITCH NAILS
FEAT 4
WITCH
Your nails are supernaturally long and sharp. You gain a nails
unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your nails are
in the brawling group and have the agile and unarmed traits.
You can etch your nails with runes with the same cost and
restrictions as for etching runes onto handwraps of mighty
blows; runes etched onto your nails apply to nails unarmed
attacks with both hands but not to other unarmed attacks.
You can deliver hexes through your nails. When you
successfully cast a non-cantrip hex that requires 2 actions
or more to cast and that doesn’t require a spell attack roll, if
your target is within your reach, as part of the spellcasting
activity you can make a nails Strike against the foe before
applying any effects of the hex. If this Strike misses, the hex
has no effect.
IMPROVED FAMILIAR
FEAT 4
WITCH
You find it easy to attract a powerful and unusual familiar to
your side. The number of abilities required to make your familiar
a specific familiar (page 147) is two lower than normal.
RITES OF CONVOCATION
FEAT 4
WITCH
Your patron grants you the power to summon other creatures
to aid you. Choose one summon spell (such as summon animal,
summon construct, and so forth) that appears on the spell
list of your spellcasting tradition. You can spend 10 minutes
in communion with your familiar to replace one spell you’ve
prepared in one of your witch spell slots with the spell you
chose, heightened to the same level. The spell you replaced
must be of at least the summon spell’s minimum spell level.
6TH LEVEL
GREATER LESSON
FEAT 6
WITCH
Your patron grants you greater knowledge. Choose a greater or
basic lesson from the list on page 100. You gain its associated
hex, and your familiar learns the associated spell. Increase the
number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
STEADY SPELLCASTING
FEAT 6
WITCH
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your
concentration when you Cast a Spell. If another creature’s
reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC
15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
WITCH’S CHARGE
FEAT 6
DETECTION
DIVINATION
WITCH
You forge a magical link with another creature, granting you
awareness of that creature’s condition and creating a conduit
for spellcasting. During your daily preparations, you can
designate one willing creature as your charge. You are always
aware of your charge’s direction from you, its distance from
you, and any conditions affecting it. In addition, you can cast
spells with a range of touch on your charge from a range of 30
feet. These effects persist until your next daily preparations.
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).

INCREDIBLE FAMILIAR
FEAT 8
WITCH
Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar
Your familiar is imbued with even more magic than other
familiars. You can select a base of six familiar or master
abilities each day, instead of four.
Special Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a
witch to this amount.
MURKSIGHT
FEAT 8
WITCH
Your vision pierces through non-magical fog, mist, rain, and
snow. You don’t take circumstance penalties to ranged attacks
or Perception checks caused by non-magical precipitation, and
your targeted attacks don’t require a flat check to succeed
against a target concealed only by such effects.
WITCH’S BOTTLE
FEAT 8
WITCH
Prerequisites Cauldron
You spend 10 minutes and 1 Focus Point brewing a special
potion containing the power of one of your hexes that targets
a creature. A creature that consumes this potion is targeted
by the hex. If the hex has a sustained duration and you have
cackle (page 237), you can cast cackle into the bottle just
before you seal it. If you do, the hex’s duration is extended
as if you had cast cackle the round after the hex was cast
(typically this extends the duration by 1 round). Your cackling
laugh sounds out when the potion is unsealed.
Any potion you create this way loses its power the next
time you make your daily preparations. While the potion is in
your possession, you can render it inert using a single action
that has the concentrate trait. You can’t regain the Focus Point
you spent to create the potion (or the Focus Point you spent
to cast cackle) until the potion is consumed or loses its magic.
10TH LEVEL
MAJOR LESSON
FEAT 10
WITCH
Your patron grants you even greater secrets. Choose a major,
greater, or basic lesson from the list on page 100. You gain its
associated hex, and your familiar learns the associated spell.
Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you’re 14th
level or higher, and a third time if you’re 18th level or higher.
Choose a different lesson each time.

If your next action is to cast a witch cantrip or a witch spell
that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level witch
spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by
1 (minimum 1 action).
TEMPORARY POTIONS
FEAT 10
WITCH
Prerequisites Cauldron
During your daily preparations, you can create a batch of two
temporary oils or potions using a formula you know. These
items follow the normal rules to Craft them, except for the time
they take, with some additional restrictions. They must both
be the same type of oil or potion, and their level must be 6 or
more levels lower than your level. Any items you create this
way become inert bottles of liquid the next time you make your
daily preparations, and any remaining effects of the temporary
items end. A temporary oil or potion has no value.
If you have master proficiency in your tradition’s spell DCs,
you can create a batch of three temporary oils or potions
during your daily preparations, and if you have legendary
proficiency, you can create a batch of four.
WITCH’S COMMUNION

WITCH
Prerequisites Witch’s Charge
You can keep watch over multiple charges. Each day during
your preparations, you can designate a number of charges
equal to your Intelligence modifier instead of just one.

You use your familiar’s senses as easily as your own. You
project your senses into your familiar. When you do, you lose
all sensory information from your own body, but you can sense
through your familiar’s body until you Dismiss the effect.
While projecting your senses in this way, you can converse
telepathically with your familiar if it understands a language.
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
HEX FOCUS
FEAT 12
WITCH
Your patron’s teachings have allowed you to achieve a deeper
focus. If you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last
time you Refocused, you recover 2 Focus Points when you
Refocus instead of 1.

that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that
spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell
affects only the original caster, even if it’s an area spell or it
would normally affect more than one creature. The original
caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the
reflected spell as normal.
RITES OF TRANSFIGURATION
FEAT 14
WITCH
You can adapt your patron’s power to transform other
creatures into forms more befitting their behavior or your
whims. Your familiar learns baleful polymorph, even if baleful
polymorph isn’t on your tradition’s spell list. By spending 10
minutes in communion with your familiar, you can replace
one spell of 6th level or higher you’ve prepared in one of
your witch spell slots with a baleful polymorph spell of the
same level.
16TH LEVEL
EFFORTLESS CONCENTRATION [free-action]
FEAT 16
WITCH

You maintain your active spells with hardly a thought. You
immediately gain the effects of a Sustain a Spell action, allowing
you to extend the duration of one of your active witch spells.
SIPHON POWER [free-action]
FEAT 16
WITCH
Frequency once per day
Requirements You haven’t acted yet on your turn.
You draw upon the reservoir of your patron’s magic that
resides within your familiar. During your turn, you can cast
one spell your familiar knows that was granted by your
patron’s theme or lessons without spending a spell slot to do
so (or even having it prepared). The spell must be at least 1
level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast.
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
18TH LEVEL
HEX WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
WITCH
Prerequisites Hex Focus
Focus flows from your patron each time you commune with
your familiar. You can recover 3 Focus Points when you
Refocus instead of 1 if you have spent at least 3 Focus Points
since the last time you Refocused.
SPLIT HEX [one-action]
FEAT 18
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WITCH
You siphon some of the power from an offensive hex you
cast to direct it at a second target as well. If the next action
you use is to Cast a Spell to cast a harmful hex with a single
target, reduce its level by 2 (making it 2 levels lower than the
maximum spell level you can cast). If you do, you can select a
second target for that hex to affect.
20TH LEVEL
HEX MASTER
FEAT 20
WITCH
You embody the link to your patron so completely that you
can cast your hexes in rapid succession. You are no longer
limited to casting only a single hex each turn. In addition,
when you cast cackle to sustain a hex, you gain the effects of
Sustain a Spell for all your active hexes that have a duration
of sustained.
PATRON’S TRUTH
FEAT 20
WITCH
Prerequisites patron’s gift
You have mastered the greatest secrets of your patron’s magic
and learned a fundamental truth about your patron, even if
their identity still remains a mystery. You gain an additional
10th-level spell slot.
WITCH’S HUT
FEAT 20
WITCH
Your home is an animated structure that obeys your
commands. By performing a rite that takes 1 day, you create
an animated object from a hut, small house, covered wagon,
tent, or similar construction of up to Huge size.
The hut uses your AC, saving throw modifiers, and
Perception modifier and has 150 HP and Hardness 10. It has
the construct armor ability, meaning once it’s reduced to less
than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged
by a critical hit, its AC is reduced by 4 until it is repaired.
The hut can’t attack or attempt skill checks. You can give
the hut a command as a single action, which has the auditory
and concentrate traits; after 1 round of reconfiguring itself,
the hut then follows that command until you give it a
different command.
• Guard The hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet
using your Perception modifier and screams if it spots
any.
• Lock Each entrance to the hut is sealed with a lock spell.
• Move The hut gains a Speed of 60 feet, growing giant
bird or bone legs, if necessary, and follows an extremely
basic movement command you give it, such as “follow
me” or “move that direction.” While perfectly suitable for
overland travel, the hut’s broad movements and 1-round
delay on response time are too imprecise to predictably
direct in a combat encounter or other situation where
seconds and precise locations count.
• Hide The hut appears to be a normal, mundane object of
its type. This is a 10th-level illusion effect.
You can have only one hut at a time. If you animate a new
hut, your previous hut immediately reverts to its original,
mundane form. If you die, the hut continues following the last
order you gave it indefinitely.

================================================================================

TOXICOLOGIST RESEARCH FIELD
In addition to the research fields in the Core Rulebook,
you can select the toxicologist research field to study and
formulate all sorts of dangerous toxins. The toxicologist
field grants the following benefits.
Research Field (1st Level): You specialize in toxins
and venoms of all types. You start with the formulas
for two common 1st-level alchemical poisons in your
formula book, in addition to your other formulas. You
can apply an injury poison you’re holding to a weapon
you’re wielding as a single action, rather than as a
2-action activity, and you can change the DCs of your
infused poisons to your class DC if it’s higher.
ALCHEMIST
Ever innovating, alchemists constantly invent new scientific marvels, weapons,
and techniques that push the boundaries of both possibility and safety.
Field Discovery (5th Level): When using advanced
alchemy to make poisons during your daily preparations,
you can spend one batch of reagents to create three
poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the
same poison.
Perpetual Infusions (7th Level): Choose two common
1st-level alchemical poisons.
Perpetual Potency (11th Level): Choose two common
5th-level or lower alchemical poisons.
Greater Field Discovery (15th Level): You can apply
two different injury poisons to the same weapon,
though not to a piece of ammunition. The two poisons
can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you
can’t use the poisons made without spending a batch
of infused reagents via perpetual infusions. Applying
the two poisons requires a separate action to apply
each poison. Once completed, you combine the two
poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the
lower of the two poisons’ DCs. This double poison is
only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the
poisons have a different number of stages, the double
poison has a number of stages equal to the poison
with the lower number of stages. The target takes
the effects of both poisons for its current stage.
Perpetual Perfection (17th Level): Choose two
common 11th-level or lower alchemical poisons.
ALCHEMIST FEATS
Alchemists can choose from the following feats.
1ST LEVEL
SUBTLE DELIVERY
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You can capably deliver toxins with a blowgun. Your blowgun
Strikes can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage
due to a creature’s resistance. If you critically succeed at
an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you’ve
poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison’s initial
save, the target critically fails instead.
2ND LEVEL
DEMOLITION CHARGE
FEAT 2
ALCHEMIST
You can rig your bombs to inanimate objects in order
to cause destruction to the surrounding area. As an
activity that takes 1 minute, you attach between
one and four bombs to an inanimate object within your
Advanced Player's Guide
106

================================================================================

reach, such as a chest, door, wall, or column. This creates
a hazard in one square occupied by or adjacent to the
inanimate object, and the hazard’s Stealth DC to detect it
and Thievery DC to disable it are equal to your class DC.
The hazard has the following reaction, which you can also
trigger as a single action so long as you are within 30
feet of the hazard. The hazard retains its potency until it’s
triggered, until the inanimate object moves from its space,
or until you make your next daily preparations, whichever
comes first.
Fire in the Hole [reaction] Trigger A creature moves into the
hazard’s space; Effect The hazard explodes, dealing the
bombs’ damage and splash damage to the inanimate object.
Combine this damage for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses, and this damage ignores an amount of the
object’s Hardness equal to your level. Any creatures adjacent
to the hazard take the bombs’ splash damage, similarly
combined for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
As a reminder, since you didn’t throw the bombs, Calculated
Splash and similar effects don’t apply.
4TH LEVEL
HEALING BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 4
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You craft an elixir of life using Quick Alchemy, and
that elixir is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced
alchemy level.
By adding a special catalyst, you transform a healing elixir
into a topical projectile. You grant the elixir the bomb trait.
If you throw an elixir of life bomb at a willing target, you
hit even on a failure, though not on a critical failure. If your
Strike with this elixir bomb hits a living target, the target
regains Hit Points as if it had consumed the elixir. On a
critical success, the target also gains the elixir’s item bonus
to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute.
TENACIOUS TOXINS
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
Your victims tend to expire long before your poisons, since
the latter have been specifically formulated to last longer.
The maximum duration of any poison you create increases
by an amount equal to the poison’s stage 1 interval, to a
maximum of twice the poison’s maximum duration.
6TH LEVEL
STICKY POISON
FEAT 6
ALCHEMIST
A combination of additional viscosity and careful
application keeps your weapons poisoned even when
suffering significant wear and tear. If your Strike with a
poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your
target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your
Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5
flat check. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned.
If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt
a DC 17 flat check. On a success, your weapon remains
poisoned until the end of your next turn.
8TH LEVEL
PERPETUAL BREADTH
FEAT 8
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites perpetual infusions
You have expanded your supply of near-infinite items.
Choose a research field. Add one item from the list of options
available to that field from perpetual infusions, or two items
if you choose your own field. If you have perpetual potency
or perpetual perfection, you gain an additional item (or items
if you chose your own field) appropriate to the field you
chose, for instance a higher-level version of the bomb you
chose or a new poison.
PINPOINT POISONER
FEAT 8
ALCHEMIST
Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your
poisons. When you successfully Strike a flat-footed creature
with a poisoned weapon or expose a flat-footed creature to
an inhaled poison, the flat-footed condition also gives that
creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against
that poison.
10TH LEVEL
UNSTABLE CONCOCTION
FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
You can create extraordinary—albeit volatile—alchemical
wonders, though they have an unfortunate tendency to
violently explode when you use them. When you use
Quick Alchemy, you can create an alchemical item from
your formula book whose level is up to 2 higher than your
advanced alchemy level. You can spend up to 3 additional
batches of infused reagents when creating this item to
stabilize it. Upon activating the item, attempt a DC 10 flat
check; for every additional batch of infused reagents you
spent to create the item, reduce this DC by 2. On a success,
the item functions normally. On a failure, the item explodes,
dealing force damage to the user equal to twice the item’s
level (doubled on a critical failure).
16TH LEVEL

================================================================================

Superstition Instinct
A deep distrust of magic drives you to forgo and
counter the metaphysical nonsense of spellcasters.
Whether you’re a member of a superstitious family
or culture that distrusts magic, a warrior in constant
battle against wizards and witches, a survivor of a
magical accident that instilled an intense aversion in
your mind and body, or a scion of a bloodline known
for its magic resistance, your rage is inimical to magic.
This makes you an excellent mage hunter but slow
to trust practitioners of magical arts. Your extremely
restrictive anathema grants you powers beyond those
of other instincts.
ANATHEMA
Willingly accepting the effects of magic spells (including
from scrolls, wands, and the like), even from your allies,
is anathema to your instinct. You can still drink potions
and invest and activate most magic items you find,
though items that cast spells are subject to the same
restrictions as all other spells. If an ally insists on using
magic on you despite your unwillingness, and you have
no reason to believe they will stop, continuing to travel
with that ally of your own free will counts as willingly
accepting their spells (as do similar circumstances) and
thus is also anathema to your instinct.
SUPERSTITIOUS RESILIENCE (INSTINCT ABILITY)
While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to all saves
against magic. Increase your damage from Rage from
2 to 4 against creatures that can cast spells. Once every
10 minutes, when you Rage, you regain Hit Points
equal to the temporary Hit Points you gain from that
Rage action.
SPECIALIZATION ABILITY
7TH
Increase the damage from Rage from 4 to 8 against
creatures that can cast spells. If you have greater raging
specialization, instead increase the damage from Rage
to 12 against creatures with spells and 8 against other
creatures.
RAGING RESISTANCE
9TH
Choose two associated magical traditions: arcane and
occult, arcane and primal, divine and occult, or divine
and primal. The resistance from your raging resistance
class feature applies against all damage you take from
spells cast with these two traditions of magic, regardless
of the type of damage dealt by the spell.
Barbarian Feats
At each level that you gain a barbarian feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ADRENALINE RUSH
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
RAGE
In the heat of battle, you are capable of amazing feats of
strength. While you are raging, increase your encumbered
and maximum Bulk limits by 2; you also gain a +1 status
bonus to Athletics checks to lift heavy objects, Escape, and
Force Open.
DRACONIC ARROGANCE
FEAT 1
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites dragon instinct
Few can sway you from your goals while the fury of combat
fills you. While raging, you gain a +2 status bonus to saving
throws against emotion effects.
2ND LEVEL
BASHING CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 2
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You smash, bust, and charge through solid obstacles without
hesitation. Stride twice. Once during your movement, if
your movement passes through or ends adjacent to a door,
window, fence, wall, or similar obstacle, you can attempt
an Athletics check to Force Open the obstacle with a +1
circumstance bonus to the roll; on a failure, your movement
ends at that obstacle.
4TH LEVEL
BARRELING CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe.
You Stride, attempting to move through your enemies’ spaces
and make a melee Strike. Roll an Athletics check and compare
the result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space
you attempt to move through during your Stride, moving
through its space on a success but ending your movement
before entering its space on a failure. You can use Barreling
Charge to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride, as
long as you have the corresponding movement type.
BARBARIAN
Through the new superstition instinct, a healthy distrust of magic makes
you deadlier and more resilient to spellcasters that dare challenge you.

OVERSIZED THROW [two-actions]
FEAT 4
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You have one or more hands free.
With a great heave, you seize a piece of your surroundings,
such as a boulder, log, table, wagon, or chunk of earth, and
hurl it at your foes. The object must be your size or one size
smaller than you, and it must not have too much Bulk for
you to lift it in the first place. Make a ranged Strike with the
object; regardless of the result, the object takes the same
amount of damage it would deal on a success. The object is a
simple ranged weapon that deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage,
has a range increment of 20 feet, and has the thrown weapon
trait. The damage increases to 2d10 if you have weapon
specialization in simple weapons, or 3d10 if you have greater
weapon specialization.
SPIRITUAL GUIDES [reaction]
FEAT 4
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
Prerequisites spirit instinct
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail, but don’t critically fail, a Perception check or
a skill check.
Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the
spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are
raging. Sometimes they’re even helpful. You can heed the
spirits’ guidance to reroll the triggering check, using the second
result even if it’s worse.
SUPERNATURAL SENSES
FEAT 4
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites Acute Scent or precise or imprecise scent
Your scent is preternaturally sharp, and you can always
rely on your sense of smell to help guide you when your
vision is compromised. When you target a concealed or
hidden opponent while you are raging, you reduce the DC
of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or to 9 for a
hidden one.
6TH LEVEL
INNER STRENGTH [one-action]
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
RAGE
Your strength is part of your rage, so as long as your anger
remains, you can gather your strength and rage to overcome
any sort of enfeeblement. You reduce your enfeebled
condition’s value by 1.
MAGE HUNTER [reaction]
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites superstition instinct
Trigger A creature within your reach Casts a Spell.
You use your hatred of magic to lash out at the sight of
spellcasting, allowing you to interrupt an enemy’s spell.
Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the
attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the spell.

================================================================================

NOCTURNAL SENSE
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites Acute Scent, or precise or imprecise scent and
low-light vision
Your senses gain even greater clarity. While raging, you gain
darkvision if you don’t already have it, and the range of your
imprecise scent increases to 60 feet.
SCOURING RAGE [free-action]
FEAT 6
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites an instinct that allows you to change your
additional damage from Rage to a different damage type
Trigger You Rage.
You emit a powerful surge of instinctual energy when you
unleash your potential. Each adjacent creature takes damage
equal to your level (basic Fortitude save against your class DC)
of the same type as your additional damage during that Rage.
8TH LEVEL
DISARMING ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
RAGE
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You attack with enough force to knock the weapon out of
your foe’s hands. Make a melee Strike; if you hit, you can
attempt an Athletics check to Disarm that foe.
FOLLOW-UP ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You used your previous action to make a
melee Strike that missed.
Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined
to succeed. Make a Strike with the same weapon, adding the
effects of the backswing and forceful weapon traits.
FRIENDLY TOSS [two-actions]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
MANIPULATE
RAGE
Requirements You are adjacent to an ally and have one or
more hands free.
You toss your friends around the battlefield. Pick up an
adjacent ally of your size or smaller and throw them to
an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. Their
movement doesn’t trigger reactions. Your ally ends this
movement on their feet and doesn’t take damage from the
fall. If your ally ends this movement within melee reach of
at least one enemy, they can make a melee Strike against an
enemy within their reach as a reaction.
INSTINCTIVE STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
BARBARIAN
MANIPULATE
RAGE
Prerequisites Acute Scent or precise or imprecise scent
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all
of your senses to pinpoint your opponent’s location. Make a
melee Strike against an opponent that isn’t hiding its scent
with an effect like negate aroma. This attack ignores any flat
check required due to the target being concealed or hidden.
10TH LEVEL
DETERMINED DASH [two-actions]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Nothing can keep you from your enemy. Stride twice. During
this movement you ignore difficult terrain, greater difficult
terrain, and any effects that would impose a penalty to
Speed. You can attempt an Athletics check instead of an
Acrobatics check to Balance when moving across narrow
surfaces or uneven ground, using the same DC. This doesn’t
prevent you from being harmed by hazardous terrain. You
can increase the number of actions this activity takes to 3 to
Stride three times instead.
IMPRESSIVE LANDING [reaction]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
Trigger You fall at least 10 feet and land on a solid surface.
You slam into the ground, shattering it around you. Treat
the fall as 10 feet shorter. You land on your feet. All
adjacent spaces become difficult terrain, and creatures in
those spaces when you land take 5 bludgeoning damage
as the debris hits them and are flat-footed until the start
of their next turn.
OVERPOWERING CHARGE
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites Barreling Charge
You trample your foes as you charge past them. When you
use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a
creature’s space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage
equal to your Strength modifier. If you critically succeed, the
creature takes twice this amount of damage and becomes
flat-footed until the end of your next turn.
RESOUNDING BLOW [two-actions]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
bludgeoning damage.
You strike your enemy in the head with such force that their
ears ring. Make a melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals
damage, the target is deafened until the start of your next
turn (or for 1 minute on a critical hit).
SILENCING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
INCAPACITATION
RAGE
A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent.
Make a melee Strike against a foe. The foe must succeed at a
Fortitude save against your class DC.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It’s
stunned 1 and its speech is raspy and hard to understand.
It must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to use linguistic
actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the
end of its next turn.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is stunned 3
instead of stunned 1.

TANGLE OF BATTLE [reaction]
FEAT 10
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Trigger You critically hit an adjacent enemy.
Your incredibly vicious Strike pulls you right in close, giving
you the opportunity to grab your foe. Attempt to Grapple the
triggering enemy.
12TH LEVEL
EMBRACE THE PAIN [reaction]
FEAT 12
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Trigger A creature damages you with a melee attack.
Ignoring your pain, you reach out and grab the creature or
weapon that caused you harm. Attempt an Athletics check to
Grapple the triggering creature or to Disarm the creature of
the triggering weapon.
SUNDER SPELL [two-actions]
FEAT 12
ATTACK
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
RAGE
Prerequisites superstition instinct
You draw upon your superstitious fury to destroy a spell. Make
a Strike with a melee weapon or an unarmed attack against
a creature, object, or a spell manifestation (such as the wall
created by wall of fire or the guardian from spiritual guardian).
If your Strike hits, you can attempt to counteract a single spell
or magical effect on the target. Your counteract level for this
attempt is equal to half your level rounded up, and you use the
result of your attack roll for the counteract check.
Whether or not you succeed at your Strike, the target
becomes temporarily immune to your Sunder Spell for 24 hours.
UNBALANCING SWEEP [three-actions]
FEAT 12
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
OPEN
You make a great sweep about yourself, knocking creatures
off their feet and away from you. Choose up to three adjacent
foes and choose whether to Shove or Trip all three of them.
Whichever of the two options you choose, roll a separate
Athletics check against each foe, performing the same action
against each foe. Each attempt counts toward your multiple
attack penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you
have made all the attempts.
14TH LEVEL
IMPALING THRUST [two-actions]
FEAT 14
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
piercing damage.
You impale your enemy and hold them in place with your
weapon. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. If
the Strike hits and deals damage, your target is grabbed
until they successfully Escape, you attack with the required
weapon, or you Release the required weapon, whichever
comes first. When the target is no longer grabbed, they take
persistent bleed damage equal to the number of weapon
damage dice.
SUNDER ENCHANTMENT
FEAT 14
BARBARIAN
Prerequisites Sunder Spell
You can focus your superstition to break the magic of an
item, in addition to destroying freestanding spells and those
active on creatures. When you Sunder a Spell, you can
instead attempt to counteract either an unattended magic
item or one of your target’s magic items. If your counteract
attempt succeeds, the item becomes a mundane item of its
type for 10 minutes. If you target an artifact, an intelligent
item, or a particularly powerful item, your counteract
attempt automatically fails.
16TH LEVEL
FURIOUS VENGEANCE [reaction]
FEAT 16
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Prerequisites fury instinct
Trigger An enemy within your melee reach critically hits you
with a melee Strike.
Your enemy’s blow fuels your rage and provokes your
immediate retaliation. Make a melee Strike against the
triggering enemy.
PENETRATING PROJECTILE [two-actions]
FEAT 16
BARBARIAN
FLOURISH
RAGE
Requirements You are wielding a ranged or thrown weapon
that deals piercing damage.
Your projectiles are unhindered by flesh and bone. Make a
ranged Strike against each creature in a 30-foot line. These
attacks ignore lesser cover, cover, and greater cover granted
by creatures. Roll damage only once and apply it to each
creature you hit. Each attack counts toward your multiple
attack penalty, but don’t increase your penalty until you have
made all your attacks.
SHATTERING BLOWS
FEAT 16
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you
are raging, your melee Strikes ignore 5 points of an object’s
Hardness. If you have the devastator class feature, you
instead ignore 10 points of an object’s Hardness.
20TH LEVEL
UNSTOPPABLE JUGGERNAUT
FEAT 20
BARBARIAN
You have become a brutal, unstoppable force of nature, able
to shrug off mortal wounds with ease. You gain resistance
equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier to all damage,
and your resistance from raging increases to 8 + your
Constitution modifier.
In addition, if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points while raging,
you can end your rage as a reaction to stay at 1 Hit Point. If
you do, you become wounded 2 (or increase your wounded
condition by 2 if you are already wounded).

BARD
This section presents new feats for bards of any muse, as well as a new muse
that draws inspiration from the furious, calamitous dance of battle.
New Muse
The following muse is available to bards in addition to
those found on page 97 of the Core Rulebook.
WARRIOR
The battlefield is your stage, the clang of steel, your song.
Your muse engages in countless battles, whether reveling
in combat or resigned to its necessity. If your muse is a
creature, it might be an otherworldly soldier, such as a
planetar, archon, cornugon, or purrodaemon. If it’s a deity,
it might be Gorum. As a bard with a warrior muse, you train
for battle in addition to performance, and you prepare
your allies for the dangers of battle. You might even wade
into the thick of things with them. You gain the Martial
Performance feat and add fear to your spell repertoire.
New Bard Feats
1ST LEVEL
HYMN OF HEALING
FEAT 1
BARD
You learn the hymn of healing composition spell (page 228),
which imbues your music with rich melodies that help your
allies recover from harm.
MARTIAL PERFORMANCE
FEAT 1
BARD
Prerequisites warrior muse
Your muse has taught you how to handle a wider variety of
weapons than most bards, empowering you to effortlessly
blend your performance into combat even with the most
inelegant tools. You become trained with all martial weapons.
If you gain the bard weapon expertise class feature, your
proficiency rank with martial weapons increases to expert.
WELL-VERSED
FEAT 1
BARD
You’re resilient to performative influences that aren’t your
own. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against effects with the auditory, illusion, linguistic, sonic, or
visual traits.
2ND LEVEL
DIRECTED AUDIENCE
FEAT 2
BARD
You can shape the area of your composition spells. Whenever
you cast a composition spell whose area is an emanation,
you can change the spell’s area to a cone 10 feet larger, to a
maximum of twice the original area. For example, you could
modify a composition spell that affects a 30-foot emanation
to affect a 40-foot cone, but a 5-foot emanation could only
become a 10-foot cone.
SONG OF STRENGTH
FEAT 2
BARD
Prerequisites warrior muse
Your performances inspire strength in your allies. You learn
the song of strength composition cantrip (page 228).
4TH LEVEL
COMBAT READING [one-action]
FEAT 4
BARD
SECRET
You use a performer’s cold reading techniques, aura reading,
and other tricks to discover your foe’s strengths and
weaknesses. The GM rolls a secret Occultism check for you
against the Deception or Stealth DC (whichever is higher) of
an enemy of your choice who is engaged in combat and isn’t
concealed from you, hidden from you, or undetected by you.
The GM might apply a penalty for the distance between you
and the enemy. The enemy is then temporarily immune to
your Combat Reading for 1 day.
Critical Success The GM chooses and tells you two of the
following pieces of information about the enemy: which of
the enemy’s weaknesses is highest, which of the enemy’s
saving throws has the lowest modifier, one immunity the
enemy has, or which of the enemy’s resistances is highest.
In the event of a tie, the GM should pick one at random.
Success The GM chooses one piece of information from the
above list to tell you about the enemy.
Critical Failure The GM gives you false information (the GM
makes up the information).
COURAGEOUS ADVANCE [one-action]
FEAT 4
AUDITORY
BARD
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites warrior muse
With a rousing call, you exhort an ally to advance. If your
next action is to cast the inspire courage composition
cantrip, one ally who gains a status bonus from the spell can
immediately use a reaction to Stride.
RITUAL RESEARCHER
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
BARD
Prerequisites enigma muse, expert in Occultism
Careful research into the art of rituals has made you better
at performing them. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Advanced Player's Guide

================================================================================

all primary and secondary checks you attempt as part of
casting a ritual.
6TH LEVEL
ASSURED KNOWLEDGE
FEAT 6
BARD
Prerequisites enigma muse
You can procure information with confidence. Whenever you
Recall Knowledge using any skill (including Bardic Lore), you
can forgo rolling your check to instead receive a result of
10 + your proficiency bonus (don’t apply any other bonuses,
penalties, or modifiers). As long as you are an expert in a skill,
you meet the prerequisites for the Automatic Knowledge
skill feat in that skill, even if you don’t have Assurance in
that skill.
DEFENSIVE COORDINATION [one-action]
FEAT 6
AUDITORY
BARD
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites warrior muse, Inspire Defense
Like the storied heroes who persist in the face of
overwhelming odds, you and your allies will hold the line.
If your next action is to cast the inspire defense composition
cantrip, you can Raise a Shield, and one ally who gains a
status bonus from the spell can immediately use a reaction
to Raise a Shield.
EDUCATE ALLIES [reaction]
FEAT 6
ABJURATION
BARD
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Well-Versed
Trigger An ally benefiting from one of your composition
spells is subject to an effect with the auditory, illusion,
linguistic, sonic, or visual trait.
You tweak the properties of your composition spell to
convey a bit of your defensive knowledge. All allies affected
by your composition spell gain your +1 circumstance bonus
from Well-Versed until the start of your next turn. Teaching
your allies also bolsters your own skills; your personal
circumstance bonus from Well-Versed also increases to +2
until the start of your next turn.
SONG OF MARCHING
FEAT 6
BARD
You learn the song of marching composition cantrip (page
228), which enables you and your allies to cross vast
distances without strain.
8TH LEVEL
ACCOMPANY [reaction]
FEAT 8
BARD
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
Trigger An ally within 30 feet Casts a Spell.
You use your performances to supplement an ally’s
spellcasting, providing magical energy for their spells.
Attempt a Performance check, using a very high DC for the
ally’s level (Core Rulebook 503–504), and either spend a
Focus Point (if the triggering spell is a focus spell) or expend
a spell slot at least 1 level higher than the triggering spell.
If you succeed at the Performance check, your ally’s spell
doesn’t cost the Focus Point or spell slot.
CALL AND RESPONSE [one-action]
FEAT 8
AUDITORY
BARD
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Your composition takes the form of a call-and-response
chant, which lets your allies continue the effect without
you. If your next action is to cast a composition cantrip with
a duration of 1 round, it becomes a call. While the spell is
active, one ally affected by the spell can respond to your
call as a single action that has the auditory and concentrate
traits to extend the spell’s duration by 1 round. Only one
ally can respond to a given call, and responding to the ally’s
response has no additional effect.
COURAGEOUS OPPORTUNITY [reaction]
FEAT 8
AUDITORY
BARD
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites warrior muse
Trigger A creature within your reach uses an auditory effect,
manipulate action, or move action; makes a ranged attack;
or leaves a square during its move action.
Requirements You are affected by inspire courage.
You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to
lash out at a foe. Make a melee Strike against the triggering
creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a
manipulate action, the action is disrupted.
SOULSIGHT
FEAT 8
BARD
Your muse has opened your senses to the world beyond. You
gain spiritsense as an imprecise sense with a range of 60
feet. Spiritsense enables you to sense the spirits of creatures,
including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and
haunts within the listed range. As with your hearing and
other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate
an undetected creature. As spiritsense detects spiritual
essence, not physical bodies, it can detect spirits projected
by spells such as project image or possessing otherwise
soulless objects. It can’t detect soulless bodies, constructs,
or objects, and like most senses, it doesn’t penetrate through
solid objects.
10TH LEVEL
ANNOTATE COMPOSITION
FEAT 10
BARD
EXPLORATION
LINGUISTIC
By putting composition to paper, you can create a source of
stirring words or song that others can read and understand.
You spend 10 minutes and 1 Focus Point to transpose a
composition spell on a special scroll that you or another
creature can later activate. This composition spell must take a
single action to cast. If the chosen composition spell requires
a Performance check as part of the casting, the GM rolls this
check as a secret check when you annotate your score. If you

have inspire heroics or lingering performance and the chosen
composition spell allows, you can also use one of those spells
to modify the annotated composition, with the GM rolling the
secret Performance check. If you do, you spend an additional
Focus Point, even if the secret check fails.
Any creature that can read the language you used when
annotating your composition can Activate the Item by
spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
This produces the effects of the composition as though the
activating creature had Cast the Spell.
A composition you create this way loses its power the
next time you make your daily preparations. While the
composition is in your possession, you can render it inert
using a single action that has the concentrate trait. You can’t
regain the Focus Points you spent to create the annotated
composition until it is activated or loses its magic.
COURAGEOUS ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 10
AUDITORY
BARD
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites warrior muse
With a mighty shout, you can stir an ally to attack. If
your next action is to cast the inspire courage composition
cantrip, one ally who gains a status bonus from the spell can
immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike.
ODE TO OUROBOROS
FEAT 10
BARD
You learn the ode to ouroboros composition spell (page 228),
which enables you to temporarily spare your allies from death.
SYMPHONY OF THE UNFETTERED HEART
FEAT 10
BARD
You learn the symphony of the unfettered heart composition
spell (page 228), which enables you to protect an ally against
incapacitating conditions.
12TH LEVEL
ENIGMA’S KNOWLEDGE
FEAT 12
BARD
Prerequisites Assured Knowledge
Your muse whispers knowledge to you at all the right times.
You gain the benefits of the Automatic Knowledge skill feat
with any skill you can use to Recall Knowledge. As per the
special clause in the Automatic Knowledge feat, you can still
only use Automatic Knowledge once per round.
REVERBERATE [reaction]
FEAT 12
BARD
Trigger You would take sonic damage from a spell.
You can manipulate the acoustics around you to deflect
sonic damage back at its source. Attempt a Performance
check against the spell DC of the creature that cast the
triggering spell.
Critical Success You reduce the triggering damage by an
amount up to four times your level. The caster takes sonic
damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in
this way.
Success As critical success, but you reduce the triggering
damage by an amount up to twice your level.
Critical Failure You misdirect the sonic waves at yourself,
taking twice the triggering damage.
SHARED ASSAULT
FEAT 12
BARD
Prerequisites Courageous Assault
In the triumph of battle, you can share the glory with
another ally. When the ally you chose for Courageous
Assault critically succeeds at the Strike granted by that
action, another ally affected by your inspire courage
composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make
a melee Strike. Since the second ally wasn’t the ally you
chose for Courageous Assault, this effect doesn’t continue
to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds
at their Strike.
14TH LEVEL
EARWORM
FEAT 14
BARD
EXPLORATION
By endlessly repeating a motif, you implant an earworm, a
memorable song that repeats over and over again in your
allies’ heads, preparing them to respond to it later. Choose
a composition cantrip and spend 10 minutes repeating
a melody, chant, speech, series of motions, or a similar
performance that embodies that cantrip. This activity gains
the traits appropriate to the type of performance. You
implant the earworm within all allies who can see or hear
you (as appropriate for the type of performance) for the
entire activity.
Once you’ve created the earworm, you can attempt a
Performance check as a free action to activate it. This check
uses a very hard DC of a level equal to that of the highest-
level target of the earworm present at the time of activation
(Core Rulebook 503–504). On a success, you cast the cantrip
on all allies who learned the earworm and can perceive
your performance; on a failure, the earworm is corrupted
and lost. Because it is based on the earlier repetitions, you
can’t use further free actions like lingering performance or
inspire heroics to modify the activated earworm. Allies forget
the earworm after it is activated, if you spend 10 minutes
to implant another earworm, or during your next daily
preparations, whichever comes first.
TRIUMPHANT INSPIRATION [free-action]

BARD
Prerequisites warrior muse
Trigger You critically hit a foe with a melee weapon Strike or

Evil Champions
The Core Rulebook contains the rules for being a
champion of good, but just as there are champions of
virtue, there are those who champion far more unsavory
causes. The vilest of these villains dedicate themselves
to truly evil gods and revel in destruction, control, or
unfettered self-interest. While many evil champions
embraced their terrible path on its own merits, many
others were once champions of good who lost themselves
to the forces of evil and became the very thing they once
fought against.
The tenets and causes of evil follow the rules provided
in the Core Rulebook. While evil characters in general can
range from self-serving but loyal allies to the extremes of
depravity, evil champions are particularly vile, with a code
that requires, enforces, and depends upon their villainous
behavior. This means they can be extremely disruptive to
a typical game and should be accessible player character
options only in appropriate adventures or campaigns
where the group collectively decides to embrace them.
The tenets and causes of evil are uncommon options.
While the feats and actions suitable for evil champions
don’t separately list access entries, typically if your GM
grants you access to evil tenets, you also gain access to
champion actions and feats that require those tenets.
THE TENETS OF EVIL
All champions of evil alignment follow these tenets.
• You must never perform acts anathema to your
deity or willingly commit a purely good act, such
as giving something solely out of charity, casting a
good spell, or using a good item.
• You must never put another person’s needs before
your own, and you must never put your own needs
before those of your deity. Though you can perform
acts others might consider helpful, it must be done
with the expectation that it ultimately furthers your
own goals or those of your master.
EVIL CAUSES
As an evil champion, you must select one of the following
causes. Your cause must match your alignment exactly.
Your cause determines your champion’s reaction (see
below), grants you a devotion spell (page 228), and
defines part of your champion’s code.
TyranT (LawfuL EviL)
Might makes right, and you subjugate the weak to keep
them in their proper place. You gain the Iron Command
champion’s reaction and the touch of corruption
devotion spell. After the tenets of evil, add these tenets.
• Let no one who is lesser than you wield power over
you or lead you.
• Mercilessly enforce established hierarchies of
masters and servants. Topple or seize control
of illegitimate hierarchies, such as democratic
governments or the arrogant echelons of the
celestial planes, and fill power vacuums by taking
that power for yourself.
• Bind the weak to serve you. This tenet doesn’t
require you to spare foes’ lives if you think they
would be disloyal if pressed into servitude, nor does
it require you to keep more servants than you find
practical or useful.
DEsEcraTor (nEuTraL EviL)
You always take what pleases you, no matter who it
hurts, and you spread the influence of evil across all you
touch. You gain the Selfish Shield champion’s reaction
and the touch of corruption devotion spell. After the
tenets of evil, add this tenet.
• Subvert or corrupt everything in your path that
is pure and good, and sow doubt among those
upholding such ideals.
anTipaLaDin (chaoTic EviL)
You’re dishonorable, dishonest, and committed to
breaking the false hopes of kindness. You gain the
Destructive Vengeance champion’s reaction and the
touch of corruption devotion spell. After the tenets of
evil, add these tenets.
• You must not bind yourself with any law or oath
beyond that of your code (though you can still
select a champion feat with the oath trait). Act
dishonorably, take advantage of others, lie, cheat,
and steal to get what you want.
• You must destroy that which offends you and that
which stands in your way, including—and perhaps
especially—the forces of good and law that oppose
you. This tenet doesn’t force you to take action
immediately if it could mean your destruction, nor
does it require you to destroy something that might
be useful if corrupted toward your ends.
CHAMPION’S REACTION
The special reactions for evil causes are as follows: Iron
Command for tyrant, Selfish Shield for desecrator, and
Destructive Vengeance for antipaladin.
CHAMPION
Though this section also contains new options for good champions, it is
dominated by the vicious tenets and vile abilities of champions of evil.

IRON COMMAND [reaction]
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
DIVINE
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Trigger An enemy within 15 feet damages you.
You put an impertinent foe who dared harm you in their
proper place. You command your enemy to kneel before
you in obedience. If they dare to refuse, they must pay the
price in pain and anguish. The foe must choose one of the
following options.
• The enemy kneels, dropping prone as a free action.
• The enemy refuses, and you deal 1d6 mental damage
to it. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at
9th level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6
at 19th level.
In addition, your Strikes against the triggering creature
deal 1 extra damage until the end of your next turn. You
choose whether the damage type is evil or negative each
time you use this reaction. This extra damage increases to 2
at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.
SELFISH SHIELD [reaction]
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Trigger An enemy within 15 feet damages you.
Your self-interest keeps you safe. You gain
resistance against the triggering damage
equal to 2 + half your level, regardless of
damage type.
In addition, your Strikes against the
triggering creature deal 1 extra damage
until the end of your next turn. You
choose whether this extra damage is
evil or negative each time you use this
reaction. This extra damage increases to
2 at 9th level and 3 at 16th level.
DESTRUCTIVE VENGEANCE [reaction]
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Trigger An enemy within 15 feet damages you.
Bloodshed begets bloodshed as you drag your
enemy toward oblivion. You increase the amount
of damage you take by 1d6, and you deal 1d6
damage to the triggering enemy, choosing evil or
negative damage to deal to the enemy each time you
use this reaction. In addition, until the end of your
next turn, your Strikes against the triggering creature
deal 2 extra damage of the type you chose.
The damage you take and deal when you use this
reaction increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 9th
level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at
19th level. The extra damage on your Strikes
increases to 4 at 9th level and 6
at 16th level.
DIVINE ALLY
3RD
If you are a champion following
the tenets of evil and choose a blade ally
as your divine ally, you can choose the
following property runes: fearsome (page 260), returning,
or shifting.
DIVINE SMITE
9TH
Your champion’s reaction improves as follows.
Tyrant: The regrets of disobedience linger. If an enemy
refuses your Iron Command, it takes persistent evil damage
equal to your Charisma modifier.
Desecrator: If your Charisma modifier is +2 or greater,
your resistance against the triggering damage equals your
Charisma modifier + half your level.
Antipaladin: An enemy damaged by the initial damage
from your Destructive Vengeance also takes persistent evil

damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This applies only
to the damage the reaction itself deals to the triggering
creature, not the damage you deal with subsequent Strikes.
EXALT
11TH
Your champion’s reaction improves in the following
ways when you gain the exalt class feature at 11th level.
These affect enemies rather than allies, as they exalt
your dark god to bring pain upon your foes instead of
uplifting your companions.
Tyrant: When you use Iron Command, each enemy
within 15 feet of you other than the triggering creature
must also either drop prone or take mental damage (the
enemy chooses). These creatures take only minimum
damage (typically 3 damage at 11th level, 4 at 12th, 5 at
16th, and 6 at 19th), and the effects they take can’t be
adjusted by anything that changes your Iron Command.
For instance, the Iron Repercussions feat couldn’t turn
the damage into persistent mental damage for creatures
other than the triggering creature.
Desecrator: When you use Selfish Shield, each enemy
within 15 feet of you takes a –1 status penalty to attack
rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
Antipaladin: When you use Destructive Vengeance,
each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the
triggering creature takes half the damage you deal to the
triggering enemy, of the same damage type you chose.

your pool.
You call out to your deity in a plea for their aid. You instantly
recover 1 Focus Point.
IRON REPERCUSSIONS
FEAT 1
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites tyrant cause
Disobeying your Iron Command has lasting consequences.
If an enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal persistent
mental damage instead of normal mental damage. You must
decide whether the mental damage will be persistent before
your enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of
damage is unchanged.
ONGOING SELFISHNESS
FEAT 1
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites desecrator cause
Your powerful personality and incredible ego demand that
you protect yourself above all else. After you use Selfish
Shield, you gain resistance to all further damage from the
triggering enemy until the end of the turn on which you
used the reaction. This resistance is equal to half your Selfish
Shield resistance.
VICIOUS VENGEANCE
FEAT 1
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites antipaladin cause
While your vengeance is painful for both you and your
foe, none can doubt that your enemies suffer more. You
gain a circumstance bonus to the damage you deal from
Destructive Vengeance equal to the number of damage dice

takes, not the damage to yourself or the extra damage you
gain after using the reaction.
2ND LEVEL
CONCEITED MINDSET
FEAT 2

Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone
who would alter your mental state—but this hubris gets the
better of you when you’re wrong. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to saves against mental effects. If you succeed at a
save against a mental effect, you critically succeed instead;
similarly, if you fail at a save against a mental effect, you
critically fail instead.
ESOTERIC OATH
FEAT 2
CHAMPION
OATH
Prerequisites tenets of good
You’ve sworn an oath to slay the alien abominations that lurk
in the remote corners of Golarion. Add the following tenet
to your champion’s code, after the other tenets. “You must
slay evil aberrations you encounter as long as you have a
reasonable chance of success.”
Your Retributive Strike gains a +4 circumstance bonus to
damage against an evil aberration, or +6 if you have master
proficiency with the weapon you used. The resistance you
gain from Glimpse of Redemption against damage from
an evil aberration is 7 + your level. If you use Liberating
Step triggered by an evil aberration, your ally gains a +4
circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating
Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.
You don’t consider evil aberrations to be legitimate
authorities, even in nations they rule.
LIGHTSLAYER OATH
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
OATH
Prerequisites tenets of evil
You’ve sworn to rid the world of the self-righteousness
of celestial beings. Add the following tenet to your code,
after the other tenets. “You must banish or slay celestials
you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of
success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find an evil
celestial, you don’t have to banish or kill it.”

gains a +10-foot status bonus to its Speed until the end of
its next turn.
AURA OF DESPAIR
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites tenets of evil
Your presence as an avatar of evil makes your foes more
susceptible to terror and makes it almost impossible for
them to shake off fear when you are near. Enemies within
15 feet of you take a –1 circumstance penalty to saving
throws against fear. In addition, an enemy that ends its turn
within 15 feet of you can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1.
CRUELTY [one-action]
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites devotion spell (touch of corruption)
The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the
strength from your enemy’s body. If your next action is to
cast touch of corruption on a living creature, the target is
also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute if it fails its save (enfeebled 2
if it critically fails).

FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
DIVINE
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Prerequisites divine ally (shield), tenets of evil
Your shield ally is more than just a spirit of protection—
it’s a conduit for deadly divine magic. When you use
your shield ally to Shield Block a melee unarmed attack
or a melee weapon Strike from an adjacent creature, the
attacker takes 1d6 evil or negative damage (your choice). If
the attack or Strike breaks or destroys your shield, double
this additional damage.
The damage the attacker takes increases to 2d6 at 11th
level and 3d6 at 16th level.
INVIGORATING MERCY
FEAT 6
CHAMPION
Prerequisites Mercy
Your divine touch rejuvenates the weak and tired. When you
use Mercy, you can instead attempt a counteract check
to remove the clumsy or enfeebled conditions, using
the source of that condition to determine the counteract
level and DC. If the condition was caused by an
ongoing effect and you don’t remove that effect,
the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
SMITE GOOD [one-action]
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites divine ally (blade), tenets of evil
Your blade ally shares your lust for the blood of
good creatures. Select one enemy you can see.
Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes
against that foe using the weapon your blade ally
inhabits deal an extra 4 evil damage, increasing
to 6 if you have master proficiency with
this weapon.
If the chosen enemy attacks you before
the start of your next turn, the duration
extends to the end of that enemy’s next turn.

GREATER CRUELTY
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites Cruelty
The extent of the corruption within you does more than
simply sap your foes’ strength, it devastates their minds and
reflexes. When you use Cruelty, choose whether you want to
make the creature enfeebled as normal, to make it clumsy 1
on a failed save (clumsy 2 on a critical failure), or to make it
stupefied 1 on a failed save (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
SACRIFICE ARMOR [reaction]
FEAT 8
CHAMPION
Trigger You are hit by a Strike that deals physical damage.
With divine awareness, you twist your body to lessen the
impact of an attack. Reduce the damage you take by an
amount equal to twice your armor’s level. Your armor becomes
broken, reducing its Hit Points to its Broken Threshold. If
your armor was already damaged, it is destroyed instead.
SENSE GOOD
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites tenets of evil
The presence of goodness sickens you with its saccharine
self-righteousness. When in the presence of an aura of good
that is powerful or overwhelming (Core Rulebook 328), you
detect the aura, though you might not do so instantly, and
you can’t pinpoint the location. This acts as a vague sense,
similar to humans’ sense of smell. A good creature using a
disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a
Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its aura
from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it
is then temporarily immune to your Sense Good for 1 day.
10TH LEVEL
ELUCIDATING MERCY
FEAT 10
CHAMPION
Prerequisites Mercy
Your mercy grants clarity to those around you just when they
need it most. When you use Mercy, you can instead attempt
a counteract check to remove the confused or stupefied
conditions, using the source of that condition to determine
the counteract level and DC. If the condition was caused
by an ongoing effect and you don’t remove that effect, the
condition returns at the end of your next turn.
LITANY OF SELF-INTEREST
FEAT 10
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites devotion spells, tenets of evil
You compel a creature to act toward its own ends rather
than consider others. You can cast the litany of self-interest
devotion spell (page 229). Increase the number of Focus
Points in your focus pool by 1.
RESILIENT TOUCH
FEAT 10
CHAMPION
Prerequisites devotion spell (lay on hands)
Your healing energies create an aura of protection that
defends your allies against more than just blades and arrows.
An ally that recovers Hit Points from your lay on hands gains
a +1 status bonus to their saving throws until the end of their
next turn.
12TH LEVEL
AMPLIFYING TOUCH
FEAT 12
CHAMPION
Prerequisites devotion spell (lay on hands)
Your healing energies empower attacks. An ally that recovers
Hit Points from your lay on hands gains a +1 status bonus to
their attack rolls and deals 1 additional good damage on all
their Strikes until the end of their next turn.
ENFORCE OATH [one-action]
FEAT 12
CHAMPION
Frequency once per hour
Prerequisites You’ve sworn to an oath against a specific type
of creature.
You call on your oath to embolden you in combat. When
you Enforce your Oath, select one creature you can see that
you’ve sworn to defeat as part of your oath. You gain a +1
status bonus to AC and saves against attacks and effects
by the chosen creature. You also gain a +1 status bonus
to attack rolls against the chosen creature. However, your
dedication to Enforcing your Oath draws your focus away
from all other foes. While you are Enforcing your Oath, you
take a –1 status penalty to AC, attack rolls, and saves against
all other creatures until you stop Enforcing your Oath.
You stop Enforcing your Oath once the chosen creature is
reduced to 0 Hit Points or offers a legitimate surrender to you
or your allies. You immediately stop Enforcing your Oath if
you are unconscious or if the chosen creature goes unnoticed
by you for more than 1 minute. You can also stop Enforcing
your Oath at any time during your turn as a free action.
GRUESOME STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites tenets of evil, champion’s reaction that grants
extra damage with your Strikes
Requirements Your Strikes currently deal extra damage from
your champion’s reaction.
Make a Strike against the creature that triggered your
champion’s reaction. If you hit, the target takes double
the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed
at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be drained 1.
Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune
to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.

PALE HORSE
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites divine ally (steed), tenets of evil
Your mount becomes a grotesque creature of foreboding when
you ride it. Its appearance transforms as flames erupt from
its skin, a whorl of negative energy surrounds it, or poison
leaks from its flesh. When you Mount your steed ally, you
can choose fire, negative, or poison. As long as you ride it,
your steed gains resistance 10 to the chosen damage type,
and any creature that touches your steed takes 1d6 damage of
the chosen type; this includes hitting the steed with unarmed
attacks or with a melee weapon Strike while adjacent to the
steed. This damage increases to 2d6 at 16th level and 3d6 at
20th level.

You and all allies within 15 feet gain a +1 status bonus to
Fortitude and Will saves against effects from aberrations. You

polymorph effects and Will saves against mental effects; this
bonus increases to +2 against aberrations’ morph, polymorph,
or mental effects.
GREATER INTERPOSE
FEAT 14
CHAMPION
Prerequisites Sacrifice Armor
Your divine grace empowers you to avoid hits when you
otherwise could not. You can use Sacrifice Armor to reduce any
type of damage from an attack or effect requiring a Reflex save.
When you use Sacrifice Armor against a critical hit or a critical
failure on a Reflex save that would otherwise cause you to take
double damage, you take the normal amount of damage instead.
LITANY OF DEPRAVITY
FEAT 14
UNCOMMON

You undercut your enemy’s vain moralism, opening their heart
to evil. You can cast the litany of depravity focus spell (page

two of the weapon’s damage dice.
18TH LEVEL
FIENDISH FORM
FEAT 18
UNCOMMON

already have it, and you gain the fiend trait and the trait
appropriate to the type of servitor you’ve become (such as
daemon, demon, or devil).
REJUVENATING TOUCH
FEAT 18
CHAMPION
Prerequisites devotion spell (lay on hands)
Your healing energies linger after you cast, providing continual
benefits. An ally that recovers Hit Points from your lay on
hands gains 10 temporary Hit Points at the start of their turn
during each of the next 10 rounds. This effect ends if the ally
is knocked unconscious.
20TH LEVEL
FIENDISH MOUNT
FEAT 20
UNCOMMON
CHAMPION
Prerequisites divine ally (steed), tenets of evil
Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister
gifts granted to it by your deity. It gains darkvision, its
maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness
10 to good damage.
Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of
your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a fly
Speed equal to its Speed. It gains the fiend trait and the trait
appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as
daemon, demon, or devil).
SACRED DEFENDER
FEAT 20
CHAMPION
You are a great warrior that can stand strong against the
fiercest opponents to your cause. You gain resistance 10
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage caused by
creatures and effects opposed to your tenets (evil creatures
for tenets of good, good creatures for tenets of evil, and so
on). In addition, creatures and effects that roll a natural 20
on an attack roll against you don’t improve their result by one
degree of success.

potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use
this spell slot to cast any spell you know from the divine spell list

Druid Feats
1ST LEVEL
VERDANT WEAPON
FEAT 1
DRUID
EXPLORATION
You cultivate a seed that can sprout into a wooden staff, vine
whip, or another weapon. You spend 10 minutes focusing
primal energy into a seed, imprinting it with the potential
of a single level 0 weapon you are trained with and that has
no mechanical parts or metal components. When holding
the imprinted seed, you can spend a single Interact action
to cause it to immediately grow into that weapon; a second
Interact action returns it to seed form. Your verdant weapon
functions as the imprinted weapon and can be etched
with runes or affixed with talismans as normal, which are
suppressed when the weapon is in seed form. It also becomes
a primal focus.
You can have only one verdant seed at a time. If you prepare
a second, your first verdant seed immediately becomes a
mundane specimen; any runes on the previous seed that are
valid for the new seed transfer between them at no cost, but
you lose any inapplicable runes unless you transfer them to a
runestone or another weapon.

similar tendrils, increasing its reach to 15 feet.
• Purify Air Your familiar recycles air, providing enough
oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air,
such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. If
the leshy is within the area of an inhaled poison effect or
an effect that relies on smell, creatures within a 15-foot
emanation from the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to their saving throws against the effect.
• Verdant Burst When your familiar dies, it releases
its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of heal,
heightened to a level 1 lower than your highest-level
spell slot. The heal spell gains a status bonus equal to
twice the spell’s level to the Hit Points it restores to
plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-level spells using
spell slots to select this familiar ability.

Prerequisites Verdant Weapon
Your verdant weapon can cut through the resistances of
magical creatures. The weapon is treated as cold iron and

minutes, you can direct your sown spell to sprout and produce
the spell’s effects as a reaction, which is triggered when a

Requirements You have a foe grabbed or restrained.
Your ability to control your own ki empowers you to pressure
other creatures into resuming their true forms. Attempt an
Athletics check to counteract a polymorph effect currently
affecting your target. If the target is somehow under the effect
of multiple polymorph effects, you can choose which one to
attempt to counteract, or the GM chooses randomly if the
separate effects aren’t obvious. The target is then temporarily
immune for 1 day.

Requirements You are in Clinging Shadows Initiate.
You launch a wave of shadowy ki outward from your body,
damaging your opponents and potentially binding them

WHIRLING BLADE STANCE [one-action]
FEAT 14

STANCE
Prerequisites Monastic Weaponry
You enter a mindful stance that creates a deep connection
between you and your monk weapons, allowing you to
manipulate them with your ki even at a distance. All melee
monk weapons you wield with the finesse trait gain the
thrown 10 feet trait (unless they already have the thrown trait
with a greater range).
Once you’ve made a thrown Strike with such a weapon,
you can use the precision of your throw to make additional
strikes with it, even from a distance. Start from the space of
the previous Strike’s target to determine the range increment
and whether the new target has cover. At the end of your turn,
the thrown weapon flies directly back to you in a straight line.
If a solid barrier blocks its path, it falls to the ground after
hitting the barrier.
16TH LEVEL

You take a moment to center yourself, then unleash a
powerful blow that sends your target tumbling away. Make
an unarmed Strike. If you hit, the target must succeed at a
Fortitude save against your class DC or be pushed up to 10
feet directly away from you (or 20 feet, on a critical failure)
and fall prone. If another creature or physical object would
prevent this movement, both your target and the blocking
creature or object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet
of movement that was prevented.
MEDUSA’S WRATH
FEAT 16
MONK
Prerequisites ki spells
You learn a monstrous ki technique that infuses your blows
with the petrifying power of a medusa’s gaze. You gain the

penalty, and you take an additional –2 penalty. This counts as
two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and
you combine the attacks’ damage for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses. Your Stunning Fist benefit applies to Triangle
Shot, even though it isn’t a Flurry of Blows. If all three Strikes
hit, the target takes 3d6 persistent bleed damage.
20TH LEVEL
DEADLY STRIKES
LEVEL 20
MONK
You have honed your body to attack with lethal focus. Your
unarmed attacks gain the deadly d10 trait, or you increase

Rogue’s Racket
ELDRITCH TRICKSTER
When it comes to a big heist, every rogue worth their salt
knows that magic can throw meticulous plans into chaos,
whether in the form of arcane wards or pesky divinations.
You dabble in magic just enough to help handle these
problems by jury-rigging spells and throwing a bit of
your own magic into the mix. You might be a solitary
thief, performing burglaries that can’t be explained by
skill alone, or a specialist called in by other rogues to
deal with magical security measures. You might even be
on the up-and-up, hired to test magical defenses or even
build them yourself.
Choose a multiclass archetype that has a basic, expert,
and master spellcasting feat. You gain that archetype’s
dedication feat as a bonus feat even though you don’t
meet its level prerequisite, though you must meet its
other prerequisites. For you, the Magical Trickster rogue
feat (Core Rulebook 185) has a prerequisite of 2nd level
instead of 4th level. You can choose the spellcasting
ability score for the multiclass archetype you chose as
your key ability score.
MASTERMIND
Where others might use sleight of hand or a silver tongue
to achieve their objectives, you rely on your intellect to
craft intricate schemes. You likely view your operations
as a chess game, always planning 10 steps ahead where
others might plan three. You might be a detective
determined to solve crimes or a spymaster in the service
of a powerful family or nation. If you operate outside the
law, you might be an aspiring crime lord or information
broker, excellent at directing others toward suitable jobs.
If you successfully identify a creature using Recall
Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against your
attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically
succeed, it’s flat-footed against your attacks for 1 minute.
You’re trained in Society and one of the following skills
of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion.
You can choose Intelligence as your key ability score.

time you Feint against a given foe.

bonus to your next saving throw against the creature
before the start of your next turn.

before the start of your next turn.

with up to four allies.
You quickly advise your ally, using your earlier planning to
make sure luck can’t throw a wrench in the cogs of your

hand, enabling you to use them for additional Strikes. You
must be within the weapon’s listed range increment and have

RECONSTRUCT THE SCENE
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
ROGUE
You spend 1 minute surveying a small location (such as a
single room) to get an impression of events that occurred
there in the last day. This involves moving about the area and
studying footprints, the placement of objects, spilled drinks
or blood, and so forth. You get an indistinct mental impression
of significant events that happened there. This gives you
clues and details of the past, including the overall events and
their time frame, but it’s not a perfect record. This also isn’t
enough to identify who was involved in these events if you
weren’t already aware the person was there. As determined
by the GM, you also pick out various seemingly small details
that could serve as important clues, like a memorable weapon
someone used for a murder or the type of cloak someone wore
when passing through.
STEAL SPELL
FEAT 16
MAGICAL
ROGUE
Prerequisites Legendary Thief, Loaner Spell
When you use Legendary Thief to steal the impossible, you
can steal a prepared spell or spontaneous spell from a foe.

the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum
of 8th-level spells; the target loses the appropriate
spell slot as if they had cast it themself. You can Cast
the Spell once within the next 1d4 rounds, after which
the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as
casting a Loaner Spell.

five times per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a
common consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.

and distracts your foes, either granting you a +1 status
bonus to Diplomacy checks for 1 round or imposing a –1
status penalty on one target’s Will saves for 1 round.
PSYCHOPOMP
For good or ill, your ancestors’ deeds drew the attention
of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in
your family tree. The presence of these shepherds of souls
and enemies of undeath has left an indelible mark on you.
Spell List divine
Bloodline Skills Intimidation, Religion

Blood Magic The border between life and death becomes
blurred to you. Either you gain a +2 status bonus to
Fortitude saving throws for 1 round, or a target takes
1 damage per spell level. The damage is negative if the
target is living or positive if the target is undead. If the
spell already deals that type of damage, combine it with
the spell’s initial damage before determining weaknesses
and resistances.
SHADOW
Whether due to a velstrac’s manipulations or a planar
jaunt gone horribly wrong, your bloodline was infused
with a vein of shadow.

Sorcerer Feats
At each level that you gain a sorcerer feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL BLOOD MAGIC
FEAT 1
SORCERER
The magic of your bloodline mixes with that of your
ancestry. You gain your blood magic effect when you cast a
non-cantrip spell you gained from a heritage or an ancestry
feat, in addition to the normal circumstances that trigger
your blood magic.
2ND LEVEL
ANOINT ALLY [one-action]
FEAT 2
MANIPULATE
SORCERER
You forge a mystical connection with an ally using your
body as a focus, allowing them to benefit from your magic.
You place a blood rune on an adjacent ally that lasts for 1
minute. When you would gain a blood magic effect, you can
forgo it, granting it to your ally instead. You can anoint only
one ally at a time; if you place another rune, your previous
designation ends.
ENTREAT WITH FOREBEARS
FEAT 2
SORCERER
Prerequisites a bloodline that corresponds with a creature
trait
Something about your presence causes creatures of your
bloodline to, consciously or not, recognize you as one of
their own, and you become inured to their tricks. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy, Deception, and
Intimidation checks when interacting with creatures that
have the trait corresponding to your bloodline, and you gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception and saving throws
against such creatures. For example, an aberrant bloodline
sorcerer would gain this benefit against creatures with the
aberration trait. The GM is the final arbiter of which creatures
match your bloodline.
4TH LEVEL
ELABORATE FLOURISH [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You embellish your spellcasting with entrancing flourishes
and grand pronouncements, making it harder to identify or
counter. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, creatures
with the ability to Cast that Spell don’t automatically
know what the spell is. In addition, creatures that witness
your spellcasting take a –2 circumstance penalty to
checks to identify the spell with Recall Knowledge and
checks to counteract the spell during its casting (such as
with Counterspell).
SPLIT SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You fragment a ranged spell into a pair of smaller shots. If your
next action is to Cast a Spell without a duration that requires
an attack roll against a single target and has no effect beyond
dealing damage, you roll a single attack roll and compare the
result to the AC of two targets within the spell’s range. The
spell deals only half its usual damage to each target. This
counts as one attack for your multiple attack penalty.
6TH LEVEL
DIVERTING VORTEX [one-action]
FEAT 6
SORCERER
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-
cantrip spell.
You transfer vestiges of magical energy to the air around you,
creating a vortex that deflects ranged attacks. Until the start
of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC against
ranged weapon attacks and physical ranged unarmed attacks.
ENERGETIC RESONANCE [reaction]
FEAT 6
ABJURATION
SORCERER
Trigger You would take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic
damage from a spell.
Requirements You have an unexpended spell slot of a level
equal to or higher than the triggering spell.
Your blood resonates with magical energy, mitigating the
effects of harmful spells. Expend one of your spell slots of a
level equal to or higher than that of the triggering spell. You
gain resistance to one of the triggering effect’s damage types
equal to twice the expended spell slot’s level.
SPELL RELAY [reaction]
FEAT 6
CONCENTRATE
SORCERER
Trigger An ally Casts a Spell and you are within that spell’s
range.
You open the power in your blood to your ally’s spellcasting,
using your magic to boost their range. Your ally can use you
as the point of origin for their spell, calculating range and
cover from your space instead of their own.
8TH LEVEL
SAFEGUARDED SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 8
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You bring the magical wavelengths of your spell into sync
with the ones produced by your own body. If the next action
you take is to Cast a Spell with an area, you aren’t affected
by the spell even if you are within the area.
SOULSIGHT
FEAT 8
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants divine or occult spells
The spiritual essence in your blood has opened your senses
to the world beyond. You gain spiritsense as an imprecise

sense with a range of 60 feet. Spiritsense allows you
to sense the spirits of creatures within the listed range,
including living creatures, most non-mindless undead, and
haunts. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses,
you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature. As
spiritsense detects spiritual essence, not physical bodies, it
can detect spirits projected by spells such as project image
or possessing otherwise soulless objects. It can’t detect
soulless bodies, constructs, or objects, and like most senses,
it doesn’t penetrate through solid objects.
10TH LEVEL
ANCESTRAL MAGE
FEAT 10
SORCERER
Prerequisites Ancestral Blood Magic
The magic of your ancestry and bloodline are one and the
same. Add any innate spells you have from a heritage or an
ancestry feat to your spell repertoire, meaning you can cast
them using your spell slots.
ENERGY FUSION [one-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You fuse two spells together, combining their energy types.
If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that deals acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, select a non-cantrip
spell in your spell repertoire that deals a different type of
energy damage from that list, and expend an additional
spell slot of the same level as this secondary spell. The spell
you cast deals additional damage equal to the level of the
secondary spell slot expended. The spell’s total damage is
divided evenly between the energy type of the spell you cast
and the energy type of the secondary spell.
ENERGY WARD [free-action]
FEAT 10
ABJURATION
SORCERER
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a
non-cantrip spell that dealt energy damage.
You trap energy from the last spell you cast within your
body, coating your flesh in a protective ward. Until the
start of your next turn, you gain resistance 5 to one type of
energy damage dealt by the spell you just cast.
SIGNATURE SPELL EXPANSION
FEAT 10
SORCERER
Your innate connection to magic lets you cast more spells
with greater freedom. You gain two additional signature
spells, each of which must have a minimum level of 3rd
or lower.
12TH LEVEL
BLOOD COMPONENT SUBSTITUTION
FEAT 12
SORCERER
You can bypass the need for incantations and gestures by
drawing energy directly from your blood, causing you to
visibly glow the color of your blood and crackle with magical
energy. When you Cast a Spell, you can replace all verbal,
material, or somatic spellcasting components
with a blood component. To use a
blood component, you lose Hit
Points equal to twice the
spell’s level as the
your

energy
blood is depleted,

and

================================================================================

decrease the Hit Points lost in any way. As usual for altering
components, this has no effect on the number of actions
required to Cast the Spell, and your Cast a Spell activity
gains the concentrate trait but not the manipulate trait. You
can’t use blood components to replace any required part of
a spell’s cost.
GREATER PHYSICAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 12
SORCERER
Prerequisites Arcane Evolution or Primal Evolution
You hold a deep understanding of the innate fundamental
structures of the physical world, and you can enforce
your will upon that structure as far as your own blood is
concerned. Once per day, you can use a sorcerer spell slot
to cast any common polymorph battle form spell of the spell
slot’s level as if it were a signature spell in your repertoire.
If you have Arcane Evolution, you can also choose from
any battle form spell in your spellbook. If you have Primal
Evolution, you can Cast a Spell listed in that feat using
the extra spell slot the feat grants (instead of a sorcerer
spell slot).
GREATER SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 12
SORCERER
Prerequisites Divine Evolution or Occult Evolution
Your magical blood is rich with spiritual essence, and this
infusion within you allows your spells to be fully effective
against incorporeal creatures, spirits, and creatures on the
Ethereal Plane. Your spells have the effects of a ghost touch
property rune. They can target or affect a creature projecting
its consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing
another creature, even if its body is elsewhere, though you
must know about the possession or projection and choose
to do so. Your spells can affect creatures on the Ethereal
Plane, though this doesn’t grant you any particular ability
to locate them.
14TH LEVEL
CONSUME SPELL
FEAT 14
SORCERER
Prerequisites Counterspell
When you successfully Counterspell a spell of the tradition
that matches your bloodline, you consume it, replenishing
yourself with its energy. When you do, you are nourished as
if you had eaten a meal and regain Hit Points equal to twice
the level of the counteracted spell.
SPELL SHROUD [one-action]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next
action is to Cast a Spell that targets you, you surround
yourself in a 15-foot emanation of dense magical mist that
lasts until the start of your next turn. All creatures within
the cloud become concealed, and all creatures outside the
cloud are concealed to creatures within it.
16TH LEVEL
SCINTILLATING SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
LIGHT
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your
next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn’t have the darkness
trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a
Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights,
in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its
Reflex save against the spell is dazzled for 1 round, and those
who critically failed are instead blinded for 1 round.
TERRAFORMING SPELL [one-action]
 FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
EARTH
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
TRANSMUTATION
You capture transformative fragments of magic and slam
them into the ground, creating a shock wave that alters your
surroundings. If your next action is to Cast a non-cantrip
transmutation Spell, either each space adjacent to you
becomes difficult terrain, or each space adjacent to you is no
longer difficult terrain. This doesn’t have any effect on greater
difficult terrain and doesn’t remove the damaging effects of
hazardous terrain.
18TH LEVEL
ECHOING SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 18
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You time the components of your spell with exacting precision,
setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell’s effects. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has
no duration, the spell’s energy reverberates and echoes. You
can Cast the Spell a second time before the end of your next
turn without expending a spell slot.
20TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE MUTATION
FEAT 20
SORCERER
Prerequisites a bloodline based on a specific type of creature
You permanently mutate to become more like the creatures of
your bloodline. You gain the appropriate trait or traits for those
types of creatures (aberration for aberrant, angel and celestial
for angelic, psychopomp and monitor for psychopomp, and so
on). You gain low-light vision or darkvision, if one is appropriate
for creatures with those traits. Choose one of the following.
• If the creatures associated with your bloodline have the
ability to fly, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.
• If the creatures associated with your bloodline are
aquatic or amphibious, you become amphibious, able to
breathe water and air equally well, and you gain a swim
Speed equal to your Speed.
• If creatures associated with your bloodline have a
resistance or immunity to acid, cold, electricity, fire,
negative, or sonic, choose an energy type your bloodline
is immune or resistant to and gain resistance 20 against
that energy type.

Arcane Thesis
STAFF NEXUS
Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of
staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic
bond between spellcaster and staff, allowing them to
create remarkable magic together. You’ve formed such a
connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are
ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.
You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own
invention. It contains one cantrip and one 1st-level spell,
both from your spellbook, but it gains no charges normally
during your preparations; you must expend a spell slot to
grant it charges in the same way you would add additional
charges to a normal staff (Core Rulebook 592). You can
Craft your makeshift staff into any other type of staff
for the new staff’s usual cost, adding the two spells you
originally chose to the staff you Craft.
At 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one
when preparing your staff, adding additional charges
equal to the combined levels of the expended spells. At
16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to
add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to
the combined levels of all three spells.
Wizard Feats
1ST LEVEL
SPELLBOOK PRODIGY
FEAT 1
WIZARD
Prerequisites trained in Arcana
You are particularly adept at learning spells to add to your
spellbook. You can Learn a Spell in half the time it normally
takes. Further, when you roll a critical failure on your check to
Learn a Spell, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure,
you can try again after 1 week.
2ND LEVEL
ENERGY ABLATION [one-action]
FEAT 2
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
When you cast energy spells, you retain some of that energy
as a protective barrier. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that
deals energy damage (Core Rulebook 452), whether or not it
successfully deals damage, you gain resistance to that type of
energy equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1) until the end of
your next turn. If the spell deals more than one type of energy
damage, choose one and gain resistance to that type.
NONLETHAL SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 2
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
You can alter offensive spells to be less deadly. If your next
action is to Cast a Spell that deals damage and doesn’t have the
death or negative trait, that spell gains the nonlethal trait.
4TH LEVEL
CALL BONDED ITEM [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond
You’re mystically connected to your bonded item and can call it
to your hand. If your bonded item is 1 Bulk or less, you teleport
your bonded item into your hand from up to 1 mile away.
6TH LEVEL
CONVINCING ILLUSION [reaction]
FEAT 6
ILLUSION
WIZARD
Prerequisites expert in Deception
Trigger A creature succeeded, but didn’t critically succeed,
at a Perception check or Will save to disbelieve an illusion
from a spell that you cast.
Requirements You are within 30 feet of the observer and
the illusion.
You use your deceptive skills to make your illusions seem
even more real. Attempt a Deception check against the
target’s Perception DC. If you succeed, the target fails to
disbelieve the illusion.
SPLIT SLOT
FEAT 6
WIZARD
You can prepare two spells in one slot, giving you the freedom
to choose the spell when you cast it. When you prepare your
spells for the day, you can choose one spell slot at least 1 level
lower than the highest-level spell you can cast and prepare
two spells in that slot. When you Cast a Spell from that slot,
choose which spell to cast. Once you’ve chosen, the unused
spell dissipates as though you hadn’t prepared it at all—for
example, it isn’t available for use with Drain Bonded Item.
8TH LEVEL
FORM RETENTION
FEAT 8
WIZARD
You have trained your mind and body to tolerate polymorph
magic for longer periods of time, so long as you prepare for the
change appropriately. When preparing a polymorph spell that
lasts 1 minute and grants a battle form, you can prepare the

spell in a slot 2 levels higher than normal. This doesn’t grant
any of the normal benefits of heightening a spell, but the spell
lasts up to 10 minutes. For example, if you prepared animal
form in a 4th-level slot with Form Retention, you would cast
a 2nd-level animal form that lasts for up to 10 minutes. If the
spell can be Dismissed, that doesn’t change.
12TH LEVEL
DIVINER SENSE
FEAT 12
DIVINATION
FORTUNE
WIZARD
You sense magical dangers. When using the Detect Magic
exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the
better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical
effect or magic item and is in range of your detect magic.
FORCIBLE ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 12
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
You perform complex manipulations to make the energy from
your spells so powerful that your enemies remain vulnerable
to it afterward. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that deals
acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you can select one
target that was damaged to gain weakness 5 to that damage
type until the end of your next turn. If a spell deals multiple
types of energy damage, choose one that the target gains
weakness to. This has no effect on creatures with resistance
or immunity to the energy type you choose.
18TH LEVEL
SECOND CHANCE SPELL
FEAT 18
ENCHANTMENT
WIZARD
When your target proves resilient to your magical
deceptions, you can try them again on someone else. When
you cast an enchantment spell that targets one creature
and that creature critically succeeds at its Will save, you
can Cast the Spell again before the end of your next turn on
a different creature without expending an additional spell
slot. The second casting doesn’t grant you any benefits
that you would normally gain for Casting a Spell from a
spell slot.
20TH LEVEL
SPELL MASTERY
FEAT 20
WIZARD
You have mastered a handful of spells to such a degree
that you can cast them even if you haven’t prepared them
in advance. Select any four spells of 9th level or lower
that you have access to; each spell you select must be of
a different level. These spells are automatically prepared
when you make your daily preparations, and they have
their own spell slots. You can select a different array of
spells by spending 1 week of downtime retraining your
mastered spells.

Advanced Maneuver Throw Rock
THROW ROCK [one-action]

Advanced Maneuver Wing Thrash
WING THRASH [two-actions]
The bat thrashes wildly with its wings, making wing Strikes

such as an alligator or caiman.
ANIMAL COMPANIONS
The following companions are available to loyally serve your character, just like the animal

Special The crocodile can hold its breath for about 2 hours.
Support Benefit Your crocodile clamps its jaws on your foe,
refusing to let go. Until the start of your next turn, if your
Strike damages a creature in your crocodile’s reach, your
crocodile can latch onto the creature. While thus attached, the
crocodile can move along with the target whenever the target
moves until the end of your next turn. Your crocodile can latch
onto only one creature in this way, and it must release the
creature to make a jaws Strike. If the target is smaller than
the crocodile, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its
Speeds and can’t Fly while the crocodile is latched on.
Advanced Maneuver Death Roll
DEATH ROLL [one-action]
Requirements The crocodile has a creature grabbed.
The crocodile tucks its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting its
victim. It makes a jaws Strike with a +2 circumstance bonus
to the attack roll against the grabbed creature. If it hits, it also
knocks the creature prone. If it misses, it releases the creature.
RIDING DRAKE
UNCOMMON
Your companion is a swift, flightless drake with limited

when you create an opening. Until the start of your next
turn, your Strikes that damage a creature in your scorpion’s
reach also deal 1d6 persistent poison damage. If your
scorpion is nimble or savage, the persistent poison damage
increases to 2d6.
Advanced Maneuver Grab and Sting
GRAB AND STING [two-actions]
The scorpion holds its foe in place with its pincers in order to

Familiar Abilities
Accompanist: Your familiar helps you perform. Whenever
you attempt a Performance check, if your familiar is nearby
and can act, it accompanies you with chirps, claps, or its own
miniature instrument. This grants you a +1 circumstance
bonus, or +2 if you’re a master in Performance.
Focused Rejuvenation: When you Refocus, you generate
magical energy that heals your familiar. Your familiar
regains 1 Hit Point per level whenever you Refocus.
Independent: In an encounter, if you don’t Command
your familiar, it still gains 1 action each round. Typically,
you still decide how it spends that action, but, the GM
might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics
rather than performing your preferred action.
Master’s Form: Your familiar can change shape as a single
action, transforming into a humanoid of your ancestry with
the same age, gender, and build of its true form, though it
always maintains a clearly unnatural remnant of its nature,
such as a cat’s eyes or a serpent’s tongue. This form is always
the same each time it uses this ability. This otherwise uses
the effects of humanoid form, except the change is purely
cosmetic. It only appears humanoid and gains no new
capabilities. Your familiar must have the manual dexterity
and speech abilities to select this.
Partner in Crime: Your familiar is your criminal
associate. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1
reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to
Aid you on a Deception or Thievery skill check (it still has
to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction). It
automatically succeeds at its check to Aid you with those
skills or automatically critically succeeds if you’re a master
of the skill in question.
Plant Form: Your plant familiar can change shape as
a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type
roughly similar to the familiar’s nature. This otherwise uses
the effects of tree shape. You must have a familiar with the
plant trait, such as a leshy, to select this ability.
Poison Reservoir: Your homunculus familiar has a
reservoir for poison, allowing it to apply an injury poison
to an adjacent ally’s exposed weapon with a single Interact
action. You must supply the poison and instill it into this
reservoir using two consecutive Interact actions. You must
have a homunculus familiar to select this ability.
Resistance: Choose two of the following: acid, cold,
electricity, fire, poison, or sonic. Your familiar gains resistance
equal to half your level against the chosen damage types.
Skilled: Choose a skill other than Acrobatics or Stealth.
Your familiar’s modifier for that skill is equal to your level
plus your key spellcasting ability modifier, rather than just
your level. You can select this ability repeatedly, choosing a
different skill each time.
Spellcasting: Choose a spell in your repertoire
or that you prepared today that is at least 5
levels lower than your highest-level spell slot. Your
familiar can Cast that Spell once per day using your
magical tradition, spell attack modifier, and spell
DC. If the spell has a drawback that affects the
caster, both you and your familiar are affected. You
must be able to cast 6th-level spells using spell slots
to select this ability.
Toolbearer: Your familiar can carry a set of tools of
up to light Bulk. So long as your familiar is adjacent to
you, you can draw and replace the tools as part of the action
that uses them as if you were wearing them. Your familiar
must have the manual dexterity ability to select this.
Touch Telepathy: Your familiar can telepathically
communicate with you via touch. If it also has the
speech ability, it can telepathically communicate via
touch with any creature if they share a language.
FAMILIARS
This section includes additional options for both familiar and master abilities,
supplementing those from the Core Rulebook, as well as stat blocks for specific familiars
with unique abilities.

================================================================================

Tough: Your familiar’s maximum Hit Points increase by
2 per level.
Valet: You can command your familiar to deliver you
items more efficiently. Your familiar doesn’t use its 2 actions
immediately upon your command. Instead, up to twice
before the end of your turn, you can have your familiar
Interact to retrieve an item of light or negligible Bulk you
are wearing and place it into one of your free hands. The
familiar can’t use this ability to retrieve stowed items. If the
familiar has a different number of actions, it can retrieve
one item for each action it has when commanded this way.
MASTER ABILITIES
Innate Surge: Once per day, you can draw upon your
familiar’s innate magic to replenish your own. You can cast
one innate spell gained from an ancestry feat that you have
already cast today. You must still Cast the Spell and meet
the spell’s other requirements.
Share Senses: Once every 10 minutes, you can use a single
action with the concentrate trait to project your senses into
your familiar. When you do, you lose all sensory information
from your own body, but can sense through your familiar’s
body for up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.
Specific Familiars
Most familiars are Tiny animals, though a few are unusual,
such as a leaf druid’s leshy familiar. Some familiars,
however, are more powerful creatures with unique abilities.
Any character can gain a specific familiar so long as they
already have a familiar with at least the required number
of abilities listed in the specific familiar’s stat block. Such
a familiar usually replaces an existing familiar, though in
some circumstances (such as for a witch) the familiar may
evolve or reveal its true form. In any case, this transition
from a normal familiar to a specific familiar requires no
downtime and has no cost. Once you’ve selected a specific
familiar, you can’t change it without losing your familiar—
this uses the same rules as if your familiar had died.
A specific familiar has several traits and abilities, as
listed in their stat block. The Granted Abilities entry lists
normal familiar and master abilities that familiar has. The
familiar also gains unique abilities listed below the Granted
Abilities entry. Much like a familiar that naturally has a
familiar ability (such as an owl with a fly Speed), you can
never swap out any of these granted or unique abilities. If
your familiar gains more abilities than are necessary for
that specific familiar, you can use the remaining abilities to
select familiar and master abilities as normal.
Statistics and abilities not listed in a specific familiar’s stat
block (such as modifiers, AC, Hit Points, and so forth) use
the normal familiar rules (Core Rulebook 217). These stat
blocks otherwise use the format from the Bestiary.
FAERIE DRAGON
These tiny, mischievous dragons make natural allies for
benevolent or capricious characters.
FAERIE DRAGON
DRAGON

gas in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in the area must
attempt a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell
DC, whichever is higher. A creature that fails its save is
stupefied 2 and slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds; on a critical failure,
the duration is 1 minute.
IMP
Imp familiars pretend to be subservient in order to trick
their masters into losing their souls to Hell.
IMP
LE
DEVIL
FIEND
Alignment An imp must be lawful evil.

Imp Invisibility Once per hour, your imp familiar can cast 2nd-
level invisibility on itself as a divine innate spell.
Infernal Temptation [one-action] (concentrate, divine, enchantment,
evil, fortune) Frequency once per day; Effect The imp offers
a non-fiend within 15 feet a bargain, granting a boon of good
luck if the creature accepts. The boon lasts for 1 hour once
accepted. If the creature dies while the boon is in place,
its soul travels to Hell, where it is bound for eternity and
unable to be raised or resurrected except by wish or similar
magic. Once during the hour, the creature can roll an attack
roll or saving throw twice and use the higher result.
SPELLSLIME
These friendly, colorful oozes congeal from the essences
left over from casting spells. They are extremely loyal to
their masters. You can select a spellslime familiar only if
you can cast spells using spell slots.
SPELLSLIME
OOZE
Required Number of Abilities 4
Granted Abilities climber, darkvision, tough (see above)
Magic Scent Your spellslime familiar gains an imprecise sense
with a range of 30 feet that enables it to smell magic of the
same tradition as your own.
Ooze Defense Your spellslime familiar is easy to hit, but it
lacks weak points. It is immune to critical hits and precision
damage, but its AC is only 10 + your level (instead of an AC
equal to yours).
Slime Rejuvenation Your spellslime familiar gains the focused
rejuvenation ability (page 146), but it recovers 2 Hit Points
per level when you Refocus instead of 1.

================================================================================

Great character concepts don’t always fit neatly into a single class. If you want
to build on what your character’s class allows them to do, using an archetype
is a simple way to adapt any class to fit your vision for your character.
Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats instead of
class feats. Start by finding the archetype that best fits your character concept,
and select the archetype’s dedication feat using one of your class feat choices.
Once you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that archetype
in place of a class feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype
feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it
replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted you a
4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only
for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats
you gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill feat instead of a class feat.
These archetype feats have the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These aren’t archetype class
feats (for instance, to determine the number of Hit Points you gain from the
Fighter Resiliency archetype feat). Each archetype’s dedication feat represents
a certain portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you select a
dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy its requirements before
you can gain another dedication feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype
dedication feat by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s list.
You can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from
that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat grants another feat, such as the alchemist’s
Basic Concoction. You must still meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
ADDITIONAL FEATS
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their entry. These are
typically class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain combat styles.
The list of additional feats includes the feat’s name, its level, and the page
number where it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that
level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required by the archetype’s
dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait
doesn’t have that class trait.
MULTICLASS ARCHETYPES
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into
another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication
feat if you are a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
swashbuckler can’t select the Swashbuckler Dedication feat).
SPELLCASTING ARCHETYPES
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of spellcasting, albeit delayed
compared to a character from a spellcasting class. A spellcasting archetype
allows you to use scrolls, staves, and wands in the same way that a member of
a spellcasting class can.
CHAPTER 3: ARCHETYPES
Beyond your class and general feats, you can expand your character concept by choosing an
archetype. Are you more heavily armored than your peers from the sentinel archetype? Are
you a viking, experienced in seafaring and raiding? Perhaps you’re a medic, tending to the
fallen. These are just a few possibilities archetypes offer.
