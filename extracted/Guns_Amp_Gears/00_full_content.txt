INTRODUCTION
The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game features a high-fantasy setting where almost any story
can be told. Where the Core Rulebook provides classic options for play and Secrets of
Magic provides options for characters to delve deep into the magical mysteries of Golarion,
Guns & Gears presents the secrets of black powder weapons and clockwork technology,
combining grit and steampunk to produce a flavor all its own.
Gears, Guns, or Both
Guns & Gears is presented as three smaller but
interconnected “books” bundled inside a single cover. The
Gears “book” is split into two chapters: Gears Characters
and Gears Equipment. The first chapter features the
inventor class and automaton ancestry, along with several
archetypes that support innovation as a theme. The second
chapter presents an array of gadgets and vehicles that
embrace themes of inventiveness. This chapter includes rules
for clockwork and steam-tech mechanisms as well as other
more esoteric forms of technology.
The Guns “book” has also been separated into two
chapters: Guns Characters and Guns Equipment. The first
section presents the gunslinger class along with an array of
archetypes that support exciting combat styles built around
firearms and crossbows. The second chapter offers a wide
array of new firearms, from classic black powder weapons
like the flintlock musket and arquebus to more fantastic
options like versatile combination weapons or magical beast
guns. Support for firearms and crossbows goes beyond just
new weapons and includes other exciting accessories for
customizing your weapon of choice, like bayonets and
reinforced stocks to attach a melee option to your guns,
magical scopes to improve your visual prowess, magical
bandoliers and holsters, and even replacement barrels and
firing mechanisms to change your weapon’s parameters.
The final “book,” The Rotating Gear, offers a standalone
gazetteer describing different areas of Golarion where black
powder, clockworks, and other forms of technology are
likely to be found. This chapter isn’t limited to just the Inner
Sea. It explores continents like Arcadia, Casmaron, and Tian
Xia, describing the technological traditions of those regions
and how they’ve influenced the growth and proliferation of
technology across the entire planet.
How To Use This Book
The options here expand upon the rules contained in the
Core Rulebook, and that book is required to use Guns &
Gears. Some rules indicate other material found in this book
with page references. Other products referencing the rules in
this book might do so using the superscript citation “G&G.”
ACCESS ENTRIES
Most of the rules content in this book is uncommon or
rare because such technology is unusual in Golarion.
However, sometimes a stat block for an uncommon rules
element includes an Access entry that lists specific criteria.
A character who meets the criteria listed in the Access
entry, such as hailing from a particular locale, gains
access to the rules element. This book often groups access
requirements by section. For example, the introduction to
the Gears Characters chapter (page 12) details the areas
of Golarion that grant access to the inventor class and its
related uncommon weapons and gadgetry, so the areas
detailed there as granting access serve the role of access
requirements for most of the section (not including rare
items and certain other elements called out as needing
additional approval from the GM, such as vehicles).
As always, the GM has the final say on who can access
uncommon or rarer options or whether to allow specific
options in the game at all. They might decide that a
character’s upbringing or abilities make sense for a specific
rules option and grant them access even if the character
doesn’t automatically qualify, or they might decide those
same options can’t be taken by anyone.
World-Building and Tone
Guns & Gears introduces elements of fantasy that might
not fit into every game. The world of Golarion has a
lot in common with the Renaissance period of Earth,
supplemented with magic and old-fashioned technologies
that were replaced on Earth before being refined to the point
they’ve reached in Golarion. This high fantasy world is
home to pirates with bandoliers of flintlock pistols, reckless
scientists animating the dead with electric coils, knights in
shining armor riding mighty griffons, and wizards casting
spells in tall towers. Each of those character concepts
has a place in Golarion; it’s just that to find some of the
technological elements, you need to know where to look.
For a home campaign, especially in a homebrew
setting, some GMs might prefer a world that embraces
the age of piracy and includes cannons and firearms
with greater frequency than Golarion without the
presence of steam-powered jetpacks and clockwork
grappling hooks. Other GMs might prefer a world where
clockworks and steam engines exist, but guns and other
black powder weapons are absent. Guns & Gears takes
steps to facilitate this world-building. As mentioned,
this tome is divided into three smaller “books.” A GM
who only wants to allow black powder weaponry

================================================================================
PAGE 7
================================================================================

without adding weird science to the game can allow
their players to use the Guns chapters, eschewing the
Gears chapters. A GM who wants to create a world of
clockwork constructs and fantastic inventions unmarred
by black powder weaponry can instead allow players
to use the Gears chapters without giving access to the
Guns chapters. Finally, a GM who remains unsure how
any of these elements might fit into their game world is
encouraged to read The Rotating Gear at the back of
this book to see how these technologies have grown and
spread through Golarion, and perhaps gain inspiration
regarding how these elements might fit into their game.
FUNCTIONALITY AND BALANCE
Golarion is a world of magic with rune-bedecked swords
forged out of metal fallen from the sky, full plate armor
similar to that produced on Earth during the 15th century,
and other armaments unlike anything the people of Earth
ever had access to. As such, the black powder weapons
and technological gadgets presented in this book are
mechanically balanced to the other options available to
all characters. Firearms, though capable of devastating
critical hits, work alongside crossbows and composite
longbows rather than replace them, in much the same
way firearms and bows were both actively used in Asia
for nearly 900 years of human history.
AREN’T GUNS MORE POWERFUL THAN BOWS?
The guns presented in this book are representative of fairly
early firearms with just a few unique twists, as explained
in the introduction of the Guns Equipment chapter (page
146). Those old guns, which used black powder that did
not exhibit the refinements of modern ammunition and
lacked the rifle barrel technology for increasing range and
accuracy, were extremely inaccurate and no more lethal
with a glancing blow than most bows and crossbows;
however, these firearms’ penetrating power was superior,
and a wound to a vital area could prove incredibly deadly.
This lethality is represented mechanically by the fatal
trait given to most firearms, with a critical hit indicating
a gunshot to a vital organ or other important body part.
This mechanic allows a firearm to do far more damage in

ecosystem that allows each player to shine.
ARMOR AND PERSISTENT TECHNOLOGY
In Golarion, technology has moved much slower than
on Earth. Many modern conveniences still have yet to be
invented or discovered. That doesn’t mean technology has
stood still, however. Because certain types of technology
persisted for centuries on Golarion instead of being
replaced as they were on Earth, many fantastic innovations
remain prevalent since competing technologies developed
more slowly or didn’t spread as quickly.
While clockwork dragons and alchemical boots that
rocket their wearer through the sky are manifestations
of less frequent technological replacement, many other,
more subtle examples are scattered throughout the
game. At its height in the 16th century, a suit of full
plate could stop even the penetrating power, if not the
full force, of a shot from a firearm, though its expense
and weight made it impractical for all but the wealthiest
of individuals. Golarion, on the other hand, is a fantasy
world where dragons and other supernatural monsters
with destructive power akin to or in excess of a firearm
are relatively common, and where adventurers accrue
great wealth that they constantly reinvest into better
arms and armor. Moreover, Golarion’s armaments can
be enhanced with magical runes that elevate them far
beyond anything that could be replicated on Earth
without the application of advanced technology from
beyond the age of swords and plate armor.
Similarly for lighter armors, on Earth, techniques for
incorporating silk that can stop bullets from penetrating
into armor and other techniques for creating bullet-resistant
armaments, such as painting layers of paper with lacquer to
create a rudimentary analogue to modern-day Kevlar, have
existed for a very long time, but didn’t often come into
popular use before evolving into a form that is no longer
recognizable. Several nations in Tian Xia have techniques
for creating black powder weapons, like the hand cannon
and fire lance, and lacquered armor. The intersection of
these technologies means it’s not unlikely to find variants
of studded leather armor or chainmail lined with layers
of such early bulletproofing. In Avistan and the Inner Sea,
knights who have encountered firearms imported or stolen
from Alkenstar likely know armorers who know techniques
to craft layered plates and silk surcoats or undergarments
that provide additional protection from bullets.
ALCHEMY’S INFLUENCE ON TECHNOLOGY
Considering that certain technologies have seen more
refinement or followed divergent development paths

================================================================================
PAGE 9
================================================================================

on Golarion in comparison to Earth, the influence of
alchemy on Golarion’s technology can’t be understated.
In addition to enabling the creation of elemental weapons,
such as alchemist’s fire and bottled lightning, alchemical
techniques have often been applied to a variety of other
fields and industries. Alchemical treatments for armor
can create stronger materials; alchemical distillations
allow for a variety of different forms and potencies in
black powder; alchemy and the people who practice it
even influence the most basic of needs, like preserving
volatile substances for transport.
Much like firearms, alchemy is something of an
everyman’s tool, usable by most anyone who can get
their hands on its components without requiring the
specialized training or unique bloodlines of wizards and
sorcerers. A single alchemist who makes their home in
a community can quickly improve the quality of
life for everyone there, reducing death by
disease, improving the community’s ability
to defend itself from outside threats,
and providing other benefits both
large and small. While it stands
as a distinct science of its own,
alchemy inextricably has ties
to black powder weapons and
other technologies of Golarion,
enabling the development of
sturdier metals and more volatile
explosives to allow creations on a grand
scale. For example, while steam technology is
extremely new on Golarion, steam engines
are much more likely to use alchemically
derived heat sources than the coal
furnaces used in our world.
TECHNOLOGY IN GOLARION
TODAY
Over the last two decades,
Golarion, and especially the
Inner Sea region comprised
of
the
continent
of
Avistan and the northern
portion of the continent
of Garund, have been beset by
catastrophe after catastrophe. Armies
of demons pouring forth from a wound
in the world itself, time‑displaced wizards
inciting chaos to restore their faded glory,
armies of giants and hobgoblins, and an
evil lich leading undead hordes have all
assaulted the people of Golarion and set
them reeling time and time again. While
these events have delayed certain
technological
advancements,
they
have
spurred
others.
Firearms are more prevalent in Golarion than they’ve
ever been before, and artificers in Varisia, Absalom,
and northern Garund constantly create new devices
both wondrous and terrible. Golarion stands on a cusp,
with alchemy prominent, clockworks poised to expand,
and steam-powered technology just entering its early
days of exciting innovation. These technologies may be
limited in their spread now but are positioned to bring
great change and advancement to Golarion. That isn’t a
guarantee, however. These advancements might all come
crashing down if the forces that seek the dissolution of
science and social cohesion have their way. Fortunately,
Golarion is also a world where heroes inevitably rise
up to face such challenges and take action to secure a
future of limitless possibility.
MODULARITY
As mentioned at the beginning of this introduction, Guns
& Gears has been organized so that you can use as
much, or as little, of the book as
is appropriate for your game
world. While some obvious
elements can help make this
intent apparent, such as the border art
changing between the Gears “book,” Guns
“book,” and The Rotating Gear “book,”
we’ve taken other steps as well that might not
be immediately obvious. Vehicles and siege
weapons, which can be fun and engaging
rules but might not be an appropriate fit for
all campaigns, each have their own separate
section. The firearms section is divided
between “Classic Firearms” and “Fantasy
Firearms,” so that if your preferred
setting has smooth-bore black powder
weapons as the technological “ceiling,”
you can allow only the classic firearms
in your campaign. If your high fantasy
setting blends the highlights of Earth’s
renaissance with fantastical or outright
magical
technology,
like
firearms
that
transform into swords or axes, or gun-like
weapons made from the taxidermic bodies
of supernatural creatures, you can add
those fantasy firearms to your game as well.
With all the possible permutations of a
fantasy world, we’ve endeavored to create
a book that speaks to as many people and
settings as possible, allowing people to
include the storytelling elements they most
enjoy without feeling overly pressured
to
include
those
that
negatively
impact their immersion or gaming
experience. Whether you want to play
a swashbuckling pirate with a black
powder pistol or a ysoki engineer
with a tesla coil backpack that

disrupts magical energy and a grappling hook with a
retractable clockwork cord, this book is for you. Feel
free to use the elements of this book that align strongly
with your vision for the characters, adventures, and game
world you create while leaving the rest behind!
BORDERS AND CHANGE
When constructing a fantasy world or playing in a
world like Golarion where wizards live next door
to gunslingers and even the most magical of realms
might have technological clockwork soldiers and other
scientific discoveries that simulate, enhance, or even
replace magic—it can become hard to picture how all
these disparate elements coexist alongside each other.
Why don’t firearms get adopted by other nearby
nations? Why would someone spend vast troves of gold
to build a clockwork dragon when they could teleport
an egg away from a nest and get the real thing much
more cheaply?
There are quite a few possible answers to these
questions, and figuring out those answers can help
make your campaign setting more vibrant and relatable.
To start, we’ll talk about some of the ways in which
Golarion answers these questions before diving into ways
to integrate these kinds of themes deeper into your own
original setting.
Dongun Hold and Alkenstar are strong examples of
areas in Golarion that can have a technology level that’s
significantly above the average technology level for the
rest of the world, without undermining or significantly
changing the general dynamics of Golarion and nearby
regions. Wedged between two warring nations ruled
by wizard kings, Alkenstar and Dongun Hold have no
significant ports of their own and are surrounded by a
wasteland filled with mutants and monsters. Moreover,
the ancient magical wars that scarred the Mana Wastes
also created pockets of unstable magic or magical dead
zones where magic remains unreliable at best and
virtually nonexistent at worst. As a
result, it makes sense that the hearty
smiths of Dongun Hold craft firearms
as the primary method to protect
themselves from dangerous creatures and
threats, as does the fact that the weapons
have remained available only in this
small region of the Inner Sea until
quite recently.
In your homebrew world, you
can use similar levers to partition the
different countries and regions you create
according to similar circumstances, or you
can use completely different options
as appropriate. For example, if your
campaign world is one in which
firearms exist but are limited to a very
specific part of the world, ask yourself why these weapons
have been restricted. Is there a powerful organization
that relies on its stranglehold over the secrets of firearm
production to protect its interests? Perhaps magic is
so prevalent that only a rare, aberrant individual who
lacks a talent for magic would be interested in pursuing
technological advancements. Maybe the dynamics of the
world itself comes into play; for example, some element
in the atmosphere or properties of the metals
drawn from below the surface resist being
shaped and manipulated to the degree
necessary for creating firearms or other
technological weapons and gadgets,
so the only way to obtain such items
is to purchase them from extraplanar
merchants who import them from
distant planes. The possibilities are
endless, and it doesn’t matter so much
what reason you decide on, as long
as you have some understanding of
how the world you create weaves
together.
Of course, your world could also be
a wild and boundless convergence of planar
nexuses, where gunslingers fight alongside
sword-swinging knights and psychic snakes.
Anything is possible and only needs to make
as much sense as is required for you and your
friends to enjoy yourselves and tell the kinds of
stories you want!
WHAT ABOUT NUMERIA?
The nation of Numeria is known to have technology levels
that greatly exceed those of the rest of Golarion. With a
crashed spaceship from a distant planet thrust into the
middle of its landscape, Numeria has lasers, artificial
intelligences, and other technology that transcend
steampunk or clockwork influences and approach the
realm of science fiction. Numeria and its technology
aren’t represented in this book, as those themes and
mechanics are better reserved for a presentation that can
give them the focus they deserve.
Some players might want to play a character from
Numeria, however, perhaps envisioning a ysoki inventor
who didn’t have access to technology from the crashed
spaceship and instead innovated based on what they
saw, using clockworks and steam engines to emulate the
functionality, if not the technological level, of weapons
and devices scavenged in the region. GMs who allow
access to the inventor class would be fully justified in also
giving characters from Numeria access to the inventor
and its gadgets, though with a clear understanding that
the technology level represented by the inventor is very
different from the highly advanced equipment normally
associated with the region.

In the world of Golarion, technology moves at its own
unusual pace. The widespread use of magic advanced
the ability for certain developments and discoveries, as
spells provided a natural way to discover new data or
solve a technological issue that required generations of
innovation on Earth. However, magic has been equally
a hindrance in the development of other technologies,
as the relative advancement and availability of low-level
magic meant it simply wasn’t worth the development
cost and time it would take to devote resources to
expanding other technologies whose benefits were easily
replicable by magic.
Another influencing factor in the development of
technology has been the many horrific cataclysms that
have befallen the planet of Golarion as a whole, and
various regions and nations in turn. Sometimes, a
technology discovered in ancient times is lost to Golarion
for millennia, only to resurface much later. For instance,
Xin, the first emperor of the ancient empire of Thassilon,
mastered the creation of clockworks over 10,000 years
ago, only to see his palace sink to the bottom of the ocean
and his discoveries lost to the ages.
Across much of Golarion, the options presented in this
chapter are uncommon at best, and some of them, like
Stasian technology, are rare or even unique in the world.
If you’re playing in a different setting than Golarion, your
group should decide if some or all of the technologies in
this chapter are more widely available, or if they aren’t
available at all.
Lands of Gears
In some corners of Golarion, these options are more
available than in others. Whether it’s due to discoveries
of ancient technology, the determination of a few
obsessed visionaries, or a storied history of innovation,
these tech-friendly locations, nations, and regions are
places where an enterprising player character looking
for technology might find that which they seek... and
possibly more than they bargained for as well.
CLOCKWORK
Absalom, the “City at the Center of the World,” naturally,
has access to engineering techniques from across the world,
and its famed Clockwork Cathedral (page 203) is a center
of learning for clockwork technologies. Meanwhile, many
inhabitants of the nation of New Thassilon, which recently
returned to the world after spending centuries displaced in
time, still remember some of First Emperor Xin’s secrets
regarding clockworks. These people tend to eagerly
explore new innovations that were created during their
GEARS CHARACTERS
The scorch marks on the wall made it clear: dragon breath. From what our wizard
said, that would probably make our adversary a red dragon. It wouldn’t have been
hard for a creature so greedy, powerful, and proud to beat us into these ancient ruins,
recently unsealed by a massive earthquake. Though something still didn’t seem right.
Most of the scorch marks weren’t fresh at all and were covered by ancient dust. When
we exited the tunnel into the great ruined chamber, we saw a gleaming metal dragon
made of thousands of clockwork parts, its fangs and claws tapering off into a dark
black metal. Adamantine, maybe? How could this be? The ruins were sealed for ages,
and I’d only ever seen a creature like this once before in Absalom. I remember hearing
the one from Absalom was cutting edge, too, but its design was much more rudimentary.
This shouldn’t be possible! But then the gears began to click and whir, and the dragon
construct’s mouth snapped open. A wave of flame arose from deep within its mechanical
body, licking from its maw in tongues of fire. Fortunately, this dragon wasn’t the only one
with a few tricks up its chassis. Sparks flew from my experimental armor as I activated
the new, if somewhat unstable, feature I created for situations just like this. When the
smoke cleared, I was barely singed, thanks to the heat-dispersing properties of my armor.
Our wizard wasn’t in the best of shape, though, and a pouch of my medicinal herbs had
caught fire. Thinking quickly, I finished what the dragon had started and vaporized
the herbs in an explosion, delivering much-needed relief to the wounded wizard. As I
pounded my fists together, electricity sparking between my two armored gauntlets, I
turned to face the dragon anew.

In the continent of Garund, near the border between the

of the Mwangi Expanse, the Uomoto people scavenge rare
wonders from the ruins of the Shory Empire, famed for
its flying cities that combined air magic with technology.
The nation of Eihlona in southern Garund has taken its
studies of the Shory and other magitechnology further,
placing its members among the finest experts of the craft.
Such hybrid magitechnology isn’t the domain of the Shory
alone. The ancient fallen empire known as the Jistka
Imperium (page 212) in northern Garund, near modernday Rahadoum, developed myriad magitechnological
constructs. The most notable were the famed automatons,
which were designed to house the souls and life forces of
Jistka’s finest residents, before Osirion’s distant ancestors
shattered the Jistkan empire.
Arcadia’s innovations, as well, bring with them
several unique blends of magitechnology, combining
gears, magical sources, and even monster parts to create
fantastic new devices.
Uomoto
characters,
characters
from
Eihlona,
automatons with memories of Jistka, and Arcadians
all have access to the inventor class (page 15), as well
as uncommon magitechnological options from the first
two chapters of this book. At the GM’s discretion, some
uncommon options might be more or less available in
certain regions.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
In Avistan, the nation of Ustalav (page 225) is
experiencing a technological renaissance championed
by reckless scientists and innovative undead hunters.
Stasian technology (page 82) is still rare, and even in
Ustalav, it’s hard to get your hands on the Stasian coils
necessary to power such equipment unless you have been
a direct participant in the new renaissance. Characters
from Ustalav have access to the inventor class. While
no characters automatically have access to Stasian
technology, players and GMs interested in exploring these
themes can work together to tie a character to one of the
factions, workshops, or places of learning dedicated to
understanding and developing Stasian tech, granting it as
part of that character’s story and journey.
LANDS BEYOND
The regions listed in this introduction are just a few of
the regions on Golarion where characters might be able
to access various gears options from this chapter and
the next, though they are the most prominent and wellknown. If you’re playing a campaign focused around
the spread and evolution of technology, the locations
where various technological wonders can be found
might shift as your campaign progresses. Furthermore,
you and your group might add your own technologically
advanced nations to the world, and future Pathfinder
books might reveal them as well. In all of these cases,
expand characters’ access to various uncommon options
as appropriate to the new locations.

INVENTOR
Any tinkerer can follow a diagram to make a device, but you invent
the impossible! Every strange contraption you dream up is a unique
experiment pushing the edge of possibility, a mysterious machine that
seems to work for only you. You’re always on the verge of the next great
breakthrough, and every trial and tribulation is another opportunity to test and tune. If
you can dream it, you can build it.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You rely on your inventions as much as possible, testing their functionalities
under a variety of conditions. You don’t set out to achieve anything as banal
as simply winning a fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used
to improve your creations!
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You provide useful context when discussing a variety of academic topics,
particularly when speaking about those subjects related to crafting and
invention. You might often look for opportunities to acquire patronage to
fund some of your more expensive or unorthodox experiments. After all, the
materials needed to assemble your inventions don’t pay for themselves!
WHILE EXPLORING...
You study the design and construction of the environments you explore
ardently, making note of clever traps, ingenious mechanisms, or especially
keen architecture you come across for later.
IN DOWNTIME...
You brainstorm new designs, bringing them to fruition through careful crafting
and meticulous attention to detail. You might also modify previous inventions to
adjust for data you’ve collected in the field. You might work as a local smith or
tinker where your skills are needed, or you might keep a workshop on the edge
of town where the clank and clatter of your experiments attracts less attention.
YOU MIGHT...
• Enjoy creating new things the world has never seen before.
• Be willing to take a chance on a theory, testing to see if your hypothesis
proves accurate. If not, you probably record the results to try again later.
• Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and
technical tangents when asked simple questions.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Marvel at your inventions and the variety of unbelievable wonder they
can bring.
• Believe that you’re a genius whose work is beyond understanding.
• Worry that your inventions might backfire or explode.

You gain these abilities as an inventor. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you gain from your chosen class at
1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
OVERDRIVE
You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention,
from muscle stimulants to concussive pistons. When it’s
necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you
in combat.
OVERDRIVE [one-action]
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Frequency once per round
Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive,
you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a
Crafting check that has a standard DC for your level.
Critical Success Your gizmos go into a state of incredible
efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to
your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to
your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive
ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or
reset, and you can’t use Overdrive for 1 minute.
Success Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your
attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is
equal to half your Intelligence modifier.
Failure You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.
Critical Failure Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire
damage equal to your level, and you can’t use Overdrive
again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset.
Special When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still
use the Overdrive action. You can’t extend your Overdrive’s
duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a
critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has
no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your
Overdrive on a critical failure.
INNOVATION
While you’re always creating inventions, there’s one that
represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope—
with refinement—might change the world. Choose one of
the below innovations. Your innovation’s level is equal to
your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend
1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a
high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An
innovation only works due to your constant maintenance
and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.
The innovations you can choose from in this book are
as follows.
Armor
Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor
with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one
of the sets of statistics on Table 2–2: Innovation Armor
Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set
of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).

Your innovation armor can have fundamental and
property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary
armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation,
everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would
normally be trained (or better) in medium armor.
Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your
innovation, either from the following or from other initial
armor modifications to which you have access.
• Harmonic Oscillator: You designed your armor to
inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create
interference against force and sound waves. You gain
resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and
sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive,
the resistance increases by 2.
• Metallic Reactance: The metals in your armor are
carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect
from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance
equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity
damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the
resistance increases by 2.
• Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only): Your
armor supports your muscles with a carefully
crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor
into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your
feats of athletics as well. When under the effects
of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Athletics checks; if you’re a master in Crafting, this
increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
• Otherworldly Protection: Just because you use
science doesn’t mean you can’t build your armor
with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed
to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain
resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative
damage, or to positive damage if you have negative
healing (such as if you’re a dhampir). You gain the
same amount of resistance to any types of alignment
damage—good, evil, chaotic, lawful—that can
damage you (note that creatures don’t take a given
type of alignment damage unless they are of the
opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil
damage only if you are good in alignment).
• Phlogistonic Regulator: A layer of insulation within
your armor protects you from rapid temperature
fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your
level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects
of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.
• Speed Boosters: You have boosters in your armor that
increase your Speed. You gain a +5‑foot status bonus to
your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus
when under the effects of Overdrive.
• Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only): You’ve
designed your armor to help you blend in and
dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor
into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect,
improving your Stealth. When under the effects of
Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
KEY TERMS
Gadget: Gadgets (starting on page 66) are consumable
technological inventions with innovative uses.
Modification: An ability with this trait alters your
innovation’s construction. If you have the reconfigure class
feature (page 20), you can retrain these feats more easily.
Unstable: Unstable actions use experimental applications
of your innovation that even you can’t fully predict, and
that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you).
When you take an unstable action, attempt a DC 17 flat
check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the
innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless)
fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and
it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable
actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire
damage equal to your level. As the innovation’s creator, you
can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making
adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you
can use unstable actions with that innovation again.
To take an unstable action, you must be using your
innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation
or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion
innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion
instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that
action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded
that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat
check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.
Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which
you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit.
If you’re unable to use unstable actions, you can still use
the action normally, but you can’t use the unstable function.
EQUIPMENT TRAITS
Your inventor abilities might grant your equipment the
following traits, which are reprinted here for convenience.
Climbing: The hand wielding the weapon is available
to Climb.
Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait
includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an
Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within
the weapon’s reach. That square becomes difficult terrain
until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise
stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.
Ranged Trip: The weapon can be used to Trip with
Athletics up to the weapon’s first range increment. The
skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add
the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the
check. As with using a melee weapon to Trip, a ranged
trip weapon doesn’t deal any damage when used to Trip.
This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.
Tethered: If you have a free hand while wielding this
weapon, you can Interact to pull the weapon back to
your grasp after you throw or shoot it as a ranged attack,
or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by
another creature).

================================================================================
PAGE 19
================================================================================

Stealth checks. If you’re a master in Crafting, this
increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
Construct
Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a
clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It’s a
prototype construct companion (page 32), and you
can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at
higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use
the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same
Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same
amount of fire damage on a critical failure.
You know how to spend additional time directing,
controlling, or programming your construct innovation
for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2
actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding
your construct companion; your construct companion
can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions,
rather than 2).
Choose one initial construct modification to apply to
your innovation, either from the following or from other
initial construct modifications to which you have access.
These modifications alter the construct’s abilities or form.
• Accelerated Mobility: Actuated legs, efficient gears in
the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your
construct faster. Your innovation’s Speed increases to
40 feet.
• Amphibious Construction:
Increased
buoyancy,
rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail
or powerful propeller make your construct able to
travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed
of 25 feet.
• Increased Size: You built your construct innovation
bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you
have this modification and your construct innovation
becomes an advanced construct companion or
otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can
immediately change increased size to a different initial
construct modification.
• Manual Dexterity:
Your
construct
innovation
has articulated hands or similar appendages
with significant manual dexterity. It can perform
manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As
normal for a companion, it still can’t wield weapons
or held items that don’t have the companion trait, and
it can’t activate items.
• Projectile Launcher: Your construct has a mounted
dart
launcher,
embedded
cannon,
or
similar
armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed
attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage
(you choose when you pick this modification). The
attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment
of 30 feet.
• Sensory Array: Additional sensory devices give your
innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well
as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
• Wonder Gears: You map specialized skills into
your construct’s crude intelligence. Your innovation
becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.
Weapon
Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon
augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins
with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or
martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple
or martial weapon to which you have access. You can
instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or
martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple
or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must
pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation
weapon can have fundamental and property runes added
to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of
the unique features of your innovation, everyone except
you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be
trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you
use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the
additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage.
Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to
your innovation, either from the following or from other
initial weapon modifications to which you have access.
These modifications grant additional weapon traits,
sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give
your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the
weapon could already deal, either from its base damage
type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you
select that modification, you can instead choose to give
the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type:
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
• Blunt Shot (Ranged Only): Your weapon innovation
can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust
the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning
attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking
a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your
innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits.
You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait
on each attack with your innovation.
• Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only): Increase
your innovation’s weapon damage die by one step
(d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In
addition, it gains one of the following traits of your
choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.
• Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon
Only; Can’t Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand
Trait): Your weapon’s modified weight distribution
can increase power in exchange for taking more hands
to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait,
with a damage die one size higher than the weapon’s
normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a
longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your
innovation also gains the versatile B trait.
• Entangling Form (Melee Only): You’ve altered your
weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to

have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains
the grapple and trip traits.
• Hampering Spikes (Melee Only): You’ve added long,
snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use
to impede your foes’ movement. Your innovation
gains the hampering and versatile P traits.
• Hefty Composition (Melee Only): Blunt surfaces
and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty
and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and
versatile B traits.
• Modular Head: You’ve constructed a multi-purpose,
adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or
you’ve made special ammunition you can swiftly
alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing (page 234).
When you Interact to use the modular trait, you
can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal
trait if it doesn’t currently have it, or to remove that
trait if it’s currently nonlethal.
• Pacification Tools (Melee Only): Softer materials
make your weapon suited to knock out
instead of kill, and special protrusions
let you catch weapons and disarm your
foes. Your innovation gains the disarm
and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to
apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with
your innovation.
• Razor Prongs (Melee Only): You can knock
down and slash your foes with sharp,
curved blades added to your weapon. Your
innovation gains the trip and versatile
S traits.
• Segmented
Frame:
Hinges,
clamps,
and telescoping parts make your
innovation
collapsible
and
adjustable. It gains the modular
trait for bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing (page 234). You
can Interact to collapse the
item down to light Bulk or to
return it to your normal form. When it’s collapsed to
light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants
you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and
DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.
EXPLODE
Your innovation is a creation barely held together by
your own engineering, always on the edge of completely
falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you
can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications
using special unstable actions. See the sidebar on page 17
for the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects
your innovation.
While inventors can learn various unstable actions
over their career, all at least know how to make their
innovation Explode.
EXPLODE [two-actions]
FIRE
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety
limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures
without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion
deals 2d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save to all creatures
in a 5-foot emanation around you (if you’re wearing or holding
the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation
is a minion).
At 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your
explosion’s damage by 1d6.

================================================================================
PAGE 21
================================================================================

If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can
choose either a 5-foot or 10-foot emanation for the area when
you use Explode; if you have the revolutionary innovation class
feature, you can choose a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 15-foot emanation.
PEERLESS INVENTOR
You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is
unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if
you don’t meet its prerequisites.
SHIELD BLOCK
You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets
you reduce damage with your shield.
INVENTOR FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain
an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an
assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For
simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of
your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many
feats and features, subject to GM discretion.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
EXPERT OVERDRIVE
3RD
You’ve increased your skill in crafting, and you can put
your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You
become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of
Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
RECONFIGURE
3RD
You’ve become an expert in all crafts and are always
adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change
the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day
of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting
check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you
can change one modification you’ve chosen for your
innovation to a different modification of the same kind
(initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).
If you have any modification feats, on a successful
check you can choose to instead retrain a modification
feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to
meet the standard restrictions for retraining.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if
it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
INVENTOR WEAPON EXPERTISE
5TH
You develop tricks for using your weapons more
effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial
weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to
the critical specialization effect with your innovation.
BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION
7TH
You’ve made a breakthrough in your field of study
and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your
innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your
innovation’s type to apply to your innovation. You can
choose an initial modification of your innovation’s type
instead if you prefer.
Breakthrough Armor Modifications
• Antimagic Plating: Whether you used some clever
adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known
as noqual or created magical protections of your
own design, you’ve strengthened your armor against
magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells
and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the
armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4
circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.
• Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only):
You’ve modified your armor’s exterior to let you
blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as
you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can
Hide even without cover or concealment, as the
pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.
• Dense Plating: You have encased your armor in
robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain
resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.
• Enhanced Resistance: You’ve improved upon your
initial modification’s ability to resist damage. The
resistance from your initial armor modification
adds your full level, instead of half your level (for
instance, phlogistonic regulator’s resistance would
increase to your level). If you have more than one

initial modification that gives resistance, choose
which one this applies to.
• Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only): You’ve
expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark,
and your groundbreaking design ensures you don’t
take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses.
Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your
proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other
heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency
in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least
16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of
reducing it to –5 feet. The armor’s adjusted statistics
are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty –2;
Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group
composite; Armor Traits bulwark.
• Hyper Boosters: You’ve improved your speed boosters’
power through a breakthrough that significantly
increases the energy flow without risking exploding.
You gain a +10‑foot status bonus to your Speed,
which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when
you’re in Overdrive. If you’re legendary in Crafting,
it instead increases to a +30‑foot status bonus when
you’re in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters
modification to select this modification.
• Layered Mesh: You’ve woven an incredibly powerful
network of interlocking mesh around your armor,
which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them.
While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to
piercing damage equal to half your level.
• Tensile Absorption: You’ve enhanced the tensile
capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with
bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you
gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half
your level.
Breakthrough Construct Modifications
• Advanced Weaponry: You’ve powered up your
construct’s weaponry. Choose one of your construct’s
unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial
weapon modification, chosen from the list on page
18 or from other initial weapon modifications to
which you have access. The unarmed attack must
meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as
being a melee attack for entangling form), and since
it’s an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain
requirements, such as being a simple weapon for
complex simplicity.
• Antimagic Construction: Whether you used some
clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal
known as noqual or created magical protections
entirely of your own devising, you’ve made your
innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct
innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all
saving throws and AC against spells.
• Climbing Limbs: With appendages that can claw
or create suction, your construct becomes a capable
climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal
to half its land Speed.
• Durable Construction: Your innovation is solidly
built; it can take significant punishment before being
destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.
• Marvelous Gears: Your innovation gains expert
proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For
any of these skills in which it was already an expert
(because of being an advanced construct companion,
for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If
you have the revolutionary innovation class feature,
these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary
if your construct innovation was already an expert.
You must have the wonder gears modification to
select this modification.
• Turret
Configuration:
Your
innovation
can
transform from a mobile construct to a stationary
turret. Your construct companion can transform as a
single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning
into a turret in its space (or transforming back from
a turret into its normal configuration). While it’s
a turret, your innovation is immobilized, but the
damage die from its projectile launcher increases to
1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet.
You must have the projectile launcher modification
to select this modification.
Breakthrough Weapon Modifications
• Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only): A carefully
tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon
especially good at hitting weak points. Your
innovation gains the backstabber trait (page 230)
and increases its range increment by 10 feet.
• Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only): You
carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to
maintain its momentum in attacks against successive
targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the
versatile S trait.
• Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only): Your
innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise
attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P
traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the
concealable trait.
• Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only;
Can’t Have the Two-Hand Trait): Combining your
weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can
quickly switch between attacking with your weapon
and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation
gains the free-hand trait.
• Manifold Alloy: You’ve devised several alloys that
contain useful properties of various metals, and
you replace a number of parts of your weapon or
its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your
weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means
you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural
creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.

================================================================================
PAGE 23
================================================================================

• Rope Shot (Ranged Only): Your weapon can shoot
projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets
around your foes’ legs to trip your targets, and
you can climb using the grappling hooks built into
the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the
climbing and ranged trip traits (see the sidebar on
page 17).
• Tangle Line (Thrown Only): Your weapon has an
extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies
over and quickly recall the weapon back to your
hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and
the tethered trait (see the sidebar on page 17).

OFFENSIVE BOOST
9TH
You’ve made additions to your innovation to upgrade
your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any
Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional
1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you
choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to
your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes
with one weapon you choose during daily preparations;
if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies
to your construct companion’s Strikes; and if your
innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes
with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch
to a different boost in the same way as switching your
modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with
the damage type in parentheses.
• Chill (Cold): Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat,
creating an intense chill.

REVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION
15TH
You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a
technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or
at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a
revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation.
You can also choose an initial or breakthrough
modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.
Revolutionary Armor Modifications
• Automated
Impediments:
Your
armor
uses
electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or
other techniques to make it difficult for those close
to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing
your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult
terrain for your enemies.
• Energy Barrier: Your armor’s defenses ablate any
kind of energy coming your way. While wearing
your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage
(acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive,
and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level.
You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic
reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to
select this modification.
• Incredible Resistance: You’ve improved upon
your breakthrough modification’s ability to resist
damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough
modifications your innovation has: dense plating,
layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the
resistance you gain from that modification to be
equal to your level, instead of half your level.
• Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only): You’ve
built a multisensory mask over your armor that
protects you by distorting your figure from all
senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled
sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you
gain concealment against all creatures, even if they
are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat’s
echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your
location obvious, you can’t use this concealment
to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the
concealment ends until you restore the mask as a
single action, which has the manipulate trait.
• Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only): You’ve
outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications
that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each
time you’re critically hit while wearing the armor,
attempt a DC 13 flat check. On a success, it becomes
a normal hit. This isn’t cumulative with fortification
runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with
a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half
your level against precision damage.
• Physical Protections: Your armor has so many
adjustments and precautions that it can guard
against all physical damage. While wearing your
armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage
(bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well
as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level.
You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or
tensile absorption breakthrough modification to
select this modification.
• Rune Capacity: Whether you’ve done some dabbling
in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering
solution, you’ve built your innovation in such a way
that it can hold an additional property rune. Your
innovation can have one more property rune than
a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four
property runes with a +3 potency armor).
Revolutionary Construct Modifications
• Flight Chassis: You fit your construct with a means
of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it
with wings and a lightweight construction. Your
innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
• Miracle Gears: As you perfect your innovation’s
cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its
Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a
language of your choice from among the languages
you know. Your construct gains the ability to use
actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce
and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes
legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based
skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous
gears modification to select this modification.
• Resistant Coating: Your innovation is hard to
damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all
damage (except adamantine).
• Runic Keystone: You’ve incorporated a device similar
to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to
hold a property rune, even though it isn’t a weapon
or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects
your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of
the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever
properties it would normally grant to a weapon to
your innovation’s unarmed attacks, following all
the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal
rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed
attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it
has no effect unless your innovation has a built‑in
ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial
modification, for example). If the rune would affect
the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or
armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect
when etched into your construct.
• Wall Configuration: Your innovation can transform
from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield
emplacement. It can unfold as a 2‑action activity
that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual
form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up
to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend
through your innovation’s original space. While your
construct is a wall, it can’t take any actions except to
use the same activity to transform back, and it can’t

================================================================================
PAGE 25
================================================================================

defend itself easily, making it flat-footed and giving
it an additional –2 status penalty to its AC. The wall
blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation
has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point
holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and
attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.
Revolutionary Weapon Modifications
• Attack Refiner: Your weapon makes minute
recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure
the next lands true. Your innovation gains the
backswing and shove traits.
• Deadly
Strike:
Through
precise
calculation,
you’ve found the perfect shape for your weapon
to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike.
Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your
innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly
die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.
• Enhanced Damage: You’ve made your innovation
more powerful than other weapons of its kind.
Increase your innovation’s weapon damage die by
one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
As normal, you can’t increase your die by more than
one size, so this modification isn’t cumulative with
complex simplicity.
• Extensible Weapon (Melee only): You’ve found a way
to construct your weapon so that it can extend while
leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation
gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the
reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional
10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.
• Impossible Alloy: Other inventors claim it’s not even
technically possible, but you’ve managed to create
several metal alloys that seem to work for only you.
These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to
any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is
treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine,
djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite).
This means you deal more damage to a variety of
creatures, though you don’t apply any of the other
special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.
• Momentum Retainer (Melee only): A special
weighted device lets your weapon retain more of
its momentum when you attack. Your innovation
gains the forceful and versatile B traits.
• Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only): You’ve
modified your innovation to be dangerous and
effective at any range. If your innovation had the
volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise,
increase your innovation’s range increment by 50
feet or an amount equal to the weapon’s base range
increment, whichever is more.
• Rune Capacity: Whether you’ve dabbled with
orichalcum or found another engineering solution,
you’ve built your innovation in such a way that it can
hold an additional property rune. Your innovation
can have one more property rune than a normal item
of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes
with a +3 potency weapon).
INVENTIVE MASTERY
17TH
Your inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency
rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.
JUGGERNAUT
17TH
Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a
Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
INFINITE INVENTION
19TH
Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached
impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make
major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily
preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it’s
destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different
innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type
you have access to) and change your modifications and
offensive boost.
If you have any feats that had your previous innovation
as a prerequisite, you can’t use them until you retrain
the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of
downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your
new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.
MEDIUM ARMOR MASTERY
19TH
Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more
blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor,
as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.
Inventor Feats
At every level that you gain an inventor feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
BUILT-IN TOOLS
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
You’ve built tools into your innovation so you can access and
use them easily. When you take this feat, choose up to two
sets of tools you own, such as thieves’ tools or healer’s tools,
that weigh a total of 2 Bulk or less. These tools become part
of your innovation. The innovation’s Bulk doesn’t increase
from this addition. As long as you are wielding, wearing, or
adjacent to your innovation, you have the same quick access
to these tools as the tools you are wearing, and they don’t
count against the usual limit of tools you can wear.
EXPLOSIVE LEAP [one-action]

launch yourself into the air. You jump up to 30 feet in any
direction without touching the ground. You must land on a
space of solid ground, or else you fall after using your next
action. As normal for effects where you fall after using your
next action, you still fall at the end of your turn, even if you
don’t use any further actions that turn.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
HAPHAZARD REPAIR [one-action]
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
UNSTABLE
You quickly fix your innovation, at the cost of its stability. You
Repair your innovation almost immediately. You don’t have
to place the innovation on a flat surface, but you do need to
be adjacent to it (including holding or wearing it), as well as
having a repair kit as normal.
NO! NO! I CREATED YOU! [reaction]
FEAT 1
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct companion
Frequency once per minute
Trigger Your construct companion would become confused or
controlled.
You appeal to your construct companion’s bond with its
creator to have it break free of a controlling effect. Attempt
to counteract the effect that confused or controlled your
construct companion, using your Crafting modifier for the
counteract check and half your level rounded up for the
counteract level.
PROTOTYPE COMPANION
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
You have created a construct companion, and while it might
not be an innovation, it serves as a trustworthy minion. You
gain a prototype construct companion (page 32).
TAMPER [one-action]
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You tamper with a foe’s weapon or armor, using a free hand.
Choose either a weapon held by an enemy in your reach or
a suit of armor worn by an enemy in your reach. Attempt a
Crafting check against the enemy’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success Your tampering is incredibly effective.
If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls
with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor
hampers the enemy’s movement, making the enemy
flat‑footed and inflicting a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds.
The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it,
regardless of which one you used.
Success Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical
success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn,
even if the enemy doesn’t Interact to end it.
Critical Failure Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating
a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take fire
damage equal to your level.
VARIABLE CORE
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
You adjust your innovation’s core, changing the way it
explodes. When you choose this feat, select acid, cold, or
electricity. Your innovation’s core runs on that power source.
When using the Explode action, or any time your innovation
explodes on a critical failure and damages you, change the
damage type from fire damage to the type you chose.
If you have the offensive boost class feature and retrain
Variable Core to a different damage type, you can also switch
to a different offensive boost that deals the same damage type
if you wish.
2ND LEVEL
COLLAPSE ARMOR [one-action]
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites armor innovation
Requirements You are wearing your armor innovation, or
holding it in both hands in its compact form (see text).
You’ve modified your armor innovation to collapse into a more
compact form so you can don or remove it in an instant. If
you’re wearing your innovation when you Collapse your
Armor, you remove it instantly, and it compresses into its
compact form, which is held in both of your hands (if you don’t
have both hands available, it falls to the ground in an adjacent
space). If you’re holding your armor in compact form when
you take this action, it unfolds back into its armor form onto
your body.
In compact form, your armor innovation is easier to carry,
with a Bulk 1 lower than the Bulk listed for it, to a minimum
of light Bulk (carried armor normally has a Bulk 1 higher than
listed in the armor entry).
COLLAPSE CONSTRUCT [one-action]
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites construct innovation
You’ve modified your construct companion and built it out
of light materials, enabling you to collapse it into a carrying
case or other compact and innocuous form. Either your
construct or you (if you’re adjacent to it) can Collapse your
Construct to turn it into its compact form or back into its
normal form.
In compact form, your construct can’t act but is easily
carried, with a Bulk of 2 if it’s Small, 4 if it’s Medium, or 8 if it’s
Large. The compact form has wheels, so you can easily drag
it behind you at half your Speed (rather than the usual slower
Speed for dragging).
REVERSE ENGINEER
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
You are incredibly skilled at reverse engineering items to
learn their formulas, or disassembling them just to disable
them. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks
to reverse engineer a formula from an item. If you get a

reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and
the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item’s value.
Furthermore, you can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a Device or Pick
a Lock.
SEARING RESTORATION [one-action]
FEAT 2
FIRE
HEALING
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were fools…
Fools who didn’t understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your
innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal
herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains 1d10 Hit Points. In addition, the
creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source
of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you,
though because it’s not a living creature, it can’t use the ability on itself.
4TH LEVEL
ADVANCED CONSTRUCT COMPANION
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct companion
You’ve upgraded your construct companion’s power and decision-making ability. It
becomes an advanced construct companion (page 33). During an encounter, even if
you don’t use the Command a Minion action, your construct companion can still use
1 action on your turn that round to Stride or Strike.
DIVING ARMOR
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites armor innovation
You’ve modified your armor with fins, rotors, and other devices to make it easy
for you to move through the water, plus mechanical gills that can help you
extract breathable air from water. While wearing your armor innovation, you can
breathe underwater and gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed.
DUAL-FORM WEAPON
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites weapon innovation
You’ve built your innovation with replaceable interlocking pieces that you can use to
transform it into another type of weapon entirely. When you select this feat, choose
a level 0 or 1st-level simple or martial weapon. It must be either a common weapon
or another to which you have access. This weapon becomes your innovation’s second
configuration.
Select a new set of weapon modifications for this new configuration. You can
spend two Interact actions to switch your weapon innovation between the two
configurations. These actions don’t need to be taken consecutively, but if you’ve
provided the first and not the second, the weapon is non-functional as it is
stranded between states. Your weapon’s Bulk is always the greater Bulk of the two
configurations, regardless of which configuration it’s in—if one weapon is smaller
than the other, you still need to keep any weapon parts on hand. Any runes on your
weapon innovation don’t affect the second weapon configuration.

Rather than just using your gadgets for various boosts and
tweaks, you also craft a few specific temporary consumable
gadgets each day. You gain the formulas for three common
or uncommon gadgets (page 66). Each day during your daily
preparations, you can create two temporary gadgets from
your formula book. Gadgets prepared in this way don’t cost
you any resources to Craft and don’t have any sale value. They
are temporary items and fall apart the next time you make
your daily preparations if you haven’t already used them.
If you’re a master in Crafting, you can create three gadgets
per day, and you gain three additional common or uncommon
gadget formulas. If you’re legendary in Crafting, you can create
four gadgets per day, and you gain another additional three
common or uncommon gadget formulas, for a total of nine.
MEGATON STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
You activate gears, explosives, and other hidden mechanisms
in your innovation to make a powerful attack. You make a
Strike, dealing an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at
least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re
at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice. The type of
Strike you can make depends on your innovation.
• Armor You Strike with a melee unarmed attack or a
melee weapon. To use a melee weapon for this, you must
have prepared it in advance with special contraptions
when you make your daily preparations.
• Construct Your minion innovation Strikes.
• Weapon You Strike with your weapon innovation.
Unstable Function You put even more force into the Strike,
though you risk stress fractures to your innovation. Add the
unstable trait to Megaton Strike. The Strike deals another
extra damage die, for a total of two extra dice at 4th level,
three at 10th level, and four at 18th level.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
6TH LEVEL
CLOCKWORK CELERITY [free-action]
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
Trigger Your turn begins.
You can use unstable clockwork devices in your innovation to
push your invention to act more quickly. You are quickened
for this turn. How you can use the extra action depends on
your innovation.
• Armor You can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or use
another movement action granted by your innovation
(such as Swim if you have the Diving Armor feat).
• Construct You can use the extra action to Command your
construct innovation (or to provide 1 of the actions if you
spend 2 actions to Command your construct).
• Weapon You can use the extra action to Strike with your
innovation or Reload your innovation.
CONSTRUCT SHELL
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
You’ve adjusted your construct innovation so that when you
ride it, special plates, hollows, or similar form partial barriers
around you to add additional protection. You have lesser cover
from all attacks when mounted on your construct innovation,
not just from attacks where the construct would be in the way.
Additionally, if your construct uses an emanation while you’re
riding on it, such as Explode, you can choose not to be affected
by the emanation.
MEGAVOLT [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ELECTRICITY
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You bleed off some electric power from your innovation in the
shape of a damaging bolt. Creatures in a 20-foot line from your
innovation take 3d4 electricity damage, with a basic Reflex
save against your class DC. The electricity damage increases
by 1d4 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.
Unstable Function You overload and supercharge the
voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The
area increases to a 60-foot line and the damage increases from
d4s to d12s.
If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you
can choose a 60-foot or 90-foot line for the area when you
use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary
innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or
120-foot line.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
VISUAL FIDELITY
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
You’ve found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of
devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You
gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see invisible
creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these
shapes are indistinct enough to be concealed to you.
If an effect would give you the blinded condition, the effect
must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with
your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On
a failed counteract check, you aren’t blinded—your various
devices are able to compensate.
8TH LEVEL
GIGATON STRIKE
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Megaton Strike
When you use a full-power Megaton Strike, you can knock
your foe back. When you succeed at your Strike while using
an unstable Megaton Strike, your target must attempt a
Fortitude save against your class DC.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
Failure The creature is pushed back 10 feet.

================================================================================
PAGE 29
================================================================================

Critical Failure The creature is pushed back 20 feet.
Special If your innovation is a minion, this benefit applies
on its unstable Megaton Strikes.
INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCT COMPANION
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Advanced Construct Companion
Thanks to your continual tinkering, your construct companion
has advanced to an astounding new stage of engineering,
enhancing all its attributes. Your construct companion
becomes an incredible construct companion.
MANIFOLD MODIFICATIONS
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites initial modification
You’ve modified your innovation using clever workarounds, so you
can include another initial modification without compromising its
structure. Your innovation gains an additional initial modification
from the list for innovations of its type (page 16).
OVERDRIVE ALLY [one-action]
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites Overdrive
Requirements You are currently in overdrive.
You quickly fling some of your powered-up mechanisms to an
ally, sharing your benefits with them briefly. Choose an ally
within 30 feet. Until the end of their next turn, that ally’s
Strikes deal additional damage equal to half your Intelligence
modifier, or your full Intelligence modifier if you were in
critical overdrive. The ally doesn’t gain the increased damage
from expert, master, or legendary overdrive.
UBIQUITOUS GADGETS
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Gadget Specialist
They thought you had used up all your devices, but they
thought wrong! You have a few more gadgets up your sleeve
than others expect. Increase the number of temporary gadgets
you can create each day by 2.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th
level or higher.
10TH LEVEL
DISTRACTING EXPLOSION [reaction]

Your enemies think they can concentrate on something else
while you’re nearby? Oh, you’ll give them a distraction, all
right! Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature
with a weapon or unarmed attack that is benefiting from your
offensive boost. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple
attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply
to this Strike.
Unstable Function You pull out all the stops to create an
explosive distraction. Add the unstable trait to Distracting
Explosion. If the attack hits, you disrupt the triggering
concentrate action.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this
reaction instead of you, even though minions can’t normally
take reactions or act when it’s not their turn. It uses your
reaction for the turn to do so.
ELECTRIFY ARMOR [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites armor innovation
Requirements You are wearing your armor innovation.
You electrify your armor to punish foes who dare to attack
you. For 1 round, any creature that touches you, or that
hits you with a melee unarmed attack or a non-reach melee
weapon attack, takes 1d4 electricity damage. The effect ends
if you cease wearing your armor innovation.
If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, the
damage increases to 2d4.
Unstable Function You create an unstable chain reaction,
sending countless sparks dancing across your armor. Add
the unstable trait to Electrify Armor. The effects last for 1
minute instead of 1 round, and the damage dice increase
from d4s to d12s.
HELPFUL TINKERING [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites offensive boost
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You don’t just tinker with your own innovation, you
fiddle with your allies’ weapons as well (for their benefit,
of course). Choose an ally in your reach and one of their
weapons. Attempt a Crafting check against a high DC for
your level.
Success For 1 minute, the chosen ally’s Strikes with the
chosen weapon gain the same offensive boost your
innovation has.
Critical Failure Your ally takes damage of the type and
amount that your offensive boost normally deals on a
successful Strike.
LOCK ON [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
Aha! You lock on to your enemy’s weak point to assist
your construct companion in destroying it. When you Lock
On, designate an enemy you can see. If your next action
is to Command your construct, the construct gains a +2
circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the designated
enemy until the end of the turn. If you use 2 actions for the
Command, the bonus is instead a +3 circumstance bonus, or a
+4 circumstance bonus if you’re legendary in Crafting.
12TH LEVEL
BOOST MODULATION
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites offensive boost
You aren’t satisfied with keeping to just one kind of boost
from your constant tinkering, so you’ve learned to modulate
between several possibilities at once. Choose two additional
offensive boosts (page 22). You can use an Interact action to
change the offensive boost currently affecting your weapon,
choosing between the one you chose for the class feature and
the two you chose for this modification. If your weapon has
the modular trait, you can swap the offensive boost as part of
the Interact action you take to use that trait.
CONTINGENCY GADGETS
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Gadget Specialist
You are too brilliant to be caught off guard, and you always
have just the right gadget for the situation. When you
prepare your gadgets during your daily preparations, you
can choose to leave one of them as a contingency gadget
that you keep ready for just this situation, rather than
declaring which gadget you’re making. You can pull the
contingency gadget out using an Interact action, at which
point you must choose which gadget you had prepared as
a contingency.
If you’re legendary in Crafting, you can leave two
contingency gadgets during your daily preparations, instead
of just one.
DEEP FREEZE [two-actions]
FEAT 12
COLD
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation,
damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature
within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your
level, with effects depending on its Reflex save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage and takes a –5-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
Failure The target takes full damage and takes a –10-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage, is slowed 1
for 1 round, and takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds
for 1 round.
Unstable Function Your innovation discharges an enormous
cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading
failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability
affects all creatures within a 60-foot cone instead of a single
target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level
instead of equal to your level.

Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
GIGAVOLT
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Megavolt
When you unleash electricity from your innovation, you can bounce it off obstacles,
creating a field of electric death. When you use Megavolt, each time your line of
electricity hits a solid barrier, such as a wall, it bounces off at an angle of your choice
and continues until you have reached the full length of the line. Even if a creature is
in the area from multiple bounces, it takes the damage only once.
SHARED OVERDRIVE
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Overdrive Ally
You’ve experimented enough on your teammates to transfer a substantial number
of powered-up gizmos to them, enabling one of your allies to benefit from the full
effects and duration of your Overdrive. The first time you use Overdrive Ally during a
given Overdrive, the effect lasts for the remainder of the duration of your Overdrive,
instead of just until the end of the target’s next turn. Any further uses of Overdrive
Ally during the same Overdrive have their normal duration, per Overdrive Ally.
14TH LEVEL
EXPLOSIVE MANEUVER [one-action]
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Prerequisites weapon innovation
Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike against a
foe using your weapon innovation.
Thanks to a hidden experimental feature you built into your
weapon, your weapon explosively deploys levers, tangling
hooks, or similar mechanisms to provide significant assistance
when you perform a combat maneuver. When you use
Explosive Maneuver, choose Grapple, Shove, or Trip. Your
weapon innovation must have a weapon trait that matches
the action you chose (for instance, to choose Grapple, your
weapon must have the grapple trait). You take the chosen
action against the same foe as your previous successful
Strike, using the same multiple attack penalty as your
previous successful Strike. You still increase your multiple
attack penalty after the Grapple, Shove, or Trip, as normal.
PARAGON COMPANION
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Incredible Companion
Your construct companion has reached the pinnacle of form and function. Your
construct companion becomes a paragon construct companion.
SOARING ARMOR
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites armor innovation
Whether through a release of jets of flame, propeller blades, sonic bursts, streamlined
aerodynamic structure, electromagnetic fields, or some combination of the above,
you’ve managed to free your innovation from the bonds of gravity! While wearing
your innovation, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.

UNSTABLE REDUNDANCIES [free-action]
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Trigger You would attempt the flat check for an unstable
action, but you haven’t rolled the flat check yet.
You’ve built triple redundancies into your innovation and
added all sorts of buffers to protect it from the harm of your
unstable experiments. You automatically succeed at the
triggering flat check.
You can’t rely on your Unstable Redundancies again until
you spend 10 minutes setting them back up. If you spend 10
minutes retuning your innovation so you can use unstable
actions again, you can set up your Unstable Redundancies
during the same time.
16TH LEVEL
JUST THE THING!
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Frequency once per hour
Need to balance on a razor’s edge, force open an iron door, or
persuade a dragon to negotiate? Never fear! No matter the
situation, you always have just the thing. You attempt a skill
action that takes 1 minute or less to complete, using the same
number of actions or amount of time as normal. However, as
you take the action, describe a device you pull out and use
to accomplish the skill. The specifics of how you accomplish
this are up to you, but they should fit the challenge at hand.
For instance, you might use gravitic stabilizers to balance on
the razor’s edge, a force battering ram gizmo to open the iron
door, or a device that produces an aroma with the ability to
pacify wyrms to persuade the dragon. Using an invention in
this way lets you alter how you calculate the skill check used
in the action. Instead of the normal skill modifier associated
with that skill action, you use your Crafting modifier.
PERSISTENT BOOST
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Prerequisites offensive boost
Your innovation sets foes on fire, covers them in acid, leaves
barbed thorns behind, or otherwise deals persistent damage
to your foes that sticks around long after you deliver your
boosted attack. When you or your construct innovation
damage a foe with offensive boost, that foe also takes 1d8
persistent damage of the same damage type as the offensive
boost damage.
YOU FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR... THIS! [reaction]
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Trigger A creature you can see targets you with an attack
against your AC.
When your foes try to attack you, you always seem to
have some outlandish invention you can pull out at the last
second to protect you from whatever attack they throw at
you. Describe a device you’re attempting to use to protect
yourself from the foe’s attack—for instance, when attacked
by a shocker lizard’s shock Strike, you might pull out a
specially grounded lightning rod from that time you tried to
power an invention by harnessing a thunderstorm! Using an
invention to defend in this way means that the attack roll
for the triggering attack targets your Crafting DC instead of
your AC.
Since you’re using your Crafting DC instead of your AC,
any penalties to your AC don’t apply, but this doesn’t remove
any conditions or other effects that are causing you such
penalties. For instance, if you were flat-footed and used an
invention to defend against a sneak attack, you’d still take
the extra precision damage if you were hit, even though the
–2 penalty to AC from being flat-footed wouldn’t apply to
your Crafting DC.
18TH LEVEL
DEVASTATING WEAPONRY [three-actions]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites weapon innovation
You release a volley of projectiles from your weapon, or
power it to fly in every direction across the battlefield and
Strike multiple creatures. Make a Strike with your weapon
innovation against each foe within 30 feet of you. Don’t
increase your multiple attack penalty until after making all
the attacks. If your innovation is a melee weapon and any of
the attacks are outside your reach, you Release the weapon
before the Strikes, and it returns to your grasp after all of
them. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it
falls to the ground in your space. As normal, if your weapon
innovation requires one or more actions to reload between
Strikes, you can’t use it to make multiple attacks with
Devastating Weaponry.
ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION [three-actions]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
Your construct unleashes a broad swath of devastation by
separating its limbs, deploying hidden armaments, or using
a similar technique to wreak havoc. You Command your
innovation. Instead of its normal actions, it Strides once,
then makes a Strike against each foe within 30 feet of it
with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the construct
makes all the attacks.
NEGATE DAMAGE [reaction]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor innovation
Trigger You would take damage.
Your armor innovation activates various devices you
prepared ahead of time, and you use one of them to reduce
the damage you would take by 15.
Unstable Function You activate all the precautions at
once, violently repelling the incoming attack to blunt its
force. Add the unstable trait to Negate Damage and reduce
the damage you would take by 50.

FULL AUTOMATION
FEAT 20
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
You become so entwined with your innovations that you
can use them without a second thought. You’re permanently
quickened. How you can use the extra action depends on
your innovation.
• Armor Your armor responds to the most subtle stimuli
to move you in the right direction as long as you are
wearing it. You can use the extra action to Stride, Step,
or use a form of movement provided by your innovation
(such as Fly or Swim).
• Construct Your ability to command your construct
becomes instinctive. You can use the extra action to
Command your construct innovation (or to provide
1 of the actions if you choose to spend 2 actions to
Command your construct).
• Weapon Your weapon becomes easier to wield with
deadly efficacy, almost as if it is an extension of your
body. It speeds effortlessly toward whatever target
you choose as long as you are holding it. You can use
the extra action to Strike with your innovation.
UBIQUITOUS OVERDRIVE
FEAT 20
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Shared Overdrive
You prepare a variety of incredible gizmos on each of your
allies, linking them together through careful modification to
enable you to power them up all at once. During your daily
preparations, select up to six willing allies. Whenever you
Overdrive, you grant the benefits of your overdrive to any of
these allies you choose who are within 30 feet of you. The
allies don’t gain the increased damage from expert, master, or
legendary overdrive.
Construct Companions
A construct companion is a loyal semi-sentient
construct who follows your orders obediently and is
roughly as intelligent as an animal. Your construct
companion has the minion trait, and it gains 2 actions
during your turn if you use the Command a Minion
action to command it.
If your companion is destroyed, you can spend 1
day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with
a high DC for your level. On a success, you rebuild
your companion. You can have only one construct
companion at a time, and you can have either a
construct companion or an animal companion, but not
both.
RIDING CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
You or an ally can ride your construct companion as long
as your construct companion is at least one size larger
than the rider.
PROTOTYPE CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
The following are the base statistics for a prototype
construct companion, the first construct companion most
characters get. A companion has the same level you do.
As you gain levels, you might make further adjustments
as your companion grows more powerful. Construct
companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you
do, with one difference: the only item bonuses they can
benefit from are to Speed.
Construct Trait
A construct companion has the construct trait. It’s not a
living creature, nor is it undead.
Proficiencies
Your construct companion is trained in its unarmed
attacks,
unarmored
defense,
all
saving
throws,
Perception,
Acrobatics,
and
Athletics.
Construct
companions can’t use abilities that require greater
Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even
if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have an
ability that allows it.
Size
Your construct companion is either Small or Medium,
chosen by you when you first gain the companion.
Strikes
Your construct companion has two kinds of melee
unarmed attacks. Its first unarmed attack deals 1d8
bludgeoning damage. Depending on the shape of your
construct this could be a fist, tendril, or other similar
unarmed attack. Its other unarmed attack deals 1d6
slashing or piercing damage (choose when you first
gain the companion) and has the agile and finesse traits.
Depending on the shape of your construct, this could be a
spine or spike, jaws or fangs, a retractable blade, or other
similar unarmed attack.
Ability Modifiers
A construct companion begins with base ability
modifiers of Str +3, Dex +3, Con +2, Int –4, Wis +1,
Cha +0.
Hit Points
Your construct companion has 10 Hit Points, plus a
number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution
modifier for each level you have.
While constructs are usually immediately destroyed
at 0 Hit Points, your construct companion is a little
harder to destroy than other constructs are. When your
construct reaches 0 Hit Points, it becomes broken and
begins sparking and might be destroyed if you don’t
Repair it. This works the same as the normal dying
rules and determines if your construct is destroyed,
with the following two changes. First, most effects that

end the dying condition don’t work to save a construct
companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the
Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill
instead of Medicine. Second, instead of gaining and
tracking the wounded condition, if your construct
becomes broken in this way more than twice within
a 10-minute period, it’s destroyed, and you’ll need to
reconstruct it by spending a day of downtime.
Immunities
Because it’s a construct, your construct companion
is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed,
drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal
attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious.
Because the construct isn’t a living creature, effects that
heal living creatures can’t help it recover Hit Points.
Restoring Hit Points to it requires using the Repair
action or other means that can restore Hit Points to
objects and nonliving creatures.
Senses
Your construct companion has precise vision, imprecise
hearing, and vague touch senses, but no sense of smell
or taste.
Speed
Your construct companion has a Speed of 25 feet.
ADVANCED CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To advance a prototype construct companion
to an advanced construct companion (usually a
result of one of your class feat choices), make
the following adjustments.
• Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
• Increase its unarmed attack damage
from one die to two dice (for instance,
1d8 to 2d8).
• Increase its proficiency rank for
Perception and all saving throws
to expert.
• Increase its proficiency ranks
in Intimidation, Stealth, and
Survival to trained. If the
construct is your innovation
and it was already trained
in those skills from a
modification, increase its
proficiency rank in those
skills to expert.
• You can change your
companion’s Size, if you
want, to either Small, Medium, or Large.
INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To improve an advanced construct companion to an
incredible construct companion, make the following
adjustments.
• Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and
Wisdom modifiers by 2.
• It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed
attacks. Its attacks become magical, allowing it to
bypass resistances to non-magical attacks.
• Increase its proficiency ranks in Athletics and
Acrobatics to expert.
PARAGON CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To improve an incredible construct companion to a paragon
construct companion, make the following adjustments.
• Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and
Wisdom modifiers by 1.
• Increase its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks
and unarmored defense to expert.
• Increase
its
proficiency
ranks
for
Athletics,
Acrobatics, saving throws, and Perception to master.
• Increase its unarmed attack damage from two
dice to three dice, and its additional damage with
unarmed attacks from 2 to 4.

Examining the knuckles on my gauntlets, I despaired. While they had done as I had hoped
and battered through the dragon’s adamantine scales, their once pristine surfaces were
now heavily dented. Worse, I’d blown out a capacitator when I activated them a second
time for that final attack. As the paladin made her rounds, applying bandages and laying
on hands, I pulled my tools out of my pack and set about repairing the damage.
My diligence was well rewarded, as a strange metal door hidden by the dragon’s body
slowly spiraled open from the floor. A metallic lift rose up. Upon it stood a pair of statues,
their bodies made of a bright, gleaming silver. First adamantine, now mithral as well?
As soon as I realized that, I called for our wizard to ready his spells of cold and water.
Whoever once called this place home possessed unimaginable resources! Not one, but
three guardians, each forged from enough precious metal to beggar a kingdom’s treasury.
Fortunately, I had more at my disposal than electrified gauntlets and heat-resistant
armor. As the wizard’s cold washed over the first golem, I opened the release valve for the
nozzle attached to my right gauntlet. A stream of pressurized, cold fluid surged forth and
engulfed our foes. As the golems’ bodies congealed and cracked, I couldn’t help but smile.
These constructs proved that even more lay hidden beneath our feet. I remained all too
eager to discover the truth, but little did I realize the magnitude of what was next in store.

Golarion is a world of fantasy, one that is incredibly
vast and diverse. This means that numerous reflections
of the genre, in all its permutations, can be found
somewhere the world, as long as you know where to
look. The Shining Kingdoms are a land of knights and
chivalry similar to those imagined in the legends of King
Arthur, the Saga Lands remain home to fierce vikings and
time-displaced wizards, and the High Seas embody the
spirit of exploration and the fearsome naval combat of
the age of piracy.
Fantasy has more to offer than just knights in shining
armor and wizards in tall towers. Ingenious goblins and
ratfolk cobbling together technology from half a dozen
different disciplines and schematics, industrious dwarves
smithing intricate technological marvels, and humans
meticulously assembling clockwork creatures and
weapons piece by painstaking piece all have their places
within the genre of fantasy and in the world of Golarion.
For the automatons of the Jistka Imperium, their place
in the world remains complicated. They represent the last
remnants of an ancient society that mastered magic and
machines in equal measure, then left them behind after
the society fell as a relic of their lost nation’s greatest
achievement. For trick drivers and their trusty vehicle
mechanics, their place might be almost anywhere, though
they’re unlikely to learn their craft outside of port cities
like Absalom, or countries where technology grew at a
steady pace alongside magic, like the continent of Arcadia
or the nation of New Thassilon. Meanwhile, trapsmiths
and their cogwheel snares find a home in Absalom, with
its Clockwork Cathedral; in the gritty Grand Duchy of
Alkenstar or their dwarven allies in Dongun Hold; or in
Arcadia or New Thassilon as well.
Even characters whose classes typically represent the
embodiments of classic fantasy and high magic might
have a spark of technology hidden away somewhere,
perhaps waiting for just the right moment to reveal the
ace up their sleeves. The old wizard, his body failing
but his magic strong, might choose to replace a failing
heart with a clockwork organ rather than succumb
to the temptation of undeath. A construct might
successfully seek out a soul and life as a living
creature to start anew and attain a different
perspective about the world. Even an elven archer
in a forest far away from any center of technology
might create devices that are entirely new to their
culture, such as scopes and eyewear that use the
scientific power of crystals and lenses to see hidden
targets and enable otherwise impossible shots. In all
these cases, players should work together with their
GMs to build context and story behind these ideas and
ground the character in the world.
Fantasy is as broad and deep as human imagination.
Let the ancestry, backgrounds, and archetypes that
follow take your imagination even farther down the road
of what a such a world can be!
VARIATIONS ON A THEME
The
inventor
class,
automaton
ancestry,
new
backgrounds, and other elements located in this book
give players ways to embody different aesthetics
that infuse mechanical concepts or fantastic science
into their character designs. The degree to which you
combine these elements is something that can help you
impact the development of your character and the tone
and feel of your game in a variety of ways.
An automaton character with a Pathfinder Core
Rulebook class like fighter or monk can be an interesting
twist on a classic idea. An automaton inventor with the
Disciple of the Gear background who multiclasses as a
cleric of Brigh, goddess of invention, can be the focal
point of an entire campaign arc themed around the spread
of technology and the search to understand the mortal
soul. A gnome vehicle mechanic who maintains and
makes improvements upon a single vehicle can serve as
an unusual character whose existence begs the question
of the prevalence of technology throughout the world, or
as an established member of a robust mechanics’ guild
that creates and maintains a small fleet of vehicles used
for a particular purpose by a city or civilization.
The way that you combine the elements presented in
this section can enable you to tell a vast array of different
stories. The extent to which magic and technology coexist
in your fantasy setting is up to you. Players and GMs
should work together to discover how their respective
ideas can influence each other as they explore how much
influence technology has on the world, as well as discuss
methods they might employ as the campaign unfolds to
demonstrate its importance, or lack thereof.

================================================================================

The Jistka Imperium was the first major human
civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the
area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring
for seven centuries thanks to great advancements
in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka’s leaders
often favored aggressive uses of technology, and
early advances paved the way for arrogance,
petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka
Imperium’s expansionist tendencies and lack of
diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies
over the course of its existence. The most
notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion.
Osirion’s enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium’s fate,
as they employed clever and depraved magic that
proved more than a match for Jistka’s legendary
golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut
corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a
desperate attempt to fight back
against internal corruption and
external pressures, a cabal of
concerned Jistkans formed the
Artificer Conclave to develop new
technologies to stave off
the Imperium’s collapse
and return Jistka to
its former glory. The
most
successful
of
these developments were
automatons, which the Conclave
believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan
constructs—or at least, the last hope for Jistka’s
salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind,
life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these
constructs, creating magical and technological marvels
powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and
scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately,
despite the Conclave’s best efforts, the automatons’
arrival happened too late to save the already doomed
Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to
fend for themselves.
The exceptional and forward-thinking construction
of automatons means that a fair number remain today,
millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the
passage of time has revealed one of automatons’
greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only
the strongest willed have managed to retain
their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after
all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as
any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has
their own personality, shaped by countless experiences.
Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid
others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding.
Even automatons who are more willing to live in the
open understand that their unique nature makes them a
prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the
automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of
distrust or worry.
If you want to play a character who is a living
construct with powerful potential and ties to ancient
magic, you should play an automaton.
AUTOMATON
These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying
empire’s last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with
magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.

YOU MIGHT...
• Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.
• Be hesitant to trust others until they’ve earned it.
• Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.
• Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.
• Look upon you with awe.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Automatons share a common construction—a blend of magically treated
metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of
direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can
move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating
foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role.
Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have
shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a
single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful
artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life
and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical
engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.
As constructs, automatons typically don’t need to breathe, eat, or sleep;
however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical
exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air
to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton’s systems,
sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like
living creatures. Though they don’t sleep, automatons require a period of
magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within
their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully
powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a
humanoid who doesn’t get 8 hours of sleep).
Automatons don’t age and the design of their cores grants them a
seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are
thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation,
even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages.
Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton’s body
is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying
an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton’s soul might
remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body.
This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional
immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads
to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic
to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core’s destruction, or
if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul,
the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.
In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously
influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their
souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they
have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless
construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless
wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.
SOCIETY
Due to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives.
There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such

of Common.
TRAITS
Automaton
Construct
AUTOMATON CORE
Your body contains an automaton core
infused with planar quintessence that
grants you power to perform various
tasks and houses your soul and life
energy. This life energy flows through
you much like the blood of humanoids.
As a result, you are a living creature.
You don’t have the typical construct
immunities, can be affected by effects
that target a living creature, and
can recover Hit Points normally via
positive energy. Additionally, you are
not destroyed when reduced to 0
Hit Points. Instead, your life energy
attempts to keep you active even in
dire straits; you are knocked out and
begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit
Points (Core Rulebook 459).

================================================================================

as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or
travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however,
and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons
that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka.
These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or
visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the
resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.
Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending
on the automaton’s personality, this encounter could go a number of ways,
ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton’s unique
appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they’re found, but
most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical
constructs aren’t an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are
mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct,
it’s often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton.
However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday
life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they
go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt
to take their body for study or to access their core.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
The people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose
behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral.
Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful
neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a
fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their
outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to
cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh
and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma
are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons
likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do
so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee,
a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as
a kindred spirit.
NAMES
An automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation
into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade,
memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have
names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had
to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one
at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of
the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave’s
members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some
automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting
a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent
a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a
particularly cherished title in place of any other name.
Sample Names
Alnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred,
Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian
Automaton Heritages
Every automaton has a unique body based on the original roles intended to aid
the people of Jistka. Choose one of the following automaton heritages at 1st level.
CONSTRUCTED BODY
Your physiological needs are
different than those of living
creatures. You don’t need to eat
or drink. You don’t need to sleep,
but you still need a daily period of
rest. During this period of rest, you
must enter a recuperating standby
state for 2 hours, which is similar
to sleeping except you are aware of
your surroundings and don’t take
penalties for being unconscious.
Much like with sleeping, if you go too
long without entering your standby
state, you become fatigued and can’t
recover until you enter standby for
2 hours.
LOW-LIGHT VISION
You can see in dim light as though it
were bright light, so you ignore the
concealed condition due to dim light.

HUNTER AUTOMATON
You were designed to serve as a scout or assassin and
have a body resembling a pack hunter like a large cat
or wolf. Though you typically move like a quadruped,
you can still stand and fight like a biped,
allowing you to use all equipment
normally. Your quadruped design allows
you to move quickly; if you have both
hands free, you can increase your Speed to
30 feet as you run on all fours.
MAGE AUTOMATON
The chamber housing your core has a more
direct connection to the rest of your humanoid
shape, allowing you to tap into your core’s magical
energy. You gain one cantrip from the arcane spell
list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell
at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to
half your level rounded up.
SHARPSHOOTER AUTOMATON
Your lithe, humanoid shape is designed for speed and
accuracy suitable for ranged combat. You gain the
Automaton Aim action.
AUTOMATON AIM [one-action]
You steady your body and observe the events of the
battlefield to maximize the range of your next shot. You
reduce the penalty for firing into your weapon’s second
range increment from –2 to 0 for the next ranged attack
you make this turn. You can use this action a second
time in the same turn to reduce the penalty from firing
into your weapon’s third range increment from –4 to 0
for the next ranged attack you make this turn.
WARRIOR AUTOMATON
Sporting a bulkier, powerful design, your body has
been designed for combat. You have a bulky, humanoid
shape. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6
instead of 1d4. You don’t take a penalty when making a
lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attack.
Ancestry Feats
The following feats are available to automaton
characters.
1ST LEVEL
AUTOMATON ARMAMENT
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You’ve been provided a body part designed for combat.
You gain either a claw or pincer unarmed attack. The claw
deals 1d4 slashing damage, is in the brawling group, and
has the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits. The pincer deals
1d6 piercing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the
grapple and unarmed traits.
ENHANCEMENTS
Automatons are built to receive enhancements and
modifications to their bodies. Many automaton ancestry
feats have an “Enhancement” line that represents a
possible augmentation you can acquire. You don’t gain the
benefits of the enhancement unless you take a feat that
grants you those benefits, such as Lesser Augmentation.
You can only gain the enhancements of a given feat once.
SHARPSHOOTER Automaton

any level, and you can retrain into or out of this feat or change
the type of attack you gain.
Enhancement Your attacking part is reinforced. Increase
the damage die of the unarmed attack you gain from this feat
by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, or from 1d6 to 1d8).
ARCANE COMMUNICATION
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You can deliver silent messages. You gain touch telepathy,
allowing you to communicate silently and mentally with any
creature you’re touching, as long as you share a language.

Your telepathy gains a range of 10 feet, but you still have to
share a language with your target.
ARCANE EYE
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites low-light vision
Your eye has been magically enhanced to pierce darkness. You
gain darkvision.
Enhancement Your eye can see invisible creatures in brief
spurts. You can cast see invisibility as an arcane innate spell
once per hour.
AUTOMATON LORE
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You have come to better understand the process that
made your body and the magic that powers it. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Arcana and Crafting. If you would
automatically become trained in one of those skills (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in
Automaton Lore.
Enhancement Your gain greater understanding. Increase
your proficiency rank in either Arcana or Crafting, as well as
Automaton Lore, to expert. If you were already an expert in
the chosen skill, increase your rank to master instead.
ENERGY BEAM
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You can channel your core’s power through the magical gem
that serves as your eye. You gain an energy beam ranged
unarmed attack that deals 1d4 fire damage. The energy
beam has a range increment of 20 feet. On a critical hit, the
target takes persistent fire damage equal to the number
of weapon damage dice. Your eye beam does not add
critical specialization effects.
Enhancement You channel greater power. Increase
the damage die of your energy beam by one step, from
1d4 to 1d6.
REINFORCED CHASSIS
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis
is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4
item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a
speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can
never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you
still don’t become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch
armor runes onto your chassis as normal.
Enhancement Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome.
You gain the Chassis Deflection reaction.
CHASSIS DEFLECTION [reaction]
Trigger A critical hit deals physical damage to you.
Attempt a DC 17 flat check. If you are successful, the attack
becomes a normal hit.

The magic powering you makes it difficult for outside magic
to affect you. You gain the Resist Magic reaction.
Enhancement Your safeguards improve. When you Resist
Magic, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to
the spell level of the triggering effect.
RESIST MAGIC [reaction]
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a harmful
magical effect but haven’t rolled yet.
Your innate magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to the triggering saving throw. Additionally, if the
triggering effect is arcane, if you roll a success, you get a
critical success instead.
INTEGRATED ARMAMENT
FEAT 5
AUTOMATON
Your mechanical body houses a weapon or shield that you
can quickly draw and stow, leaving you prepared for combat
at all times.
You can use a 1-minute activity, which has the manipulate
trait, to integrate a single, one-handed weapon or shield into
one of your arms. You can draw or stow this item as an Interact
action. Creatures don’t automatically see this integrated item
when it’s stowed and must actively Seek in order to find it. They
take a –2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While
you are wielding the item, it can’t be Disarmed and you can’t
drop or Release it; you must Interact to store the weapon and
free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can
do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme
violence to your arm—such as physically removing portions
of the limb. You can only have one integrated armament at a
time, though you can use the 1-minute activity to replace the
item or swap the arm in which it’s stored.
Enhancement Your body has more space for integration.
You can now either integrate two one-handed weapons, a
one-handed weapon and a shield, or a single two-handed
weapon which is split across both arms. You can use a single
Interact action to draw or store both integrated armaments.
When you draw a single weapon, you can choose to hold it
with either one hand or both hands.
MAGICAL RESISTANCE
FEAT 5
AUTOMATON
Your animating magic provides some defense. Choose one of
the following energy damage types: cold, electricity, or sonic.
You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.
Enhancement You tap deeper into your animating magic,
and your resistances improve. Choose one of the following
benefits: you gain resistance 5 to the remaining two damage
types from the above list, or your chosen resistance increases
to a value equal to 1 + half your level.
9TH LEVEL
ARCANE CAMOUFLAGE
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites hunter automaton
You have developed magical techniques to aid you with
stalking your prey. You can cast blur and invisibility each
once per day as 2nd-level arcane innate spells.
Enhancement Your camouflage is more potent. Your blur
spell now lasts 10 minutes and when you cast invisibility,
you can choose to gain the effects of the 4th-level version of
the spell. In addition, you can now cast blur and invisibility
each twice per day.
ARCANE PROPULSION [two-actions]
FEAT 9
ARCANE
AUTOMATON
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
You redirect energy from your core to ports on your back or
feet, allowing you to fly for a short time. You can maintain
this redirected energy for 5 minutes. You gain a fly Speed
equal to your Speed while redirecting the energy.
Enhancement You can maintain your flight for longer.
You can redirect your energy at all times, allowing you to
fly whenever you want, rather than just once per day for
5 minutes.
ARCANE SLAM [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites warrior automaton
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You channel magical power from your core into your arm,
empowering your attack as you attempt to slam your foe
into the ground. Attempt an Athletics check against the
foe’s Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to
your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4
circumstance penalty if it’s larger than that. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size
smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it’s smaller
than that.
AUTOMATON ADVENTURERS
Many who became automatons had some role in society
prior to their transformation and often gravitate toward
classes that best represent these roles, even if they
no longer remember their former life as more than
subconscious flashes. Hunter, sharpshooter, and warrior
automatons usually become fighters, rangers, and
rogues. Spell casting classes, such as bards, witches, and
wizards are common among mage automatons. While
an automaton can have any background, the pool of
individuals chosen to become automatons were typically
of the acolyte, bounty hunter, emissary, gladiator, guard,
herbalist, hunter, martial disciple, scholar, scout, or
warrior background.

Critical Success You slam the foe down and the magical
energy overwhelms it. The creature is knocked prone,
becomes dazzled for 1 round, and takes damage equal
to 2d6 plus your Strength modifier. The foe is no longer
grabbed or restrained by you.
Success You slam the foe down. The creature is knocked
prone and takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.
The foe is no longer grabbed or restrained by you.
Failure You are unable to slam the creature, but your hold
on the creature remains.
Critical Failure The creature breaks free and is no longer
grabbed or restrained by you.
Enhancement Your arms better channel your core’s power.
You no longer take penalties for attempting to slam larger
foes. Your foe takes damage equal to 2d6 plus your Strength
modifier on a success (or double that on a critical success).
CORE ATTUNEMENT
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites mage automaton
Your core allows you to draw more power from it. Select one
1st-level arcane spell and one 2nd-level or lower arcane spell,
to which you have access. You can cast your chosen spells as
arcane innate spells each once per day.
Enhancement Your attunement grows stronger. Select one
5th-level or lower arcane spell and one 6th-level or lower
arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast them
as arcane innate spells each once per day, in addition to the
original spells.
LESSER AUGMENTATION
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
You’ve focused on enhancing yourself and have received
an improvement to one of your existing abilities. You gain
the enhancement benefits of one of your 1st- or 5th-level
automaton ancestry feats.
You are also capable of reconfiguring your augmentations
to meet your needs. You can spend one week of downtime to
change the enhancement you gain with this feat.
Enhancement You gain the enhancement benefits of
another 1st- or 5th-level automaton ancestry feat. Also, your
reconfigurations take less time. You only need to spend 1 day
of downtime to change any of your enhancements. If you
have multiple enhancements, changing each one requires a
separate day.
RAIN OF BOLTS [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites sharpshooter automaton
Frequency once per day
Throughout the day, your body produces powerful projectiles
within your chassis. You fire them all at once in either a
30-foot cone or a 10-foot emanation. Foes in the area take
6d6 piercing damage. This increases to 7d6 at 12th level, 8d6
at 15th level, and 9d6 at 18th level.
Enhancement The projectiles regenerate quicker, they are
much more powerful, and you can refine the metallic content
to harm certain creatures. You can use Rain of Bolts once
per hour instead of once per day. The damage increases
to 12d6 and each time you use the action, you can choose
adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The damage from Rain of
Bolts is treated as the metal you chose. At 20th level, the
damage increases to 13d6.
13TH LEVEL
ARCANE LOCOMOTION
FEAT 13
AUTOMATON
You’ve modified your body to allow you to augment your
movement. You gain either a climb Speed of 20 feet or a
swim Speed of 20 feet, your choice.
Enhancement Your body allows for even further forms of
movement. You can either select the option from this feat
you haven’t chosen yet (climb Speed or swim Speed), or you
can increase your land Speed by 5 feet and increase the
Speed you chose from this feat increase to be equal to your
adjusted land Speed.

AUTOMATON ORIGINS
The method of creating automatons as the Artificer
Conclave did millennia ago has been lost to time. As
such, most automatons who remain on Golarion were
created during Jistka’s existence. However, there are a
few rare automatons that have different origins. Anquira,
herself an automaton and a high-ranking member of
the Artificer Conclave, resides in Axis and seems to be
nearing the point of recreating the Jistkan process. She’s
created a few promising prototype automatons with her
techniques. There are also rumors of another automaton
doing similar research somewhere in the deserts of the
Golden Road, though the new automatons emerging from
the desert appear somewhat incomplete.
Of significant note are the increased reports of
automatons in southern Garund, originating from the nation
of Eihlona. The nation is famous for its inhabitants’ skill in
mixing magic with technology, particularly the remnants of
Shory technology that crashed within the nation’s borders
in ages past. Eihlonan mage crafters have managed to
recreate automatons using their vast knowledge, magical
prowess, and access to ancient technology, alongside
insights from a few friendly automaton immigrants who
found a respectful and welcoming home there. Though the
process is long and arduous, Eihlona seems to be on the
verge of recreating the success of the Artificer Conclave.
If they do, they could someday produce hundreds, if not
thousands of automatons.

the Astral Plane, allowing you to teleport periodically. You
can cast dimension door once per hour as a 4th-level innate
arcane spell.
Enhancement Your attunement allows you to teleport
in a series of quick jumps rather than in one big leap. You
can expend your hourly use of dimension door as a free
action when you begin your turn. If you do, your Strides
are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you
to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with
your Speed instead of traversing normally to the location.
While augmented, your Strides gain the conjuration and
teleportation traits. Your augmented Strides don’t trigger
reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon
leaving or entering a square, unless those reactions trigger
on teleportation.
CORE REJUVENATION [free-action]
FEAT 13
AUTOMATON
Frequency once per day
Trigger You have the dying condition and are about to
attempt a recovery check.
Your soul taps into your core’s power to push against the
grasp of death and allow you to recover consciousness.
You’re restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and unconscious
conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or
increase the wounded condition as normal when losing the
dying condition in this way.
Enhancement Your soul can draw even more power from
your core, granting you additional benefits. When you use
Core Rejuvenation, you also gain a number of temporary
Hit Points equal to three times your level. These Hit Points
remain for 1 minute.
ENLARGED CHASSIS
FEAT 13
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites Medium or Small size
You’ve empowered your core to support a larger body,
granting you size and additional reach. You gain the effects
of enlarge constantly.
Enhancement Your core’s empowerment has stabilized,
allowing for greater support. You are no longer clumsy due
to the effects of enlarge.
17TH LEVEL
AXIAL RECALL
FEAT 17
UNCOMMON
AUTOMATON
You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to
attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast plane shift
twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target
yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane,
and your body serves as the focus component.
CORE CANNON [two-actions]
FEAT 17
ARCANE
AUTOMATON
CONCENTRATE
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
Your body transforms into a powerful magical cannon.
While immobile as a cannon, you can fire blasts of energy
directly from your core, devastating your foes. You become
immobilized until you use an Interact action to revert back
to your standard form. While in your cannon form, the
only actions you can use are to Strike with an energy blast
unarmed attack or to Interact to revert back to your standard
form. You can remain in your cannon form for up to 1 minute
or until you take the action to revert back to your standard
form, whichever comes first.
Energy blasts are a special ranged unarmed attack. You
can only make energy blast Strikes while you’re in your
cannon form. Your energy blasts deal 3d8 fire damage and
3d6 force damage, which increases to 4d8 fire damage and
3d6 force damage at level 20. You gain the item bonus to
attack rolls with your energy blasts from the highest potency
rune on any handwraps of mighty blows you are wearing
or any weapon you are wielding, but striking and property
runes have no effect on your energy blasts. Energy blasts
have a range increment of 120 feet. On a critical hit with
an energy blast, the target takes 10 persistent fire damage.
Your energy blast doesn’t add critical specialization effects.
If it matters for an effect dependent on weapon damage dice,
an energy blast’s number of weapon damage dice is three, or
four at level 20.
GREATER AUGMENTATION
FEAT 17
AUTOMATON
You’ve greatly improved your abilities and your core can
support further augmentations. You gain the enhancement
benefits of one of your 1st-, 5th-, 9th-, or 13th-level automaton
ancestry feats.
You are also capable of reconfiguring your augmentations
to meet your needs. You can spend one week of downtime to
change the enhancement you gain with this feat.
VERSATILE HERITAGES
Since automatons have artificial bodies, they don’t
manifest the features of versatile heritages, even if
the soul within their core did so in life. As a result,
most automatons don’t have a versatile heritage.
However, players who are interested in taking a
versatile heritage are encouraged to speak with their
GM to best determine an explanation for the versatile
heritage. Since an automaton core draws on planar
energy, there is a chance that said energy manifests in
a versatile heritage, such as a tiefling automaton with
an overabundance of Hell’s planar energy. Alternatively,
a powerful soul might still be able to manifest the
features of their heritage they had prior to transfer
to an automaton body. An automaton with a versatile
heritage will have minimal physical changes if any,
though the color of energy that courses through their
core and the rest of their body might change to properly
represent the versatile heritage.

are listed as common for an area with themes of gears
and technology, and their mechanics and story impact
are not likely to require a discussion with your GM
or the other players, many of them still might not be
thematically appropriate for regions and campaigns that
lack these themes.
ANTI-TECH ACTIVIST
BACKGROUND
You’ve seen the sorts of things that technology brings—
polluted environments, workers put out of their jobs or
horribly injured, and the slow erosion of society—and you’ve
vowed to inform the larger world of these ills. You do so with
long, impassioned speeches on street corners and village
squares and by talking personally with the heads of various
guilds. Adventuring into the wider world could help spread
your message even farther.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Guild Lore
skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat.
CLOCKFIGHTER
While others choose to use their engineering ability to heal
the injured or make brilliant innovations, you’ve used your
skill to repair and modify clockwork constructs that battle in
gladiatorial combat. You know how to get a crowd electrified
for your clockwork gladiator, win or lose, and you know how
to repair it when it gets damaged. These skills serve you well
as an adventurer.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Gladiatorial
Lore skill. You gain the Experienced Professional skill feat.
CLOCKWORK RESEARCHER
BACKGROUND
New forms of clockwork technology are incredibly
interesting to you, and you’ve been studying examples
of them to see where else they might be best put to use.
You might eventually develop a new prototype machine or
find a way to make related technologies practical enough
for everyone to benefit. Though before you do, you must
continue your research!
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Engineering Lore
skill. You gain the Eye for Numbers (Advanced Player’s Guide
206) skill feat.
CODEBREAKER
BACKGROUND
Whether you’re employed by a military organization to
decipher coded messages sent by enemy
factions or work independently to crack an
enigma created by a past civilization, you
have a head for patterns and linguistics.
You might even use new clockwork
devices to aid you in your efforts.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be
to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Cryptography
Lore skill. You gain the Glean Contents (Advanced Player’s
Guide 206) skill feat.

DISCIPLE OF THE GEAR
BACKGROUND
While many regard science and faith as incompatible, you
believe scientific advancement is your deity’s will. Perhaps
you’re a follower of Brigh, Casandalee, or some other god of
technology, or perhaps you see the furnaces and sparks of
modernity as the latest manifestation of Sarenrae’s flame or
Gozreh’s lightning—whatever the case, you’re always willing
to spread the word of your deity, and you’ve learned some
basic tinkering to show how your deity’s focus can increase
the common standard of living.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Lore skill for
the deity you worship. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.
DRIVER
BACKGROUND
You practically live behind the controls of a vehicle, and
can handle just about anything the road, waves, and sky
can throw at you. You likely adventure to test your skills
in unusual environments and new and interesting vehicles.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill and the Piloting Lore
skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Piloting Lore.
HOUNDED THIEF
BACKGROUND
Some time ago, you stole a unique item from a strange
individual. It might have been a piece of clockwork from
a far-off land or some other bit of strange technology. You
might still have it or you might have sold it, but either way,
you can’t shake the feeling that you’re being followed and
watched, likely by forces who want to retrieve what you
took. Luckily, a life of adventure keeps you on the move.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Thievery skill and the Underworld
Lore skill. You gain the Pickpocket skill feat.
JUNKER
BACKGROUND
You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the
detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in
your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to
search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where
people make greater use of technology.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Lore skill of the
terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the Hefty Hauler skill feat.
MECHANIC
BACKGROUND
The intricate inner workings of machines are no stranger
to you. Whether they are mundane devices or complex
clockworks, you know what makes them tick and how to
maintain them. An adventuring group might keep you around
to repair their equipment, or you might travel around to offer
your rare services to those in need—for a price, of course!
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.
MEDICINAL CLOCKSMITH
BACKGROUND
While others might have looked to clockwork as a
mechanical innovation, you see the potential in the
technology to improve the health of patients. You might
be an experienced field medic who reached for a scrapped
construct to help a wounded soldier, or a vanguard surgeon
who’s found replacing organs with clockwork more
effective than repairing them. Perhaps you’ve also worked
to “optimize” organic bodies with fine machinery, with or
without the permission of your patients.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Risky Surgery skill feat.
PRINTER
BACKGROUND
Keeping your finger on the pulse of the city, you write a small
news broadsheet to sell on street corners. You rent the use of
a printing press to achieve this goal, so you’re familiar with
such machines. However, people and their stories are your
main focus, and you adventure to chase the latest scoop.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Scribing Lore
skill. You gain the Multilingual skill feat.
SABOTEUR
BACKGROUND
Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest
of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a
knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or
structure’s weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer
strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills
or complete a particular mission.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Thievery skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Concealing Legerdemain (Advanced
Player’s Guide 204) skill feat.
TOYMAKER
BACKGROUND
You delight in making little trinkets for children of all ages,
and seeing their faces light up thanks to one of your creations
brings joy to your heart. Perhaps you sell your wares from
a particular shop or from the back of a wagon as you travel
from town to town.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Mercantile
Lore skill. You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat, choosing
artistry, blacksmithing, glassmaking, leatherworking, tailoring,
or woodworking as your specialty.

While most backgrounds are available to any character,
some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them
makes a character rare and extraordinary.
These rare backgrounds can give a player a
significantly different roleplaying experience by setting
their character up with a history or legacy beyond
the norm. For example, when a character with the
discarded duplicate background is the duplicate of a
world-shaking or plot-essential NPC, the character is
situated in a special position within the narrative. Your
character’s background is an intrinsic part of where
they come from and not something they earn during
the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only
after a discussion between the GM and other players as
to whether one would apply for a particular character
in your group’s game.
DISCARDED DUPLICATE
RARE
Someone created you for a specific purpose. Some important
person, be they a storied royal, a contentious politician, or
a stark military leader, needed a body double for their most
dangerous appearances. Using a mixture of fringe science and
magic, you were commissioned and trained to emulate this
person in every way, and have stood in for them in countless
deadly circumstances. You may or may not know the reason
behind your decommissioning, but whoever discarded you
didn’t finish you off. Now, the world is yours to explore—but
“you” may have a bold or brutish reputation, or the individual
you were duplicating may be long dead. Regardless of the fate
of this individual, your way of life has changed drastically.
You and the GM can work out how to incorporate your
previous life into your story. The GM can keep this knowledge
hidden even from you, or you or another character know what
happened. You and the GM can also leave the information
unspecified and fill it in later.
You gain three free ability boosts. You choose two, and the
GM chooses one based on the attributes of the character you
were built to duplicate.

your body. It may have sunk its needles into you or locked
its spidery legs around your neck, torso, or upper arm.
Some entity or spirit lives in this collection of gears and
wires—whether or not other people hear its whispers is up
to you. The entity may be an ancient, terrible being that
has razed villages with its hosts, or it may be a brilliant,
starry-eyed child who barely understands you’re not part
of its own body.
You have studied and searched for information on these
rare, crab-like machines, leaving you an expert in the binding
of elemental spirits or mortal souls to mechanical objects.
Though you have several theories on what the symbiotic
entity might be, you have no definitive answers—this may
be why you’re adventuring in the first place, or perhaps
you’ve made a deal with someone to get it removed.
The entity might talk to you periodically, or it might
only speak when it wants you to do something in
particular or finds the two of you in danger. You and
the GM should decide on the entity’s motivations,
or if the motivations should be a secret known only
to the GM.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be
to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a
free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Arcana skill
and an additional skill in which
the clockwork entity is well-versed,
determined by the GM. Any time you
attempt a skill check for the entity’s
skill, the GM can offer you a +1
circumstance bonus to the check, as
though the entity were Aiding you.
If you accept but fail the check,
the entity clenches up and you are
stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical
failure).
SAVED BY CLOCKWORK
RARE
Through bloody combat, a terrible
accident, or purposeful sacrifice,
you’ve lost some piece of your
body that has been replaced
with a clockwork mechanism.
Whether your arm is now a
whirring series of pumps, steel
coils, and iron gears; your heart
a intricate crystal clock that requires winding every
day; or your lower leg a sculpted metal tube powered
by adamantine springs and steam, part of you needs
regular maintenance and repair. You might have
received instructions from the brilliant inventor
who saved you, or you might have woken up on a
battlefield with no memory of the procedure or
the individuals involved. Regardless, you possess
the knowledge to take care of yourself—even if it’s
how to wind a key in your own heart or reconstruct a
mechanical foot.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill. Every day you must
perform 10 minutes of maintenance and wind up your
clockwork parts, or you risk failure of the components, with
consequences depending on what you replaced (determined
by you and the GM). Your clockwork components allow you
to react to danger with alacrity. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to initiative rolls.
TECH-RELIANT
RARE
Some event, be it an accident, attack, or disaster,
has left you horribly scarred by magic. Your body
no longer tolerates magical healing, and you can’t
use magic, forcing you to rely on gadgets and
ingenuity where others trust in spells and magical
items. You might have been well-versed in
magic before, or barely familiar with its
use. This event may have injured your
body in visible ways, but no matter
the extent of your injuries, your
body no longer interacts with
healing magic in any capacity.
Choose two ability boosts.
One must be to Constitution
or Intelligence, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill
and the Medicine skill. You gain the
Battle Medicine skill feat, and a +1
circumstance bonus to saving throws
against
spells.
Healing
spells,
healing magic items, and magical
effects with the healing trait have
no effect on you.
WISHED ALIVE
RARE
Once you were a simple
construct or inanimate doll, but
due to a deeply felt wish, either
yours or another’s, you came
to life, and so you’re now a living,
breathing creature.
Choose two ability boosts. One
must be to Constitution or Charisma,
and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill. Once
per day, you can fervently wish for something
you could work towards achieving as a single action
which has the concentrate trait. If you do, you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus on the first skill check you
attempt before the end of your turn to fulfill that wish.

While an infinite number of character concepts exist,
you might find that the feats and skill choices from
a single class aren’t sufficient to fully realize your
character. If you’re hoping to add a splash of technology
and invention to your character’s abilities while playing
a class other than inventor, these archetypes will allow
you to expand the scope of your character’s class.
Applying an archetype requires you to select
archetype feats instead of choosing class feats from your
class. Start by finding the archetype that best fits your
character concept, and select the archetype’s dedication
feat using one of your class feat choices. Once you have
the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that
archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet
its prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still
subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it
replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th
level that granted you a 4th-level class feat with the
dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only for
an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf
trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a class feat are
called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once
you select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must
satisfy the requirements listed in its “Special” entry
before you can gain another dedication feat. Typically,
you satisfy an archetype dedication feat by gaining a
certain number of feats from the archetype’s list. You
cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any
other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another
feat, such as the alchemist’s Basic Concoction feat. You
must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those with
full write-ups in their archetype entry. These are typically
class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain
combat styles. The list of additional feats includes
the feat’s name, its level, and the page number where
it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat
of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of
feats required by the archetype’s dedication feat. When
selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait
doesn’t have that class trait.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your character’s training into another class’s specialties.
You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat
if you are already a member of the class of the same
name (for instance, a fighter can’t select the Fighter
Dedication feat).
Gears Archetype List
The following archetypes each allow you to build a
character with strong ties to gears and gadgets in a
variety of different ways.
• The inventor multiclass archetype (page 49) adds
some inventor abilities to a character of any class.
This allows all sorts of characters to flex their
ingenuity in order to solve problems through
brilliant invention.
• The overwatch archetype (page 50) uses enhanced
visual gear to watch the battlefield, taking
advantage of enemies’ openings and assisting allies
in a bind.
• The sterling dynamo archetype (page 52) gains
powerful uses out of their clockwork prosthetic.
While the prosthetic is usually an arm, the archetype
covers characters replacing or augmenting any limb
with a clockwork prosthetic.
• The trapsmith archetype (page 54) expands the
snarecrafter archetype with special options for
creating snares with cogwheels and gears, granting
a variety of special benefits impossible with an
ordinary snare.
• The trick driver archetype (page 55) drives a vehicle
into battle, crushing opponents who stand in their
way. A great choice for a character who wishes to
pilot a vehicle and join in the fight, whether it’s a
personal vehicle or one shared by the group.
• The vehicle mechanic archetype (page 56) gets the
most out of a specific vehicle, granting that vehicle
special benefits. This makes a vehicle mechanic a
natural combination with a trick driver to pilot
the vehicle.
GEARS ARCHETYPES
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in several archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Reckless: Actions with the reckless trait run the risk
of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing
a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an
appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.

MULTICLASS INVENTOR CHARACTERS
Inventor is a great fit for intelligent characters
looking to branch out and learn new tricks, especially
alchemists, who are already good at Crafting and may
appreciate unstable options as an alternative to daily
alchemical resources. If they meet the Intelligence
requirements, clerics of deities who encourage invention
and experimentation like Brigh are an amazing fit,

Overwatch
With a stalwart mind and sharp eyes, you observe the
battlefield as though you and your allies are pieces on
a chessboard. By predicting dangers and hazards and
offering your insights to your comrades, you win battles
through keen observation and teamwork. Whenever
there’s a threat or opening, you’re the first to point it
out, and you’re ready to help your allies directly when
necessary.
As a group’s overwatch, you might let the position go
to your head. In such cases, you might think of yourself as
the mastermind behind the chessboard and feel detached
from your allies, thinking of them as little more than
pawns on the field.
But more likely your role allows you to feel a deeper
connection to your allies, and your coordination and
heroics stand out most when you subsume your individual
ego to serve the group’s needs. In that case, you might
think of yourself as a part of a functional whole—if your
party was a single living body, you serve as the eyes, but
that doesn’t mean you’re the brain, the heart, or other
vital organs. Everyone has a crucial role to play.
OVERWATCH DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites expert in Perception
You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you’ve
innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that
allow you to assist your allies. With the help of enhanced
visual gear (such as a specially modified telescope, goggled
visor, or binoculars), you’re keenly aware of the movement
of combatants on the battlefield. You quickly and efficiently
disperse that information to your nearby allies so they can use
it to direct their own observations and reactions to danger.
You’re surrounded by an overwatch field aura in a 30-foot
emanation. Your overwatch field aura grants you increased
perception and allows you to call out warnings to your allies
within the aura to point out threats. This aura has the auditory
and visual traits. You and allies within your overwatch field
receive a +2 circumstance bonus when using Perception for
Initiative checks.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
after you have gained at least two other feats from the
overwatch archetype.
SPYGLASS MODIFICATION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication
Your enhanced visual gear includes a regulating scope and
reflectors, combined in an ingenuous setup that allows you
to see around corners within the area of your overwatch
field. This permits your overwatch field to extend around
a single corner or turn and allows you to see around that
corner as well. This ability doesn’t let you see through
walls or other barriers. You can’t use it to see around
a second or further corner, and it doesn’t allow you
to make ranged attacks or perform other actions that
require line of effect with your target.
SWIFT INTERVENTION [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication
Trigger An ally within your overwatch field fails in their
attempt to Arrest a Fall, Balance, Grab a Ledge, or
Maneuver in Flight.
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.
You’re burdened with noticing potential threats at all times.
Because of this, you’ve learned that a well-placed shot can
prevent disaster. You make a shot to either pin an ally’s
clothing to stop a fall or secure them against a ledge, or you
bounce an attack off their armor to correct their course as
they stumble while attempting to balance or fly.
Make a single ranged attack roll against the DC of the
triggering check; your ally uses the result of your ranged
attack roll in place of their original roll. You must have line of
effect to your ally, and your attack roll includes any normal
bonuses or penalties for a ranged attack with that weapon
(such as the penalty for making a ranged attack beyond your
first range increment).

When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic
maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your

first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your
eventual success.
When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to

Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Through a variety of perceptive techniques, careful routines,

FOREWARN [reaction]
FEAT 12

Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Frequency once per minute
Trigger An enemy within your overwatch field attempts an
attack against an ally who is also within your overwatch
field.
Your foresight and planning are more valuable than armor
as you direct your ally away from danger, but there’s a
limit to how often you can guide your allies away from a
foe’s relentless assaults. The triggering attack roll targets
your Perception DC instead of your ally’s AC. Though this
allows your ally to avoid taking penalties to their AC, it
doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such
penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would
still deal extra damage to your ally if they are flat-footed,
even though they wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty
when defending against the attack.
MASTER SPOTTER

Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, expert in Perception
Your incredible perception and trusty enhanced visual gear

ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Your keen senses and ability to process battlefield
information have dramatically improved, allowing you to
drastically reduce the advantage of unseen foes. You and
allies in your overwatch field gain a +2 circumstance bonus
when using the Seek action to find hidden or undetected
creatures within the overwatch field. You and your allies
don’t have to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed
creature within your overwatch field. When you or an ally
targets a hidden creature in your overwatch field, reduce the
DC of the flat check to 5.
CONVERGE [reaction]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Trigger You make a successful ranged attack against an
opponent who is within your overwatch field, and who
is within reach of one or more of your allies who is also
within your overwatch field.
Informing your ally of an opening created by your shot, you
coordinate to set them up to hit the target at the same time.
Your ally can make a melee Strike against the triggering foe as
a reaction. This Strike doesn’t count toward that ally’s multiple
attack penalty, and their multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply
to this Strike. If your ally’s Strike is successful, combine the
damage from your successful ranged attack with the damage
from your ally’s melee attack for the purpose of determining
resistances and weaknesses.
OVERWATCH TRAINING
Not just anyone can train to become their party’s
overwatch. A keen and incisive perception is necessary,
of course, but that alone won’t be sufficient. While
many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses
or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able
to apply information received from all five senses
(and any additional special senses they might have)
to make split-second decisions that work toward
achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially
be trained through hours of daily drills designed to
help a potential overwatch separate true threats and
situations requiring their skills from false positives,
and even situations where they would cause a problem
if they didn’t hold back. However, while training helps
ingrain good practice into one’s reflexes and muscle
memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks
an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such
training slow to produce results, or in the worst case,
even impossible.
Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch
requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear
to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others
miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your
team and nearby foes. While it isn’t explicitly necessary
for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to
maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many
successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better
understand how every piece works together to create
the whole.

Sterling Dynamo
While many people across Golarion use prosthetic devices,
you’ve acquired and outfitted yourself with a particularly
advanced combat model of clockwork prosthesis: a piece
of cutting edge technology called a sterling dynamo.
You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to
customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any
promising new technologies you encounter into its design.
There’s a significant distinction, however, between
someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis
and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With
their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun
Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt
sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice,
among the wide variety of amazing options
already available in both markets. However,
not everyone who chooses to use sterling
dynamo technology is a member of the
sterling dynamo archetype.
With
the
sterling
dynamo
archetype, you both use a sterling
dynamo
prosthesis
and
truly
understand
its
advantages,
limitations,
and
limitless
potential. You don’t have
to literally be your own
mechanic, as there’s
no
requirement
for
a sterling dynamo to
be
particularly
skilled
at crafting, but even if you
aren’t, you can still “feel” what’s
right when it comes to adjusting and
optimizing your dynamo. Whether you
implement these improvements yourself
or present your mechanic with ideas
and insights that allow them to achieve
something special on your behalf, your
strength and ingenuity are what make
you a sterling dynamo.
As you train to use your dynamo in
all sorts of adventures, you may become
capable of feats its original inventors
never dreamed possible. In fact, as you
progress in the archetype and explore
the possibilities, you might find that
these inventors want to interview you in
order to apply your insights and help them
create a new generation of the technology
with even greater capabilities. The sterling
dynamo’s adaptability grants it vast
potential, so the sky’s the limit!
STERLING DYNAMO DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which
allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a
simple new non‑prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your
sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile
limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never
increases your character’s number of hands or prehensile
limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities
or effects.
Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for
combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that
is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which
makes it more effective against certain types of creatures,
such as devils and werewolves).
 You have several options to customize your sterling
dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver
dynamo, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has
the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which
deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and has the agile and
finesse traits.
Most dynamos are automated, so they don’t require
a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks.
However, you can instead choose to make your
dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld
switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack
with a manually controlled dynamo, you must
have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is
great control and a more devastating strike. This
increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for
a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive
striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always
manual, but they use the hand on that arm
to operate the dynamo when making strikes.
Manual control is required only in the heat of
combat, not for less strenuous adventuring
or everyday activities.
You need to keep your sterling dynamo
wound, but the process isn’t particularly
onerous, so in most situations, it won’t be
an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding
up your dynamo, it can remain active for
24 hours before needing additional winding.
However, enemies can attempt to Disable the
dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to
reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour,
or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other
abilities that adversely affect technology might
also reduce the dynamo’s remaining operational
time. When your dynamo is out of operational time,
you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you
cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any
other abilities from this archetype until you wind the
dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute
at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of
operational time.
Special You cannot select another dedication
feat until you have gained two other feats from
the sterling dynamo archetype.

MODULAR DYNAMO
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to
swap between various different possibilities with ease in
order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo
attack gains the modular trait (page 150), as well as one of
the following configurations of your choice: power driver
(1d6 bludgeoning damage; shove), percussive striker (1d4
bludgeoning damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle (1d6
slashing damage; trip), or entangling barbs (1d6 piercing
damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo,
these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can
also choose the extendable baton (1d4 bludgeoning damage;
finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already
factored in.
When you use an Interact action to switch configurations
using the modular trait, you switch between the initial
configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling
Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose
with Modular Dynamo.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
you choose another configuration and add it to the list of
options you can choose when you use an Interact action with
the modular trait.
PISTON PUNCH [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
You lash out with a powerful punch, extending your dynamo
to a greater length in order to attack two creatures in a row.
Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and
compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The
first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe
must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from
you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you
hit. A Piston Punch counts as two attacks for your multiple
attack penalty. Reduce the operational time of your sterling
dynamo by 1 hour.
STASIAN SMASH [two-actions]
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Access You are from Ustalav.
You’ve modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing
you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity.
Make a dynamo Strike. On a success, the Strike deals an
additional 1d12 electricity damage to the target, as well as
1d4 electricity damage to up to two other foes within 10
feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your
dynamo Strike, you take 1d12 electricity damage. This counts
as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target
increases to 2d12, and the additional electricity damage to
the other foes increases to 2d4. Reduce the operational time
of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.
BEAST DYNAMO HOWL [two-actions]
FEAT 10
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Access You are from Arcadia.
You’ve incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your
dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying
creatures to enhance your prosthesis’s capabilities. The beast
parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful
attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check
to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don’t take a
penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that
doesn’t understand your language. Then, make a dynamo
Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo
by 1 hour.
GOLEM DYNAMO
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Access You are an automaton or are otherwise from the
ancient Jistka Imperium.
You’ve learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses,
allowing you to incorporate golem components into your
dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. You gain a +1 status
bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo
Strikes become magical.
SOARING DYNAMO
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
You’ve built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo,
allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly
Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces
the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour,
measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a
given minute.
PROSTHETICS IN GOLARION
Prosthetics in Golarion don’t require membership
in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A
character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye,
hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as
5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that
are decorated with unique customizations or designs
available for a corresponding mark-up. For more
information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder
Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo
prosthetic technology presented here was created
through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis
inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint
system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral
in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that
increased how customizable the model was and sent
it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That
iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the
market in late 4721 ar. It has been widely applauded for
its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.

Trapsmith
Wielding a wrench or blowtorch, you manufacture snares
that whir and tick with delicate precision. Your best work
requires the right materials—a glorious set of brass fittings
and cogwheels—with which you create snares that are as
elegantly lethal as they are subtle. As a trapsmith, you’re
always improving your snares: adjusting timing, tweaking
triggers, and finding new ways to hide them from foes.
You can select the dedication feat for the trapsmith
archetype even if you haven’t yet gained three feats from
the snarecrafter archetype.
TRAPSMITH DEDICATION
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication or Snare Specialist
ranger class feat
You use glimmering gears and gnashing mechanisms to
manufacture snares using specialized parts. Your snares
include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears,
and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If
you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature
fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are
concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam
obscures its vision.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or
trapsmith archetypes.
GEAR GNASH
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication, expert in Crafting
Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are
quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to Disable
your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional
Thievery check in order to disable the snare. On a failed
check, while the snare doesn’t fully trigger, the grinding
mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal
to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure,
as normal.
PROPELLER ATTACHMENT
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication, master in Crafting
You’ve mastered attaching clockwork propellers to your daily
quick-deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to place
your snares in the air or underwater, where they remain in place
for up to 10 minutes, after which the propeller runs out of power
and they fall or sink. Unless you use additional precautions to
hide it, a propeller snare’s location is usually obvious.
RECYCLED COGWHEELS
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You’re able to scavenge the cogwheels from your daily
quick‑deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to
deconstruct a snare that didn’t trigger in order to set the snare
up somewhere else. Doing so takes the same number of actions
as setting the snare did. When you do, you recover the snare
and can deploy it in another location.
REPURPOSED PARTS
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your
snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy
snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of
the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily
preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that
you know how to Craft, even if you didn’t prepare that snare
during your daily preparations.
FINESSED FEATURES
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You’ve learned how to build snares that trigger based on
visual stimuli. When you construct a snare using gears,
you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of
a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only
be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only
activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger
it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on
creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures
smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise
satisfy the snare’s trigger as normal.

You can optimize your vehicle’s performance, coaxing extra
speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.
When calculating your travel speed for the day
while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a
Driving Lore check to increase your vehicle’s
travel speed. The DC is determined by
the GM but is typically based on the
vehicle’s piloting DC or a difficulty

Requirements You are piloting a vehicle.
In your hands, any vehicle is a weapon.
When you use Run Over, you can use
your class DC in place of the vehicle’s
collision DC. Your vehicle can Run
Over any number of creatures up to
one Size smaller than the vehicle or
ram any one target creature or object
in your path up to the size of your
vehicle.
DRIVE-BY ATTACK [one-action] TO [three-actions] FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
FLOURISH
Prerequisites Trick Driver Dedication
Requirements You are piloting a
vehicle.
You can smoothly line up an attack
without disrupting your control. You Drive,
gaining the effects of the Drive action for the
same number of actions you spent to DriveBy Attack. At any point during your vehicle’s
movement, you Strike.
USING VEHICLES
While many of the options in this book are uncommon
to allow you to insert the thematic elements into your
game as you see fit, there are some options you should
consider very carefully before including. This archetype
is one of them. Vehicles are relatively complicated and
can move very fast, which can make mapping encounters
quite difficult. They can also move characters too far
from the fight for other participants to respond. Think
carefully before deciding whether to include the trick
driver archetype, and make sure that vehicle use is right
for your campaign’s style and encounter area size.

Vehicle Mechanic
You have always felt that vehicles are as much works
of art as they are means of transportation. It doesn’t
matter if it’s as common as a chariot or as complex as
an airship, there’s always some aspect of the vehicle you
can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value
your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their
vehicles. While you can make a great profit working
on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep
a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal
passion project.
You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union,
working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair
jobs and support each other’s labor. While some vehicle
mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits
of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so
they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused
gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such
as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the
goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular,
vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow
union members seriously. While this might mean your
character becomes obligated to help a fellow union
member who needs your help, it also means you have
steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of
need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its
weight in gold.
VEHICLE MECHANIC DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Intelligence 14, trained in Crafting
You are adept at designing and maintaining mechanical
vehicles, and you lavish your attention and ingenuity on
one vehicle in particular. You become an expert in Crafting,
and you choose one vehicle you own—or your party owns
collectively—to be your signature vehicle: the vehicle you
spend time customizing to grant it various advantages.
You can spend 1 week of downtime with a new vehicle to
designate it as your signature vehicle instead. Due to your
amazing customizations and adjustments, pilots gain a +1
circumstance bonus to any piloting checks they make to
control your signature vehicle. If you are a master in Crafting,
this bonus increases to +2.
Special You cannot select another dedication feat
until you have gained two other feats from the mechanic
archetype.
ENGINE BAY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication, expert in Crafting
You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and
can work on many machines at a time. When Repairing and
spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If
you are a master in Crafting, you can fix up to four targets. If
you’re legendary in Crafting, you can fix up to eight targets.
This feat has no effect when using Quick Repair or another
ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
PATCH JOB
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You
gain the Improvised Repair general feat. When you use
Improvised Repair, you can attempt a Crafting check with the
same DC as Repair. If you succeed, you can use the object as a
normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as
a shoddy object of its type.

SUPERIOR PROPULSION
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
By experimenting with the effects of momentum gained from
your signature vehicle’s movement, you have learned to get
more from propulsion than just speed when the pilot pushes
the vehicle to its limit. Each time the pilot Drives your signature
vehicle as a 2- or 3-action activity and succeeds at the Piloting
check, the vehicle produces an additional effect, depending on
its method of propulsion. If your signature vehicle has more
than one propulsion method, the pilot can select which benefit
to gain each time they succeed at the Piloting check to Drive
the vehicle as a 2- or 3-action activity.
Alchemical The caustic runoff from the alchemical engines
is now weaponized. Creatures adjacent to your signature
vehicle when it begins its movement take acid damage equal
to your level.
Clockwork More resilient gears allow the vehicle to remain
functional, even when damaged. If your signature vehicle is
broken, it does not need to make the flat check to avoid losing
operating time.
Magical The residual magic from your signature vehicle
interferes with hostile spells. Pilots, crew, and passengers of
the vehicle gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against spells until the start of the pilot’s next turn.
Pulled You have eased the amount of effort needed for
those pulling your signature vehicle to move it. The vehicle
gains a +10 circumstance bonus to its Speed.
Rowed Reinforced ports protect the rowers below decks
from harm. Rowers of your signature vehicle who are
below decks have greater cover from attacks from outside
the vehicle and are not damaged when the vehicle takes
collision damage.
Steam The outlet of steam forms a cloud around the vehicle
as it moves. For the duration of its movement, your signature
vehicle is concealed.
Wind The draft of the wind helps the vehicle turn. During
this movement, your signature vehicle can turn normally,
rather than needing to move in a straight line as normal for a
2- or 3-action Drive.
EFFICIENT CONTROLS
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication, master in Crafting
By reducing redundant systems and streamlining essential
functions, you have made it easier for the vehicle to operate
with fewer crew. Reduce the number of crew required to
operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you
would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew
to 1 pilot and 6 crew. This adjustment only affects the number
of crew needed to operate the vehicle; it doesn’t reduce the
vehicle’s need for a pilot.
IMPERVIOUS VEHICLE
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
From armor plating and flexible components, to reinforced
materials and backup redundant functionality, you have built
safeguards to protect your vehicle from the rigors of combat.
Your signature vehicle gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC
and Fortitude saves, and increases its Hit Points by an amount
equal to twice your level.
MIRACULOUS FLIGHT
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
MAGICAL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
With superior engineering and magical application, you
have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity,
allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle
gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest
current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly
Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a
90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the
length of the vehicle).
UNIONS
Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those
who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most
other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions
to keep business practices fair and to protect each other
from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright’s
Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in
Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and
engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone
(LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of
the union, having been a member for more than 60
years. It is said that you can count on one hand the
number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which
she has never worked. The Shipwright’s Union manages
shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil’s Own and the
Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members
to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.
USING VEHICLES
The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where
the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that
the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign
on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic
archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen
the trick driver archetype. As mentioned on page 55,
vehicles are an element you should consider carefully
before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears
campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can
move very fast, which may make mapping encounters
quite difficult. They can also move characters too
far from the fight for other participants to respond.
Think carefully before deciding whether to include
the vehicle mechanic archetype, and make sure that
vehicle use is right for your campaign’s style and
encounter area size.

Three Innovations
While many of the items here contain their own unique
blend of engineering, science, and, sometimes, magic, three
major types of technology appear in several sections.
CLOCKWORK TECHNOLOGY
Clockwork technology is the least rare technology in
this book, though it’s still quite uncommon. Clockwork
represents, if not a majority of the new inventions, then
at least a plurality, spurred by cutting-edge research at
the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom and the return
of New Thassilon, which surfaced some of the secrets
of clockwork discovered by the ancient empire’s first
emperor, Xin. Most clockwork items need to be wound in
order to work, but aside from a few extraordinary devices,
the time and effort needed to wind up a clockwork item
are far less than the duration and magnitude of its effects.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
Stasian technology is the rarest of the three types, channeling
electricity from a limited supply of Stasian coils smuggled
out of Irrisen, the land of eternal winter, which owns few
Stasian coils to begin with. However, enough smuggled coils
have spread to the mist-haunted principality of Ustalav to
GEARS EQUIPMENT
Stories about gear and technology don’t just focus on the innovative genius of inventors
who toil and tinker until inspiration strikes and they discover something new. The
inventions themselves are often what capture the imagination, sparking stories about
these complex and unusual items. This chapter includes everything you need to add
items of weird science to your fantasy game. While the equipment presented here tends
toward clockwork and steampunk instead of science fiction, in a world that contains
both magic and technology, that line can blur in multitudinous, marvelous ways.

inspire a technological renaissance in the highest halls of
Ustalavic academia. While Stasian technology is the newest
form of electrical technology, and the one least dependent
on magic, it’s hardly the first time in Golarion’s history that
a civilization has attempted to harness electricity. Most
notably, aeromantic infadibulum technology allowed the
sky cities of the Shory empire to soar through the sky.
However, such previous electrical technologies relied
heavily on magic as a key component, as this made the
inventions that harnessed them drastically more stable and
powerful than a purely technological solution. After all,
magic-users could create lightning bolts—what need was
there for a non-magical alternative? While it might seem
frivolous on magic-soaked Golarion, Stasian technology
exists because it originates from another world where
magic is much rarer. By utilizing less magical energy,
Stasian tech offers a viable alternative. The core Stasian
technology can be found on page 82, but other sections
of this chapter have a few pieces of Stasian technology
sprinkled in as well.
STEAM-POWERED TECHNOLOGY
Steam technology is also an extremely recent invention,
making it far less known than clockwork but still more
accessible than Stasian technology, since it doesn’t require
the use of the heavily limited Stasian coils. Many regarded
the idea to use steam for power as particularly novel simply
because the world of Golarion contained so many other
power sources that seemed more obvious or useful than the
energy generated by the transition from water to steam. Most
steam engines currently in use include a magical component
used to heat the steam; for instance, a fire elemental
generates a steady supply of heat on its own, though prior
inventors would have used that energy directly rather than
through the creation of steam. Nonetheless, several small
proof-of-concept steam engines have successfully run safely
and stably without the use of magic, through the use of
a furnace to heat the water. Purely technological steam
power will remain mostly a curiosity, though, as long as
it continues to be less effective and convenient than steam
power sourced through magical means.
Cogs in the Machine
Each section in this chapter presents a different use for
new technologies. Depending on how you want to add
technology to your character and game, you can mix and
match these sections and choose the ones right for you.
The chapter map sidebar on this page provides a quick
glimpse of the page numbers for each section.
COMBAT GEAR
Combat gear items are the practical sort you can use to
fight your enemies, making them the premiere choice for
martial characters seeking technological upgrades. There
are new weapons, weapon-like technological items, and
items that can alter the way you use weapons.
GADGETS
Gadgets are technological consumable items that do
something special once and then break down. They’re
especially important for inventors, who can take feats
allowing them to make a few free gadgets each day.
SIEGE WEAPONS
Siege weapons are large, powerful, difficult to move,
and dependent on several people to reload, aim, and fire
them. They’re particularly effective in a large-scale battle
or war, leveraging rank-and-file infantry for powerful
attacks by the skilled leaders of siege crews.
SNARES AND HAZARDS
Snares and hazards are perfect for rangers, trapsmiths
(page 54), and other characters who like to control the
battlefield ahead of time. When you mix the devious
minds of trapmakers with the possibilities presented by
technology, the possibilities remain especially deadly.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
Stasian technology includes some of the fundamental
technological items that use Stasian coils. You can learn
even more about Stasian technology and how Ustalav has
been using it on page 82.
UTILITY GEAR
Utility gear describes items that are useful in society, though
they may or may not be useful to a typical adventurer. For
instance, the recent invention of the printing press might
one day revolutionize the way society presents written
texts, but on a typical adventuring day, few heroes have
particular use for one. On the other hand, a clockwork
disguise or diving suit could be just what an adventurer
needs to get themselves out of (or into) a sticky situation.
VEHICLES AND MOBILITY DEVICES
Vehicles and mobility devices allow you to travel in style,
using new inventions based on the latest technologies that
can propel your adventure. If you’d like more mobility for
any reason, you can’t go wrong here. You can find even
more mobility items starting on page 66 of Pathfinder Lost
Omens Grand Bazaar, and the original rules for vehicles
are on page 174 of the Gamemastery Guide.

COMBAT GEAR
Although invention thrives all across Golarion, not all
inventions have spread far. Many remain isolated, typically
due to cost, inconvenience, location, or lack of components
and materials. The weapons, combat gear, and equipment
presented below are all mechanical, non-magical, and based
off cutting-edge clockwork innovations, which occasionally
incorporate even newer, bleeding-edge steam technology.
Weapons
NEW WEAPON TRAITS
The weapons in this section use the following traits in
addition to those found on pages 282–283 of the Core
Rulebook and page 248 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
Injection: This weapon can be filled with an injury poison.
Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you
can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single
Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance
requires three Interact actions and uses both hands.
Repeating: These weapons can’t be loaded with
individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and firearms;
instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition
to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in
place, the ammunition loads automatically each time the
weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value
in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs
out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free
hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine,
retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in
place). These actions don’t need to be consecutive.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
BACKPACK BALLISTA
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
This complex wooden device, worn on the back, contains a
miniature ballista on a retractable arm. As an Interact action,
you can pull a lever to deploy or retract the ballista. As long as
it remains deployed, you must hold the ballista using that hand
or some of the components spill out onto the ground, just like
dropping any other weapon. While deployed, the device opens
and raises the ballista up over your shoulder. While retracted,

the ballista and its mount slide down and are concealed within
the device. Although a backpack ballista packs a punch, the
device is a challenge to operate. Reloading it takes 1 minute
and can’t be done while worn. As normal, you can’t wear a
backpack ballista with another backpack.
BACKPACK CATAPULT
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
This wooden device is worn on the back and contains a
miniature catapult mounted on a retractable frame. As an
Interact action, you can pull a lever to deploy or retract the
catapult. As long as it remains deployed, you must hold the
catapult using that hand or some of the components spill out
onto the ground, just like dropping any other weapon. While
deployed, the device opens and raises the catapult up over
your shoulder. While retracted, the catapult and its mount
slide down and are concealed within the device. A backpack
catapult fires specialized stone spheres that are loaded into the
bucket while unworn and retracted, through a sliding hatch;
the reloading process takes 1 minute. To prevent misfires and
accidental injury, the bucket fully encloses the stone while
deployed, only opening when fired. As normal, you can’t wear
a backpack catapult with another backpack.
DART UMBRELLA
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This umbrella fires tiny blowgun darts from its ferrule with a
twist of the handle. The darts are loaded into the shaft, and
though the damage they deal is minimal, the dart umbrella is
an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections.
INJECTION SPEAR
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A hollow receptacle inside this spear’s head can store a single
dose of poison. A sliding trigger along the spear’s shaft can
inject the loaded poison into a damaged target.
PANTOGRAPH GAUNTLET
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A pantograph gauntlet is a heavy, fist-like weight, mounted on
an extendable frame and attached to your outer arm with a
series of leather straps. The frame’s set of mechanical linkages
connected at various hinges allow movements to propagate
across the frame based on reshaping parallelograms, further
controlled by a crossbar grasped in your hand. A pantograph
gauntlet is driven by your own motion and mirrors your
arm’s movements—a punch thrown with your fist moves
the pantograph, extending the weight out at a rapid speed
to land blows up to 10 feet away. In some regions, such as
Alkenstar and Ustalav, pantograph gauntlets are occasionally
constructed entirely of metal and fashioned in the likeness
of oversized arms, incorporating a complex system of
gears or a miniature steam engine in place of the simpler
pantograph mechanism.

REPEATING CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This crossbow has an internal chamber that can be loaded
with up to five bolts. An automated catch mechanism at the
top of the flight groove, just in front of the latch, locks the
bowstring and launches bolts with the pull of a trigger.
REPEATING HAND CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This handheld crossbow features an ingeniously designed
catch mechanism at the top of the flight groove, just in
front of the latch, which automatically loads a bolt from a
magazine and resets the string each time the weapon is
fired. A typical repeating hand crossbow magazine holds
five bolts.
REPEATING HEAVY CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This large crossbow has an internal chamber that
can be loaded with up to five bolts. While it uses
the same automated catch mechanism as other
repeating crossbows, a repeating heavy crossbow’s
design has significant trade-offs. It has increased
range and damage and is easier to learn how to use, but
requires a small amount of effort to reload.
UMBRELLA INJECTOR
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This umbrella’s ferrule is a hollow-tipped blade three
to four inches in length and often overlooked as decorative.
A receptacle inside the umbrella’s shaft can be loaded with
a single dose of injury poison and injected into a damaged
target with the pull of a sliding trigger. Reinforced ribs
enable you to parry and deflect blows with the umbrella’s
tear-resistant canopy.
Combat Gear
The following pieces of combat gear aren’t weapons
themselves, though several
enable you to deploy other
weapons in innovative ways.
BLADE LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 18 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a
handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either
a dagger, dart, shuriken, or starknife. Configuring a blade
launcher requires three Interact actions. Once properly
configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a
blade launcher requires a single Interact action. A blade
launcher can’t fire weapons for which it’s not currently
configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the
agile, monk, thrown, and versatile traits, if it has them, and
has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown
weapon trait, returning and most other effects that allow a
weapon to return don’t function; even if a launched weapon
did return, you’d still need to load it into the blade launcher
with an Interact action to fire the blade launcher again.
BOMB LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 20 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This long, hollow tube is held in two hands and braced over
the shoulder. Inside, it contains a small metal basket sized
to hold alchemical bombs. A chute in the top delivers an
alchemical bomb into the internal basket, while a lever
on the underside pulls the basket back and locks it
in place. Loading an alchemical bomb into a bomb
launcher requires a single Interact action. With a pull
of a trigger, the basket speeds forward, allowing you
to Strike with the loaded alchemical bomb over long
distances. Bombs fired with a bomb launcher have
a range increment of 60 feet.
DEPLOYABLE COVER
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This thick mat of canvas, foliage, and wood is mounted on a
tripod of flexible metal struts, folded into a batonlike shape, and clamped shut. You can rapidly
deploy it on the ground with an Interact action to
create cover. Deployable cover is large enough to Take Cover
behind, allowing you (and others) to gain standard cover when
you use the Take Cover action. Before it can be used again,
deployable cover must be carefully folded and clamped shut,
which takes 1 minute.
Type deployable cover; Level 1; Price 15 gp
Type ballistic cover; Level 2; Price 35 gp
Specially crafted to protect against bullet fire, a ballistic cover
also works against other physical projectiles, such
as arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons. While
a creature has cover from Taking Cover
behind a ballistic cover, it gains resistance 2
to piercing damage from ranged weapons
and ranged unarmed attacks.
GRAPPLING GUN
ITEM 0+
UNCOMMON
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wooden, pistol-like device features a large reel coiled with
100 feet of thin metal cord and can fire a grappling hook up
to 100 feet. To reload the grappling gun, you must manually
recoil the cord by turning the reel’s crank, and then lock in
the grappling hook. Reloading a grappling gun takes 1 minute.
Type grappling gun; Level 0; Price 3 gp
Type clockwork grappling gun; Level 1; Price 15 gp
Clockwork controls the reel on this grappling gun, reeling the
grappling hook back in when you pull a lever. Reloading a
clockwork grappling gun takes three Interact actions.

NET LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
RARE
Price 16 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wide, hollow tube is two to three feet long and fires an
unattached net at much greater range than one can be thrown.
A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your
shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully
folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a
net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net
launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40
feet, rather than 20 feet.
WIND-UP WINGS
ITEM 3+
RARE
CLOCKWORK
Usage attached to a thrown weapon; Bulk —
These delicate clockwork wings enable thrown weapons to
soar through the air at high speeds, performing turns and
other aerial maneuvers midflight. Wind-up wings also have
different types of special effects depending on the type.
Wind-up wings must be attached to a thrown weapon and
wound to function. A thrown weapon with an attached set of
wind-up wings can’t have anything else attached to it, or the
wings cease to function.
Attaching or detaching a pair of wind-up wings to a
thrown weapon requires a repair kit, and the process takes
10 minutes. Winding an attached pair of wind-up wings takes
three Interact actions. There are a variety of wind-up wings,
with different effects.
Type flutterback wind-up wings; Level 3; Price 50 gp
When you make a thrown Strike with the weapon to which a
pair of flutterback wind-up wings are attached, and the wings
are wound, the wings fly the weapon back to your hand after
the Strike is complete. If your hands are full when the weapon
returns, the wings hover in place three feet above the ground.
At the end of your turn, the wings are wound down; they don’t
function again until wound. If you aren’t holding the weapon
when the flutterback wind-up wings become wound down, the
weapon falls to the ground.
Type homing wind-up wings; Level 12; Price 1,800 gp
When you make a thrown Strike with the weapon to which a
pair of homing wind-up wings are attached, and the wings are
wound, the wings seek out your target, flying through cover
and avoiding obstacles. You ignore the target’s concealed
condition and reduce the target’s cover by one step (lesser
cover to no cover, standard cover to lesser cover, or greater
cover to standard cover). After the Strike is complete, the
wings are wound down; they don’t function again until wound.

GADGETS
Gadgets are consumable technological inventions with
innovative uses. Gadgets take a variety of forms, some
handheld, others worn, and they often take a while to
put on or take off. Depending on their forms, gadgets
also have a variety of different effects. Due to the use of
technology, all gadgets are uncommon or rare, though
inventors and regions with access to inventors have
access to uncommon gadgets.
Gadgets are particularly important to inventors,
some of whom learn tricks and techniques to create a
number of temporary gadgets each day from spare parts
without needing to spend additional time and money
on the project. This, in turn, leads those inventors to be
particularly profligate in the use of gadgets, which leads
to an even stronger association between the two.
Gadgets are not, however, exclusive to inventors. In
truth, anyone can make a gadget if they have the time,
money, skill, and knowledge of how to do so. This
sometimes leads others to misidentify a particularly
technologically-savvy investigator or wizard using
gadgets as an inventor.
ABLATIVE ARMOR PLATING
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage attached to armor or traveler’s clothing; Bulk 1
Ablative armor plating is additional plating, combined with
springs, clever clockwork, and improvised padding, to absorb
damage by knocking the additional pieces free. The pieces
slowly come apart on their own with time and movement.
The process of attaching the plating takes 10 minutes and
grants the wearer of the armor the listed temporary Hit
Points for the stated duration or until lost. Removing the
plating early destroys it.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The wearer gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1
minute or until lost.

ABLATIVE SHIELD PLATING
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage attached to a shield; Bulk 1
Ablative shield plating is an amalgam device that provides
a layer of additional protection for a shield. Ablative shield
plating is cobbled together from parts of other shields, wires,
scraps, and bits of detritus, adding mass to a shield. The
process of attaching ablative shield plating takes 10 minutes,
and you can’t attach ablative shield plating to a shield that has
any other attached item, such as a shield boss or shield spikes.
When the shield is damaged, this additional material crumples,
breaks, and falls apart, absorbing some of the energy of
the blow. Otherwise, the additional material slowly
crumbles over time. Applying the plating grants
the shield temporary Hit Points that last for the
stated duration or until lost. Removing the plating
early destroys it.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The shield gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last
for 1 minute or until lost.
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 12 gp
The shield gains 10 temporary Hit Points that
last for 10 minutes or until lost.

When you Activate the greater blast boots to High Jump, you
can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up
to 50 feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can
increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to
75 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the greater blast boots
continue to boost your jumps. Every time you Leap during
the duration, you can move 30 feet in any direction, or your
normal Leap distance, whichever is further.
Type major; Level 17; Price 2,750 gp
When you Activate the major blast boots to High Jump, you
can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up
to 80 feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can
increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up
to 120 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the major blast boots
remain active, allowing you to clumsily fly through the air for
the duration. You gain a 30-foot Fly speed for the duration,
but any time you Fly, you are clumsy 1 until the start of your

Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This small, clockwork torch device uses a
trigger-operated sparker to ignite a flow of
flammable gas, creating a short, hot flame
capable of rapidly cauterizing wounds and
helping to stop bleeding. The cauterizing
torch is applied to yourself or an adjacent
target. The target attempts an immediate flat
check to end any persistent bleed effect with
the lower DC for particularly effective assistance
(Core Rulebook 62).
CHAMELEON SUIT
ITEM 4+
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage worn over armor and clothes; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
This complex clockwork outerwear, worn over armor or
other clothing, is composed of thin, interlocking scales of
myriad colors attached to numerous clockwork gears that
can rotate between all visible colors and shades.
When activated, the clockwork gears work double-time
to temporarily switch and adjust the scales to match the
exact coloration of the area around you, allowing you to
blend in as long as you stay still. For the duration, you can
Hide without needing cover or concealment to do so. This
doesn’t allow you to Sneak without ending your movement
in cover or concealment, however, as the clockwork flips
over and adjusts the scales to match your background as
you move, giving the impression of rippling waves of color
and revealing your movement. Once the duration expires,
the overworked clockwork and scales fall apart.

This heavy set of mechanical goggles contains a variety of
different lenses for different situations, including lenses
that filter light at different intensities and frequencies and
even some that capture heat and other stimuli. Clockwork
mechanisms can swap between the lenses rapidly as needed.
However, many of these lenses can only capture a single
stimulus once and then are forever etched with it, making
them unsuitable for long-term use. When activated, the
clockwork mechanism on the goggles rapidly switches
between the different lenses, granting you the benefits of all
of them for a brief period of time.

CRYOMISTER
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
COLD
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in
an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you’ve
done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist,
settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet
of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending
on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for
1 minute; , at the GM’s discretion, however, this duration
might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in
unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage,
the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a
weapon, the cryomister’s rapidly cooling mist deals cold
splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the
area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through
the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a
DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and
move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto
the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the
same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures
of the listed size.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 3 gp
The area is a 5-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 17, and the
cold splash damage is 1. The floating ice can support one
creature up to Medium size.
Type moderate; Level 5; Price 25 gp
The area is a 10-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 21, and the
cold splash damage is 3. The floating ice can support one
Large creature or two Medium or smaller creatures.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 250 gp
The area is a 15-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 30, and the
cold splash damage is 5. The floating ice can support one
Huge creature, two Large creatures, or four Medium or
smaller creatures.
Type major; Level 17; Price 2,500 gp
The area is a 20-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 39, and
the cold splash damage is 8. The floating ice can support
one Gargantuan creature, two Huge creatures, four Large
creatures, or eight Medium or smaller creatures. The ice can’t
support Gargantuan creatures larger than a 20-by-20-foot
space, such as a mu spore.
ELECTROMUSCULAR STIMULATOR

EXPLOSIVE MINE
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the
ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode
when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in
advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground
before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth
to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you
don’t Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance.
Once activated, the mine is primed to explode when
enough pressure is placed on the square where it’s located.
Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves

GADGET
Price 21 gp
Usage worn (attached to footwear or feet); Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact (move)
Gadget skates are metal devices that come in pairs and strap
onto existing footwear (or a creature’s feet).
When you Activate gadget skates, clockwork gears reveal
small wheels that propel you along the ground, moving you
up to twice your Speed. During this movement, you must
succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics check to turn up to 90
degrees, and you can’t turn more than once or more than
90 degrees. During the activation and after the activation is
complete, you can’t Stride, Step, or otherwise move on the
ground until the end of your next turn. However, you can use
this movement instead of a Stride to perform a High Jump or
Long Jump just after the activation ends, in the direction of
your last movement using the gadget skates.
You can Sustain the Activation of your gadget skates
for up to 1 minute. Starting on the turn after you Activate
the gadget skates, the first time you Sustain the Activation
each turn, you gain the effects of the activation again: you
move up to twice your Speed in the same direction as your
last movement with the gadget skates, and the restrictions
continue to apply until you choose to cease Sustaining the
Activation or you reach the maximum duration. Once the
effect ends, the skates fall away and you can move normally.

Usage worn over armor and clothes; Bulk L
Activate see below
While you’re wearing an impact foam chassis wrapped
around your body, it Activates automatically whenever you
fall at least 10 feet, causing a layer of soft, flexible impact
foam to expand beneath and around you to cushion the
fall. The impact foam decreases the falling damage by up
to the listed amount, taking damage equal to the amount
of falling damage the foam reduced. If this is enough to
destroy the foam, it disperses immediately. However, if the
foam has any Hit Points remaining, it remains surrounding
you for up to 1 minute. While you’re surrounded in foam,
you are immobilized and have standard cover against other
creatures, and other creatures have standard cover against
you. The foam has an Escape DC of 15; a creature can also
remove it by spending three Interact actions. You or others
can also attack the foam (the foam has an AC of 12), which
disperses if reduced to 0 Hit Points.

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
An instant spy is a tiny clockwork device that is small enough
to be easily hidden. It contains the same audio-recording
mechanisms as a clockwork spy (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 48),
as well as a short‑lived gemstone that can store up to 1 hour
of sound to play back later.
Once you have activated the instant spy, it surreptitiously
begins recording all the sounds around it for an hour. In
general, it can hear sounds that are clearly audible in the
location where you activated it, but not sounds that would
require a Perception check with a DC of 10 or greater to
hear. The GM determines exactly what the instant spy can
hear and record, as well as whether or not the recording
is clear in a situation where the original sound is quiet,
distorted, or intentionally obscured.
When the recording is complete, once within the next 24
hours, you or another creature can use an Interact action
to play back the stored audio in its entirety, after which the
gem crumbles to dust. If no one plays the recorded sounds
back within 1 day, the gem crumbles into dust anyway.
This prevents the information from falling into the wrong
hands later. It’s typical to use the Conceal an Object action
to hide an instant spy in a location once you’ve activated
it, since if you don’t hide it, it’s relatively easy to discover
in a thorough search, despite the fact that it’s small and
relatively unobtrusive.

SIEGE WEAPONS
Shattering towering palisades. Mowing down hordes of soldiers. Breaking through
barred castle gates. All of these tasks call for something heftier than the typical armaments
carried by the common soldier: siege weapons. These massive, often‑complex devices
require full crews to operate. In significant numbers, they allow attackers to lay siege
to entire fortifications, just as their name would suggest.
There are two categories of siege weapons: mounted and
portable. Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size
and space, typically have defensive statistics, and are used
for large-scale warfare. More adaptable are portable
siege weapons, such as battering rams, which can be
carried more easily and can serve a valuable role during
large-scale warfare, smaller conflicts, or even exploration.
All siege weapons need more than one person to operate
them, working together as a crew. These crew members all
need to be adjacent to the siege weapon for it to operate.
A siege weapon’s stat block lists the minimum number
needed and the maximum crew size. Adding additional
crew beyond the minimum is useful for ensuring a quick
and successful Load in uncertain conditions and allowing
for enough time to Aim the siege weapon when firing at
a moving target.
Mounted Siege Weapons
Properly using a mounted siege weapon involves three
activities: Loading, Aiming, and Launching the payload.
Generally, none of these activities can be taken unless the
weapon has enough crew, but the GM might allow a smaller
crew or even an individual to perform simpler parts of the
process, like Launching—especially at a dramatic moment!
AIMING
A cumbersome mounted siege weapon can’t be Aimed in
a moment like a bow could be. A member of the weapon’s

Introduction
Gears
Characters

Gear

Guns &
GEARS
crew needs to take the Aim activity to adjust a mounted
siege weapon’s aim. At a given time, the weapon is Aimed
in a particular way, depending on the target or area the
weapon uses.
• Single Target: Aimed at one square
• Burst: Aimed at one grid corner (that will be the
center of the burst)
• Cone or Line: Aimed in a particular direction, to the
nearest 45º angle.
When a siege crew member takes the Aim activity,
they can move the aim of a mounted siege weapon only
a certain distance (or rotate the weapon a certain amount
for a cone or line). Typically, the aim for a single target
or burst can’t be placed too close to the weapon due to
the arc in which the weapon shoots. The distance moved
or rotated can be found in each weapon’s stat block, as
is the minimum distance, if applicable. The Launch entry
notes whether the attack is against a single target or in a
burst, cone, or line.
LOADING
Any member of the crew can take the Load activity to
prepare the weapon, resetting its machinery or helping
Load the payload. The stat block lists how many times
the activity must be taken to prepare the weapon to
Launch. Some Load activities require successful checks to
be effective, such as ones that require an Athletics check
to Load heavy ammunition into the siege weapon. Once
the weapon is Loaded, trying to Load it further has no
effect. It doesn’t matter in what order the siege weapon
is Aimed and Loaded, and the crew could partially Load
the weapon, Aim it, and then continue Loading it without
disrupting the process.
LAUNCHING
A member of the crew adjacent to the siege weapon’s
release can use the Launch action to shoot the siege
weapon. After the weapon has been Launched, it must
be Loaded fully to be Launched again. No matter how
quickly it’s Loaded, a single siege weapon can never be
Launched more than once per round. The aim remains
where it was, and the weapon needs to be Aimed again
only if the crew wishes to change the aim.
Launch [one-action] (attack) Requirements The siege weapon is Loaded;
Effect The siege weapon launches its payload, which targets
or has an area where the weapon is Aimed.
• Single target Targets a creature, unattended object, or
structure in the square the weapon is Aimed at
• Burst Centered on the grid corner the weapon is Aimed at
• Cone or Line Directed where the weapon is Aimed
Each creature, unattended object, and structure the siege
weapon is Aimed at or that is in the area takes the amount
of damage listed in the Launch action, with a basic saving
throw against the DC listed in the stat block. If you’re trained
in any weapons of the category listed in the siege weapon’s
proficiency entry, you can use your class DC instead of the
weapon’s default save DC. The weapon’s range increment
penalty applies to the Launch DC, as does your multiple
attack penalty. If the weapon is mounted on a vehicle,
the penalties for attacking from a vehicle in combat also
apply (Gamemastery Guide 177). Though a siege weapon
doesn’t require an attack roll, the Launch action still has
the attack trait and therefore counts toward your multiple
attack penalty.
MOVING A MOUNTED SIEGE WEAPON
A mounted siege weapon has to be built on solid ground
and remains stationary while being operated. Some are
on wheels or are otherwise easier to move, but none can
be prepared or shot while being moved. The GM might
allow a mounted siege weapon to be placed on a large
enough vessel, such as a sailing ship.
Moving a mounted siege weapon takes concerted effort
from the whole crew pulling and pushing. This requires
acting in concert, as described under Portable Siege
Weapons, with the crew leader taking the Move Siege
Weapon activity. This requires the minimum number
of crew required to operate the siege weapon and gets
no extra benefit for additional crew helping. If a siege
weapon doesn’t list this action, it can’t be moved this
way; it has to be disassembled and reassembled.
Move Siege Weapon [two-actions] Requirements The rest of the crew
have Readied to Stride on your order; Effect You and the
crew Stride, moving the mounted siege weapon with you.
The maximum distance equals the slowest crew member’s
Speed, or the maximum Speed listed in the siege weapon’s
Move Siege Weapon entry, whichever is lower. The siege
weapon’s aim moves the same distance and direction the
siege weapon moved.
Portable Siege Weapons
Portable siege weapons require moving in concert and
making a single attack supported by the full crew.
ACTING IN CONCERT
Because portable siege weapons require coordination,
operating one requires following a crew leader. The rest of
the crew must Ready an action to be taken when the crew
leader calls to attack with the siege weapon. The siege
weapon’s special activity lists what action they need to
Ready. For example, all of the crew operating a battering
ram—except the crew leader—need to Ready to Stride.
Each portable siege weapon has a special activity the
crew leader can take if all the rest of the crew have Readied
the necessary action. The number of actions it requires
and the other specifics can vary greatly depending on
what it takes to operate the weapon. It typically requires
the crew leader to make a Strike.
STRIKING
A Strike with a siege weapon uses the crew leader’s
attack bonus. The siege weapon’s Proficiency entry

================================================================================
PAGE 75
================================================================================

indicates the weapon category for the siege weapon. The
crew leader rolls an attack roll against the target. Any
bonuses or penalties the crew leader is taking apply to the
attack roll. See the sidebar above for more on how attack
abilities work with portable siege weapons.
BULK
A portable siege weapon has a Bulk entry. This is
primarily used when someone is carrying the portable
siege weapon around. When it’s being used by a crew,
this Bulk is distributed among them as they see fit, and
it’s usually not worth tracking the Bulk unless they’re
already heavily loaded. If characters try to have more
than one of them carry the portable siege weapon when
it’s not being used (dragging it around a dungeon, for
example), this is cumbersome, and they’re encumbered
due to the challenge of constantly coordinating their
movement.
Siege Weapon Statistics
A siege weapon uses the following stat block format.
An individual siege weapon might omit some of these
sections, especially a portable siege weapon.

OTHER TRAITS
Price This entry lists the siege weapon’s Price; Ammunition
If the siege weapon requires special ammunition, the
ammunition’s name appears here, along with the Price and
Bulk of each piece.
Usage This entry shows whether the siege weapon is mounted
or held. The number of hands required for a held siege
weapon reflects how many the entire crew needs to use to
operate the weapon; Bulk A portable siege weapon has Bulk;
Space A mounted siege weapon has this entry to indicate
its dimensions, not including any creatures crewing it.
Crew The number of creatures needed to operate the siege
weapon is listed here. If additional creatures can assist,
there’s a second number to indicate the maximum number
that’s practical. For instance, “4 to 8” indicates the weapon
can’t be operated by fewer than four creatures, and that no
more than eight creatures total can crew the weapon at a
time; Proficiency This entry shows the proficiency required
to use your class DC when Launching a mounted weapon
(see the Launch action) or the proficiency used for your
attack roll with a portable siege weapon.
AC The siege weapon’s AC. This section appears only if the siege
weapon can normally be attacked and is more typical of
mounted siege weapons; Saving Throws The siege weapon’s
saves, which typically include only Fortitude and Reflex.
Hardness The siege weapon’s hardness; HP The siege weapon’s
Hit Points, with its Broken Threshold in parentheses;
Immunities The siege weapon’s immunities; Weaknesses

Large handles are affixed to the sides so it can be hefted and
carried by a crew.
SIEGE WEAPONS VS. NORMAL WEAPONS
Many of the benefits that apply to standard weapons—
daggers, bows, battleaxes, and the like—don’t work
on siege weapons. They’re simply too different in form
and function. The GM might allow using them in certain
circumstances, but this is fairly rare.
Character abilities that affect their attacks might work
with portable siege weapons. For example, a battering
ram might get the benefit of a character’s bonuses that
apply to attacks with two-handed weapons. The GM can
determine what’s reasonable and what’s not. Because
siege weapons require special actions to operate, a
character can’t use their special actions with them. Sorry,
no Attacks of Opportunity with a battering ram!

BUILDING SIEGE WEAPONS
Just like other items, building a siege weapon requires
using the Craft activity. However, due to the size, it
typically takes more than one person to prepare some of
the materials (such as felling tall trees and working them
to create a trebuchet arm) and assemble the weapon.
You typically need a number of workers equal to the
minimum crew size for the siege weapon to complete it
in the standard amount of time. It can take much longer
or even be impossible for a smaller team or individual.
Due to their specific uses, you might be able to use
Engineering Lore or Warfare Lore instead of the Crafting
skill when you Craft a siege weapon. The GM determines
whether you can—some strange or more complex engines
might not be constructible with Warfare Lore.
DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING
A mounted siege weapon without a Speed must be
disassembled to be moved, then reassembled in its new
location. The GM determines how long this takes, but it’s
typically 1 day or half a day of downtime to disassemble
a siege weapon and 1 to 2 days to rebuild it. As with
building a siege weapon, you need a larger crew to
disassemble or reassemble a siege weapon at full speed.

SIEGE TOWERS
A siege tower uses the vehicle rules from page 174 of
the Gamemastery Guide. The siege tower uses pushed
propulsion, which uses the same rules as pulled. The
helepolis uses both pushed propulsion and turned
propulsion to turn a capstan. Turned propulsion uses the
same rules as rowed propulsion.

Tiered A helepolis has six levels. The crew operate at
the bottom tier, turning a giant capstan. There’s room
remaining on that tier for up to six passengers (enough
for a full heavy ballista siege crew; see Weaponry). Each
of the remaining five levels carries up to 60 passengers.
The tiers are specifically meant to be protective and give
those within the helepolis greater cover (or standard
cover if the helepolis is broken). A massive ladder runs
diagonally through the center of the helepolis, from the
front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier. The
ladder is wide enough for two crew or passengers to
climb simultaneously.
Weaponry The siege tower is loaded to the brim with siege
weapons—typically bristling with heavy ballistas on its
first and second tiers and ballistas on its third, fourth,
and fifth. The Price of these weapons is included in that
of the helepolis. When building a helepolis, you can
choose to replace any of these with other siege weapons
with a lower Price. If you want a more expensive siege
weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the
helepolis’s structure, any siege weapon in it must launch
its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or
springald could function in a helepolis, but not a catapult
or trebuchet. Passengers of the helepolis can crew these
siege weapons.

7-foot ladder.
The siege tower has a corvus at its highest tier: a
vertical bridge that can be lowered to allow creatures
to cross gaps. Lowering the corvus takes a total of
3 Interact actions. Moving the siege tower while the
corvus is lowered is highly dangerous, especially for
anyone on the corvus. When it’s open, creatures in the
top tier don’t have cover from the side with the corvus,
and creatures on the lowered corvus don’t have cover
except from below.

SNARES AND HAZARDS
New innovations bring about progress, but not all
progress makes the world a better place. While some
innovators are focused on lessening toil and providing
free time to pursue passions and pleasures, others are
less altruistic. Creators of a more devious bent often
channel their imagination toward the invention of
deadlier, more cunning traps. Below are just some of the
latest advances in their perilous craft.
Snares
The following snares take advantage of various
technological advances to terrifying and lethal effects.
They otherwise work like any other snares.
ACID SPITTER
SNARE 4
UNCOMMON
ACID
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 15 gp
This tin clockwork lizard is activated when a creature moves
adjacent to it, at which point it spits out a glob of acid. The
target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or take
3d6 acid damage.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes full damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and 5 persistent acid
damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and 10
persistent acid damage.
BINDING SNARE
SNARE 10
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 160 gp
When a creature enters the snare’s square, several strands
of strong wires ending in jagged hooks latch onto it before
hauling it to the ground. The snare deals 2d6 piercing
damage, and the targeted creature must attempt a DC 28
Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is knocked
prone and immobilized for 1 round (Escape DC 28).
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is knocked
prone, and is restrained for 1 round (Escape DC 28).

CLOCKWORK CHIRPER
SNARE 3
UNCOMMON
AUDITORY CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 8 gp
This simple clockwork bird is no larger than a sparrow,
designed to be wound up and perched on a tree branch or
ledge. The Tiny clockwork remains immobile and silent until a
Small or larger creature enters the square beneath its perch,
at which point it springs into action. Once activated, it flies
around making a loud chirping sound that can be heard up
to 500 feet away. The bird then follows the creature that
activated it for up to one hour or until it is destroyed, doing
its best to stay just above the creature and out of reach,
and continuing its string of loud chirps. The bird is an object
with a Speed 10 feet, and a fly Speed of 25 feet. It has AC 15,
Hardness 5, HP 10 (BT 5) and object immunities. Once broken,
it can no longer fly. It can’t attack or otherwise damage other
creatures. After an hour has passed after its activation, the
clockwork chirper falls into a pile of useless components.
CLOCKWORK MONKEY
SNARE 2
UNCOMMON
AUDITORY CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 5 gp
These cute and unassuming toy monkeys are often dressed in
loud clothing and carry a percussion instrument. It’s activated
once a creature moves adjacent to the square it sits in, at
which point it leaps on the creature, scurrying about on its
agile hind legs while it pounds on its instrument, riding the
creature and raising a racket. The creature being assaulted by
the monkey must find a way to escape its agitator either via
flinging the monkey off with the Escape action (DC 18) or by
breaking the monkey. The monkey has AC 19, Hardness 2, HP
10 (BT 5) and object immunities.

RARE
CONSUMABLE
ELECTRICITY
MECHANICAL
SNARE
TRAP
Price 9,000 gp
This modified Stasian coil of metal and glass stands about
three feet tall. It activates when at least three creatures are
within 20 feet of it, or if at least one creature stays within
20 feet of it for more than 1 round. It then lashes out with a
torrent of electrical energy dealing 7d12 electricity damage
to all creatures within 20 feet of it. Due to the fact that it
doesn’t trigger immediately when a creature enters its square,
abilities like Surprise Snare (Advanced
Player’s Guide 194) don’t work with
a death coil. Creatures within that
area must attempt a DC 43 Fortitude
saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is
unaffected.
Success The creature takes half
damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage
and is stunned 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage
is stunned 4.
DETONATING GEARS SNARE
SNARE 3
AUDITORY
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 12 gp
This snare uses clockwork stressed almost to the breaking
point, which activates with a powerful explosion that deals
3d8 piercing damage to the first creature entering the snare’s
square. The creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex saving
throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and 3 persistent bleed
damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and 6
persistent bleed damage.
FLAME DRAKE SNARE
SNARE 5
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE
FIRE
MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 25 gp
The snare takes the form of a Tiny, drake‑like
clockwork toy. When a creature enters
its square the snare activates, causing the
drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15-foot cone in
the direction from which the creature entered.
For instance, if a creature entered the square
coming from the east, the cone would
point east, to hit any allies behind the
triggering creature. Those within the
cone must succeed a DC 19 basic Reflex
save or take 6d6 fire damage. After spitting its fire,
the snare falls apart.
DANGEROUS TOYS
A fair number of clockwork snares take the form of toys
and curiosities. In fact, many were initially developed
by enterprising toymakers who sought to create an
interesting toy and accidentally invented something with
lethal potential. Pranksters, criminals, revolutionaries,
and even other inventors then sought out these designs,
made improvements, and unleashed them as snares.
Devious kobolds and gnomes in particular take great joy
in the use of their deadly little “gifts,” and the worst of
them are always looking for new innocuous disguises for
their dangerous playthings.
It’s rumored that various toymakers in Absalom
meet at least once a season in an undisclosed location
in the city to demonstrate their new designs to various
creators of snares and sell their base formulas to the
highest bidders. Once sold, these designs are repurposed
into destructive snares. The only restrictions toymakers
place on these illicit auctions are that their formulas
can’t be used to fabricate actual toys, and the outward
appearances of the snares must be substantially different
from the toys on which the mechanisms are based.

in a random direction determined by the GM but always
including the creature who opened the box. Those within
the cone must succeed at a DC 17 basic Reflex save or take
4d6 fire damage.
FROST WORM SNARE
SNARE 9
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
COLD
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 115 gp
The snare takes the form of a Tiny frost worm clockwork
toy. When a creature enters its square, the snare activates,
causing the worm to let loose a 30-foot line of frost in the
direction from which the creature entered the square. For
instance, if a creature entered the square coming from
the south, the worm would shoot the line south, to hit
any allies of the triggering creature. Those within the line
must succeed a DC 25 basic Reflex save or take 10d6 cold
damage. After spitting its frost, the snare falls apart.

Price 120 gp
This cute and unassuming dragon toy activates once a creature
moves into its square. It then unleashes a rapid burst of toxic
gas in a 10-foot emanation. Those within the emanation when
the snare is activated must attempt a DC 25 Fortitude saving
throw or take 3d6 poison damage.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is sickened 1.

shrapnel to cause devastating damage. When a creature
enters the snare’s square, the trap releases, dealing 12d6
piercing damage in a deafening explosion. Everyone in a
10-foot radius of the snare’s square must attempt a DC 31
Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature in unaffected,

STRANGE NEW METHODS
Many inventors’ creations seem to defy reality. This
is made possible by their constant scientific study of
the various monumental powers that manifest upon
Golarion. While wizards have their formulas, clerics
their rituals, and occult casters their strange secrets,
inventors search for what they call the hidden laws of
reality. They believe mundane reality, untouched by the
mysteries of magic, has its own set of laws that are
for the most part unknown. For example, what makes
electricity choose its exact crackling path? It must
follow some kind of law.
Exactly what these laws are and how they should
be explained is a matter of debate. Many inventors
continue practices common to alchemists, where
they codify their research with strange symbols and
secret codes, believing the best way to protect their
craft, prestige, secrets, and income is to avoid sharing
their wildest theories with others. But there are more
openminded individuals, usually living in cosmopolitan
centers, who think sharing their secrets and having
peers assess their methods of research will benefit the
people of their kingdom, perhaps even the world. They
believe collaboration will lead to better explanations
and answers to the mysteries of these natural laws.
And while these naturalist societies are small and
secluded, most of their members believe that they and
those like them are on the right track toward solving
the mysteries of the multiverse. While wizards and
other academic spellcasters appreciate their rigor, they
believe the idea of separating the laws of mundane
reality from magic is an absurd and pointless constraint,
especially given that magical essences underpin the
very fabric of reality. For their part, naturalists believe
these spellcasters are missing the point.

an incorporeal creature enters its square, the device lets
loose an ectoplasmic web that lashes around the creature’s
spectral form. The creature must succeed a DC 26 Reflex
saving throw or become immobilized for 1 round. On a critical
failure, the creature becomes immobilized for 1 minute. In
either case, the incorporeal creature can attempt to Escape

triggering creature, Striding up to 50 feet, then roll initiative.
Routine (9 actions) Each of the mannequins uses three of
the haunt’s actions on each turn, and the haunt loses
three actions each turn for every disabled or destroyed
mannequin. Each mannequin uses its first action to Stride
up to 50 feet and its remaining two actions to make
clockwork fist Strikes. Each has its own separate multiple
attack penalty.
Melee [one-action] clockwork fist +29, Damage 2d10+18 bludgeoning
Reset The haunt deactivates after it has no target creatures
and resets, usually over the course of 1 round, as the
mannequins move to their original positions. If a mannequin
is more than 150 feet from its original position, the haunt
takes longer to reset, as the mannequin moves back 150
feet each round.
TINY SNARE, BIG EXPLOSION
While most snares take the form of large, carefully
hidden contraptions, some of the snares in this section
resemble tiny clockwork toys or other small objects
that pack a hidden punch. Often whimsical and strange,
these tiny snares might even be fun to play with if
they weren’t dangerous. Gnomes, goblins, kobolds, and
other small creatures take an almost perverse delight
in using these diminutive snares to shock, burn, or
damage any larger folks who make the mistake of
believing that small humanoids are easy pickings.
There is a fine line between legitimate defense and the
machinations of a malicious prankster, however. Many
times, the users of such snares blur those lines out of
schadenfreude or exuberance. Those who adventure
with snarecrafters and trapsmiths are advised to reach
an understanding or at least have a serious conversation
with them, to ensure that their cunning companion
respects their allies’ personal boundaries.

STASIAN TECH
Stasian technology uses electricity to produce strange
and unpredictable effects, sometimes, but not always, in
conjunction with magic. The Stasian coils necessary to
power such technology are limited and hard to acquire,
making Stasian technological items extremely rare.
However, slow imports and smuggling into Ustalav have
led to development of items based upon the technology,
making these items easier to acquire than other rare
items, if one knows the right places to look. You can find
more information on Ustalavic innovations using Stasian
technology on page 225.
Technological Items
The following items utilize Stasian technology alongside
or in place of magical components.

ITEM 10
RARE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Price 970 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx,
supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres
with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body
comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze
electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic
energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge
that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create
a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse’s
final memories. Galvanic mortal coils are even rarer than other
galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Effect You
drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while
attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage
their heart and possibly siphon their life force. The galvanic
mortal coil casts death knell on the creature (DC 27).
Activate (10 minutes) Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect
You implant the coil into a corpse. The coil casts talking
corpse on the body.

A galvasphere animates a corpse to motion via electricity,
rather than necromancy. When you Activate the galvasphere
by inserting it into an adjacent intact Medium or Small
humanoid corpse, the corpse animates as a galvaheart
zombie for 1 minute. The galvaheart zombie has the
statistics of a zombie shambler except that it is
a construct instead of an undead, isn’t evil,
can’t be harmed by positive energy, and is
the same size as the corpse (Medium or
Small). The zombie is your minion and
performs the actions you choose
when you Command it. If you don’t
Command it, it takes no action,
twitching in place as the electricity

Price 175 gp
Usage affixed to a shield
Activate [free-action] Interact; Trigger You Shield Block a foe’s melee
unarmed attack or melee attack with the affixed shield.
This miniature Stasian coil talisman emits small sparks when
jostled. It uses a combination of Stasian technology and
evocation magic to erupt in electricity when discharged.
When you activate the coil, the foe takes 2d12 electricity
damage (DC 27 basic Reflex save). On a failed save, the foe is
flat-footed until the start of its next turn.
SPIRIT-SINGER
ITEM 5+
RARE
Etheric spirit-singers create an eerie spectral sound based on
the presence of spiritual essence and other ethereal
energies. All spirit-singers can be used as musical
instruments by manipulating the sensitivity to
ethereal energies. However, they have an even
greater benefit in areas heavy with spiritual
essence. When played in the presence of a
significant spiritual disturbance, such as
a haunt or an incorporeal undead, a
spirit‑singer grants you a +1 item
bonus to Performance checks. While
playing a spirit-singer, you also
gain a +1 item bonus to checks to
detect a haunt or incorporeal undead,
and you can roll a check to notice a haunt
even if you aren’t actively Searching for it, due to
the distortions of the spirit-singer’s music. A haunt or
incorporeal undead that is intelligent enough to notice
the effects it is having on the spirit-singer’s music and that
can’t otherwise communicate with the living might choose
to use the spirit-singer to do so if it wishes. For instance, it
could try to guide the spirit-singer player towards a location
by creating distortions in that direction or, if it understands
language, it could try to answer questions by creating one
distortion for yes and two distortions for no. Unless stated
otherwise in its usage entry, a spirit-singer functions like
a heavy musical instrument; rather than carrying it, the
musician places the spirit‑singer in a particular position and
uses both hands to play.

point that you can analyze its song more
intricately. Increase the item bonus to
Performance checks near spiritual
disturbances, and the item bonus to

VIOLET RAY
ITEM 12
RARE
Price 1,893 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
One of the many wondrous devices brought into the world
by Stasian technology is the seemingly miraculous violet ray.
Physicians claim it anything from headaches to heartburn, or
nausea to deafness, all with an easy and painless treatment.
The device is a glass vacuum with an insulated handle
connected to a small Stasian coil. When powered, the glass
tube fills with purple light and becomes warm to the
touch. Pressing the tube to one’s body is
said to increase blood flow, eliminate
toxins, and many other beneficial
effects. A violet ray functions as a set
of healer’s tools and provides a +2 item
bonus to Medicine checks to Administer
First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or
Treat Wounds.
Activate [three-actions] Interact; Frequency once
per day; Effect You apply the violet ray
to an adjacent creature and attempt to
counteract the blinded, clumsy, confused,
deafened, drained, enfeebled, sickened, or
stupefied condition with a counteract level of 6 and
a counteract modifier of +22, using the source of the
condition to determine the condition’s counteract level
and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect
and you don’t remove that effect, the condition returns
after 1 minute. Each use of this ability can only counteract
a single condition.

Weaponry might be one of the flashiest forms of
clockwork technology, but it’s far from the only one.
For every inventor who devotes his labors to creating
clockwork instruments of destruction, there are ten
others who focus on creating devices which average
people can use to make life easier and more enjoyable.
These machines, built for society rather than
adventurers, are arguably more impactful than even
the most powerful weapon, for they affect thousands of
lives every day. Major trade centers reap these rewards
as inventors from far-flung lands meet and share their
methods and designs. As innovations from different
regions mingle, each breakthrough enables the next at a
quicker rate.
AQUARIUM LAMP
ITEM 8
UNCOMMON
ELECTRICITY
LIGHT
Bulk 20
Price 1,500 gp
Activate [one-action] Interact
The aquarium lamp is a combination light source and exotic
animal aquarium, intended to provide rich nobles amusement
and illumination. It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet
wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by
two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around
the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the
ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical
coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass
tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while
a number of animals belonging to species considered to be
the eels’ natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks.
With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller
tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank.
Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal,
using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this
happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy
into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send
the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result
produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though
it were midday.
This device is an expression of a recent trend among
certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their

manors’ interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious
decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as
“tacky” and “unrefined.” If a noble in such company wishes
not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration
adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The
aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race,
and it’s already proven popular with its target market.
When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in
a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each
activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use,
and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey
animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled,
though electric eels usually need feeding only once per
day, and won’t go after the prey if they’re all full. While
electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers
and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they
can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they
are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving
tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of
which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the
lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years
if kept well-fed.
CLOCKWORK BOOKSHELF
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 15 gp
This device was originally created by an inventor who had
way more books they wanted to access than available wall
space to store them. Each of the bookshelf’s six levels is
actually loaded with a pair of shelves instead of a single
shelf. A simple switch on the side of the bookshelf flips the
corresponding shelf to the other side, revealing any books
stored in the paired shelf. While this makes the clockwork
bookshelf a little deeper than a normal bookshelf, in order
to fit both shelves, it effectively allows you to store twice
as many books using the same amount of wall space. Those
who wish to keep volumes hidden from visitors (or perhaps
stow a weapon or potion within a false book) often load the
hidden shelf first, then switch to the second shelf lined with
more respectable volumes.
CLOCKWORK BOX PACKER
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 50 gp
This handy clockwork device is too expensive for most
warehouses and shipping docks to make use of it, but some
nobles have purchased the item for their staff as a status
symbol, and merchants who are in the shipping trade can
afford to slowly reap the benefits of its usage. It takes 1
minute to wind a clockwork box packer; after which, it can
function for up to 1 hour.
You can indicate how high you want the clockwork
box packer to stack boxes and what the packing storage
dimensions are. Once packing instructions have been input,
you can load a crate onto the clockwork box packer, and it
begins its task. Once the box is stacked, the clockwork box
packer closes the box, if necessary, then ties a ribbon or cord
around it from a supply loaded into the clockwork box packer
in advance. Once the package is secure, the clockwork box
packer stacks it and then swivels back into position, ready
to accept another box. In this way, the clockwork device can
finish within minutes a packing job that might take humanoid
workers an hour.
CLOCKWORK DISGUISE
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Usage worn armor; Bulk 2
Price 200 gp
Sometimes, just disguising one’s face just isn’t convincing
enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement
regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For
example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they
must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers
stationed there—or else have a very good explanation for
their commander as to why they’re out of proper uniform!
The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such
awkward, potentially fatal confrontations.
The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected
to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user’s
torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with
several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide
variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are
arranged and connected, they can be made to look like
almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor,
though armor embellishments such as those worn by highranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement
process takes some time, but once it’s completed, the
user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a
clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate
arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards,
when the user flips a switch on the harness’s belt to one
of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect
as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired
preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up
to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use
a minimum of two: the one required for their current task,
and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the
first configuration is unnecessary.
Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration
requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can
have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time,
and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made
of metal.
The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following
stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:
AC Bonus +2; Dex Cap +3; Check Penalty –1; Strength 12;
Group plate
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect Transform the clockwork
disguise into any one current preset configuration of the
user’s choice.

CLOCKWORK DIVING SUIT
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
AIR
CLOCKWORK
WATER
Usage Worn; Bulk 4
Price 200 gp
The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that
allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time
without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional
magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a
clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better
protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for
characters who prefer more protection. However, they also
come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits
circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed
suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped
bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe.
A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user
to see what’s going on in front of them.
The suit’s rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the
user’s range of movement and keeps them from moving
faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for
this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the
suit’s back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system
and separate air bladder; it’s activated with a simple pull of a
lever on the suit’s belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum
system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder
sprays the water out and propels the user short distances.
This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface
without walking to shore—it’s too heavy to float on its own.
Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back
to the water’s floor.
The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of
operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up
to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of
air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal.
This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an
area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process
that takes 10 minutes to complete.
The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the
following stats:
AC Bonus +4; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty –4; Speed Penalty
–15 ft; Strength 18
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect The diving suit shoots out a
water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight
line. The distance of this movement is unaffected by your
swim Speed, if you have one, or the armor’s Speed penalty.
However, difficult terrain, such as the difficult terrain for
moving up or down or moving against a current, still slows
this movement.

CLOCKWORK MEGAPHONE
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 1
Price 15 gp
A clockwork megaphone uses cunning clockwork gears to
adjust the shape and angle of the cone within the megaphone,
allowing you to raise or lower the volume, widen or contract
the angle in which you project your voice, or both at the same
time. This makes a clockwork megaphone far more useful
than an ordinary megaphone for situations where you want
to make sure that everyone in a particular venue or location
can hear you without being so loud that your voice comes
across as a painful shout. It takes 1 minute to wind up a
clockwork megaphone, which allows it to remain active for up
to 1 hour of adjustments, only counting the time you change
the megaphone’s settings, not the time you spend speaking.
Since it automatically enters standby mode when not in use,
this typically means you don’t have to wind up the clockwork
megaphone for months, or even years, depending on how
often you adjust the settings each day.
DAY GOGGLES
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
Price 30 gp
Usage worn eyepiece; Bulk L
The darkened lenses of these goggles protect sensitive eyes
from bright light but make seeing in the dark more difficult.
While wearing day goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to
saving throws against visual light effects. However, while
wearing the goggles, you take a –2 item penalty to visual
Perception checks and you treat areas of bright light as dim
light and areas of dim light as darkness for the purpose of
whether you can see. While this is normally a disadvantage,
if you have light blindness, you aren’t dazzled in bright light
as long as you continue wearing the day goggles, since to
your eyes, there is only dim light. You can wear the goggles
around your neck or on your forehead, granting no benefits,
but allowing you to move them over your eyes with a single
Interact action, without having to withdraw them first.
ELECTROCABLE
ITEM 3
RARE
ELECTRICITY
FIRE
Price 45 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
This footlong length of conductive cable is capped on both
ends by grounded handles containing Stasian coils. These coils
can be turned on or off as a single action. While on, the coils
electrify the cable, dealing 1d6 electricity and 1d6 fire damage
in a thin precise line to anything the cable touches, though the
cable is too unwieldy to use as a weapon. Electrocables are
typically used to “cut” a thin straight line through metal. They
ignore 10 points of a metal object’s hardness.
EXTENDABLE PINCER

Price 2 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
This extendable rod features a pincer on one end and clamped
handle on the other. By squeezing the handle, the pincer opens
or closes. As an Interact action, you can extend or retract the
rod by 5 feet to one of three settings, allowing you to Interact to
pick up an object with the pincer either within your own space,
in an adjacent space, or exactly 10 feet away.
HEATED CLOAK
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
Price 160 gp
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
This fine cloak is lined with tiny tubes of slowly reacting
alchemical reagents. These chemicals generate heat, which is
circulated throughout the cloak by the wearer’s movements.
While active, the wearer is protected from severe cold. The
cloak offers no protection from extreme or incredible cold. It
operates for 24 hours and can be reset with a simple process
that takes 1 minute.
HOLY STEAM BALL
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
DIVINE
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
GOOD
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Price 30 gp; 2 gp per refill
Activate [one-action] Interact
The holy steam ball is an odd-looking device that’s
nevertheless effective at reinforcing its user’s mind against
fiendish control. It’s a hollow black-rubber ball with small,
flexible twin tubes sticking out from its center. Sealed within
the rubber ball is vapor made from a mixture of evaporated
holy water and a special type of incense smoke. The tube’s
twin prongs are placed into the user’s nostrils, after which
the user squeezes the rubber ball to activate the device,
forcing the vapor into the user’s body through their nose.
The holy power contained within the vapor strengthens the
user’s will against creatures that are weak to holy water,
making it tougher for malevolent creatures to subvert the
user’s mind.
When the holy steam ball was first introduced in Mendev
fifty years ago, few trusted it’s efficacy. The nation had seen
many charlatans peddle so-called “anti-demon” products, and
most thought this was no different. Only when soldiers of the
Mendevian Crusades used the ball and personally testified
to its effectiveness did suspicion gave way to enthusiastic
use. Nobody remembers who first invented the holy steam
ball; they’re likely lost to history because most initially
thought it was a scam. After receiving endorsement from
the Mendevian Crusade, a team of alchemists and inventors
were able to determine the vapor’s exact composition and
mass produce them. The holy steam ball’s highly specialized
purpose kept it from widespread use outside of the nations
that once bordered the Worldwound. Yet with the return of
the Whispering Tyrant in the past few years, the growing
undead threat presents a new opportunity for more citizens
to use holy steam balls for protection against the mind
control powers of vampires and other undead.

================================================================================

After using a holy steam ball, you must refill it before the
next use in a process that takes five minutes to complete.

object within reach.
LIGHT WRITER
ITEM 6
RARE
CLOCKWORK
EVOCATION
LIGHT
Bulk 2
Price 200 gp; 3 gp for 10 metal plates
The light writer is a cutting edge invention,
first created in Absalom in late 4721,
combining magic and clockwork
innovation to allow its operator to
create a true-to-life, monochromatic
portrait of people or a scene over the
course of 20 minutes of exposure.
It consists of two flat metal squares,
one larger than the other, connected
by a tube of leather similar to that found
on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of
the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The
larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on
the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick
connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached
to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on
the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation,
magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady
light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and
projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of
the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed,
allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner
desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be
perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from
appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image
of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature
to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike
blurring of the final image.
MECHANICAL TORCH
ITEM 1
CLOCKWORK
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Powered by electricity, you can turn a mechanical torch on
and off by toggling a lever on the torch with an Interact
action. When active, the torch sheds bright light in either
a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet) or a
40‑foot cone (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Changing
this area requires a single Interact action to flip a switch. The
torch carries sufficient charge to operate for ten minutes.
You can recharge the torch in 1 minute via an integrated
crank-charging mechanism, turning the clockwork gears
and generating sparks to power the torch, though doing so
requires two hands.
NIGHTBREEZE MACHINE
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
AIR
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 125 gp
The nightbreeze machine can turn a scorching hot room into
a comfortable one with just the pull of a lever. Its outer shell
is a brass cube half as tall as the average human
that houses a series of flat metal “blades” in
a circular arrangement. When placed on
a flat surface, a creature within reach can
Interact to flip the lever, turning the machine
on. When the machine is active, the blades
begin to spin rapidly, setting the air in
the room into motion, which cools off
the room’s inhabitants. A front-mounted
metal grate prevents anyone from coming
into accidental contact with the spinning
blades without impeding airflow.
The nightbreeze machine was recently
commissioned by Malduoni, Keeper of the
First Law, leader of the nation of Rahadoum.
He tasked the country’s brightest inventors with creating
devices that would, in his words, “Ensure that no mortal
need fear death from the desert heat.” This machine was the
first creation to come out of this consolidated engineering
effort, but it won’t be the last.
A nightbreeze machine can affect an enclosed area of
no more than 50 feet by 50 feet and has negligible effect
when used in a larger enclosed area or outside. While
active, it reduces the effects of severe heat by one step to
mild heat, and reduces extreme heat to severe heat (Core
Rulebook page 518). A nightbreeze machine isn’t powerful
enough to reduce the effects of incredible heat, though
fortunately such heat isn’t found naturally in the deserts
of Rahadoum. A nightbreeze machine runs for 8 hours,
after which it must be wound in a process that takes 10
minutes to complete. The 8 hours of activity don’t have to
be consecutive.

dangerous magical symbols inscribed upon it, incriminating
legal documents, or just simply paper waste, sometimes you
just need to make sure a document is completely destroyed
in a way that makes it nearly impossible to read afterwards.
Enter the paper shredder, a clockwork device that performs
exactly this function.
With 1 minute of wind-up, a paper shredder can function
for up to 1 hour of shredding, and it automatically enters
standby mode when not in use, meaning the device can
typically go for weeks between wind-ups unless you shred
an exceptionally large volume of paper.
Setting a piece of paper or parchment into the paper
shredder takes a single Interact action, which means you
can shred up to three pages of paper or parchment each
round. If the page is longer than normal, it takes longer
to shred, as determined by the GM. Additionally, only
one person can use the shredder each round, limiting
it to shredding three pages per round regardless of how
many people are available to feed paper into it. The paper
shredders rips and tears the paper or parchment apart into
tiny disjointed strips. This is typically sufficient to destroy
glyphs of warding and other similar dangerous magical
traps on the paper, though the GM might determine that
particularly resilient magical traps find some way to survive
their shredding. If the paper is magically protected or
otherwise has more Hardness than a normal sheet of paper
or parchment, the shredder can’t shred it. After churning
such hardened paper for 1 round, the shredder spits it back
out without harming the shredder. This prevents shredding
any other paper during that round.
PRINTING PRESS
ITEM 9
RARE
CLOCKWORK
Price 600 gp
Bulk 20
The printing press is a revolutionary machine that combines
movable type with a mechanical inking system and screw
press, allowing for the mass production of large volumes
of text. Using the press, a worker can produce up to 3,600
identical pages per day. In order to use the printing press,
you must first set the type for the page you want to print.
Time required to set type varies depending on the number
of characters used; from 1 hour for small pages with brief
text, to 8 hours for a full-sized normal page of text, though
extreme examples may be outside this range. When you
prepare a page for printing, you can include engraved
images in addition to text. No magical properties of text are
transferred in the printing process, so it cannot be used to
mass-produce magical scrolls, glyphs of warding, or similar
spells or magic items.
STEAMFLIGHT PACK
ITEM 15
RARE
CLOCKWORK
STEAM
Usage worn backpack; Bulk 2
Price 6,000 gp
Activate [one-action] Interact
The steamflight pack allows its user to fly without using
magic or wings. Each steamflight pack looks like a large
brass backpack with two large nozzles mounted on the
sides pointing downward. It also features metal arms
reaching around the front that terminate in handles with
activation buttons on them. When the user holds down an
activation button, a complex series of mechanisms pumps
water from the large tank in the backpack and releases it
through the nozzles as powerful jets of steam, enabling the
user to fly short distances. Tilting the handle adjusts the
nozzles’ angles, allowing the user to control the direction
of their flight.
When active, the steamflight pack gives the user a fly
Speed of 20 feet. It carries enough water for 20 minutes of
operation and can be refilled in five minutes with a supply of
normal water and a funnel.

Usage operated with two hands; Bulk 2
This hefty winch is powered by a small steam engine and
includes a 100 ft. length of steel cable, which enables you
to haul a heavier load than you could with a hand cranked
winch or comealong (Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide
114). A steam winch allows you to slowly pull a heavy load
(usually up to 50 Bulk) along a flat surface or up and down
a vertical expanse.
Attaching a steam winch to a device takes three Interact
actions, while starting the winch (and getting it warm
enough to operate) takes 10 minutes. Once in operation,
a steam winch requires regular maintenance to function.
Every twenty minutes, the boiler must be refilled and heat

MOBILITY DEVICES
Over the history of Golarion, countless cultures have used innovative mobility devices.
While you can find more information, as well as several magical mobility devices and
additional add-ons, on page 66 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar, additional
devices appropriate to the themes of invention and innovation can be found in this section.
Wheelchairs
Wheelchairs provide comfort and support when traveling.
You can use the item either in an ambulatory manner or
every day, depending on your character. Wheelchairs come
in a variety of sizes to suit every person regardless of height
or body type. Each wheelchair has the following features.
Adjustable Seat Belts: These belts strap around your
waist, knees, and shins to keep you in the chair if it’s
thrown, knocked or handled roughly. You can open and
release all of your belts with an Interact action.
Bulk Limit: A wheelchair is strong enough to support
you and any amount of Bulk you could typically hold
or carry (Core Rulebook 272). Sum up the Bulk of all
the items you are wearing, carrying, and stowing on your
wheelchair. You take the usual consequences when there
is too much Bulk on you and your wheelchair: if there is
more than 5 + your Strength modifier, you’re encumbered,
and you and your wheelchair can’t hold or carry more
than 10 + your Strength modifier. The wheelchair’s own
Bulk does not count against your Bulk limit while riding
in the wheelchair; it’s listed in case you need to carry the
wheelchair separately.
Frame: A wheelchair is typically made from common
materials like wood. It can also be made from other
materials such as steel, or rarer materials like mithral. The
wheelchairs presented in this section are assumed to be
made from durable wood.
Magic: The wheelchair is considered an extension
of yourself. Spells or abilities that change your bodily
form are also applied to the chair and it transforms

what appearance this has. For example, when you
transform with wild shape, you can choose to have full
mobility of your limbs or have the chair transform to
become a wheelchair appropriate for that shape, such as
wheelchair harnesses for dogs.
Movement: While using a chair, you Stride at your
normal Speed (the Speed listed for your ancestry, with any
additional bonuses, penalties, and adjustments applied).
You propel a wheelchair by using the handrims. You can
propel the wheelchair even while holding something in
your hands, but not if you’ve restrained or otherwise
unable to move your hands freely. You are still affected
by difficult terrain and other terrain features, and any
effect that would immobilize you, give a penalty to your
Speeds, and so on based on entangling or hindering with
your legs applies to the wheelchair as well. You can use
all of your actions while in a wheelchair. The impulse
control add-on allows you to direct a wheelchair with
your fingers or nerve impulses instead.
Quick-Righting: If the chair is tipped or you are
knocked prone while in the chair, you can right yourself
using the Stand action, though in this case you are righting
the wheelchair instead. An ally can use an Interact action
to help right you, allowing you to Stand as a free action
triggered by their Interact action.
WHEELCHAIR TYPES
The following are some of the wheelchair types seen
throughout Golarion.
BASIC CHAIR
ITEM 0

made from interlocking wood pieces, clockwork, or other
devices, that allow the chair to traverse up or down stairs
without any additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still
difficult terrain, just like for other characters), and move
through other such environments that adventurers and
travelers encounter without any additional difficulty, such as
ladders and uneven ground.

VEHICLES
It’s unsurprising that the advances in clockwork technology and the introduction of rare
Stasian and steam technology have led to the creation of many new and revolutionary
vehicles across the world. Some, like the apparatus of the octopus, have existed for
millennia but only recently rose to more wide-spread prevalence.
Vehicles
Included in this section are an array of new vehicles for
use in your game, each of which uses the new technology
described in this chapter, especially clockwork, steam,
and Stasian technology. The full rules for vehicles can
be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide starting
on page 174.
AUTOMATED CYCLE
VEHICLE 1
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 50 gp
This clockwork cycle provides most of its mobility via cogs
and gears, which allow the cycle to move at a reasonable
pace without the need for significant pedaling effort on
the part of the pilot. The pilot uses a system of pedals and
steering to control the speed and direction of the vehicle.
The vehicle comes equipped with two sidecars, one on each
side of the pilot.

CLUNKERJUNKER
VEHICLE 1
UNCOMMON
MEDIUM
Price 30 gp
A favorite of goblins, a clunkerjunker is essentially an
armored cart built out of junk that uses volatile flammable
chemicals, explosions, and alchemical reactions to propel
itself bumpily along. While the initial idea is impressive and
the cost of creating one is surprisingly low, these junkers,
unfortunately, have a strong tendency to malfunction, and
they’re always one bad bump away from disaster.

Collision 2d6 (DC 15)
Fall Apart When this vehicle takes physical damage the pilot
must attempt a DC 11 flat check (or a DC 20 flat check
when it takes a critical hit). On a failure, the armored hull
fractures and the vehicle loses its Hardness and takes a –4
circumstance penalty to AC.
Smog (aura, fire) 10 feet. Whenever this vehicle is being
piloted, it continually emits a thin haze of smoke and
chemicals. Creatures in the aura (including the pilot and
passengers) take a –1 circumstance penalty to visual
Perception checks.
Volatile Flamethrower [three-actions] (fire) The pilot performs a
three‑action activity on their turn to vent alchemical fire
out the sides of this vehicle. This requires three flasks
of minor alchemist’s fire, which the pilot loads into the
vent as part of the activity. The pilot must then attempt
a DC 5 flat check. On a success, creatures adjacent to this
vehicle take 1d8 fire damage (DC 15 basic Reflex save). On
a failure, it backfires, dealing 1d8 fire damage to the pilot
and any passengers, with no save.
PROPULSION
The vehicles in this section use the following new means
of propulsion, in addition to the forms listed in the
Gamemastery Guide.
CLOCKWORK PROPULSION
Powered by the measured release of energy stored in
springs via winding, clockwork propulsion is a fragile
thing of mechanical beauty and wonderous engineering.
Clockwork vehicles can often be piloted with the
Crafting skill.
A clockwork vehicle must be wound to remain
operational. Clockwork vehicles have the Wind-Up
trait, with the specifics listed in its stat block under the
wind‑up ability.
For a clockwork vehicle to move or take other actions,
it must be wound by a creature using a unique key. This
takes the amount of time listed. Once wound, it remains
operational for the listed amount of time, after which
time it becomes inactive and immobile until it’s wound
again. Some clockwork vehicles’ abilities require them
to spend some of their remaining operational time.
They can’t spend more than they have and shut down
immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it’s
unclear when a clockwork vehicle was last wound, most
vehicles are re-wound approximately half-way through
their operating time.
A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode
by its pilot as a 3-action activity. Its operational time
doesn’t decrease in standby.
A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a
clockwork vehicle down (with a DC listed in the wind-up
entry). For each success, the clockwork vehicle loses 10
minutes of operational time. This can be done even if the
clockwork vehicle is in standby mode.
Broken clockwork vehicles have difficulty holding
energy. The first time each round a broken clockwork
vehicle moves, it must make a DC 5 flat check. On a
failure, it loses 10 minutes of operational time.
ELECTRICAL PROPULSION
Electrical power, whether the vehicle uses magical
electricity or the extremely rare new Stasian coil
technology to store electricity without magic, allows for
vehicles that make significantly less disturbance than
some other propulsion methods. Electrical vehicles can
often be piloted with the Crafting skill.

Price 155 gp
A sand diver is a vaguely scorpion-shaped vehicle that uses
alchemical reactions to propel itself. The tail-like structure
acts as a heat sink and releases alchemical fumes behind the
diver as it burrows. Instead of pincers, it has two burrowing
mechanisms in front that allow it to dig through sand.

Shard Trail A sand diver can only burrow through sand,
using the heat and flame from its alchemical core to slowly
dig its way through. The alchemical fumes left behind
become trapped belowground as it Burrows, temporarily
catalyzing fragments of sand into a glass‑like byproduct.
Creatures that Burrow through a space this vehicle has
Burrowed through within the last 24 hours take 1d12
piercing damage from the shards (DC 17 basic Fortitude
save). A creature that continues Burrowing through
a stretch of the same space the sand diver recently
Burrowed through must continue to attempt this save
the first time each round that it Burrows through the
shards.

must attempt a DC 32 Reflex save. On a failure, they are
flat‑footed for 1 round, and on a critical failure, they’re
knocked prone.
CLOCKWORK CASTLE
VEHICLE 16
RARE
GARGANTUAN
Price 30,000 gp
While the name slightly overstates its size, nonetheless a
magical clockwork castle is a sizable mobile fortress built on
ten spiderlike clockwork legs, with three stories of palatial
accommodations within. Legends tell of a unique clockwork
castle massively larger even than this size, perhaps an artifact
in its own right.
Space 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, 35 feet high
Crew 1 pilot, 2 crew; Passengers 10
Piloting Check Driving Lore (DC 35),
Arcana (DC 39), or Crafting (DC
37)
Wind-Up 10 minutes of wind-up,
1 hour of operational time, DC 35,
standby
AC 36; Fort +28
Hardness 20; HP 250 (BT 125);
Immunities object immunities
Speed 40 feet (clockwork, magical)
Collision 11d10 (DC 35)
Environmental
Protections
This
vehicle’s interior temperature is magically
maintained. Creatures inside this vehicle
are protected from severe cold, severe heat,
extreme cold, and extreme heat.
Luxurious Accommodations This vehicle contains a bridge,
engineering room, private sleeping quarters for up to 13
creatures, and four additional rooms (typically a dining
room, kitchen, lavatory, and meeting room).
Maneuverable This vehicle is mounted on ten spider-like legs
that enable it to turn swiftly, turn in place, and even move
backward. Each 90-degree turn made in less than a vehicle
length costs 5 extra feet of movement; so, for example, it
costs 10 feet of movement for the vehicle to turn around
and begin moving backward. This vehicle loses these
benefits when broken.
Skewering Step [three-actions] (attack) Two crew members each
perform a 3-action activity on their turn to skewer nearby
enemies with the clockwork castle’s legs. All creatures
under or adjacent to the vehicle at the end of the second
character’s turn take 7d8 piercing damage (DC 35 basic
Reflex save).
Weapon Mounts This vehicle has four rooftop weapon mounts;
one mount on each corner of the vehicle. At purchase, these
weapon mounts are initially empty. Installing or uninstalling
a weapon into a weapon mount requires 10 minutes, a
successful DC 35 Crafting check, and an appropriate
weapon. Three of these weapon mounts can be equipped
with ranged weapons, and the fourth can be equipped with
a ranged siege weapon of size Large or smaller.
VONTHOS’S GOLDEN BRIDGE
VEHICLE 17
UNIQUE
LARGE
Price 50,000 gp
Crafted by the wizard Vonthos as part of his bid to attempt
the Test of the Starstone in Absalom, this strange vehicle
is considered to be a magical and technological marvel.
Vonthos’s Golden Bridge is a flying sphere made out of a
throne surrounded by several clockwork rings covered in gold
and gems infused with powerful adaptive abjurations that
grant it unique abilities.
Space 9 feet long, 9 feet wide, 9 feet high
Crew 1 pilot
Piloting Check Driving Lore (DC 36) or Arcana
(DC 38)
AC 39; Fort +29

Wealth
(aura,
enchantment, magic, mental,

and other embellishments that adorn
this flying sphere emit a sparkling
resplendence
capable
of
enthralling
creatures. Each creature that begins its turn
within the aura must attempt a DC 36 Will
save; on a failure, the creature is fascinated and stupefied
2 for as long as it remains within the aura. A creature that
succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour. Each time
Prismatic Defense is activated, the area of Captivating
Wealth is reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour, to a minimum of
0 feet.
Protective Barrier While the swirling rings of the vehicle
don’t fully cover the pilot, they offer incredible protection,
magically maintaining the temperature within and ablating
physical attacks. The pilot is protected from severe cold,
severe heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. The pilot
also gains resistance 10 to all physical damage (except
adamantine).
Prismatic Defense [one-action] (abjuration, magical) The pilot harnesses
power from the magical gemstones hidden among this
vehicle’s extravagant embellishments to grant the vehicle
additional defenses. This vehicle gains resistance 20 to one
of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity,
fire, force, or sonic. This immunity lasts until Prismatic
Defense is next activated.

GUNS CHARACTERS
I never liked hurting people. As a shield marshal, I knew my duty and kept my arquebus,
Alessandra, in top condition. But if I had the choice, I would have been a spotter. I tried
not to think too much about all the monsters we put down.
When I retired, I took my pension, gun, and family away from it all. Bought a farm. Buried
Alessandra in a sealed box under an old tree. This far from Alkenstar, few even know what a
gun is. The ones who do aren’t the kind of people you want knowing you have one. At least,
that’s what I told myself. Believed it too, right up until the bandits took everything from me.
I don’t know how long I laid in that pool of blood. All I remember is the sounds of
screaming, the snarling faces, and the smell of smoke. When I woke up, the farm and my
family were gone. So I crawled. I crawled to that old tree and dug in the dirt with my
bare hands until I uncovered the chest. I fumbled open the clasp and found Alessandra,
wrapped in leather and treated with oil, my shield marshal uniform folded neatly
underneath. Didn’t fit my battered body as well as Alessandra fit my hands, but it’d do.
The last thing out of the chest was my bandolier, loaded with a dozen cartridges. Fired
the first one, just to make sure the powder hadn’t spoiled. Eleven shots left, but that was
fine. There were only nine bandits. I’d faced monsters, desperadoes, and even a mutant
dragon. Nine murderous fools weren’t going to stand a chance against me and Alessandra.

GUNSLINGER
While most people can fire a gun or
crossbow, a gunslinger knows such
weapons better than anyone. From
reloading to customization, a gunslinger
demands more from their weapons,
though demanding too much can result in
a misfire. Gunslingers remain unrivaled in their
skill and accuracy with weapons that strike hard from afar.
NHALMIKA IRONSIGHT
Born and raised in Dongun Hold,
Nhalmika served as a skilled
vanguard for many years. Upon
retiring after the death of her spouse,
Nhalmika took the scattergun that had
served her so well during her service
and started a new chapter as an adventurer,
cheered on by her children.
Several regions on Golarion have developed their own
versions of firearms, their cultural and intellectual
traditions each shaping how these weapons are
beginning to spread throughout the globe. While
multiple cultures having their own techniques and
signature styles, guns are still incredibly scarce
worldwide. Despite their rarity, rifles and pistols
loom large in tales told throughout the Inner Sea,
thanks to the chronicles of the Pathfinder Society and
stories spread by other adventurers who have come
into contact with guns in battle or traveled through a
region where they are used. The following regions have
access to firearms.
Perhaps the most famous home for black powder
firearms on Golarion is the grand duchy of Alkenstar
(page 195). Located on the continent of Garund, this
primarily human duchy, along with their neighbors, the
dwarven sky citadel of Dongun Hold (page 190) produce
black powder and high-quality firearms, continually
perfecting their craft and supplementing the art of
gunsmithing with ancillary technologies like scopes for
long-distance sniping. For many years, Alkenstar and
Dongun Hold were the only reliable sources of firearms
found in the Inner Sea, but the ingenuity of the pirates
of the Shackles (page 217) has introduced a competing
market for those looking to acquire a black powder
weapon. Buyers must beware however, as the weapons
produced in the Shackles lack the quality and reliability
of firearms produced on the opposite side of Garund.
Alkenstar is a good place to encounter adventurers who
wield high-quality equipment, such as sniping duos or
demolitionists, while the Shackles is known for being
home to many types of pistol phenoms, who remain
quick to draw and fire at a moment’s notice.
The continent Tian Xia and the subcontinent Vudra
(page 220), have also traded in black powder for centuries,
though in relatively small amounts, with a focus more on
explosives than firearms. Nonetheless, merchants making
the cross‑continent trek from the trade ports in Tian Xia
on the eastern side of the continent to the Qadiran ports
far to the west will occasionally hire guards armed with
jezails or Tian mercenaries bearing hand cannons and
fire lances from their homelands. The demolitionist and
fireworks technician archetypes are relatively popular in
Tian Xia and Vudra due to the continents’ extremely long
histories with those uses of black powder.
On the western continent of Arcadia (page 206),
firearm technology has become more common and
more diverse than anywhere else in the world. That said,
firearms that use black powder are a substantially new
development in this region, having only recently been
smuggled halfway across the world from Alkenstar.
Instead, Arcadia is home to several of its own
distinct traditions of firearms, from beast guns, created
through ritualized hunts against mighty monsters
using magical taxidermic techniques, to the legendary
magical star guns that predated the apocalypse of
Earthfall. Aside from beast guns and magical guns
constructed to imitate the legendary star guns, the core
of basic firearms in Arcadia has been based on air gun
technology for centuries.
The most notable region of Arcadia to produce firearms
and firearm wielders is the central basin known as the
Deadshot Lands, which is also home to the few regions in
Arcadia that are beginning to use black powder firearms
in tandem with the traditional Arcadian arsenal. The
beast gunner archetype is a perfect match for Arcadian
characters focused on connecting with the magic of
their beast gun, and the spellshot class archetype is an
excellent fit with the storied Arcadian tradition of using
magical firearms. In this way, Arcadia is home to some
of the most diverse and magical traditions of gunslingers
in the world.

GUNSLINGER
While some fear projectile weapons, you savor the searing flash, wild kick,
and cloying smoke that accompanies a gunshot, or snap of the cable and
telltale thunk of your crossbow just before your bolt finds purchase. Ready
to draw a bead on an enemy at every turn, you rely on your reflexes, steady
hand, and knowledge of your weapons to riddle your foes with holes.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You strike from range with your firearms, seeking to defeat your opponents
before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you
might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever
realize you’re there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or
glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end
the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You
might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention
when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something’s amiss.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You scout the group’s position for incoming threats and help search for secret
doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.
IN DOWNTIME...
You might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and
maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents,
such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You
might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence
that lingers between gunfights.
YOU MIGHT...
• Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can
help build your reputation.
• Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to
keep you safe.
• Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and
ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
• Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand
how to resolve other mechanical challenges.
• Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because
you lack any other skills.
• Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a gunslinger. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to those from your class at 1st level, you have
the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
GUNSLINGER’S WAY
All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a
combination of philosophy and combat style that defines
both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At
1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique
reload action called a slinger’s reload, and proficiency
with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater
deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.
The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108.
The following ways are presented in this book.
Way of the Drifter: You wander across the battlefield,
equally at home in and out of the fray.
Way of the Pistolero: You carefully maintain your
distance at a duelist’s 10 paces with pistol in hand.
Way of the Sniper: You practice a methodical style of
shooting, striking from far cover.
Way of the Vanguard: You rely on a brutal combat
style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.
GUNSLINGER FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
gunslinger class feat.
SINGULAR EXPERTISE
You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows
that grants you greater proficiency with them and the
ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.
This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents
you from reaching the same heights with other weapons.
Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with
weapons other than firearms and crossbows can’t be
higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would
increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons
to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the
weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have
gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you
have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you
gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
STUBBORN
3RD
You don’t like being told what to do, and you don’t
give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases
to expert. When you fail, but don’t critically fail, a Will
save against an effect that would give you the controlled
condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect

at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save,
the controlled condition ends, though any other effects
remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn’t allow
you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
GUNSLINGER WEAPON MASTERY
5TH
You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique
weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master
with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your
proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows,
simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
increases to expert. You gain access to the critical
specialization effects for firearms and crossbows.
VIGILANT SENSES
7TH
Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
for Perception increases to master.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
7TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
ADVANCED DEED
9TH
You’ve learned a powerful new technique of your chosen
way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you
chose at 1st level.
GUNSLINGER EXPERTISE
9TH
Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict
or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class
DC increases to expert.
EVASION
11TH
You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions,
dragon’s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
GUNSLINGING LEGEND
13TH
You’ve learned unique techniques for wielding firearms
and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in a number of
gunslinger abilities.
Flourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too
much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You
can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Misfire: Firearms that are improperly maintained or
subjected to unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt
to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or
earlier and hasn’t been cleaned since, roll a DC 5 flat
check before making your attack roll. If you fail this
misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams. The attack
is an automatic critical failure, and you must use an
Interact action to clear the jam before the weapon can
be reloaded and fired again. Once you’ve spent at least
an hour cleaning a weapon, you don’t need to roll for a
misfire until the next day unless an effect says otherwise.
You can clean multiple firearms during this hour, up to a
reasonable limit as determined by the GM (typically no
more than five).
Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as a part of
their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an
attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed
attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a
critical failure.
Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple
and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with
advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank
for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed
attacks increases to expert.
MEDIUM ARMOR EXPERTISE
13TH
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
GREATER DEED
15TH
You’ve mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen
way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you
chose at 1st level.
GREATER WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
15TH
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
JUGGERNAUT
17TH
Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a
Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
SHOOTIST’S EDGE
17TH
You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency

================================================================================
PAGE 109

way grants a series of deeds, access to feats, proficiency
with a skill, and a special reload action, all of which help
shape and influence the way you affect the battlefield.
The ways available to all gunslingers are described below.
WAY OF THE DRIFTER
You’re a wanderer traveling from land to land with your
gun and a melee weapon as company. Maybe you learned
to fight with blade and pistol as a Shackles pirate, mastered
the hand cannon and katana in Minkai, or practiced with
a hatchet and clan pistol in Dongun Hold. You win battles
by relying on mobility and flexible use of your weapons.

15th
DRIFTER’S WAKE [three-actions]
GUNSLINGER
You drift across the battlefield, striking down foes as you
go. You Stride, and you can Strike up to three times at any
points during your movement. Each attack must target a
different enemy and must be made with a one-handed firearm,
crossbow, melee weapon, or unarmed attack. Each attack
counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until you’ve made all your
attacks. Your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
WAY OF THE PISTOLERO
Whether you’re a professional duelist or a pistol-twirling
entertainer, you have quick feet and quicker hands that
never seem to let you down, and an equally sharp wit and
tongue that jab your foes. You might leave a hand free or
cultivate the ambidexterity for twin weapons. Either way,
you stay close enough to your enemies to leverage your
superior reflexes while leaving enough space to safely fire.

You attempt to clear the room by promising a grim fate to
anyone who doesn’t do what you say, and quickly. Attempt a
Deception or Intimidation check against the Will DCs of each
creature within 30 feet, except for your allies. Regardless
of whether you succeed or fail, each subject is temporarily
immune to your Grim Swagger for 10 minutes.
For example, if you attempt a Deception check, you lie
and boast about your prowess or the large group of friends
on their way to back you up. If you attempt an Intimidation
check, you promise everyone in the room that you’re going to
be the last thing they see.
Critical Success The creature becomes frightened 3. If it’s
lower level than you, it’s also fleeing for 1 round.
Success The creature becomes frightened 2.
WAY OF THE SNIPER

attempt to Hide, then Interact to reload. As normal, you must
meet the requirements to Take Cover or Hide; you must be
INTERACTING TO RELOAD
The slinger’s reload action from each gunslinger way, as
well as many feats, give the ability to Interact to reload
a weapon. This is enough to reload a weapon that takes
1 Interact action to reload, but only provides one of the
Interact actions needed to reload a weapon with reload
2 or greater. As normal, you can provide the remaining
Interact actions separately.

to Take Cover, and you need to be benefiting from cover or
concealed to a creature to Hide from that creature.
Initial Deed
ONE SHOT, ONE KILL [free-action]
GUNSLINGER
Trigger You roll Stealth for initiative.
Your first shot is the deadliest. Interact to draw a firearm
or crossbow. On your first turn, your first Strike with that
weapon deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This
precision damage increases to 2d6 at 9th level and 3d6 at
15th level.
Advanced Deed
9th
VITAL SHOT [two-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces
a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is
flat‑footed, the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage,
and the foe takes persistent bleed damage equal to the
amount of precision damage from your One Shot, One Kill.
Greater Deed
15th
GHOST SHOT [one-action]
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you’re hidden from
or undetected by the target, the Strike adds the additional
precision damage from One Shot, One Kill; if you would
already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the
effects aren’t cumulative. If you were undetected or unnoticed
by any creatures, you’re now hidden from them instead, as the
origin of the attack is clear.
WAY OF THE VANGUARD
You practice a unique combat style originated by dwarven
siege engineers, using heavy weapons with wide attack
areas to blast holes through enemy lines, clear an opening
for your allies, and defend the conquered territory.

Slinger’s Reload
CLEAR A PATH [one-action]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a two-handed firearm or
two‑handed crossbow.
You push outward with your weapon to clear some space
before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an Athletics
check to Shove an opponent within your reach using your
weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don’t
need a free hand, and you add the weapon’s item bonus on
attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action
was a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple
attack penalty as that Strike for the Shove; the Shove still
counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks
as normal.
Initial Deed
LIVING FORTIFICATION [free-action]
GUNSLINGER
Trigger You roll initiative.
You can posture defensively with firearms or crossbows, acting
like a walking tower. Interact to draw a firearm or crossbow. You
then position that weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC until the start of your first turn, or a +2 circumstance
bonus if the chosen weapon has the parry trait.
Advanced Deed
9th
SPINNING CRUSH [three-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or loaded
crossbow.
You go into a vicious spin, smashing your weapon into those
nearby and increasing your momentum by firing. All creatures
adjacent to you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus your
Strength modifier; this increases to 2d6 if your firearm has a
striking rune, 3d6 if it has a greater striking rune, and 4d6 if
it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other
effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as
weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must
attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is
also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.
Greater Deed
15th
SIEGEBREAKER [two-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a firearm that has the kickback
or scatter trait, or a two-handed crossbow.

firearm or crossbow against an adjacent target. This Strike
deals an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage and ignores 10
points of the target’s Hardness (if any), or of their shield’s
Hardness if the target uses Shield Block.
After the Strike, you become immobilized and position the
required weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus
to AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the chosen weapon has
the parry trait. Both effects last until the start of your next
turn. If a force would move you while you’re immobilized in
this way, it must succeed at an appropriate check against your
class DC.

prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
BLAST LOCK [one-action]
FEAT 1
ATTACK
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
Sometimes taking the shortest distance between two points
involves removing an obstacle or two. You shoot your firearm
at a lock within 10 feet. Make an attack roll against the DC
required to Pick the Lock.
Critical Success You open the lock, or you achieve two
successes toward opening a complex lock.
Success You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward
opening a complex lock.
Failure You fail to open the lock, and your shot makes it harder
to open. Future attempts to Pick the Lock or Blast the Lock

it much harder to open. Future attempts to Pick the Lock or
Blast the Lock take a –4 circumstance penalty.
COVER FIRE [one-action]
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Frequency once per round
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing
foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a firearm or
crossbow Strike; the target must decide before you roll your
attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks,
it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or
a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a
–2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of
its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that Strike.
CROSSBOW CRACK SHOT
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
You have a deep understanding of the crossbow. When you’re
wielding a crossbow and Interact to reload it, including
Interact actions as part of your slinger’s reload and similar
effects, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll
on your next Strike with that crossbow. As normal, this isn’t
cumulative with the +1 circumstance bonus from singular
expertise. If the crossbow is a simple crossbow, also increase
the damage die size for that attack by one step. You must
make the attack before the end of your turn or these benefits
are lost.
DUAL-WEAPON RELOAD [one-action]
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding two one-handed weapons, each
in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to
reload while holding two weapons. You Interact to reload
a one‑handed ranged weapon you’re holding. Unlike most
Interact actions, you don’t need a free hand to reload your
ranged weapon in this way.
HIT THE DIRT! [reaction]
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Trigger A creature you can see attempts a ranged Strike
against you.
You fling yourself out of harm’s way. You Leap. Your movement
gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering
attack. Regardless of whether or not the triggering attack hits,
you land prone after completing your Leap.
MUNITIONS CRAFTER
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Bullets and bombs can be scarce in some parts, so you’ve
learned to make your own. You become trained in Crafting
and gain the alchemist’s infused reagents class feature (Core
Rulebook 72), gaining a number of reagents each day equal to
your level. You also gain the Alchemical Crafting feat and four
additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items.
You gain infused reagents (a pool of reagents usable to make
alchemical items) and advanced alchemy (allowing you to make
alchemical items during your daily preparations without the
normal cost or time expenditure). You gain batches of infused
reagents per day equal to your level, which you can use to
create only bombs or alchemical ammunition. Your advanced
alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn’t increase on
its own. If you use a batch of infused reagents to create basic
level-0 ammunition such as black powder cartridges or black
powder doses, you produce 10 rounds of ammunition.
SWORD AND PISTOL
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
You’re comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand
and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks
with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful
ranged Strike against an enemy within your reach with your
one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is
flat-footed against your next melee attack with a one-handed
melee weapon.
When you make a successful melee Strike against an enemy
with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged Strike
you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or
one-handed crossbow doesn’t trigger reactions that would
trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as
Attack of Opportunity. Either of these benefits is lost if not
used by the end of your next turn.
2ND LEVEL
DEFENSIVE ARMAMENTS
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
You use bulky firearms or crossbows to shield your body

================================================================================
PAGE 113
================================================================================

from your foes’ attacks. Any two-handed firearms and

appropriate weapon already has the parry trait, increase the
circumstance bonus to AC it grants when used to parry from
+1 to +2.
FAKE OUT [reaction]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
VISUAL
Trigger An ally is about to use an action that requires an
attack roll, targeting a creature within your weapon’s first
range increment.
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
With a skilled flourish of your weapon, you force an enemy to
acknowledge you as a threat. Make an attack roll to Aid the
triggering attack. If you dealt damage to that enemy with the
same weapon since the start of your last turn, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to this roll.
PISTOL TWIRL [one-action]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites trained in Deception
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed ranged
weapon.
Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your
opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks.
You Feint against an opponent within the required weapon’s
first range increment, rather than an opponent within melee
reach. If you succeed, the foe is flat-footed against your melee
and ranged attacks, rather than only your melee attacks. On
a critical failure, you’re flat-footed against the target’s melee
and ranged attacks, rather than only its melee attacks.
QUICK DRAW [one-action]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
You draw your weapon and attack with the same motion. You
Interact to draw a weapon, then Strike with that weapon.
RISKY RELOAD [one-action]
FEAT 2
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a firearm.
You’ve practiced a technique for rapidly reloading your
firearm, but attempting to use this technique is a dangerous
gamble with your firearm’s functionality. Interact to reload
a firearm, then make a Strike with that firearm. If the Strike
fails, the firearm misfires.
WARNING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
Who needs words when the roar of a gun is so much more
succinct? You attempt to Demoralize a foe by firing your
weapon into the air, using the firearm’s maximum range rather
than the usual range of 30 feet. This check doesn’t take the
–4 circumstance penalty if the target doesn’t share a language
with you.
4TH LEVEL
ALCHEMICAL SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You have an alchemical bomb worn or in one
hand, and are wielding a firearm or crossbow in the other.
You’ve practiced a technique for mixing alchemical bombs
with your loaded shot. You Interact to retrieve the bomb
(if it’s not already in your hand) and pour its contents onto
your ammunition, consuming the bomb. Next, Strike with
your firearm. The Strike deals damage of the same type as
the bomb (for instance, fire damage for alchemist’s fire),
and it deals an additional 1d6 persistent damage of the
same type as the bomb. If the Strike is a failure, you take
1d6 damage of the same type as the bomb you used, and
the firearm misfires.
The persistent damage increases to 2d6 if the bomb is 11th
level or higher, or 3d6 if it’s 17th level or higher.
BLACK POWDER BOOST [one-action] OR [two-actions]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
You fire your weapon as you jump, using the kickback to go
farther. You Leap and discharge your firearm to add a +10-foot
status bonus to the distance traveled. If you spend 2 actions
for Black Powder Boost, you High Jump or Long Jump instead.
Special An ability that allows you to High Jump or Long Jump
as a single action (like the Quick Jump skill feat) lets you use
Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.
INSTANT BACKUP [reaction]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Trigger Your attack with a firearm misfires.
Even as your firearm misfires, you quickly draw a backup
weapon. Release the misfired weapon if you so choose, and
Interact to draw a one-handed weapon.
PAIRED SHOTS [two-actions]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding two weapons, each of which
can be either a loaded one-handed firearm or loaded
one‑handed crossbow.
Your shots hit simultaneously. Make two Strikes, one with each
of your two ranged weapons, each using your current multiple
attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target.
If both attacks hit, combine their damage and then add
any applicable effects from both weapons. You add any
precision damage, only once, to the attack of your choice.
Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances
and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when
calculating your multiple attack penalty.
RUNNING RELOAD [one-action]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
You can reload your weapon on the move. You Stride, Step, or
Sneak, then Interact to reload.

penalty, but you don’t apply the multiple attack penalty until
after making both attacks.
10TH LEVEL
CALLED SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
You target a specific area of your foe’s anatomy to debilitating
effect. Declare a part of your foe’s anatomy to target and make
a ranged weapon Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target
takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you
targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline
when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy—for instance,
applying the “arms” effect to a creature’s tentacles if those are
what the creature uses to attack.
• Arms The target is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next
turn. On a critical hit, it’s also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
• Head The target is stupefied 2 until the end of your next
turn. On a critical hit, it’s also stupefied 1 for 1 minute.
• Legs The target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its
Speeds until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it
also takes a –5-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.

falls 20 feet, or 40 feet on a critical hit. The fall is gradual
enough that if the target hits the ground, it takes no
damage from the fall.
DEFLECTING SHOT [reaction]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An ally within the first range increment of your firearm
or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You’re always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon
or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The
ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the
triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the
attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 will make
a sufficient difference.
PENETRATING FIRE [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You blast a bullet through one foe and into another. Choose two
targets, one of which would give the other lesser cover against
your ranged attacks. Make a single ranged Strike with the
required weapon against both targets. This attack ignores any
lesser cover the nearer target provides the other. Roll damage
only once and apply it to each creature you hit. Penetrating Fire
counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty.
PRECIOUS MUNITIONS
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Munitions Machinist
You mix flecks of precious materials you’ve gathered on
your journeys into your custom bullets to bring out those
properties in your temporary ammunition. You can use
advanced alchemy to create standard-grade adamantine, cold
iron, or silver ammunition, spending 1 batch of reagents per
piece of ammunition. At 15th level, you can create high‑grade
adamantine, cold iron, or silver ammunition.
REBOUNDING ASSAULT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or loaded
crossbow in one hand and a bludgeoning or slashing melee
weapon in the other.
You hurl your melee weapon at an opponent, then fire a bullet
into the weapon’s hilt, making it deal additional damage and
bounce back to your grasp. Make a thrown ranged Strike with
the melee weapon, then a ranged Strike with your firearm.
Both Strikes use the same multiple attack penalty. If the melee

================================================================================
PAGE 117
================================================================================

weapon doesn’t already have the thrown trait, it gains the thrown 10 feet trait during
a Rebounding Assault.
If both attacks are successful, the bolt or bullet hits the thrown melee weapon instead
of your target, adding its force into one attack. Combine the damage from both Strikes,
using the thrown weapon’s damage type, and add an additional 1d6 precision damage.
The impact sends the melee weapon rebounding off the target and back to your hand.
In any circumstance other than both attacks hitting, carry out the individual Strikes
normally. The thrown weapon doesn’t rebound and remains in the target’s space as
normal for thrown weapons.
REDIRECTING SHOT [reaction]
FEAT 10
FORTUNE
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An ally misses with a ranged attack that uses a thrown weapon or
ammunition. The ally must be willing to accept your assistance, you must see the
attack’s target, and the attack’s target must be within the first range increment of
your firearm or crossbow.
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
Seeing your ally’s attack about to go astray, you fire your weapon to right its course.
Discharge your firearm and roll a d20. Your ally uses this roll instead of their own,
and the attack ignores bonuses the target would gain against the attack from lesser
or standard cover.
TRICK SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.
You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a Strike with your firearm
against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level (Core Rulebook 504). On a success,
instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your
target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different
AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn’t a valid option, such as using the
explosive barrel option when there’s no such object on the battlefield. The GM should
inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained
eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.
• Dislodge Object Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2
Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For
example, the weapon could knock a wizard’s crystal ball off a table.
• Explosive Barrel Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile
alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other
explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the
area take 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The
damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the
damage by 1d6 for every 2 levels you have above 10th.
TWIN SHOT KNOCKDOWN [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded crossbow or loaded firearm in each hand.
You fire at an enemy while targeting a part of its anatomy that will disrupt its
balance. Make two Strikes against the same target, one with each of the required

and reduces the flat check for the hidden condition from 11
to 5.
DEADEYE [one-action]
FEAT 12
CONCENTRATION
GUNSLINGER
You relax your eyes, taking in the smallest movements of
objects, stirring of grass and leaves, and other signs of the
presence of hidden things, granting you the ability to locate
invisible creatures. Until the start of your next turn, you can
see invisible creatures and objects as silhouettes defined by
the movement of air, slight depressions in the ground, and
other tells that less-keen eyes would overlook, which makes
them merely concealed from you.
FLESH WOUND [one-action]
FEAT 12
GUNSLINGER
You fire to ensure that even if your shot doesn’t land cleanly, it
still lands close enough to deal some damage. Make a ranged
Strike. It gains the following effect on a failure (though not a
critical failure).
Failure Though your attack misses, it still deals one die of
damage plus any damage from your weapon specialization
class feature. This uses your weapon’s normal damage die
and damage type. This attack doesn’t add extra damage
from any other sources or abilities.
RICOCHET SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 12
CONCENTRATE
GUNSLINGER
You bounce your shot off a nearby surface to strike your
opponent from an unexpected angle. When determining
whether a target has cover from your ranged attack with a
firearm or crossbow, you can choose one solid surface within
your weapon’s first range increment to ricochet your shot off
of. If you do, you determine the target’s cover from the point
where you ricochet your shot instead of from you.
SHATTERING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 12
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or loaded
crossbow and are wearing or holding an alchemical bomb.
You fling a bomb into the air and then shoot it with your gun
before it falls, raining destruction down over a wide area. If
necessary, you Interact to draw the bomb and regrip your
weapon. You throw your bomb to the corner of a square within
your firearm’s first range increment and shoot it with your
firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot burst of the bomb take the
bomb’s normal damage with a basic Reflex save against your
class DC. They don’t take any splash or persistent damage the
bomb would deal normally.
SHOOTER’S CAMOUFLAGE
FEAT 12
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You specialize in blending into a particular type of environment,
able to disappear after taking your shot. Choose either natural
or urban terrain. In the chosen terrain, you can Hide and Sneak
even without cover or being concealed.
UNSHAKABLE GRIT
FEAT 12
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Grit and Tenacity
You’ve become hardened by conflict after everything you’ve
faced, and you possess a certain intractable stubbornness. If
the reroll granted to you by your Grit and Tenacity reaction
is a success, you get a critical success instead; if it’s a critical
failure, you get a failure instead.
14TH LEVEL
BLAST TACKLE [two-actions]
FEAT 14
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites way of the vanguard
Requirements You’re wielding a two-handed crossbow or a
firearm that has the kickback or scatter trait.
You throw yourself at an enemy, bracing your weapon
against it and pulling it close before releasing a destructive

both hands, you Release one hand to do so. If your Grapple
succeeds, you can immediately Strike the target of the Grapple
with the required weapon, even if it’s a two-handed weapon
you’re holding in one hand. This Strike deals an additional 3d6
precision damage.
As long the creature remains grabbed or restrained, you
can use just one hand to reload the weapon and Strike that
creature with it.
COME AT ME!
FEAT 14
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Pistolero’s Challenge
You’re a legendary duelist, welcoming all challengers, enabling
you to challenge many foes even while other challenges are
active. There is no longer a limit to the number of Pistolero’s
Challenges you can have in effect at one time.
DANCE OF THUNDER [three-actions]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
GUNSLINGER
Frequency once per minute
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow
and are not fatigued.
Your steps echo with the thunderous retort of exploding
black powder as you dance a dance of death. Take any of the
following actions you choose in any order: Step, Strike against
a target within your firearm’s first range increment, and
Interact to reload. If you attempted a Strike and it succeeded,
you can repeat these three actions again in any order. If you
attempted a Strike in the second set and succeeded, you can
repeat the actions one last time.
After using Dance of Thunder, you become fatigued for
1 minute.

DISRUPTIVE BLUR
FEAT 14
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites way of the drifter
You use cacophonous blasts from your gun or distracting shots from your crossbow
to cause momentary diversions, letting you move about the battlefield with impunity.
After you make a Strike with a firearm or crossbow, creatures can’t take reactions
that would be triggered by your movement for the rest of your turn.
HEADSHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATION
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites way of the sniper
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You attempt to finish your target with a final, well-placed shot. Make a crossbow or
firearm Strike. If you’ve damaged the target within the last minute with the same
weapon and you get a critical success on your attack roll, the target must succeed at
a Fortitude save against your class DC or die; this is a death and incapacitation effect.
A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 day. Creatures with no head
(such as dullahans or oozes) are immune to this ability, and creatures with redundant
heads (such as ettins) might survive the destruction of a head.
SHOWSTOPPER
FEAT 14
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Pistol Twirl, master in Deception
Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that’s difficult to look away from.
When using Pistol Twirl to Feint, you can target all enemies within your weapon’s

GUNSLINGER
You’re especially talented at striking your enemies in their most vulnerable areas.
When you critically hit with a fatal firearm, you deal an additional die of the
appropriate size and damage type for the fatal trait after doubling the weapon’s
damage. For example, after getting a critical hit with a fatal d12
weapon, you add an additional 1d12 damage to the
attack after doubling its damage.
HAIR TRIGGER
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites initial deed that allows you to Interact to draw a weapon
No one can react faster than you can pull your trigger. When using your initial deed,
instead of Interacting to draw a weapon, you can Strike with a firearm or crossbow
you’re already wielding. If this Strike hits, the target is also flat-footed until the end
of your first turn of the encounter.
Special If your initial deed allows you to Interact to draw a weapon more than
once, this feat allows you to replace one of these Interact actions and use the other
one to draw a weapon. You can’t replace both Interact actions with Strikes, but you
SAMPLE GUNSLINGER
SNIPER
You favor long-range guns and
powerful shots taken while hiding at a
safe distance.
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Dexterity. Wisdom can
improve your Perception and make

can draw a loaded firearm or crossbow with one of the actions
and immediately shoot it with the other.
INSTANT RETURN [reaction]
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An enemy misses you with a ranged attack using a
type of ammunition appropriate to your weapon (a bullet if
you’re wielding a firearm).
Requirements You’re wielding an unloaded firearm or
crossbow.
With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the
air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker.
Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make
a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering
opponent. Since you’re using the foe’s ammunition, this Strike
applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for
instance, if it was explosive ammunition, it would explode in a
burst of fire if your Strike hits).
RICOCHET MASTER
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Ricochet Shot
You have an eye for angles and can find shots that others
believe are impossible. When using Ricochet Shot, you can
bounce your bullet off up to two solid surfaces within your
weapon’s first range increment instead of just one.
In addition, a creature is flat-footed the first time you attack
it with a Ricochet Shot during an encounter.
18TH LEVEL
FINAL SHOT [three-actions]
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding an unloaded firearm.
You jam a triple charge of black powder into your weapon to
unleash a devastating but risky and inaccurate attack. Interact
to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition
to your normal black powder or ammunition, then Strike with
your firearm against a creature within the weapon’s first
range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a
critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires.
Regardless of your roll, after the attack you’re flat-footed until
the start of your next turn and stunned 1.
PIERCING CRITICAL
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Your attacks with your preferred weapons deal especially
devastating wounds. When you Strike with a firearm or
crossbow for which you have legendary proficiency, you
critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die, as long as that
result is a success.
UNERRING SHOT
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Your senses are finely tuned to the slightest variations in
the air, so much that you can place your shot exactly where
you intend to aim it from any range possible with your
weapon. When attacking with a ranged weapon in which
you have master or greater proficiency, ignore the penalty
from its range increment. (The weapon’s maximum range is
unchanged.) In addition, if your target has cover against your
attack with such a weapon, it doesn’t gain the bonus to AC
if it has lesser cover, gets only the bonus of lesser cover if
it has standard cover, or gains only the bonus of standard
cover if it has greater cover.
REACH FOR THE STARS
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Black Powder Boost
The sky’s the limit, as long as you’ve got enough black powder.
When you use Black Powder Boost, you can expend additional
black powder or ammunition to boost yourself farther. For
each dose of black powder or piece of firearm ammunition you
spend in addition to your shot, you add another 10 feet to the
height or distance of your Leap, to a maximum of 5 boosts (a
+50-foot status bonus). You must be wearing a dose of black
powder or piece of ammunition, or have it in hand, to detonate
it for a boost.
You can choose at which points in your Leap you detonate
each boost, allowing you to change direction each time. You
must then move in a straight line until you boost again or end
your Leap.
20TH LEVEL
PERFECT READINESS
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
You prepare to fire with an instinctive speed and muscle
memory that go beyond your conscious thoughts. You’re
permanently quickened. You can use your extra action only to
Step or Interact to reload.
RICOCHET LEGEND
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Ricochet Master
The more obstacles between you and your target, the deadlier
your shots become, as you ricochet off multiple surfaces to hit
them. When using Ricochet Shot, your shot can bounce off of
any surface within your weapon’s first three range increments
and the target can’t benefit from cover unless they have total
cover on all sides.
In addition, a creature must attempt a Will save against
your class DC the first time in an encounter you attack it
with a Ricochet Shot. If it fails, it’s stunned 2 and is unable to
determine where your shot originated.
SLINGER’S REFLEXES
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
Your ability to react to unexpected circumstances is
preternaturally sharp. At the start of each enemy’s turn, you
gain an additional reaction you can use on only that turn to
use a gunslinger reaction.

Guns &
GEARS
Guns and the people who use them remain uncommon
in the world of Golarion, as the technology required to
produce firearms and black powder is limited to a few
technological strongholds scattered across the globe.
Despite their rarity, or perhaps because of it, firearms
leave a lasting impression on those who witness their
destructive power and startling impact. Residents of
the Inner Sea from outside of the Impossible Lands
who behold a gunslinger or other wielder of firearms in
action might undertake a pilgrimage to Alkenstar and
attempt to negotiate with the Alkenstar Gunworks in
order to obtain one of these unusual but potent weapons
for themselves.
Even people who never see or obtain a firearm might
have a compelling reason to take these options, however.
Crossbows are vastly more common than firearms but
serve a similar purpose and can be put to many of
the same uses. An artillerist leading a cannon team in
Alkenstar might have a counterpart in Taldor who uses
similar abilities with catapults. The sniping duos who use
their arquebuses to guard the walls of Alkenstar from
monsters in the Mana Wastes are not terribly different
than the elven archers who patrol the forests of Kyonin
and brave the demon-haunted swamps of Tanglebriar.
In the islands of the Shackles, pirate captains fight with
swords and pistols while their crew, most of whom can’t
afford a rare and expensive handgun, might use the same
combat style with a similar weapon such as a crossbow
or hand crossbow.
While firearms are still relatively rare in the Inner
Sea, the stories they inspire and the combat styles that
incorporate them have spread faster than the technology
itself. Snipers, drifters, weapon performers, and more
have a place in Golarion that is larger than the impact
of firearms alone. Even if your world or region doesn’t
include guns, there might be options perfect for your
next character in this section. The options presented here
can add new choices and exciting abilities for characters
of any campaign world, regardless of the setting’s
technology level.
CHARACTER OPTIONS
A sniper without a spotter is like a sentry without a spyglass. Sure, you might catch a few
enemies, but you’ll miss more threats than you’ll ever see on your own. I knew that going
after the bandits, but I went anyways. Was I supposed to just let them take everything
from me and hope they didn’t do it again to the next family? Absolutely not.
Things started out well enough. Tracked them down by the trail of bloody footprints and
careless tracks they left from my farm to their camp. I found a nearby spot overlooking
the camp from a small bluff. They probably set up there knowing it’d make it harder
for anyone to see the smoke from their fires, or for people like me to sneak up on them.
Fortunately for me, the top of that bluff was as close as I needed to be.
I saw my shot when the bandit who killed my boy stood up in the middle of the camp
to make some speech. Don’t know what he was planning on saying, but my statement
was loud and clear when Alessandra roared like an angry dragon and put a lead round
clean through him. Reload, aim, fire. Reload, aim, fire. Two more down, but a pair of
them got clear and started climbing the sides of the bluff. Should I focus on the bandits
who were still in my field of fire or give up my position to deal with the ones coming at
my flanks? Rough spot, hard choice. That’s the kind of thing a spotter would’ve been real
helpful for. Should’a had someone watching my back. Ah, well. Reload, aim, fire.
—Griestly Peppercorn, retired shield marshal
WHY NO GUN PROFICIENCY?
While most of the character options in this section
provide benefits that are particularly useful or even
specifically tailored for firearms, remarkably few of
them outside of the gunslinger give a firearm-specific
proficiency progression. You might be asking yourself
why that is and there’s a very simple answer: for the vast
majority of characters, it isn’t necessary.
Just like knives, swords, spears, and every other
category of weapon, firearms come in simple, martial,
and advanced variants. As long as a character has
access to firearms (page 148), they’re also likely to have
a selection of firearms with which they are already
proficient. Additionally, many of the character options in
this section work equally well with crossbows as they
do with firearms. This means the options in this chapter
automatically support whichever category of weapons
(simple, martial, or advanced) your character knows how
to use.

COMMON BACKGROUNDS
The following common backgrounds are particularly
appropriate for characters that interact with guns,
areas that have guns, and gun-related themes. While
the backgrounds are listed as common for an area with
themes of guns and gears, and their mechanics and story
impact aren’t likely to require a discussion with your
GM or the other players, many of them still might not
be thematically appropriate for regions and campaigns
that lack these themes. Thus, be sure to discuss with your
group before using these backgrounds in a campaign
without any guns to ensure that your expectations
match those of the other players.
BACK-ALLEY DOCTOR
BACKGROUND
You’re the medic many turn to when a more official clinic or
healer might not be available. You may specialize in stitching
up bullet wounds or have a standing, confidential deal with
a criminal syndicate to provide your services any time of
day or night. In either case, you’ve perhaps turned to the
adventuring life because a former client is unhappy with
your work or members of the local constabulary have been
asking too many questions.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the
Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Risky
Surgery (Advanced Player’s Guide 208) skill feat.
CANNONEER
BACKGROUND
You served as a crewmate aboard a military
vessel or pirate ship and were responsible for
the use and maintenance of the ship’s cannons. A
strong back and quick reflexes were equally
important to you in your duties, and you know
your way around explosives and the dangers
that lie therein. These skills serve you well in
your new life as an adventurer, as compared
to the weight of a cannon, a gear load that
makes your allies blanche just makes you
laugh instead.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must
be to Dexterity or Strength, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the
Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Hefty Hauler
skill feat.
DEPUTY
BACKGROUND
While your life may have taken some twists
and turns in the intervening years, you were
once deputized as the lawful protector of
a community. While the role was temporary
and you’ve since turned in your badge, that
responsibility shaped you. Whenever a community is in
trouble, and the sheriff is nowhere to be found, residents call
on you to capture a criminal, rescue the mayor’s offspring
from bandits, or go toe to toe with outlaws.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Hunting Lore
skill. You gain the Experienced Tracker skill feat.
FIREWORKS PERFORMER
BACKGROUND
Few celebrations in Tian-Xia are complete without a show of
fireworks, and your job is to make sure they go off without a
hitch. You load the fireworks, set the fuses, and choreograph
the performance, bringing the show together in a finale of
lights and explosions. Then it’s time to pack up your gear
and move on to the next civic holiday or religious festival.
Of course, someone who travels the roads with a pack full
of high explosives is bound to run into an adventure or two
along the way, and so over time, your fireworks have been
spent in support of that life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Fascinating Performance
skill feat.
GUNSMITH
BACKGROUND
From a young age, you apprenticed to an
experienced gunsmith and over time your skill
and knowledge rose to match that of your master.
Today, you can easily repair, modify, or improve
nearly any firearm you’ve seen before, and even if
you haven’t seen it, you’ll break it down to learn about
what makes it tick in no time.
You’ve taken those skills on the
road, using them to assist yourself
and your allies as an adventurer
when it comes to maintaining their
weapons, shields, armor, and more.
Choose two ability boosts. One of
these boosts must be to Intelligence or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the
Engineering Lore skill. You gain the Quick
Repair skill feat.
HIRED KILLER
BACKGROUND
Your life truly began after your first kill.
Maybe you killed in self-defense, maybe
it was a crime of passion, or maybe it was
just an accident and you were a kid in the
wrong place at the wrong time. In the end,
the why doesn’t matter. You got away with it.
And then you found that maybe it didn’t bother
you as much as it should have. And maybe, just

maybe, you had a talent you could use to forge a life for
yourself. A blood-soaked talent and a blood-soaked life,
sure. But it’s yours.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Strength
or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore
skill. You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat, choosing a terrain
appropriate for where you make your kills.
FARMSTEADER
BACKGROUND
You built your house using wood from the trees surrounding
it. Raised it up from the dirt and called it home. You thought
that it would be where you would grow old and die. But
despite your best efforts, you were wrong. The land that
once gave you food fell fallow, and dust took to the air and
choked the livestock. Now you wander the world as an
adventurer. Are you in search of a new place to settle down
and try again, or have you become disillusioned by your old
dreams, leading you to seek out a new purpose?
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Farming Lore
skill. You gain the Forager skill feat.
JUNK COLLECTOR
BACKGROUND
You live by the adage that one person’s trash is another’s
treasure. Whether by sifting through scrap heaps or
digging up old battlefields, you remain on the lookout for
lost or discarded objects that you might be able to turn into
something useful. More often than not, what you find is just
junk... but you’re convinced that one of these days, you’re
going to hit the jackpot. You’ve even taken up adventuring
as a means to supercharge your access to all sorts of junk,
gear, and loot.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and your choice of
either the Engineering Lore or Mining Lore skill. You gain the
Crafter’s Appraisal skill feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 204).
SALOON ENTERTAINER
BACKGROUND
All you want to do is entertain the people, but sure enough,
bad news seems to follow you. Gunfights, brawls, robberies,
and more befall establishments you play at, and word is
quick to spread. Keep one town ahead of the gossip, and you
just might be able to play a gig, command a stage, or run a
table again.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and a lore skill of
your choice. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat.
SPOTTER
BACKGROUND
An eye for detail, a sense for the wind, and a strong trust in
your gut feelings. These qualities have set you apart from
others when it comes to assisting a sharpshooter with setting
up the perfect shot against their target. Elevation, velocity,
and concealment—these are all vital factors that need to be
considered to pull off a feat of true marksmanship, and no
sniper would be able to function without an experienced
spotter. Since your younger days, you’ve put your skills as
a spotter to work as an adventurer. Whether you’re taking
your own shots now or spotting for others, your talents
grant you an edge in an adventuring career.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Stealth skill and the Scouting Lore
skill. You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat.
UNDERTAKER
BACKGROUND
People die. This is the unfortunate fact of life on which
you’ve founded your business, because wherever people
die, there is a demand for mortuary services. You might be
a Pharasmin priest or a secular professional, but your job
is seeing to the body, comforting the bereaved, and making
sure that the deceased goes to their ultimate reward with all
due dignity. Of course, someone in your position sees a lot of
strange deaths, and chances are one of them set you on the
road to adventure.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and a Lore skill
specializing in one local type of undead. You gain the Forensic
Acumen skill feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 206).
WANDERING PREACHER
BACKGROUND
While you once spoke to a small congregation in a
ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your
church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now
you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious
text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to
Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Religion skill and a Lore skill
associated with the deity you preach for (such as Pharasmin
Lore). You gain the Pilgrim’s Token skill feat (Advanced
Player’s Guide 208).
WASTE WALKER
BACKGROUND
Whether you grew up in the Mana Wastes or another
similarly desolate place, you quickly learned that only the
strong survive. You and your family were forced to evade
monsters, mutants, wild magic, and worse, as each new day
heralded the possibility of a danger or threat you’d never
seen before. You learned to adapt to the worst possible
conditions and how to forage and survive in a place few
others would dare to live.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Strength
or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill, and Mana Wastes Lore
(or another similar Lore skill associated with the wastes
where you grew up). You gain the Forager skill feat.

PAGE 125
================================================================================

UNCOMMON BACKGROUNDS
The following backgrounds are uncommon, typically
because they require a character to be a member of an
organization, own a current residence in a particular
settlement, or a maintain a level of social status or
responsibility that you should discuss with your GM
and group first.
For instance, the rank of a judge or sheriff grants
social status and judicial power with the area of your
appointment, so it’s appropriate to check with your
GM and group to ensure the stories and adventures
everyone wants to tell make sense with a character
possessing those titles, and determine how prominent
the associated locales will be to the campaign.
ALKENSTAR OUTLAW
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re an outlaw whose first crime was stealing the guns
from Alkenstar’s Gunworks which allowed you to commence
a crime spree of epic proportions. You don’t know where
your road ends, but it’s probably going to be a bloody affair.
The life of an adventurer might even be a relief compared
to a life forever on the run from Alkenstar authorities and
their allies.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Dexterity
or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Thievery and Underworld Lore. You gain
the Subtle Theft skill feat.
ALKENSTAR SOJOURNER
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You came to Alkenstar because you heard they had guns,
but you stayed because of the atmosphere. Or the guns.
Either way, journalism and scientific curiosity opened the
door to a life of adventure. Now you continue to adventure
in the Alkenstar area, using your skills to deal with
whatever situations present themselves.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Society and Engineering Lore. You gain
the Streetwise skill feat.
CIRCUIT JUDGE
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re a circuit judge, a courtroom on horseback who serves
a group of communities out in the Mana Wastes or a similar
backwoods region. You show up every couple of months, hear
the cases that have piled up since your last visit, give verdicts,
and then it’s on to the next town in your itinerary. It’s not the
easiest life in the world, but it’s an interesting one, and you
hear some mighty strange cases. Chances are, it was one of
those cases that set you on the road to adventure.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Deception and Legal Lore. You gain the
Lie to Me skill feat.
GOLDHAND ARMS DEALER
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re a dwarven agent of the Goldhand Lodge, a collection
of dwarven merchants based out of Dongun Hold who
seeks to sell guns far and wide. High King Anong Arunak
hasn’t expressed approval for such a method of distribution
yet, but in the meantime you’re still out and about,
talking up your wares and occasionally providing visceral
demonstrations of the overwhelming stopping power of
your firearms. These demonstrations and sales have given
you a taste for adventure, and the constant threat of piracy

PRESS-GANGED
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
Was it five shots or six? It doesn’t really matter in the
end, because after those nice folks bought all your drinks,
you woke up on the lowest rung of the ladder. Whether a
crewmate on a ship, a conscript in an army, or something
worse, you’ve nowhere to go but up. This background
generally requires buy-in with the entire group to tell
a story allowing you to play a character starting their
adventuring due to circumstances outside their own
control. However, you can also play a character who was
once press-ganged and has since escaped that life. If you
do, press-ganged doesn’t have the uncommon trait, and it
has the same mechanical effects either way.

SHERIFF
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You hold an official title of sheriff or deputy in a small
community. Those that would do harm to others flee your
gaze, for they know it brings the promise of castigation.
You protect your town, watch over those who have placed
their trust in you, and make sure those that would do
others harm are brought to justice.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Hunting
Lore skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat.

While most backgrounds are available to any character,
some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them
makes a character rare and extraordinary.
These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm, situated in
a special position within the narrative. Your character’s
background is an intrinsic part of where they come from
and not something they earn during the game. Rare
backgrounds should be chosen only after a discussion
with the GM as to whether one would apply for a
particular character in your group’s game.
OTHERWORLDLY MISSION
BACKGROUND
RARE
You’re called to serve a specific purpose—your deity told you
so, and so it must be true. Maybe you grew up knowing all
along, or maybe it came to you one day in a vision, clear as
a bell and twice as loud. You have some task that only you
can accomplish. You mission might be as dangerous as
killing a deadly tyrant or as simple as opening a particular
door on a particular day.
You should work with your GM on how to handle the
truth of your character’s backstory or leave it to the GM
to decide in secret. Is this call to action a message from the
character’s own mind, are they being manipulated by some
manner of supernatural entity, or are they actually getting
marching orders from one of the deities of the setting?
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Religion. Once per adventure, you can ask
the voice you believe to be a deity for orders and get some kind
of instruction—you never get any kind of explanation, simply a
command to go somewhere or do something. Following those
commands isn’t always safe, but it’s usually interesting.
REVENANT
BACKGROUND
RARE
You died. No real doubt about that. Bullet to the brain or knife
to the throat, you were dead as dead can be. Then you got
back up again. Maybe you had some unfinished business, or
maybe you were just so tough and so mean that Hell itself
spat you out. Either way, you came back for a reason.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Religion and Boneyard Lore. You’re still
alive, not undead, but you have the negative healing ability,
which means you’re harmed by positive damage and healed
by negative effects as if you were undead.
TALL TALE
BACKGROUND
RARE
You’ve ridden a tornado, lassoed a river, mooned a dragon under
RARE BACKGROUNDS
a full moon, and shot six zombies with one bullet. That’s what
the stories say, anyway, and even if people don’t strictly believe
them, they are curious about you. Certainly, the stories keep
spreading, and it would appear that you either have a unique
destiny or are trying to convince the world that you do.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Performance. You gain the Impressive
Performance skill feat. You can gain the Connections skill
feat later without being expert in Society or having Courtly
Graces—this represents less traditional social connections
and more the way that your legend has spread, and you’ve
learned to leverage your legend, with people wanting to
meet you and see you for themselves.
Tall Tale

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in several archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in it for some time. A stance lasts until you’re
knocked unconscious, until its requirements (if any) are
violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter
a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take
an action with the stance trait, you can’t take another
one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in
encounter mode.
ARCHETYPES
While gunslingers are especially known for using firearms,
various other sorts of characters use them too, and you
might find the gunslinger class isn’t the perfect fit for your
character concept. Archetypes allow you to expand the
scope of your character’s class.
Applying an archetype requires you to select
archetype feats instead of class feats. Start by finding the
archetype that best fits your character concept and select
the archetype’s dedication feat using one of your class
feat choices. Once you have the dedication feat, you can
select any feat from that archetype in place of a class
feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype
feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions
on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you gained
an ability at 6th level that granted you a 4th-level class
feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class
feat only for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with
the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a
class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you
select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy
its requirements before you can gain another dedication
feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat
by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s
list. You can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you
have any other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another
feat, such as the alchemist’s basic concoction feat. You
must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their
entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter
feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of
additional feats includes the feat’s name, level, and the
page number where it appears. You can take the feat
as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts
toward the number of feats required by the archetype’s
dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that
normally has a class trait doesn’t have that class trait.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t
select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you’re a
member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
fighter can’t select the Fighter Dedication feat).
Guns Archetype List
The following archetypes each allow you to build a
character with strong ties to gears and gadgets.
• The gunslinger multiclass archetype (page 127)
adds some gunslinger options to characters of any
other class.
• The artillerist archetype (page 128) launches powerful
attacks from siege weapons and heavy artillery.
• The beast gunner archetype (page 130) forms a
mystic bond with a powerful beast gun, gaining
spells and magical abilities in the process.
• The bullet dancer archetype (page 132) performs
a unique form of martial arts focusing on various
uses of firearms.
• The demolitionist archetype (page 133) sets
explosives that trap foes and demolish edifices.
• The fireworks technician archetype (page 134)
launches fireworks for a variety of interesting
special effects.
• The pistol phenom archetype (page 136) combines
flashy pistol work with a powerful personality to
take control of any situation.
• The sniping duo archetype (page 138) teams up with
a spotter of their choice in order to gain benefits
helping both the sniper and their spotter.
• The spellshot class archetype (page 140) adds
magical options to the gunslinger class.
• The unexpected sharpshooter archetype (page 142)
is either incredibly lucky or secretly extremely
skilled. Whichever is the truth, such a character
always seems to hit their targets and dodge attacks
as if propelled forward by some uncanny power.

Artillerist
“Load Pathfinders, load! That fey-blighted moth will be
coming around for another pass quick as a blink and
if we don’t meet it with a rain of cannon fire, you’ll be
wishing you had a diving suit like mine. Steady the aim
there! Steady... fire!”
—Khoumrock Blackthorne, captain of the Unsinkable
and self-proclaimed slayer of “giant evil moth gods.”
The artillerist’s maxim holds that while fights might
be won with swords, battles are won with cannons.
Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults,
hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat
engineers’ corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the
penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need
to operate on a small scale. You’re a consummate
professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging
mathematics and manpower to transform whatever
castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon
offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.
You’re not just some daredevil demolitionist, though.
You’re part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with
your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness.
Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next
round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine’s
next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence
on the team ensures their chances of success are
maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the
sum of its parts.
ARTILLERIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in martial weapons
Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew
has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might
just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin
could cause the whole thing to explode. You’ve taken these
lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team
assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon’s
deployment and usage. If you’re serving on a siege weapon
crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the
weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the
weapon’s aim twice as far as normal.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you’ve gained at least two other feats from the artillerist
archetype.
NAMED ARTILLERY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege
weapon most important to them and closest to
their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon
is their livelihood. You’ve gone a step further,
and you always make sure that your named
artillery has the best possible maintenance and
upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and
working on a single siege weapon to designate
it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you
designated as your named artillery gains a +2
circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and
Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice
your level.
During your daily preparations, you must spend at least
one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery.
If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a
new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery
loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist
can designate a particular siege weapon as their named
artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same
siege weapon’s crew (though it’s typically more efficient
for a group with several artillerists to divide them up,
assigning one to each siege weapon).

Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with
a very specific minimum number of members designed to
ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable
and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon.
In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people,
provided you know what you’re doing. You can operate a siege
weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an
increasing penalty. You and your crew take a –2 penalty to
checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for
each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number
of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this
feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew
size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take
a –10 penalty when doing so.
CANNON CORNER SHOT
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can
make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other
siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally
contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon’s
loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a
line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a
10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns
into a 10-foot burst).
FIELD ARTILLERY [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one
place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a
gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact

by 10 feet for one round.
LIVE AMMUNITION
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot
out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use
the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it’s
more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs
or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer
demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires
two additional Load actions, which you must conduct
personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or
restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon
must be physically capable of firing the creature in question,
based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas
don’t qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which
require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and
onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the
weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot
square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to
its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.
MASTER SIEGE ENGINEER
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
What you don’t know about artillery isn’t worth knowing and
your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of
actions as part of a siege weapon’s crew. You’re permanently
quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch
a siege weapon.
LEADING WITH A CANNON
A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their
skills in that field certainly shouldn’t be underestimated.
When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of
knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle,
but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and
a few good siege weapons can make the difference
between prolonged months of battle with countless lives
lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths
and a more lasting victory.
Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding
land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all
vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on
the military might of either side, but on a castle’s ability to
withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers
capable of penetrating a castle or keep’s defenses, the
occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as
they have enough food and water to keep their citizens
and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been
“won” when the besieged force manages to last through a
single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break
down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold
weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor
hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an
opportunity to impact their opponents.
An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely
rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on
the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the
besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist
hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult
stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling
down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their
opponents have brought siege weapons, especially
powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons,
will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even
started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be
staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but
not thwarted without outside intervention.
Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow,
might take things a step further, specifically targeting
granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting
food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town
near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle,
so too does the morale of the castle’s inhabitants and
defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it
hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops
mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.

================================================================================
PAGE 131
================================================================================

Beast Gunner
The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred
to as “beast guns” (page 154) is truly ancient, with the
first iterations of the weapons created on the continent
of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that
beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting
in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets
have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing
beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into
the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare
as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige
associated with star guns has allowed more people access
to equivalent destructive power without the intense
requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast
gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.
The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the
full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with
multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking
to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand
new weapon made after they hunt down the creature
themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the
beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature.
Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored
to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the
prospective beast gunner. However, it’s also possible to
bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the
generations by adding symbolic fresh components from
the same kind of creature, after performing the same
ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the
intent of establishing a bond.
To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner
must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding
to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand
new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun.
Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five
assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who
help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants
are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature,
or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood
a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the
bonding process and the hunt and organic materials
are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of
the hunter. The same doesn’t apply if the prospective
beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are
significantly more powerful than the creature, such that
the creature never stood a chance against them in a one
on one fight.
You’re one of those who successfully completed the
hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you
seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think
they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.

The beast gun also acts as a conduit, drawing out and
amplifying any latent or active magic power you have. You
learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell
activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your
choice, from either the arcane or primal spell list. You choose
this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list
or from other spells you have access to on the list. This cantrip
must require a spell attack roll. You’re trained in spell attack
rolls and spell DCs for arcane or primal spells, whichever of
the two traditions you chose. Your key spellcasting ability for
these spells is Charisma.
If you already cast arcane or primal spells from spell slots,
you learn one additional cantrip from that tradition. If you’re a
prepared caster, you can prepare this spell in addition to your
usual cantrips per day; if you’re a spontaneous caster, you add
this cantrip to your spell repertoire.
You also gain Spellsling.
Spellsling [three-actions] Requirements You’re wielding your bonded
beast gun; Effect You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions
to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the
spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the
beast gun you’re wielding. Make a Strike with that beast
gun. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your
attack roll result to determine the effects of both the
Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the
purposes of determining your multiple attack penalty, but
you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed
resolving the attack and spell.

You create a direct magical connection with your beast gun,
allowing you to guide the beast gun’s next shot by taking
control of the projectile directly, steering it through the air,
and swerving and veering it to continue to hit target after
target. Make a beast gun Strike against a creature within the
first range increment. On a hit, the shot tears through the
target and continues toward another target you can see. You
make a Strike against this new target. The new target must be
no farther from the previous target than a distance equal to
the beast gun’s range increment. For example, the new target
must be within 150 feet of the previous target when attacking
with a drake rifle. On a hit, you can direct the bullet toward a
new target.
You can continue to make Strikes against new targets in
this same way until your attack misses, at which point your
shot dissipates. You can’t make a Strike against a target
you already attacked during this use of Controlled Bullet,
but you can otherwise continue to make attacks against
valid targets until you miss. Each attack counts toward
your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your

CHOOSING YOUR BEAST GUN
A beast gunner’s bond with their beast gun is deep and
mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner,
it’s important to choose a beast gun that suits your
temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if
you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is
the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be
optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the
battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow
and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close
range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can
be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun
has a personality and magical abilities that attract people
who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast
gunners say the weapon chooses you.

DEDICATION
Prerequisites expert in unarmored defense and
trained in simple weapons
You’ve learned how
to
synchronize
traditional martial arts
and guns. You gain the Bullet Dancer
Stance action. Whenever your proficiency
in any weapon increases to expert or
beyond, you gain that new proficiency with
bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms
and unarmed attacks.
Bullet
Dancer
Stance
[one-action]
(stance)
Requirements You’re unarmored and
wielding a simple firearm, bayonet, or
reinforced stock; Effect You enter a
specialized stance for a unique martial
art centered around the use of simple
firearms. While in this stance, the
only Strikes you can make are those
using bayonets, reinforced stocks,
and simple firearms. You can use
Flurry of Blows with these weapons.
You can use your other monk feats
or monk abilities that normally
require unarmed attacks with bayonets
and reinforced stocks, so long as the feat
or ability doesn’t require a single, specific Strike.
You can also use them with simple firearms when
attacking within half the first range increment.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat
until you’ve gained two other feats from the bullet
dancer dedication archetype.
BULLET DANCER BURN
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bullet Dancer Stance
Requirements You’re wielding a firearm with an attached
bayonet or reinforced stock.
The fiery blaze of your weapons combined with your unorthodox
technique leaves your opponents with little opportunity to
capitalize on any gaps in your defenses, or properly defend
themselves against your onslaught. While in Bullet Dancer
Stance, when you successfully Strike an opponent with a
bayonet or reinforced stock attached to your firearm, the next
ranged Strike you make against that opponent doesn’t trigger
reactions that would trigger on a ranged attack, such as Attack
of Opportunity. While in Bullet Dancer Stance, when you
make a successful ranged Strike against an opponent within
your melee reach using a firearm, the next reinforced stock or
bayonet attack attached to that firearm deals an additional 1
fire damage per weapon damage die.
The benefit on your next Strike from either use of Bullet
Dancer Burn is lost if not used by the end of your next turn.
BLACK POWDER BLAZE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Black Powder Boost
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
You learn to take advantage of every shot,
flying across the battlefield with the help of
your weapon’s recoil. Stride and use Black
Powder Boost. Make a ranged Strike with
the required weapon at any point during
the Black Powder Boost.
BULLET DANCER RELOAD [one-action] FEAT 12

Prerequisites Bullet Dancer Burn
Requirements You’re in Bullet Dancer
Stance.
You’ve
learned
to
reload
your
simple
firearms
with uncanny grace, the
ammunition simply falling into place
as though part of a well-practiced
kata. You Strike with a simple
firearm, and then Interact to
reload that same firearm. You
don’t need a free hand to reload your
simple firearm in this way.
RANGED DISARM [one-action]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Bullet Dancer Dedication,
Trick Shot
Requirements You’re wielding a simple
firearm.
When using a simple firearm, you can shoot objects right
out of your enemy’s hands. Attempt to Disarm the target
using a ranged attack roll with your simple firearm,
instead of attempting an Athletics check against
the target’s Reflex DC.

DEDICATION
You know how to set explosives to cause the maximum possible
damage to buildings and other structures. You become trained
in Engineering Lore or become an expert in it if you were
already trained. You gain the Set Explosives action.
Set Explosives [two-actions] (concentrate) Requirements You have 1 or 2
bombs in hand; Effect You attach the bombs to an inanimate
object within your reach, such as a door, wall, or column,
and rig them to detonate at a set time. The bombs
explode at a specific time you determine (such as after
your next action or at the start of your next turn, to
a maximum of 1 minute), dealing their damage and
splash damage to the inanimate object. Combine
this damage for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses, and this damage ignores
an amount of the object’s Hardness equal
to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the
hazard take the bombs’ splash damage, also
combined for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses. As a reminder, since you
didn’t throw the bombs, Calculated
Splash and similar effects don’t
apply. Making sure your timing
is correct requires concentration,
so you can’t Set Explosives again
while you’re waiting for a previously
set bomb to detonate.
Special You can’t select another
dedication feat until you’ve gained two
other feats from the demolitionist

SAFETY MEASURES
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
You’re often careful to be sure you’re not
hoisted on your own petard, or anyone
else’s, for that matter. When you have cover
from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage
caused by that bomb equal to half your level,
plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to
AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits
against your own bombs regardless of whether
you have cover.
EXPLOSIVE ENTRY [two-actions]
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites
Demolitionist
Dedication,

Engineering Lore
You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by
detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of
course! You Set Explosives on a door, window, container,
or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can
attempt an Engineering Lore check to Force Open the
target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls,
add that item bonus to your Engineering Lore check. Since
you’re blasting your way in, you can’t avoid breaking the
object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a
success instead.
CONTROLLED BLAST
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication; Calculated Splash,
Directional Bombs, or Expanded Splash
You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives
by controlling every possible parameter of the
blast meticulously. If you have the Directional
Bombs feats, you can use it with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge, even though you didn’t throw
the bombs. If you have the Calculated Splash
or Expanded Splash feats, you can apply the
additional splash damage to one of the bombs
when you Set Explosives or use Demolition
Charge, and you can apply the increased
splash area from Expanded Splash to all
the bombs.
COLLAPSE WALL [reaction]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
Trigger A creature moves into the bombs’
splash area.
Requirements You’re within 30 feet of an area
where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or
similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge.
You detonate the required bombs in order
to bring a wall down on a creature. If
your bombs deal enough damage to
reduce the wall’s Hit Points below its
Broken Threshold, the wall partially
collapses on the creature. The creature
takes bludgeoning damage equal to the
damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex
save; the DC for this save is equal to
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher). On a failure, they must spend an
Interact action to dig themselves out of
the collapse, and on a critical failure,
they must spend 2 Interact actions
to do so.

Firework Technician
The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering
aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle,
and piercing screech—these are the stock and trade
of your craft. You know how to perfectly pair light
and sound to create fireworks displays that can amaze
children and adults, comfort friends, and even confound
your foes.
As a fireworks technician, you might be an itinerant
wanderer, roaming from town to town and developing
your craft on your own. In that case, you make a living
on the road, selling fireworks to the townsfolk, setting
up public displays upon request and receipt of payment,
and even tailoring individualized performances to those
wealthy or interesting enough to be worthy of receiving
their own private show.
 On the other hand, you might be part of an established
fireworks house from Tian Xia or Vudra and rely on
teamwork to perfect your various formulas and displays.
Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks
technology, you often send back the notes from your
studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues
from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on
your next big idea.
FIREWORK TECHNICIAN DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
DEDICATION
DEDICATION
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You’ve learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom
using black powder, metals, and paper. You most likely came
by this knowledge through formal training with a fireworks
house in Tian Xia or a fireworks company from Vudra, though
perhaps you mastered fireworks completely by yourself after
finding a secret stash in an old shipwreck.
You become trained in Fireworks Lore or become
an expert if you were already trained in it. You
gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, a pool of
infused reagents equal to your level, and advanced alchemy
(allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily
preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure).
You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks,
Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from this
archetype (see below). Your advanced alchemy level is 1.
The rules for these are in the Alchemical Crafting section
on page 258 of the Core Rulebook, and rules for infused
reagents and advanced alchemy are on page 72. If you gain
infused reagents from more than one source, you use the
highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather
than adding them together.
You can also create special fireworks displays using your
infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can
use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage
in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and
learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more
complex displays through other firework technician feats.
The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC,
whichever is higher.
Launch Fireworks Display [one-action] to [three-actions] (see below); (manipulate);
Cost 1 or more batches of infused reagents; Requirements
You have a free hand; Effect You set off a fireworks display.
You can launch a normal firework to simply create a visual
or audible signal within 20 feet or you can choose one of
the following special effects. A firework display has the
listed traits, and if it costs more than 1 batch of infused
reagents, it is noted in its Cost entry.
Comet [one-action] (visual) You shoot a streak of shining light in a
60-foot line. All spaces in that line are lit with bright light
until the start of your next turn. As part of this action,
you can also Point Out a single creature in the line, and
your allies do not need to hear or understand you.
Flower [one-action] (visual) You ignite a ring of sparks, creating a shape
that might be reminiscent of a flower blooming in the sky.
Each enemy with 20 feet of you must attempt a Fortitude
save. On a failure, the enemy is dazzled for 1 round, and on
a critical failure they are dazzled for 2 rounds.
Salute [one-action] (auditory) You create a startling bang or whistle,
adding an auditory component to your fireworks display.
When you launch a salute display, you can choose a
confused or fascinated ally within 60 feet. If the ally you
chose is fascinated, the noise is so violent that it acts as a
hostile effect for the purpose of their fascinated condition
(though it has no negative repercussions) automatically
ending most applications of the fascinated condition. If
they’re confused, the sound is so loud and violent that it
might snap the ally out of confusion. They can immediately
attempt the flat check to remove the confused condition
which normally occurs when a creature is damaged. If the
confused condition has special rules that remove the flat
check when taking damage or make the flat check harder,
those rules also apply to the salute.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you’ve gained two other feats from the fireworks technician
archetype.

COUGHING DRAGON DISPLAY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering
trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate
your audience’s attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly
effective use in combat, suppressing auditory or visual effects
behind your magnificent display. You gain the Coughing
Dragon fireworks display.
Coughing Dragon [two-actions] Cost 2 batches of infused reagents;
Effect Choose either auditory or visual effects. The display
gains that trait, and you attempt to counteract one or more
effects within 60 feet that have this trait. On a success, the
effect is suppressed until the start of your next turn, rather
than ending entirely. Use your Fireworks Lore modifier
as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is
equal to half your advanced alchemy level (rounded up). A
coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather
than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend
an additional action to create an even bigger coughing
dragon display that attempts to counteract both auditory
and visual effects at the same time.
EXPERT FIREWORKS CRAFTER
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication, expert in

You’re particularly adept at crafting fireworks, allowing you
to create much more powerful fireworks than you otherwise
could. Your advanced alchemy level for fireworks increases to
your level – 3.
JUMPING JENNY DISPLAY
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
This multi-sequence rocket blasts confetti at a series of
altitudes. While the design is intended to delight children
of all ages, you’ve found it has an unexpected side effect
of confounding enemy fliers. You gain the Jumping Jenny
fireworks display.
Jumping Jenny [one-action] Cost 2 batches of infused reagents; Effect
Target a flying creature within 60 feet. Until the start of
your next turn, each time that creature attempts to Fly,
they must succeed at an Acrobatics check to Maneuver in
Flight against the DC of your fireworks display, or the Fly
action is disrupted. If all the creature’s attempts to Fly are
disrupted, at the end of its turn, it falls harmlessly to the
ground below. A jumping jenny costs 2 batches of infused
reagents, rather than 1.
GOBLIN JUBILEE DISPLAY
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and
devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest
goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that,
while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical
health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You
gain the Goblin Jubilee fireworks display.
Goblin Jubilee [three-actions] (fire, sonic, visual) Cost 3 batches of
infused reagents; Effect Chaos fills a 20-foot burst within
120 feet. All creatures in the area takes 3d6 fire damage
and 3d6 sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save.
A goblin jubilee display costs 3 batches of infused reagents,
rather than 1.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is dazzled and deafened until the end
of its next turn and takes half damage.
Failure The creature is dazzled and deafened for 1 minute
and takes full damage.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round, dazzled
and deafened for 1 minute, and takes double damage.
BANSHEE CRY DISPLAY
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
You’ve learned how to pull off a sudden noisemaker at just
the right moment in your display, a technique that can disrupt
precise wording. You gain the Banshee Cry fireworks display.
Banshee Cry [reaction] Trigger A creature within 30 feet Casts a
Spell that has a verbal component or Activates an Item
using a command Activation; Effect You set off a firework to
explode with a loud screech near the creature. The creature
must attempt a Will save.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature must use an additional action on the
triggering action or activity, or it’s disrupted.
Critical Failure The triggering action is disrupted.
DESCRIBING YOUR FIREWORKS DISPLAY
As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your
character’s special abilities might matter significantly to
you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same
fireworks display, even if they come from the same
fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate
the display. In fact, it’s likely that when you use a feat
from the firework technician archetype, the resulting
display remains a bit different each time as you tinker,
perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably
have a few themes that you prefer for each of your
firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing
Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine
shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering
trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric
shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a
shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree
blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you
can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what
your character is doing, you might come up with some
go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your
favorite displays.

Pistol Phenom
“You saw what I can do, so you know I’m telling the
truth when I say that I don’t miss. That was just a
warning shot. Now if you’d kindly empty out that coffer
into my bag of holding, I don’t see any need for this to get
unpleasant... do you?”
—Unidentified pistol-twirling half-elf desperado, just
before absconding with the funds a corrupt Alkenstar shield
marshal planned to use to bribe a judge.
You treat combat as an art and your pistol as an extension
of your performance. You might wield a single pistol, a
pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to
pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though,
the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial
to your technique and style.
To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun
as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents
but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into
doing what you want them to do. While others tend to
focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as
possible, your style is all about control. By controlling
a foe’s attention and actions, you can bolster your own
attacks and mitigate the foe’s potential for mayhem. You
control the tempo of the battle much as you would a
staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe’s actions
don’t fall outside of your intended script. You’re both
the director and the star of this show, and your enemies
dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes
quite literally!

This otherwise serves as Pistol Twirl for the purpose of
meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn’t count
as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting
Pistol Phenom Dedication’s special entry and taking another

you can choose to attempt a Performance check instead
of a Deception check.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until

phenom archetype.
GUNPOWDER GAUNTLET [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.
Your flair keeps foes’ attention, as your motions with your gun
draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and
performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel
vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your
own making. Attempt a Performance check against the Will
DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm’s first
range increment.
Critical Success The target takes a –2 status penalty to attack

Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in
their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected
straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a

HOT FOOT [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
Using a carefully aimed shot, you make a creature “dance.”
You shoot at the ground near a target’s feet, causing
them to react involuntarily; even mindless creatures have
unconscious responses to dodge an attack, and you can
capitalize off those uncontrollable reflexes to achieve your
aim. As they dance to the sweet tune of your pistol’s retort,
you ensure your foe can’t use whatever nasty surprise they
had planned in store for you and your allies. Make an attack
roll against the Reflex DC of a target creature within your
firearm’s first range increment.
Critical Success The creature can’t use reactions, is flat-footed,
and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves. These
effects last until the start of its next turn.
Success The creature can’t use reactions until the start of its

PHENOM’S VERVE
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
You’re possessed with an incredibly vivacious spark that
separates you not only from ordinary gun users and
gunslingers, but even from other phenoms. Using that
distinctive verve, when you perform impeccably and control
the scene with your abilities, you also manage to set up your
foes for disaster and ensure they remain in your sights for
any follow-up attacks you want to make against them. If you
critically succeed at a Performance check for Pistol Twirl or a
pistol phenom archetype feat, you gain a +1 status bonus to
your attack rolls with one-handed firearms and one-handed
melee weapons until the end of your turn.
REACH FOR THE SKY [two-actions]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
VISUAL
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
You command the room, firing a gun into the air and ordering
everyone to surrender and put their hands in the air. You
fire your firearm and then attempt a single Intimidation
check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet. Creatures
who become frightened instinctively put their hands in the
air. If they had Raised a Shield, they lose the benefits, as
they raise the shield above their head where it’s of little use
to block attacks. With their hands in the air, each of these
frightened creatures can’t use reactions or free actions that
require their hands, or items held in their hands, until the
beginning of their next turn. Regardless of the result, each
creature is then temporarily immune to Reach for the Sky
for 1 minute.
WHIRLING KNOCKDOWN [two-actions]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed firearm
and a one-handed melee weapon.
You fire your gun while throwing off a target’s balance with
your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground
with the quick orchestrated combination. You don’t need
to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with
your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and
eliminating your target’s movements and options, leaving
them no choice but to fall.
Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the
reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a Performance
check against the creature’s Reflex DC. If the Strike critically
succeeds, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its
Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the
following effects.
Critical Success The target falls and lands prone. It takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Success The target falls and lands prone.
Critical Failure Your plans backfired on you, and you’re forced
to drop your melee weapon in your space.
WHAT MAKES A PHENOM?
Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or
intimidate a foe, but it’s not just your skills that make
you a phenom, it’s your style and attitude. As a pistol
phenom, you understand how to grab everyone’s
attention with everything you do, especially the way
you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your
gun. But what’s more, you’re well aware of that fact and
the power you have over others, and you aren’t afraid
to flaunt it.
Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol
phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of
allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to
protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they
get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be
other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms
gather in the same group, it’s almost inevitable for a duel
or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not
end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that
of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating
rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong
friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your
greatest achievements to compare exploits.

Sniping Duo
Skilled shooters who don’t let their egos get in the way of
their efficacy are likely to say that sniping is a two-person
job. Taking down a target without giving away your
position or giving the opponent a window for reprisal is
difficult work that requires teamwork and coordination,
as well as a tight-knit bond and shared perspective. Sniping
duos live and die by the credo “two heads are better than
one,” focusing their skills and strategies toward deadly
efficiency. Whether your spotter and partner is a fellow
ranged combatant or a melee enthusiast, you’ve learned
how to use the openings they provide to devastating effect.
Additional Feats: 4th Assisting Shot (Core Rulebook

SNIPING DUO DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in at least one type of weapon in the
bow or firearm groups, trained in Stealth
When you take this dedication, choose one willing,
non-minion ally to act as your spotter. As part of your
training in this archetype, you train your spotter in the
necessary habits and techniques to use your abilities
automatically; your spotter doesn’t need to spend any feats
of their own to grant the effects. You only gain the benefits
of your Sniping Duo archetype feats if both you and your
spotter are alive and conscious. You and your spotter don’t
grant your foes lesser cover against one another’s Strikes.
Whenever you or your spotter successfully Strikes a target,
the other member of your duo gains a +1 circumstance
bonus per weapon damage die on the damage roll of their
next Strike made against that target before the end of their
next turn.
You can change your designated spotter by spending 3
days of downtime training with another ally.

The penalty you take for firing into further range increments
is –3 for the third range increment, with an additional –2

for the fourth range increment, –7 for the fifth, and –9 for
the sixth).
EXPLOIT OPENING [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
Trigger Your spotter critically succeeds at a Strike against a
creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon’s
first range increment.
You take advantage of your spotter’s devastating attack to
unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged Strike
with a –2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to the Strike.
TARGETED REDIRECTION [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You aim a shot at your spotter, intending for your spotter
to redirect that shot off their own weapon or shield to hit
your foe from a better angle, and avoid your foe’s cover.
If your next action is to make a ranged Strike, you treat
your spotter’s position as your own for the purposes of
determining cover and range. Your spotter must be within
your weapon’s first range increment and they must use a
reaction to redirect your shot.

DUO’S AIM [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially
accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon Strike against a foe
either within your spotter’s melee reach or the first range
increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On
this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack
roll and ignore the target’s concealment. If you’re using a
firearm with the kickback trait, you don’t take the normal
circumstance penalty to this Strike for not having the
required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.
VANTAGE SHOT
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter take advantage of each other’s attacks
to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against
your follow-up attack. When you successfully make a
ranged Strike against a foe, your spotter can use a reaction
to attempt a Stealth check against the foe’s Perception DC.
On a success, the foe is flat-footed against the spotter’s next
attack before the end of your spotter’s next turn. Similarly,
when your spotter successfully makes a ranged Strike
against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a Stealth
check against the foe’s Perception DC. On a success, the foe
is flat-footed against your next attack against them before
the end of your next turn.
TAG TEAM [reaction]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
Trigger You or your spotter misses with a Strike against
a creature, and the creature is within the other’s melee
reach or first range increment.
Your skilled teamwork with your spotter enables you both
to assist one another when you falter, using either other’s
failures as opportunities to strike. If you used Tag Team after
your spotter missed the triggering Strike, make a ranged
Strike against the same target with a –2 penalty. If you used
this reaction after you missed the triggering Strike, your
spotter can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged
Strike against the same target. Strikes granted by this feat
don’t count toward your or your spotter’s multiple attack
penalty and your or your spotter’s multiple attack penalty
doesn’t apply to the granted Strike.
EAGLE EYES
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
VISUAL
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one
another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither
of you is flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking
creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level
or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help
their allies flank.
CONCENTRATED ASSAULT
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter combine your efforts to bring down your
target. If you and your spotter both use the Ready activity
to make a Strike against the same opponent and choose the
same trigger for the readied action, resolve your attacks at
the same time. Each of you can use the higher of the two
attack rolls for your Strikes, each using your own modifier;
this is a fortune effect. If both attacks are successful, total
the damage for both attacks for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses.
CHOOSING A SPOTTER
The most important aspect when choosing a spotter
for the sniping duo archetype is the out of character
component; make sure you team up with another
player who is excited about the idea of roleplaying
out teamwork and coordination in combat, and with
granting you benefits and gaining benefits from you. The
mechanics of the archetype are not very demanding of
your spotter’s actions, but that still doesn’t mean every
player is interested in the narrative component.
Mechanically, a good spotter is likely either another
ranged attacker or a melee attacker, and depending
on the type of spotter you choose, certain feats might
become more or less enticing. For instance, Targeted
Redirection is more useful with a melee spotter.

Spellshot
(Class Archetype)
Rarity Uncommon
Spellshots aren’t ordinary gunslingers. They come from
a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they
temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots
combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create
a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots,
enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the
world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots
tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code
and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive
crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns,
the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts
of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together
by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that
defined how one should behave while using these powerful
weapons. You can find more information about star guns,
the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code on page 206.
Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as
the stories describing the relevant skills and training to
become one have been passed down over the generations.
Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these
tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques
to channel magical energy through their firearms in
imitation of the Regents’ arcane methods. While Arcadia
is home to the vast majority of the world’s spellshots, the
techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However,
spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea
region due to the unique history of guns there and their
connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists
in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.
WAY OF THE SPELLSHOT (1ST)
You’ve learned the intricacies of magic and technology,
blending the two together with deadly results. You
combine a knowledge of arcane theories with a strong
connection to your chosen weapon that allows you to
manifest unique effects, though your knowledge doesn’t
extend as far as actual spellcasting. You can imbue
energy into your weapon and conjure bullets from thin
air. As you progress, you eventually learn to phase bullets
through walls or even to teleport yourself along the path
of your bullets. You must select Spellshot Dedication as
your 2nd-level class feat.
Prerequisites: You must be a gunslinger.
Spellshot Adjustments: Instead of choosing a way
from the options listed in the gunslinger class, you have
the way of the spellshot. It has the following way skill,
slinger’s reload, and deeds. You gain these abilities at the
same levels as normal for the class. You use Intelligence
for your class DC.

everything but your target. Make a crossbow or firearm Strike against a foe
who’s observed or hidden to you (but not undetected). The ammunition travels
to your target in a straight line, passing through any non‑magical barriers
or walls in its way, though magical barriers and force effects stop the
bullet. The shot ignores all cover, the concealed condition, the hidden
condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a
+4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The
Strike’s damage can’t be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using
a non‑magical shield.

Sharpshooter
“Oh would you look at that, there’s a bunch of bullet
holes around here... so that’s what all the ruckus was
about! Six... seven... eight of you, huh? Oh, but did you
notice the northern finch over there in that tree a minute
ago? Its nest is up there, but I think all those gunshots
startled it. You think you could quiet down so maybe it’ll
come back?”
–Viri, gnome ornithologist, just before a series of
strange accidents mysteriously took down a hardened
bandit squad of eight former Alkenstar veterans.
Some people say you must be the luckiest soul in all of
Golarion to still be alive and kicking after all the dangers
you’ve seen. Others say that, given the circumstances
and the number of foes who you’ve defeated seemingly
by accident, that there’s no way you can really be as
incompetent as you seem. These critics claim there has
to be some kind of angle, some racket you’re running.
Either way, you sure don’t look or act dangerous, except
possibly to yourself.
Somehow, despite your apparent clumsiness, professed
confusion, and known propensity to incite calamity, you
find yourself standing after every battle. The same can’t
often be said for your enemies. Funny how that works
out, isn’t it?

Prerequisites trained in Deception, Unexpected Sharpshooter
Dedication
Frequency once per hour
Requirements Your previous action was a ranged weapon
Strike that missed a foe within 60 feet.
Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction
that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet
knocks your foe’s weapon away or they stumble over stray
debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a Deception
check to attempt to Shove, Trip, or Disarm the foe you missed.
CHAIN REACTION [three-actions]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You fire your gun once, creating a devastating and
unpredictable chain of events; perhaps your bullet strikes
exactly the right spot on a water tower, causing it to
flood and incite a stampede of horses which knock over a
lantern that sets a city on fire. Whatever the exact chain
reaction, and no matter how improbable, the indiscriminate
catastrophe creates significant challenges for your enemies
across a wide area while leaving everyone else alone.
Make a Strike with a ranged weapon, and if you hit, you
can make another Strike at a target within 30 feet of the
first target. If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a
third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on,
continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at
any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack.
However, you can’t target the same creature more than once;
each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you
haven’t made a Strike against yet during this particular use of
Chain Reaction.
This damage is caused by some improbable set of events
that injures one target after another, rather than from
actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree
branch that then fell on the targets, or one target’s scream
caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot
themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target
suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical
ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes
the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage
is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However,
the GM might choose to change the damage type based on
their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one
target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage
instead of physical damage.
SKILLED OR LUCKY?
Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected
sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how
your character achieves their surprising success. Your
character at first seems like they bumble into their
successes through sheer circumstance. However, when
the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect
another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly
so incredible that they not only achieve impressive
results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind
a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be
true about your character, or some combination of
both. You might decide the truth together with the GM
as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until
later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at
hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good
choice for a character who’s secretly more powerful or
skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities
for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of
the campaign.
If your inclination is to play a character who hides
their abilities, consider training in the Deception
skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and
Confabulator that emphasize your character’s crafty
nature and skill at concealing their true intent.
If you instead prefer to play a character who’s
legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky,
you might choose to pursue actions that have a high
chance of earning you a Hero Point. You could also
consider taking abilities with the fortune or misfortune
traits, such as Halfling Luck or Harbinger’s Caw.

Black powder weapons have many permutations
throughout history, from simple, handheld affairs
built for self-defense to mighty cannons designed
to blast holes in castle walls and fortifications. In
the world in which you, the reader, live, the history
of firearms followed a meandering course around
the globe, developing in a slow and uneven arc with
many dead-ends and tributaries of varying success and
longevity. On Golarion, a world of spells and myths,
creatures and cataclysms, this developmental arc is
even more diverse, with unexpected leaps forward and
unique variations incorporating elements only possible
in a world of magic and fantastical creatures.
This chapter will showcase a variety of firearms.
Some have historical inspirations, while others are
more unusual black powder weapons, never seen
on Earth due to the differences in the two worlds’
technological advancements, historical eras, and
societal shifts. We’ve also included a short segment
here to talk about the ways in which the development,
spread, and evolution of firearms on Golarion differs
significantly from those on Earth.
Firearms on Golarion
Golarion’s guns come from three different continents
and have spread to at least two more, with each
devising their own particular style and gunsmithing
techniques. In Tian Xia, the birthplace of black powder,
GUNS EQUIPMENT
The greatest lesson I’ve learned from my dwarf allies is that progress and innovation
demand patience and iteration. In a few short years I have grown a duchy from a blasted
desert with the gift of my ambition, but it shall outlast me thanks to the gifts our patient
dwarven neighbors have laboriously engineered. These weapons, these “guns,” named for
this dwarven kingdom, were meticulously crafted one painstaking piece at a time over
decades. High King Arunak told me once that she personally built the firing mechanism of
the weapon she carries today nearly 50 years past, hand crafting each component dozens,
even hundreds, of times until she made the most perfect version of each part.
When I showed her the first of the weapons forged by my own hands—a heavy,
handheld affair with three barrels and a sliding catch mechanism so that multiple shots
could be prepared and easily reloaded even when carrying a sword or shield—I thought
she would be dismayed or even disappointed by my hubris. But instead, she smiled
and acknowledged what we both knew in our hearts to be true. “We shall be stronger
together than we could ever hope to be apart.”
When I’m gone, if Arunak’s heir and my distant successor have kept the dream we kindled
together alive, may liches and monsters quake in fear of the weapons we have wrought.
Let humans and dwarves challenge villains with weapons of defiance forged by countless
lives dedicated toward a single purpose. Let the dragons beware—here, there be guns!
—Ancil Alkenstar, the first Duke of Alkenstar
gunslingers tend to prefer more versatile weapons,
such as the modular hand cannon and the fire lance, a
precursor to the more complex combination weapons
presented later in this chapter.
In Arcadia, home to millennia-old guns that use
magic rather than science to propel their ammunition,
multiple traditions and lineages exist, none of which
used the black powder essential to other continents’
firearms. Arcadian firearms range from the mystical
beast guns to the scientifically produced air guns, as
well as the legendary star guns that inspire the hearts
of Arcadians even now, thousands of years after the
secrets of their creation were lost to time.
In Garund, the forges of Dongun Hold and Alkenstar
billow smoke and flame night and day as industrious
smiths constantly innovate, developing new varieties
of guns and creating special customizations and
attachments to improve nearly any firearm.
You can find more information on all these regions in
The Rotating Gear chapter starting on page 186.
THE BIRTH OF GUNS
While Arcadia has had firearms for millennia longer
than any other continent, these didn’t use black
powder at all. The first firearms, beast guns, and star
guns worked purely via magical processes. The many
wards and magical anomalies that guard passage
to Arcadia’s shores have kept beast and star guns

relatively contained over the millennia. These same
barriers to travel have also sheltered Arcadia from
many of the worst catastrophes to wrack other parts
of Golarion, so the continent’s gunsmithing techniques
and traditions have grown more slowly and along
more focused paths tied to ritual hunts and ceremonial
weapons forged from skymetals and magic.
One of the most significant innovations in technological
firearms to come from Arcadia, though it has fallen into
relative obscurity on the continent in modern days, was
the development of air guns: lower-impact firearms
fired using compressed air stored in specially crafted
cartridges. Sealed with a wax stopper that is punctured
and resealed by the gun’s firing mechanism, these
relatively lightweight and efficient containers could
be combined with cartridges containing metal balls or
darts. Due to their inexpensive nature and ease of use,
they were a staple of Arcadian hunters for many years,
until the techniques to create beast guns and imitation
star guns became more affordable to those who admired
and desired these weapons for themselves.
Compared to black powder firearms, air weapons
are far less volatile and don’t have any problems with
water, but their destructive potential is also much lower.
Black powder firearms, however, are virtually unknown
in Arcadia. Beast guns and new magical guns patterned
after the ancient star guns are powerful and effective,
lessening any desire for black powder weapons, and the
barriers to trade cut both ways.
Beast guns were the earliest firearms created in Arcadian
history, first invented well over 10,000 years ago. Star
guns, too, predated Earthfall, created by a mysterious
and isolated group called the Crowned Regents. These
in turn inspired air guns, as well as imitation star guns
created with skymetals scattered across the continent by
Earthfall. Though limited trade exists between Arcadia
and Tian Xia, it’s unlikely that Tian Xia’s weaponry took
any cues from Arcadian firearms; hand cannons and
fire lances are distinct from Arcadian weaponry, with
similarities between the weapon designs and innovations
of the two continents only appearing long after their
respective gunsmithing traditions were well established.
ADVENT OF BLACK POWDER
For the rest of Golarion outside Arcadia, black powder
preceded firearms, and was first discovered by alchemists
in Tian Xia, perhaps as a secret negotiated from a
dragon’s hoard if the legends are to be believed. As
fireworks, rockets, hand cannons, fire lances, hwachas,
and other black powder innovations became known in
various cities across the continent, an interest in trade
arose, most prominently from Tian Xia’s neighboring
western continent of Casmaron and the Impossible
Kingdoms of Vudra.
The Dragon Empire of Lung Wa was in ascendance
across much of Tian Xia, however, and had a
near-monopoly on black powder technology. The
empire was cautious of other continents in general
and was thus understandably hesitant to provide these
secrets beyond their borders, where they could get
into the hands of potential enemies and increase their
future military might. However, Vudran negotiators
were enthusiastic and persuasive, offering ever-moreenticing gifts and wonders, and at last Lung Wa
acquiesced, gifting a significant amount of black powder
to their Vudran neighbors, along with a formula to
make more. However, a secret that the Vudrans never
learned, even many centuries later, was that their Tian
trading partners traded them a watered-down version
of the black powder formula—much more stable but
also less powerful and, therefore, less threatening to
their hegemony.
There’s no indication that black powder technology
ever reached Arcadia through their limited trade
interactions with Tian Xia. Unlike the Vudran
negotiators who wanted to learn the formula at any
cost, it’s likely that Arcadian traders would’ve seen
little value in obtaining a technology clearly more
volatile and unreliable than their own.
For many years, the black powder trade was
primarily locked between Tian Xia and Casmaron.
Vudra, on the other hand, found many innovative uses
for the modified black powder formula they received,
which turned out to be much more stable than the
original. This in turn allowed them to trade farther
and wider than Tian merchants were allowed, and
without fear of their wagons or ships exploding. This
ultimately facilitated Vudran trade in both directions
and, most notably, introduced the Vudran formula for
black powder to the continent of Garund.
DONGUN HOLD AND THE FORMATION OF INDUSTRY
Before sealing their gates for what they believed would
be the final time to defend against a war between
archwizards that threatened their very existence, the
dwarves of Dongun Hold made a critical trade with
their Kulenett cousins. Kulenett dwarves had obtained
several casks of black powder from Vudrani traders
and brought it to the Hold, using a combination of
underground and overland routes to safely navigate
the war spreading across the regions. Surprisingly, the
Kulenett dwarves had no idea that their cousin nation
would ultimately turn these casks into the foundation

for a technological revolution. Knowing that Dongun
Hold’s access to the surface was being closed with
the intent to never reopen, the Kulenett provided the
black powder with the intent that it could serve as a
food preservative that would also give the foodstuffs a
peppery bite when eventually consumed. The powder’s
explosive properties were an incidental reality, though
not one that went unnoticed in Dongun Hold.
Over the following centuries, dwarves of Dongun
Hold learned to recreate and then further perfect
several of their own new recipes for black powder,
eventually recreating the stronger and more volatile
blend kept secret in Tian Xia. Their discoveries as
they experimented led to better explosives for mining,
powerful black powder traps to protect their tunnels,
and ultimately, their first modern black powder
firearms. Dedicated perfectionists who had already
survived one war while under constant threat from
Darklands factions, Dongun Hold dwarves innovated
rapidly, producing pistols and muskets in various
forms and configurations and soon creating entire
elite military units of long gun–wielding snipers and
armored vanguards with blunderbusses.
The forges and processes for arming the soldiers of
Dongun Hold would later expand dramatically when
a human wanderer by the name of Ancil Alkenstar
sought, and received, audience with High King Anong
Arunak of Dongun Hold, spurring yet another leap
forward in the development of firearms. As Dongun
Hold’s surface-facing gates opened for the first time in
millennia and the duchy of Alkenstar was established,
human ingenuity met with dwarven craftsmanship
for the first time in the history of firearms and black
powder on Golarion. The result was an explosive
period of discovery and growth in firearm technology.
This period bred innovations like the crank-handle
pepperbox and threaded breech for quickly reloading
arquebuses, making firearms both more accessible and
more practical for use as personal defense weapons.
The arquebus in particular became perhaps one of
the most favored weapons for both military and
personal use against the enormous monstrosities that
haunt the Mana Wastes. The name arquebus refers
to the hooked mechanisms usually attached to the
underside of the weapons and used to mount them on
defensive fortifications as a means of mitigating their
enormous kickback.
FIREARMS ON MODERN GOLARION
Today, firearms are still relatively uncommon across
Golarion and only available from less than a handful
of sources in the Inner Sea. However, magic and
clockwork technologies have advanced and evolved
firearm innovations in unique and remarkable ways
only possible on a world like Golarion. While many
of the firearms currently produced in Golarion share
names and basic functions with counterparts from
Earth’s history, they often feature mechanisms that
weren’t uncovered until later in our history and
refinements that never happened or never proliferated.
On Earth, such firearms were discarded predominantly
in favor of more advanced technology that Golarion
has not yet discovered how to reproduce or has had no
need to replicate.
In Alkenstar, most firearms are crafted with a
flintlock firing mechanism and folding breech, a hinged
barrel that allows the weapon to be quickly opened
and reloaded with new prepackaged paper cartridges
of powder and shot. Alkenstar also hosts a thriving
industry of smiths who focus their ingenuity and
creativity on singular elements of firearms, such as
specialized firing mechanisms and scopes both magical
and scientific in nature and function.
In Dongun Hold, the steady and methodical process
of iteration and refinement continues, spurred on by
a determination not to be shown up by their human
neighbors in Alkenstar and to retain their reputation
as the preeminent gunsmiths on Golarion. The
scatterguns produced in Dongun Hold are some of
the most powerful and sought-after firearms in the
Inner Sea, using a simple but ingenious clockwork
system built directly into the weapon to eject a firing
FIREARMS AND ACCESS
In the world of Golarion, firearms and black powder
weaponry remain largely limited to specific regions.
In Avistan, reckless scientists and innovative undead
hunters in the nation of Ustalav have championed a
technological renaissance, spurring the development of
basic but effective muskets copied off Alkenstar originals
and, in the process, creating a burgeoning market for
silver bullets and bayonets. In the Shackles, Motaku Isle
Ironworks continues to pump out shoddy, but deadly,
replicas of firearms and cannons stolen from Alkenstar,
as well as create new (usually unstable) black powder
weaponry. Alkenstar itself boasts the premier black
powder gunsmiths on the planet and is the undisputed
center of modern innovation for firearm accessories.
In Tian Xia, the nations of Goka, Ling Shen, Po Li, and
Quain have long worked with black powder, using it to
spur other technological advancements. The continent
of Arcadia has seen decades of relatively uninterrupted
peace and might contain more gunslingers than the rest
of Golarion combined, though their firearms are a more
diverse array of magical star guns, technological air
guns, and ceremonial beast guns, with no black powder
whatsoever. Characters from these regions have access
to the gunslinger class and firearms. Other than Arcadia,
they have access to black powder siege weapons if
the GM has opened up siege weapons as an option for
the campaign.

tray that wielders can load with powder and shot and
then quickly prep to fire with minimal effort. Many
dwarves of Dongun Hold have gone so far as to retire
the signatory clan daggers of their extended family
units, replacing them with clan pistols to showcase
the family’s gunsmithing skills. The most proud and
unyielding families might even refuse to acknowledge
that a child has reached adulthood until they craft
their own clan pistol designed in accordance with the
family’s exacting standards.
In Casmaron and Vudra, firearms obtained from
either Garund or Tian Xia are held in high regard and
often become family heirlooms, particularly among
families of merchants and guards. Because it’s difficult
to obtain replacement parts for these weapons, the
jezail has become a particularly common weapon of
choice. Typically starting from the barrel and firing
mechanism of a long gun, such as a musket or even
an arquebus, a jezail has a stock handcrafted by each
successive owner, customized to their grip and build
for maximum utility and often accented with artistic
patterns that celebrate the owner’s, or their family’s,
history and accomplishments.
Arcadia’s
modern
firearms
include
magical
innovations alongside technological ones, making them
just as mystical as their ancient predecessor weapons.
Beast guns in particular have benefitted from millennia
to perfect the rituals and magic used to create them,
allowing for the creation of several types of beast guns
with powerful effects or longer range compared to
most black powder firearms.
REVOLVERS AND WORLD WAR I–ERA WEAPONS
A small number of weapons that are more advanced
than anything that can be reproduced on Golarion
have found their way into Golarion from time to time.
In a few Adventure Paths, player characters have the
opportunity to travel to other worlds where modern
weaponry is available. The assumption is that some
of these revolvers, World War I–era weapons, and
other devices may have made their way into the hands
of collectors throughout Golarion, but never in a
significant enough quantity to be considered anything
other than absolute rarities.
Because these weapons, and the ammunition used
to fire them, aren’t something that can be reliably
reproduced on Golarion, statistics for them aren’t
included in this book. A GM looking to introduce these
types of guns has several options to choose from, but
before you begin, it’s important to note that doing so
can have an imbalanced effect. The guns of Golarion
are designed to work well along the other weapons
in the world, giving you more options that each have
power in certain situations. Firearms with additional
advantages would simply be more powerful than
anything else available, potentially raising damage
output significantly while negatively impacting an
array of other gunslinger options.
For a mechanical expression that works similarly
to a cartridge-fed rifle, a GM might look at creating
a non-magical version of the Rowan Rifle (page 166)
with the repeating trait. However, the resulting weapon
would be more powerful than an advanced firearm, so
it’s not recommended. For a GM looking to create a
revolver, a similar mechanical expression might result
from adding the repeating trait to the dueling pistol,
but again, this would make it more powerful than an
advanced firearm, so it isn’t recommended.
An option that might work better if you’re
interested in using newer, more modern guns as the
main firearms in your campaign is to instead adjust
the baseline expectations for them. Being able to load
the breech-loading weapons included in this book
with just a single Interact action is a pretty big stretch,
created to make them more fun to use than a simulated
reality, but if you want to use more modern guns in
your setting, you can just say that breech loaders take
a more realistic time to reload (making them very weak
compared to other weapons), and then use the statistics
currently listed for a pepperbox as a revolver instead.
This option will have no knock-on implications that
throw off the weapon balance in your game, but it’s
an all-or-nothing choice that’s only appropriate if
modern firearms are the ones that are mainly used in
your world.
The final option you might consider to handle these
firearms is to create statistics for specific magical
versions of certain modern guns and say those were the
only expressions of those guns available to be found.
This allows you to give the gun enhanced statistics
without causing any problems because the weapon
starts out at a significantly higher level and is unable
to add property runes, whereas other weapons can add
property runes to gain additional benefits.
BLACK POWDER PRESERVATIVES?
On both Golarion and Earth, black powder contains
elements that can help preserve and even season food.
On Earth in the early 1800s, Napoleon Bonaparte is said
to have used gunpowder to season and preserve horse
meat to feed his wounded troops when supplies were
particularly low after a major battle. On Golarion, this
same technique has been used in years past by Casmar
and Vudrani traders, when storms or other events
threatened to spoil rations or even cause the black
powder itself to go to waste. Today, the demand for black
powder across the Inner Sea is high enough, and the
availability of black powder from Tian Xia low enough,
that the practice is largely discontinued. Preserving or
seasoning your rations with black powder would be akin
to salting a steak with gold!

================================================================================
PAGE 151
================================================================================

The following rules cover the use of firearms and
includes the firearms and ammunition types available.
All firearms are subject to misfires if they’re not properly
maintained, as described in the sidebar.
The clan pistol and dwarven scattergun have the dwarf
trait, the mithral tree has the elf trait, and the flingflenser
has the goblin trait. However, feats such as Dwarven
Weapon Familiarity, which normally grants access to all
uncommon weapons with the dwarf trait, don’t grant
access to firearms with the listed traits unless the character
separately has access to firearms. For instance, dwarves
who’ve never seen a firearm and then train in traditional
dwarven weapons don’t have access to clan pistols and
dwarven scatterguns. You can find more information on
this and other firearm access details on page 148.
AMMUNITION
Firearms require ammunition consisting of a projectile
and black powder. A round of ammo can vary in its
composition but is typically either a prepackaged paper
cartridge, including wadding, bullet, and black powder,
or loose shot packed in manually. Some weapons,
like hand cannons and blunderbusses, can fire other
materials, but their ammunition has the same Price due
to the cost of the black powder. Because making rounds
of firearm ammunition requires creating black powder,
you need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to make
them. Firearm rounds are a valid option for magical
ammunition, just like arrows or bolts. Crafting magical
firearm ammunition requires you to be able to craft
both alchemical and magical items.
WEAPON TRAITS
These weapons include the following traits, in addition
to any described in the Core Rulebook.
Capacity: Weapons that have the capacity trait
typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of
containing a round of ammunition. Capacity is always
accompanied by a number indicating the number of
barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired,
you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an
Interact action that doesn’t require a free hand. Each
barrel or chamber can be reloaded after it’s fired as a
separate Interact action.
CLASSIC FIREARMS
Concealable: This weapon is designed to be
inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide
or conceal a weapon with this trait.
Concussive: These weapons smash as much as
puncture. When determining a creature’s resistance or
immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker
of the target’s resistance or immunity to piercing or
bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune
to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to
bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from
a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all
physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.
Double Barrel: This weapon has two barrels that are
each loaded separately. You can fire both barrels of a
double barrel weapon in a single Strike to increase the
size of the weapon damage die by one step. If the weapon
has the fatal trait, this increases the size of the fatal die by
one step as well.
Fatal Aim: It’s possible to hold the stock of this weapon
under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand as
long as the other hand isn’t holding a weapon, shield, or
anything else you would need to move and position, to
ensure the weapon doesn’t slip out from under your arm.
However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make
fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands,
it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding
the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly
more complicated than just releasing one hand from the
weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must
do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as
part of reloading.
Kickback: A kickback weapon is extra powerful and
difficult to use. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional
damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a
–2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters
with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a
kickback weapon to stabilizers can lower or negate this
penalty (page 182).
Modular: The weapon has multiple configurations
that you can switch between using an Interact action.
Typically, switching between configurations of a modular
weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed
in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s

Repeating: Repeating weapons can’t be loaded
with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows
and firearms can; instead, they require a magazine of
specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special
slot. Once the magazine is in place, the ammunition is
automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to
fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry
(typically 0).

When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must
be loaded, which requires a free hand and three Interact
actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new
magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). As with
other types of reloading that take multiple actions, these
actions don’t need to be consecutive.
Scatter: This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide
spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating
the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of an
attack with a scatter weapon takes the listed damage, and
the target and all other creatures within the listed radius
around it take 1 splash damage per weapon damage die.
FIREARMS CRITICAL SPECIALIZATION
This book introduces the firearm weapon group, which
has the following critical specialization effect.
Firearm: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
against your class DC or be stunned 1.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
Each of the weapons listed in Table 4–1: Melee Weapons
and Table 4–2: Ranged Weapons are detailed below.
Air Repeater: A thin-barreled firearm that uses a
container of pressurized air instead of black powder to
propel small metal bullets from an attached cartridge,
the air repeater has fallen out of common use in Arcadia
due to its poor stopping power, though it’s still used
occasionally for casual hunting and sport shooting. The
air repeater and its longer-ranged, two-handed variant are
still valued by some for their ability to allow a shooter to
fire multiple rounds without needing to stop to reload or
crank to a new chamber. A typical air repeater magazine
holds 6 pellets.
Arquebus: This is a long rifle that offers more range
than the average firearm, though the long barrel and
ferocious kickback make the weapon particularly
unsteady unless a tripod or other stand is used to stabilize
it. The arquebus is one of the most commonly used long
guns among the soldiers of Dongun Hold and Alkenstar.
Bayonet: This blade or spike can be attached to a
crossbow or firearm but, unlike other attached weapons,
can be wielded in one hand as its own weapon. When
used as a separate weapon, it can’t benefit from any runes
or abilities that function only for attached weapons.
Blunderbuss: This weapon fires pellets from a
trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an excellent choice for
hunting brush fowl or dealing damage within a short, broad
area. Adventuring gunslingers often carry a blunderbuss to
deal with swarms of vermin and similar threats.
Clan Pistol: The tradition of dwarves displaying their
clan affiliations with special clan daggers goes back
millennia, but many of the dwarf clans of Dongun Hold
have their own take on the tradition, with promising
young gunsmiths claiming their adulthood by crafting
a specialized personal firearm using the clan’s unique
smithing traditions. Losing or being forced to surrender
their clan pistol is a terrible embarrassment for the
dwarves that carry them.
Coat Pistol: This small pistol is easily concealed inside
a jacket or some other article of clothing. Rarely kept as
a primary weapon, coat pistols are equally favored by
clever assassins and traveling Alkenstar aristocrats.
Double-Barreled Musket: This flintlock breech-loader
has two side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate
than a standard musket, a double-barreled musket
offers versatility in firing options. Many of Alkenstar’s
famous shield marshals save their earnings to buy a
double-barreled musket as their first personal firearm.
Double-Barreled Pistol: This flintlock pistol has two
side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate than a standard
pistol, a double-barreled pistol is a useful and versatile
weapon. It’s generally banned in areas where duels with
pistols are relatively common, in much the same way that
arriving at an aristocratic duel with a scattergun would
be considered crass, at best.
Dragon-Mouth Pistol: Similar to the blunderbuss,
a dragon-mouth pistol fires pellets from a flared
barrel. Though less powerful than a blunderbuss, the
dragon-mouth pistol is appreciated for its portability
and one-handed design. Though the name was coined
because of the destructive belch of this handheld scatter
weapon, many gunsmiths craft dragon-mouth pistols
with elaborate embellishments that resemble a stylized
dragon’s maw framing the barrel.
Dueling Pistol: Made for settling disputes when
diplomacy fails, dueling pistols are finely crafted and
made to fit easily into a holster or pocket. Noble and
wealthy merchants in both Alkenstar and Dongun Hold
often own matching pairs of dueling pistols in case
they’re called upon to address a challenge—though this
practice has become increasingly rare in the modern age.
MISFIRES
Firearms that are improperly maintained or subjected to
unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt to fire a firearm
that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn’t been
cleaned since then, roll a DC 5 flat check before making
your attack roll. If you fail this misfire check, the weapon
misfires and jams. The attack is an automatic critical
failure, and you must use an Interact action to clear the
jam before you can reload the weapon and fire again.
Once you have spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon,
you don’t need to roll for a misfire until the next day
unless an effect says otherwise. You can clean multiple
firearms during this hour, up to a reasonable limit as
determined by the GM (typically no more than five).
Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as part of
their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an
attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed
attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a
critical failure.

GEARS
Dwarven Scattergun: A favored weapon of dwarf
scouts from Dongun Hold, the dwarven scattergun is a
powerful weapon designed to take advantage of a dwarf’s
sturdy frame. A dwarven scattergun fires a large paper
cartridge stuffed with black powder and knuckle-sized
lumps of metal, creating a devastating burst so destructive
that a foolish dwarf might find themself catching
painful ricochets when firing at a too-close target. Some
scatterguns are crafted with a clockwork firing tray that
can quickly sort and load black powder and shot without
needing a prepackaged cartridge, though this is largely an
aesthetic feature with no real mechanical benefit.
Fire Lance: This amazingly simple projectile weapon
is nothing more than a metal tube packed with black
powder and a stopper, attached to the sharpened head of
a javelin. A loaded fire lance can be wielded as a normal
spear, though it requires an Interact action to regrip the
weapon and hold it properly when switching from one
use to another. Fire lances are most commonly found in
Tian Xia, though occasionally one makes its way all the
way to Avistan, typically in the hands of a Tien mercenary
or caravan guard.
Flingflenser: A flingflenser is a
goblin-designed weapon ending in
an ovoid tube with a hatch and
handle on the narrow end.
A cluster of circular
blades held together
and attached to a
black powder packet
with a thin leather strap
serves as ammunition and is
loaded through the hatch before
being fired with a flintlock or other external ignition
mechanism. The flingflenser’s sturdy design also places it
among the more reliable goblin weapons.
Flintlock Musket: The most commonly available of
firearms in Alkenstar, the flintlock musket includes an
external firing mechanism and an efficient and relatively
compact frame. Though lacking the range and firing
power of the arquebus preferred by Alkenstar and
Dongun Hold’s military members, the flintlock musket is
popular among civilians for its ease of use.
Flintlock Pistol: Though less accurate and powerful
than a flintlock musket, the flintlock pistol is a preferred
weapon of privateers thanks to its more compact size and
affordability. Pirate captains often wear a brace of such
pistols in a bandolier so they can draw and fire without
stopping to reload.
Forked Bipod: Developed by Alkenstar scouts who
often don’t have time to break down a tripod when beset
by the chaotic mutant monsters of the Mana Wastes, this
two-pronged stabbing weapon can be used as a bipod to
stabilize a gun with potent kickback. A forked bipod can
be deployed or retrieved for use as a melee weapon as an
Interact action.
Hand Cannon: Popular among privateers and
mercenaries in Goka, hand cannons are little more than
a hardened tube with a handle and external ignition
attached. A hand cannon can be used to fire almost
anything that can be packed into its barrel. The wielder
of a hand cannon can change the damage type granted
by its modular trait as part of the same Interact action
used to reload.
Harmona Gun: A favored weapon of monster hunters
in Arcadia, the harmona gun is a large-bore long gun that
fires a heavy, slow-moving round. The gun got its name
due to the eerie similarity between the buzzing sound its
oversized projectiles make flying through the air and the
flight of a fey bird called a harmona.
Jezail: Jezails are simple, efficient long guns developed
in Casmaron that typically feature a custom stock and
a flintlock firing mechanism. Though lacking the range
and stopping power of an arquebus or the raw force of
a harmona gun, the jezail is an elegant, well-balanced
weapon suitable for a variety of combat
situations. It’s even possible to tuck it
under one arm to fire a less accurate
attack that uses only one hand.
Knuckle Duster: This bit of
hardened metal, favored by street
toughs, is typically made of brass
and features four finger holes so
that it can sit atop the knuckles, adding
extra power to a punch.
Long Air Repeater: Like the one-handed air
repeater, this thin-barreled firearm uses a container
of pressurized air instead of black powder to propel
small metal pellets from an attached cartridge. The long
air repeater has better range and ammo capacity than
the one-handed variant, though it still lacks significant
stopping power. A typical long air repeater magazine
holds 8 pellets.
Mithral Tree: Neither mithral nor a tree, this long gun
takes its name from the legends of the elves of Jinin and
is most commonly found within the nation. An elegant
weapon, a mithral tree does somewhat resemble a tree; its
fanned stock and long, sweeping barrel reinforced with
metal rings enable a wielder to parry melee attacks while
moving back into safe firing range.
Pepperbox: This weapon is a specialty of the smiths
of Alkenstar. The pepperbox has three barrels that each
hold a single shot, and the shooter can manually rotate
the whole barrel assembly to align a loaded barrel with
the firing mechanism.
Reinforced Stock: A reinforced stock is a weighted
crossbow, firearm haft, or grip customized for striking
in melee.
Slide Pistol: Also known as a harmonica gun,
this weapon is essentially a stock, trigger, and firing
mechanism attached to a sliding brace of barrels that can
each hold a round of ammunition.

While their power and rarity make Golarion firearms
fantastical in their own right, this hasn’t stopped
engineers, craftsman, and even fey smiths from attempting
to improve the weapons or create their own versions.
Whether these fantastic weapons include the beast guns
of Arcadia, the combination weapons wielded by gunners
of the Inner Sea seeking to stretch their meager supplies of
black powder, or the goblin-forged “cobbled firearms” of
the Shackles, Golarion is home to a diverse and unlikely
array of unusual black powder weapons.
Beast Guns
Arcadia’s history of gunsmithing goes back centuries,
and Arcadia may very well have been the first
continent on Golarion in which firearms were
developed. While Arcadia’s Deadshot Lands are
famous for their rare and prestigious skymetal
guns, patterned after the star guns of old,
more common in other regions are beast
guns, created as part of a long-standing rite
of passage.
While they don’t look much like
ancient star guns and use a different kind
of magic, beast guns are particularly
notable in that, like star guns, they rely
on magic rather than black powder.
Beast guns can produce unique effects
beyond simply damaging their targets.
Beast guns aren’t loaded with the
same ammunition as other guns, but
they do still use ammunition, rather
than shooting magical energy like
a star gun. This ammunition comes
as specially designed rounds, such as miniature
tentacles fired from the tentacle gun or javelin-like
spikes from the spike gun. Unless otherwise stated, these
rounds come in packs of 10 that cost 1 sp and have
light Bulk. The only weapon in this section that works
significantly differently is the growth gun, which grows
back a gob of its own ammunition once per round,
ensuring you always have enough ammunition to fire a
shot every round.
Monster hunters of all kinds roam Arcadia slaying
beasts and harvesting their body parts to produce new
beast guns, both new examples of established models and
brand new types never seen or imagined before. Even after
thousands of years, innovators expand the possibilities of
what a beast gun can do.
The following pages contain a small sample of the
many kinds of beast guns crafted in Arcadia. Each
beast gun is a specific magic item. You can find more
information on the ritual used in hunting the beasts to
create a beast gun on page 130.
FANTASY FIREARMS
BREATH BLASTER
ITEM 8+
UNCOMMON
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
A breath blaster is a +1 striking blunderbuss most commonly
crafted from the trachea of a dragon, though other creatures
with breath weapons or the ability to spit energy are
occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon’s trachea
allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the
form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.
A breath blaster’s Strikes deal either acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon
type or other creature from which it was made, though
it can otherwise be used like a normal
blunderbuss. A breath blaster also can
be activated to fire a line of energy in a
30-foot line or 15-foot cone, chosen when
it’s created and typically corresponding to the
shape of the breath weapon used by the type
of dragon or creature from which the breath
blaster was created.
In theory, the foundational techniques
required to create a breath blaster would
allow for other damage types, but such
breath blasters would require the trachea
from the correct dragon or creature type
and additional creation techniques, making such a
breath blaster rare rather than uncommon.
Activate [two-actions] Interact (evocation, magical); Frequency once
per minute; Effect You fire the breath blaster, dealing 4d6
damage of the appropriate type in the appropriate area.
Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 24 basic Reflex
save (or Fortitude save if the damage is poison).
Type breath blaster; Level 8; Price 500 gp
Type greater breath blaster; Level 14; Price 4,500 gp
The greater breath blaster’s activation deals 6d6 damage and
the DC is 31. It’s a +2 greater striking blunderbuss.
Type major breath blaster; Level 18; Price 24,000 gp
The major breath blaster’s activation deals 10d6 damage, the
DC is 38, and the area increases to either a 60-foot line or
a 30-foot cone, chosen when it’s created. It’s a +3 greater
striking blunderbuss.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include the
trachea of a ritually hunted dragon or other creature with a
breath weapon with the appropriate damage type and area
(line or cone) for the breath blaster.
DRAKE RIFLE
ITEM 4
UNCOMMON
EVOCATION

is a +1 weapon. It’s a distinct type of martial firearm that
deals 1d10 damage with a range increment of 150 feet and
reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage,
depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical
hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent
damage of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the
number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add
critical specialization effects.
Activate [three-actions] Interact (evocation, magical); Frequency
once per day; Effect You fire a large, specialized burst
designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike
with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn’t a critical
failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon
damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of
the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its
normal damage.
On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following
additional effects based on its damage type:
• Acid Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to
move. The target becomes sickened 1.
• Cold Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
• Electricity
Small
bursts
of
electricity continue to
spark and jolt the target.
The
target
becomes
dazzled and flat-footed
for 1d4 rounds.
• Fire
A
massive
explosion
knocks
the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from
you, and if it’s on the ground, it falls prone.
• Poison Noxious vapors fill the target’s lungs. The target
becomes enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 for 1 minute.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include
the saliva glands of a ritually hunted drake with a breath
weapon that deals the appropriate damage type for the
drake rifle.
GROWTH GUN
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 700 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 2
A growth gun is a +1 striking hand cannon made from the
regenerative flesh of a hydra, troll, or other similar creature. It
has an attached flesh sac that slowly replenishes one shot each
round and can be loaded like a normal round of ammunition. It
fires regenerating gobbets of flesh, bone, or teeth, determined
by the damage type selected for its modular trait. A growth
gun can be fired underwater, though it’s still limited by the
selected damage type as normal.
Activate [two-actions] Interact (magical, transmutation); Frequency once
per minute; Effect Make a ranged Strike. On a hit, the creature
becomes covered in a mass of flesh that continues to grow on
the target for a brief time. The creature becomes slowed 1 for

venom clings to the target and they take persistent poison
damage equal to 1d4 + the number of weapon damage dice.
A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects.
The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers
other creatures.
Activate [one-action] Interact (conjuration, magical); Frequency
once per round; Effect You fire a mass of webbing at
a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered
in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the
webbing from a spider gun can be cleared by a single
attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or
1 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically
fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature
in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters
the webbing during a move action, it must attempt
an Athletics check or Reflex save against DC 20. On a
success, it moves normally through the webbing and
clears away the webbing from any squares it enters
this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as
difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it’s

Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a spike launcher
is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A spike
launcher is a +1 striking weapon. It’s a distinct type of
martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the
backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range
increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical
specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the
firearm critical specialization.

once per day; Requirements The spike launcher is loaded;
Effect The spike launcher fires a volley of smaller spikes
in a 10-foot burst centered anywhere within its range.
Make a Strike with the spike launcher against each
creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the
creature to take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speed.
On a critical success, the creature becomes immobilized
instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent
creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike
and end the penalty or immobilized condition.

Cobbled Firearms
Goblins are nothing if not creative and adaptable, and
have a unique gift for recognizing an advantage when
they see one. Even with the relative rarity of firearms,
only the most secluded goblins are unaware of the deadly
metal tubes that fling death over long distances using
fire and explosive powder. The goblin gunsmiths of the
Motaku Isle Ironworks in Absalom’s Shackles constantly
experiment with new weapon designs using spare parts
from their clients’ weapons shipments and whatever
happens to be lying around. The more successful versions
of these junk guns often get added to the catalogue
of weapons available from the ironworks, while the
less effective ones usually kill their creators before the
unfortunate gunsmiths have a chance to iterate on
their designs. All cobbled firearms have the
cobbled trait, which causes them to
misfire on a failure.
The big boom gun and
spoon gun both have the
goblin trait. However, feats
such as Goblin Weapon Familiarity, which
normally grants access to all uncommon
weapons with the goblin trait, do not grant
access to firearms with the goblin trait unless the
character separately has access to firearms. You
can find more information on this and other firearm
access details on page 148.
MUNDANE COBBLED FIREARMS
Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions
of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks
alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access
to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you
can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand
cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand
cannons apply to both weapons.
SPOON GUN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
GOBLIN
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
No one’s entirely certain who
developed the spoon gun, but
all authorities agree that it was
probably a goblin. Essentially a terrible
idea in firearm form, the spoon gun is a
spring‑powered hand cannon with a modified
grip that uses miscellaneous knives, forks, chopsticks,
and spoons as ammunition. Users typically upend the entire
contents of their cutlery drawer into the gun, aim it in the
general direction of the foe, and hope it hits something.
This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple
weapon. It has the scatter (5 feet) trait and uses cutlery or
similar-sized objects as ammunition instead of bullets (enough
cheap cutlery to fire ten shots costs 1 sp).
BIG BOOM GUN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
GOBLIN
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 2
Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the ‘hand’
part of ‘hand cannon’, this comically-oversized gun has a
heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome
quantity of gunpowder.
This hand cannon is a martial weapon,
instead of a simple weapon. It has the
fatal d12 trait and a range of 20 feet. It also
has the following modified critical failure
condition:
Critical Failure The attack misses, the weapon
misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it
explodes in your face.
MAGICAL COBBLED FIREARMS
When you take the already volatile
technology of cobbled firearms and add unstable
evocation magic to the mix, you can be sure that
something either wonderful or terrifying is going to come
from it, and perhaps both at once. The liar’s gun is the
embodiment of that certainty. The liar’s gun is a specific
magic item.
LIAR’S GUN
ITEM 7
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
MAGICAL
Price 360 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This dubious weapon gets its name
from the fact that it’s typically
crafted with multiple false barrels
so that it’s more difficult for enemies
to predict the weapon’s angle of fire
from the four working barrels. Most of the time, this
gun functions as a +1 striking pepperbox with capacity 4
instead of capacity 3, albeit one with a complicated loading
mechanism involving rotating the barrels. In a pinch though,
all four of the real barrels can be fired simultaneously.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect Make up to four Strikes with
the liar’s gun. Each of the four Strikes must be against
a different target within a 20-foot cone. You apply and
increasing your multiple attack penalty for the four Strikes
only after resolving all attacks. If the weapon misfires on
any of these attacks, wait to apply the misfire until you
resolve all of the attacks.
ADDITIONAL TRAITS
The following new trait is applicable to all the weapons
in this section.
Cobbled: This firearm is cobbled together and likely to
misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it, on a failed
attack roll, the attack misses and you must roll a DC 5 flat
check. If you fail this check, the weapon misfires.

Combination Weapons
With the advent of firearms, there have been a number of
gunslingers, inventors, and alchemists who have created a
variety of combination weapons using black powder. The
explosive dogslicer, gnome amalgam musket, and three
peaked tree all have traits corresponding to an ancestry.
However, feats such as Elven Weapon Familiarity, which
normally grants access to all uncommon weapons with the
elf trait, do not grant access to firearms with the given trait
unless the character separately has access to firearms. You

COMBINATION WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
The weapons listed in Table 4–3: Uncommon Combination
Weapons are detailed below.
Axe Musket: This item, favored by firearms-using
dwarves and barbarians, takes the form of a sturdy musket
with an axeblade attached near the muzzle.
Black Powder Knuckle Dusters:
This pair of knuckle dusters is fitted
with an explosive charge of black
powder within the hollowed spikes of
the weapon and a firing mechanism you
hold in your hand while in use.
Cane Pistol: This fashionable cane’s handle
hides a dueling pistol fired through the thin, painted
cap at the bottom of the cane.
Dagger Pistol: This weapon, favored by rangers and
other wilderness wanderers, takes the form of a stoutly
built pistol with a dagger blade attached beneath the barrel
and extending out past the muzzle.
Explosive Dogslicer: An explosive dogslicer is a sneaky,
explosive weapon that often brings perverse joy to the
goblins who use them. At first glance, it appears to be a
triple-bladed dogslicer with an oversized guard.
Gnome Amalgam Musket: Rumored to be the result of
a gnomish dare to make a variant of a hooked hammer
that’s even more intricate and complex, this weapon adds
a musket to the mix of an already overcomplicated device.
Gun sword: This weapon consists of a large sword with
a powerful gun based on a harmona gun down the center.
Vanguards and other characters who rely on Strength
and Dexterity enjoy the power and
flexibility of a gun sword.
Hammer Gun: This weapon, favored
by dwarves and those who like smashing
and shooting, takes the form of a stoutly
built gun designed similarly to an arquebus
with a hammer head built into the muzzle,
decreasing kickback but limiting range.
Mace Multipistol: At first glance this weapon
looks like nothing more than an iron-bound club.
But the top of the weapon features a latch that opens
to reveal three rotating pistol muzzles concealed in the
mace’s head that can be fired and rotated using triggers
built into the weapon’s haft.
Piercing Wind: Favored by caravan guards who traverse
the Mana Wastes, a piercing wind is similar to a jezail,
in that you can carry it in one hand as long as the other
hand’s free, by holding it under one arm. Additionally, it’s
fitted with an underslung curved blade.
Rapier Pistol: This elegant weapon is shaped similarly
to a rapier with a pistol down the length of the blade.
Three Peaked Tree: A recently developed weapon created
for an elven champion from Jinin, the three-peaked tree can
be used as both a trident and a mithral tree. A three-peaked
tree has a length of silken rope attached to the butt of its
haft, allowing it to be quickly retrieved after thrown.
ADDITIONAL TRAITS
The following traits are applicable to various weapons in
this section.
Combination: Combination is a new trait for weapons
that combine the functionality of melee weapons and
firearms in unique or unusual ways. A combination
weapon has a firearm form or usage and a melee weapon
form or usage. Table 4–3: Uncommon Combination
Weapons lists the firearm statistics first and the melee
weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the
ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon
usage and the firearm usage requires an Interact
action. However, if your last action was a successful
melee Strike against a foe using a combination
weapon, you can make a firearm Strike with the
combination weapon against that foe without
fully switching to the firearm usage, firing the
firearm just as you hit with the melee attack. In this
case, the combination weapon returns to its melee
usage after the firearm Strike.
Since a combination weapon is one weapon with
two usages, both usages share any fundamental
runes. You can put a property rune on a combination
weapon as long as it’s appropriate for either of the two
usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property
rune’s requirements, the effects of the property rune only
apply for that usage. For instance, a vorpal axe musket
only applies the vorpal property rune when you are
using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination
weapons can’t have another weapon, such as a bayonet or
reinforced stock, attached to them.
Critical Fusion: Critical fusion is a new trait for
combination weapons that grants you two additional
options for their critical specialization effect when using
the combination weapon’s melee version to make a melee
attack while the firearm is loaded. If you choose to use
one of them, they replace the melee usage’s normal critical
specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm
to create a loud bang and concussion, using the
critical specialization effect for firearms instead
of the melee weapon group’s critical specialization
effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm
to increase the critical hit’s momentum or shoot the
foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2
additional damage per weapon damage die.
Both options discharge the firearm, which
typically means you have to reload it before
firing it again.
Tethered: This weapon is attached to a
length of rope or chain that allows you to
retrieve it after it’s left your hand. If you
have a free hand, you can use an Interact
action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you
have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been
disarmed (unless it’s being held by another creature).

Rare and Unique Magic
Firearms
While firearms are relatively uncommon in Golarion
and extremely unusual to encounter in the Inner
Sea region outside of a few specific areas, they are
nonetheless an attractive choice for use in crafting
unique signature weapons and other great works.
The fey of Arcadia created their own firearm in the
form of the Rowan Rifle to gift to their champions,
while in the Inner Sea heroes from several countries
and regions have traveled to Alkenstar to have their
trophies immortalized as part of a powerful and
unusual weapon.
The following are rare and unique specific magic
firearms, possessing unusual and sometimes outlandish
special effects. Some among these firearms are cursed,
haunted, or even intelligent. You can find more
information on cursed items on Gamemastery Guide
page 90, and more information on intelligent items
on Gamemastery Guide page 88. A haunted firearm
is simply a cursed firearm whose curse derives from a
confused, enraged, or tormented spirit attached
to the weapon. It is often possible, though
difficult, to discover and resolve the unfinished
business that will put that spirit to rest. In
this case, the firearm’s curse might be
forever lifted as the spirit goes free
to the afterlife, never to bother the
firearm’s wielder again.
CURSED FIREARMS
ARBOREAL’S REVENGE
ITEM 6
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This walnut and brass +1 striking blunderbuss has a natural
look, with wood worn smooth by time, but left knotted and
gnarled. The handgrip beneath the flared muzzle is a wellpositioned bulging tree knot, and the long stock looks as if it
was grown to fit you. On closer examination, the whorls and
rings in the wood resemble eyes.
Arboreal’s revenge is a haunted firearm constructed with
wood hewn from a living arboreal, slaying the arboreal and
trapping its spirit in the firearm. Perhaps a patient wielder
could one day put the arboreal’s spirit to rest, or at least come
to terms with it, abating the drawbacks of the weapon while
keeping its advantages.
When you first fire arboreal’s revenge, the blunderbuss
fuses with you, after which it’s almost impossible to remove it
from your possession with a remove curse or similar effect, like
many cursed items. You gain weakness 5 to fire and the flat
check for you to recover from persistent fire damage increases
from 15 to 17, or from 10 to 12 if you receive appropriate help.
Whenever you wield arboreal’s revenge, the arboreal
spirit bound to the blunderbuss attempts to overtake you.
The wood handgrip sprouts roots which grow around your
hand, binding both of your hands to the firearm. You gain a
+4 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending
against checks to Disarm you. However, you can’t Release
your grip on the blunderbuss until you forcibly tear off the
roots, though they do allow you to move your hands enough
(and only enough) to reload and fire the blunderbuss. Tearing
off the roots takes 1 minute.
The arboreal haunting the firearm can use the following
two effects whenever it wants, often using them at random.
You can coax it into performing them each intentionally once
per day, with the following activations.
Activate [free-action] command; Frequency once per day; Effect The
arboreal haunting the blunderbuss attempts to regrow
itself into a new physical body by sprouting from the
bodies of all the creatures that the firearm recently
harmed. You and all creatures within 60 feet damaged by
arboreal’s revenge within the last minute must attempt
a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. On a failure, they take
a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds as roots
rapidly sprout from their wounds, which lasts until they
Escape (DC 20).
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect You cast barkskin from the blunderbuss as a 2ndlevel primal spell. However,
the weakness to fire imposed
by barkskin is cumulative
with the weakness to fire
imposed by this weapon’s curse,
for a total of weakness 8 to fire.
IMMOLATION CLAN PISTOL
ITEM 10
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
FIRE
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This charred and blackened +2 striking clan pistol is coated
in a thick layer of soot and grease and its retort sounds
uncomfortably like a scream. Clearly at dangerous risk of
misfire, this weapon claimed the life of its dwarven crafter
shortly after completion and is haunted by that pained spirit.
This ever-burning spirit keeps the firearm warm to the touch,
regardless of surrounding environment.
No matter how much you clean and maintain it, an
immolation clan pistol is always at risk of a misfire, and
the flat check to avoid a misfire is DC 7 rather than DC 5.
On a misfire, an immolation hand cannon releases a blast
of concentrated fire, dealing you 2d6 fire damage and 2d6
persistent fire damage.
An immolation clan pistol fuses with you when you first
fire it. While you’re fused with the immolation clan pistol, the
pained spirit haunts your dreams, forcing you to relive its
death each night. If you fired the immolation clan pistol that
day, you are unharmed by these dreams. If you didn’t fire
the immolation clan pistol that day, but still possess it, you
awaken fatigued. If you no longer possess the immolation
clan pistol, the spirit of its dwarven smith is enraged by
your neglect; you awaken fatigued and aflame, taking 2d6
persistent fire damage.

Regardless, these nightmares possess clues to the spirit’s
life. If you take the immolation hand cannon to the site of its
creation and repair it with tools belonging to the tormented
spirit, you might be able to break the curse. If the spirit is set
free, this weapon becomes a +2 greater striking flaming hand
cannon with no other abilities or curses.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect You allow yourself to become partially possessed by
the immolated spirit bound to the hand cannon. For 1 minute,
you look like a flaming corpse. During this time, you gain a +2

cannon becomes a +2 striking flaming hand cannon.
PACT-BOUND PISTOL
ITEM 10
RARE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
EVIL
FIRE
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Wielded in over a hundred duels by the
famed Ustalavic noblewoman Countess
Tasya
Iserav,
this
+1 striking
fearsome dueling pistol (Advanced
Player’s Guide 260) is a work of
master
craftsmanship,
almost
eerie in the axiomatic perfection
present in each dimension and detail.
Commissioned at great expense and
artfully designed by a team of the finest
gunsmiths, this exquisite mahogany pistol
has adamantine detailing. The ruby-eyed,
leering devil’s face that surrounds the barrel
was intended to strike fear into the Countess’s
opponents—of which there were many. Countess
Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional
success in dueling circles and refused to name the
weapon’s creators for fear their works would fall
into an opponent’s hands. In the past decade, seven
replicas of the Countess’s famed pistol have arisen, each
said to be crafted by the Countess’s anonymous gunsmiths.
That each of these weapon’s wielders have quickly risen to
become exceptional duelists in their own right has
lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure,
wielders of these replicas have refused to square off
against the Countess.
Despite the weapon’s beauty and utility, a pact-bound
pistol is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation
of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the
weapon and the Archdevil Mephistopheles. Each pact-bound
pistol was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by
Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted
priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the
weapon is an acceptance of the contract’s terms and causes
the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears
in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and
can’t be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the
curse is removed.
Whenever you attack a living creature with the pact‑bound
pistol, text from the infernal contract is seared into your
flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the
attack was a critical success. The text appears one sentence
at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in
Infernal. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you
no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature.
These burned phrases heal over as scars which can’t be
removed while you are fused to the weapon, although they
can be covered and disguised.
Each time a creature dies within 1 hour of being damaged
by a pact-bound pistol, that creature must attempt a DC 25
Will saving throw. On a failure, their soul is consigned to the
Archdevil Mephistopheles; their soul immediately goes to Hell
and they can’t be returned to life through any means short
of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the
courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as wish is insufficient.
After you have consigned 9 souls to Mephistopheles in this
way, the contract is fully scribed upon your flesh. You become
immune to fire damage and the pact-bound pistol becomes a
+2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol. Your soul belongs
to Mephistopheles and immediately goes to Hell when you
die. You can’t be returned to life through any means, even
through the divine intervention of a deity.
Failing to wield a pact-bound pistol is a breach of
contract. Each day you go without firing the pact‑bound
pistol at a living creature, you must attempt a Will
saving throw. On a failure, you become stupefied
1. If you are already stupefied, the value of
your stupefied condition increases by 1, to
a maximum of stupefied 4. While you’re
fused with the pact-bound pistol, you
can’t reduce the value of your stupefied
condition except by damaging a living
creature with it. Whenever you damage
a living creature with it, if you are
suffering from the stupefied condition
due to the pact-bound pistol, your
stupefied condition is removed.

The gunsmith that created this marvelous +2 greater
striking spell-storing scattergun poured so much love and
care into its creation that the weapon gained a spark of
sentience. However, at first it was completely incapable of
expressing itself. This led a seething frustration to grow
within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to
Animate Dreamer

================================================================================
PAGE 163
================================================================================

the same love and affection that created it. Through decades
of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically,
then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting
its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the
weapon’s progress, years of feeling helpless have given the
animate dreamer a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a
body of its own.
An animate dreamer is cunning, intelligent, and patient. It
urges you to create a body for it and is willing to go to any
lengths to see its goals come to fruition, including coercion,
deception, and violence. An animate dreamer desires a
permanent body but isn’t picky about the body’s form or
the methods it has to use in order to gain it. Therefore, an
animate dreamer is just as happy in a living body stolen from
an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body,
or even an undead corpse. If you refuse to work towards
creating or obtaining a body for the animate dreamer, it will
likely use its possession ability to try and take control of you
and use your body to find a permanent replacement for itself.
Activate [two-actions] command; Requirements The animate dreamer
has a stored spell. It can see a creature it hit and damaged
within the last minute, and that creature’s within 120 feet
of animate dreamer; Effect The animate dreamer casts its
stored spell at a target that meets the requirements. This
empties the spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be
cast into it again. The animate dreamer has a spell attack
roll of +25 and a spell DC of 33 with the stored spell.
Activate [three-actions] command; Effect The animate dreamer
focuses on a single unattended inanimate object in an area
it can see and exerts its will over the object, temporarily
levitating it around. The animate dreamer casts mage
hand as a 5th-level occult spell.
Activate [three-actions] command; Frequency once per day; Effect The
animate dreamer attempts to achieve its goal of occupying
a body of its own and casts possession as a 7th-level spell
with a spell DC of 33. The weapon still functions as a +2
greater striking spell-storing scattergun while this effect
is active but loses all other special abilities until the spell
expires and the animate dreamer’s intellect returns to it.

Possessing a boisterous, proud demeanor, this +1 jezail is
an aspiring big game hunter, always quick to share a tale
of its bold adventures and predatory conquests—although
the veracity of such tales is often questionable. A boastful
hunter enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but
takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous,
or rare animals. Against an animal, the boastful hunter deals
1d6 additional damage. On a critical hit against an animal,
the boastful hunter also deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
A boastful hunter urges you to face off against tougher and
tougher creatures—a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be
adequate to deal with. If the boastful hunter goes one week
without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least
your level, it becomes bored. A bored boastful hunter complains
incessantly and imposes a –1 item penalty to attack rolls against
non-animal targets. A bored boastful hunter can be appeased by
using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.
Unable to accept its own weaknesses, a boastful hunter
blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about
its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted boastful
hunter badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact
with, imposing a –1 item penalty to Deception, Diplomacy,
and Intimidation skill checks, and all attacks with it incur
a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted
boastful hunter can be appeased by complimenting it and
succeeding at a Diplomacy check against its Will DC two

appease the boastful hunter once each day.

INTEGRATED FIREARMS
In addition to the many rare and unique weapons
presented here, there exists a special type of rare firearm
known as an integrated firearm that anyone who knows
the proper techniques can craft. An integrated firearm
replaces a creature’s forelimb, usually in place of a
prosthesis or one of an automaton’s (page 36) arms. An
integrated weapon can be a one or two-handed firearm
or combination weapon, though weapons with the reach
property are typically too ungainly for this treatment
and one-handed weapons are usually preferred since
two-handed weapons still require the use of a second
arm for proper wielding. Opponents can’t disarm an
integrated firearm and they take 10 minutes to attach
or remove. Integrated firearms can be fired using the
same arm they are attached to, with careful and complex
mechanics that use the wearer’s posture or even directly
attach to the muscles or other infrastructure that used
to control the severed or detached limb. A creature with
an integrated firearm can’t use the arm replaced by the
firearm for any actions or tasks other than wielding
and firing the firearm.

Patriotic to the extreme, this +2 flaming greater striking
flintlock musket was among the first firearms forged in the
Gunworks and was wielded by Ancil Alkenstar, founder of
the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. In Alkenstar’s hands, the
musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy
from outside threats, including mutants of the Mana Wastes,
Nexian constructs, and undead from Geb. After Ancil’s
death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree,
not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar,
as determined by the weapon’s previous owner. Over time,
the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a
psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect
and drive of its own.
A duchy defender is a powerful weapon with a rigid
personality. It follows the laws of Alkenstar to the letter,
and fights in defense of its nation. If these two priorities
ever clash, a duchy defender prioritizes the protection
of Alkenstar and its citizens over following the laws
themselves, since laws can change, but the people will
always need protecting.
 If you break the laws of Alkenstar, a duchy
defender goes out of its way to call attention to you
at inopportune times, such as when you’re engaged
in an illegal activity, and attempts to see you pay
for your crimes, up to and including outing you
to law enforcement and providing testimony
against you in court. If a duchy defender is used
unjustly against a citizen of Alkenstar, the weapon
automatically misfires.
If the weapon is removed from the Grand
Duchy of Alkenstar without a reason that directly
benefits the duchy, the duchy defender transports itself
away, reappearing in the hands of a previous worthy owner,
or elsewhere in Alkenstar if no such previous owner lives.
In the hands of a worthy owner, a duchy defender is
nearly impossible to steal, since it transports
itself back to you at the first opportunity
after someone takes it, and it grants you a
+2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC
to resist being disarmed of it.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency
once per round; Effect The duchy
defender focuses its will on a single
target it can see and who it knows is guilty of committing
a crime within Alkenstar’s borders. The next time the
duchy defender damages this target, it deals an additional
2d8 precision damage.
Activate

worthy. If the owner’s hands are full, the duchy defender
instead appears on the ground in their space. If there
is no previous owner the duchy defender deems worthy
that lives, it instead travels to a random public location
within Alkenstar. Traveling to an unknown location
is draining; after doing so, the duchy defender can’t
transport itself anywhere for 1d4 days.

A sunken pistol is imbued with the unfulfilled desires and
insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious pirate
drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought
weapon, a sunken pistol is coated in a fine layer of dried salt
and encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this +1
striking dragon mouth pistol is now coated in a layer of salty
ectoplasm and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can
shoot the sunken pistol underwater, even when using black
powder ammunition.
A sunken pistol urges you to amass a horde of treasure
even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to
acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol,
so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all
else, a sunken pistol desires the return of its own treasure,
which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship’s hold or be
hidden on a dangerous island.
In pursuit of treasure, a sunken pistol offers nautical and
navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during
less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner,
the sunken pistol aids you in combat by Demoralizing your
opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove
charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the sunken
pistol turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat
until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the sunken pistol,
it would be wise to not accept water breathing from it, as it
might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder
to acquire it from your corpse. The sunken pistol can use the
following activations.
Activate [one-action] command; Frequency once per minute; Effect
The sunken pistol curses and insults a creature it can
see, attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that
creature.

from Tian Xia who sought the title of linnorm king. Though
the smith failed to slay the linnorm, he did claim the mighty
dragon’s tooth and fashion it into a magic firearm that still
drips warm venom. Hyldarf survived the encounter with
her attacker and slew the gunsmith years later, though by
then the smith had already bequeathed the weapon to his
chosen heir and it was far out of her grasp. The linnorm still
searches for her missing tooth, portending potential doom
for the weapon’s owner.
The weapon deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on a
successful Strike, plus 3d10 persistent fire damage on a
critical hit. Fire damage dealt by this weapon (including
persistent fire damage and damage from Hyldarf’s Venom)
ignores the target’s fire resistance.

The first firearm of this type came as the result of a
gunslinger who entreated an efreeti, wishing for the might of
the desert sun. The weapon constantly glows and burns with
a brilliant intensity. The firearm has since belonged to an
extensive string of users and been replicated several times,
though each wielder of the weapon, whether the original or
one of its copies, has eventually ended up as a charred husk,
slain by fire in battle or unusual accidents that no one could
quite explain except, perhaps, the efreet.
Activate [one-action] envision; Frequency once per minute; Effect You

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This +2 striking arquebus has an ashwood stock plated with
worked silver, featuring a mosaic of agonized skulls carved
into the metal. The mere mention of Galt’s infamous final
blades is enough to make any mortal creature shudder. Used
to execute political opponents in the nation’s constant civil
war, these guillotines hold the souls of those they execute,
preventing them from reaching a natural afterlife. When
one of the final blades was destroyed in 4710, some of the
metal from its remains made its way to Alkenstar and was
reforged into a deadly firearm that retained the guillotine’s
soul-stealing properties.
Whenever the reaper’s grasp kills a sapient living or
undead creature, a portion of that creature’s soul is drawn
inexorably into the weapon, and another skull is added to
the mosaic as if scrawled by an invisible hand, to a maximum
of 10 souls. Creatures whose souls are protected by outside
forces, such as a lich’s soul cage, are immune to this
effect, though the process, while painful, does not prevent
the soul from going to the afterlife or being resurrected.

Usage held in two hands; Bulk 2
In a dense forest within Arcadia, djezet fell from the sky
millennia ago, even before Earthfall. While this metal
was poisonous to most of the plant life growing nearby,
one stubborn rowan tree refused to die, its roots slowly
absorbing djezet in small particles from the ground until the
entire plant was suffused with it. Fey bowyers discovered
the remarkable plant and coaxed it into growing into a very
particular shape, its branching trunks woven together into a
tightly twisted and naturally rifled barrel.
One of the legendary star guns, Arcadia’s greatest
treasures, the Rowan Rifle is a +2 greater fearsome speed
greater striking (Advanced Player’s Guide 260) advanced
firearm with a range of increment of 300 feet. It deals 1d8
fire damage and has the backstabber, concussive, and fatal
d12 traits.
As a star gun, the Rowan Rifle runs on magic, and
doesn’t use ammunition or black powder. As a weapon
forged to protect the fey peoples of Arcadia, the Rowan
Rifle’s enchantments prevent it from ever causing harm to
a creature with the fey trait; any attempt to shoot a fey
with it results in an automatic misfire. This legendary star
gun is as much a badge of office as a weapon, as it denotes
dominion over all Briarbough. If the Rowan Rifle’s wielder is
fey, or if they were specifically given the Rowan Rifle by a
fey creature who recognized them as a worthy champion,
they can use the following activations.
Activate [one-action] envision; Effect You will the Rowan Rifle to
change the energy it fires from the white-hot energy of
summer that glows like a star to the shivering chill of
winter, the crackling electricity of the storm, or even the
sonic vibrations of a roar. The Rowan Rifle’s damage type
changes from its current damage type to cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic. On the next sunrise, the Rowan Rifle returns
to dealing fire damage.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect The Rowan Rifle
fires a 60-foot line of liquid djezet that wraps around all
creatures in the affected area before
hardening, which impedes them
with metallic vines unless the
affected creature succeeds
at a DC 35 Reflex save. A
creature who fails the save
takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds,
and a creature who critically fails is immobilized. A
creature who succeeds at a DC 35 Escape check ends this
effect. Otherwise, the djezet vines last for 10 minutes
before crumbling away.
Activate command, envision, Interact (1 minute); Frequency
once per 10 minutes; Effect You hold aloft the Rowan Rifle
and step into a tree in Briarbough, and you tree stride to
another tree in Briarbough.
TIGER’S CLAW
ITEM 11
RARE
ILLUSION
PRIMAL
Price 1,400 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This +2 striking fearsome dueling pistol (Advanced Player’s
Guide 260) is made from fine tigerwood, with the head
of a tiger as the muzzle. Beneath the tiger head is a claw
shaped bayonet. One of a set of four guns crafted as a gift
to a Zenj family for delivery of rare healing and diseaseabating herbs during an outbreak of a deadly disease in the
Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, these firearms are now passed
down to those who have done brave acts in service to the
Zenj people. The flintlock sparks thrown by this weapon
take the shape of pouncing tigers and the firearm’s report
sounds like a tiger’s growl. Clever wielders use the firearm’s
report to panic their prey into mistakes and then pounce
for the kill.
This firearm’s bullets deal slashing damage instead of
piercing and add an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage
on a critical hit. This persistent bleed damage causes
tiger‑claw-shaped wounds to appear on the target.
Activate [two-actions] envision; Frequency once per day; Effect You
capitalize on the fears your firearm engenders, terrifying
your foes. Make a ranged Strike with this firearm against
a target. If you successfully deal damage to your target,
the target is also affected by a 4th-level phantasmal killer
with a spell DC of 28. While phantasmal killer typically
takes the shape of the target’s worst fear, this effect
always appears to the target in the form of a majestic and
ferocious tiger.

MAGICAL
Price 3,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This +2 greater striking flintlock pistol bears strange, jagged
markings of erratic design and has an oddly squishy grip. It
can be activated to produce a variety of unusual effects.
Activation [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect Choose a creature
within 60 feet and roll a percentile die on the table below
to determine the pistol’s effect. If an entry lists a spell,
the pistol Casts that Spell at the indicated level (or at its
lowest level, if no level is listed). You make any decisions
for a spell cast by the pistol unless otherwise indicated,
except that it must only target the creature you chose, or
the creature you chose must be the center of the spell’s
area, if it has an area but no targets. The only exception
to the limitation on targeting is if the effect specifically
states it targets you. If the spell’s range is less than 60
feet, increase the range to 60 feet.
Any spell DC required is DC 29, and any spell attack roll
required is +21. If the pistol casts a spell on you, you don’t
get a saving throw or any other defense against it. Once
activated, the pistol can’t be activated again for 1d4 hours.
d%
Wondrous Effect
1–2
The pistol casts phantom steed (4th level) to
produce a pale horse adjacent to you; only you
can ride it.
The target becomes a shiny metal color (bronze,
copper, or iron) and any sound or speech becomes
tinny and robotic in nature; this effect lasts 1
month.
4–5
The pistol casts dimensional anchor.
Modify memory (6th level) causes the target to
forget you ever existed; you can’t Sustain the
Spell.
7–13
A short rod protrudes from the pistol and unfurls
a small flag that reads “Bang!”. The pistol can’t be
fired until the flag is removed, which requires a
single Interact action.
14–16
You are pushed 30 feet directly away from the
target; if you hit an object or creature, you stop,
but take falling damage equal to the distance you
moved (if you hit a creature, it takes the same
amount of falling damage).
17–19
The target is pushed 30 feet directly away from
you; if it hits an object or creature, it stops,
but takes falling damage equal to the distance
it moved (if it hits another creature, the other
creature takes the same amount of falling
damage).
You don’t need to eat or drink for 1 week.
21–25
The pistol casts cloudkill.
26–30 The pistol casts heroism on you.
The pistol casts tree shape on you, except you
appear as a Medium wooden grave marker
bearing your name and the current date; you can’t
Dismiss the spell for 1 round.
The pistol casts mask of terror, except the target
appears as a more fearsome and violent version of
itself to all observers.
33–35
The target knows you have a bullet with its name
on it; the first time you Strike the target with the
pistol before the end of your next turn, roll the
attack roll twice and take the highest result (this
is a fortune effect).
36–37
The pistol casts cloak of colors on you with a
duration of 1d10 rounds.
38–47
The pistol casts hydraulic push (4th level) as water
streams from the pistol.
48–50 The pistol casts dimension door on you,
teleporting you to the space adjacent to the target
opposite your current position; if that space isn’t
clear, you instead teleport to the nearest open
space.
The pistol casts disintegrate.
Dozens of tattered, nonmagical playing cards
burst from the pistol’s barrel.
53–54 Shadows crowd around the target, making all
creatures concealed to the target while not in
bright light; this effect lasts for 1 hour.
55–57
Normal vegetation within 30 feet of the target
immediately dies and turns to ash.
The pistol casts dinosaur form on you to
transform you into a triceratops; the pistol
protrudes from the base of your front horn, and
you can fire (but not reload) the pistol while in
this form.
All non-artifact ammunition in your possession
crumbles to dust.
60–69 You are quickened for 1 minute. You can use the
extra action only to reload or fire the pistol.
70–71
The target is quickened for 1 minute. It can use
the extra action only to Step or Stride.
72-79
The pistol casts phantasmal killer.
80–81
Dozens of bullet holes appear in the target’s
nonmagical clothing. The effect is purely cosmetic.
82–85 The pistol casts outcast’s curse.
The pistol vanishes, reappearing among your
possessions once it can be activated again.
87–91
The pistol casts solid fog, but with swirling dust
and sand instead of fog.
92–96 The pistol casts stoneskin on you, making your
skin rough and leathery; the target ignores the
resistance you gain from this spell, and the
target’s attacks don’t reduce the spell’s duration.
97–99 The pistol casts uncontrollable dance with
a duration of 3 rounds, even on a failure or
critical failure.
Reroll two results and apply both in the order
rolled; further results of 100 on these rerolls have
no effect.

No gunslinger’s or arbalist’s repertoire is complete
without a selection of magical ammunition to amplify the
effectiveness and impact of their shots. While many of the
following options are limited to firearm rounds, others
work for a variety of ammunition.
AROMATIC AMMUNITION
ITEM 2
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 5 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
The components of this ammunition emit a strong smell when
combined during its activation. A creature hit by an activated
aromatic ammunition gains a distinct odor for up to 1 hour or
until the scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water
and 10 minutes of scrubbing). Any creatures within 30 feet
smell the target, allowing even those with a weak sense of smell
to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus
to Track the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A
creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range
at which they can detect the target using their scent compared
to the normal range of their scent.

EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious
metal and enchanted to unlock that metal’s true potential. Each
version has a different special effect.
Type awakened adamantine shot; Level 18; Price 3,500 gp
The shot is a high-grade adamantine bullet. The awakened
adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores
the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage,
all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a
golem or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by
adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters
the target’s defenses, causing them to become flat-footed for 1
minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version
of awakened metal shot is uncommon even for gunslingers or
other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets
from this book.
Type awakened cold iron shot; Level 17; Price 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron

by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted
creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the
enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature’s
mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is
+27. If you fail (but don’t critically fail) the counteract check
against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit
a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other
creatures, the target is stupefied 1 for 1 minute instead.
Type awakened silver shot; Level 17; Price 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade silver bullet. The awakened silver
gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken
and expose devils and werecreatures. On a hit, it attempts
to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The
counteract level is 9, and the counteract
modifier is +27. If you fail (but don’t
critically fail) the counteract
check against a devil or a
werecreature, you get a success
instead. If you counteracted the
Change Shape ability, the creature
can’t use that ability again
for 1 round, or 1 minute on
a critical success. If you
hit a devil or werecreature
not under a polymorph effect, the
target is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute instead.
BLACK POWDER
ITEM 0+
UNCOMMON
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance
commonly used in the production of firearm munitions.
Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet
and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight
container.
Type dose or round; Level 0;
Price 1 cp
The smallest unit of black
powder that still has a simple use,
a dose can be a simple package paper parcel
around black powder or it can be packaged with
a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited
with a fuse or exposed to direct flame, a dose of black powder
explodes. This isn’t powerful enough to deal damage but makes
a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a
dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the
dose to explode the round after it’s lit.
Type horn; Level 2; Price 5 gp
A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn
can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and
then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black
powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly
full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal
1d6 fire damage in a 5-foot burst (DC 16 basic Reflex save). It
takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn
to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate
simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but
the damage in overlapping areas doesn’t increase.
Type keg; Level 6; Price 50 gp
A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be
detonated in the same way as a horn. As long as the keg is
mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals 3d6 fire
damage in a 20-foot burst (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Detonating
multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this
effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an
overlapping area also doesn’t increase the damage.
DREAMING ROUND
ITEM 14
UNCOMMON CONSUMABLE ENCHANTMENT INCAPACITATION MAGICAL MENTAL SLEEP
Price 900 gp
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] command
The night sky seems contained in this glass projectile.
When an activated dreaming round damages a
creature, it induces drowsiness. The creature must
attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected
and becomes temporarily immune for 1
minute.
Success The creature becomes slowed 1
and fatigued for 1 round.
Failure The creature becomes fatigued and
slowed 1, and must attempt another Fortitude
save at the end of each of its turns. If it fails, its
slowed condition increases by 1. A successful save reduces
the slowed condition by 1. If the slowed
condition is removed or reduced to 0,
the effect and the fatigued condition
end. If the target’s actions are reduced
to 0 by this effect, it immediately falls
into a deep sleep and is unconscious,
during which it no longer attempts a
save at the end of its turn. It wakes up
automatically after 1 hour or if it takes
damage, but not due to non-painful stimuli
(such as noise or being nudged). When it
wakes up, its slowed condition decreases by
1, though it must once again save at the end of each of its
turns and might risk falling asleep again.
Critical Failure As failure, except the target is initially slowed 2.
ERODING BULLET

the glass casing inside the bullet bursts, releasing a splattering
of bubbling green acid that coats the target. The target takes
2d6 persistent acid damage in addition to the damage normally
dealt by the attack.
EXSANGUINATING AMMUNITION
ITEM 4+
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This ammunition includes a small reservoir of a tacky red
substance that coats the ammunition when you activate
it. The substance makes a creature bleed more freely. For 1
minute after you deal damage to a creature with an activated
exsanguinating ammunition that creature gains the listed
weakness to persistent bleed damage. In addition, the DC of
any flat checks to end persistent bleed damage increases from
15 to 17 (from 10 to 12 when receiving particularly effective
assistance) for the duration.
Type exsanguinating ammunition; Level 4; Price 15 gp
The target gains weakness 1 to persistent bleed damage.
Type greater exsanguinating ammunition; Level 8; Price 80 gp
The target gains weakness 3 to persistent bleed damage.
Type major exsanguinating ammunition; Level 12; Price 360 gp
The target gains weakness 5 persistent bleed damage.

Price 65 gp
Ammunition round
Activate [two-actions] command, envision
These bullets are seaweed-green, refract light like an emerald,
and are covered in a thin film of gray-green powder. When
fired, a fairy bullet creates an effect that functions as the
glitterdust spell in a line between you and your target. This
line can be no more than 60 feet long, so if the target is
more than 60 feet away from you, the line simply ends after
reaching its maximum distance. Since the fairy bullet is fired
before the glitterdust can reveal the target, the effects don’t
affect the flat check for the attack roll with the fairy bullet.

Activate [one-action] Interact
This craggy stone ammunition is warm to the touch. When you
fire an activated meteor shot, it explodes into a small swarm
of meteors as it reaches its target, scorching nearby creatures
and littering the ground with rubble. In addition to the weapon’s
normal damage, the meteor shot deals fire damage and the
ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
In addition, the Strike gains the following critical failure effect.
Critical Failure The weapon misfires.
Type meteor shot; Level 7; Price 70 gp
The ammunition deals 3d6 fire damage in a 5-foot emanation
around the target (DC 23 basic Reflex save).

ITEM 7+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] envision, Interact
A series of small stone discs pressed into a single round
make up this ammunition. When you fire an activated
stepping stone shot, whether you hit or miss your target,
the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures
can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or
descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any
amount of weight, but don’t otherwise pose any sort of
obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if
they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to
move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use
a two-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to
Stride up to its speed on the stones while causing them
to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in
firearms with the scatter trait. The maximum length of
the line depends on the type of ammunition. However, the
line also can’t extend beyond the maximum distance for
a Strike from your firearm (usually six times the firearm’s
range increment).
Type stepping stone shot; Level 7; Price 65 gp
The stones reach up to 100 feet, and they last
up to the end of your next turn if no one
collapses them.
Type greater stepping stone shot;

The stones reach up to 250 feet, and
they last up to 1 minute if no one
collapses them.
TRUSTWORTHY ROUND
ITEM 3
CONSUMABLE
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 9 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [free-action] command
This ammunition was developed in Dongun Hold to
minimize casualties to friendly fire, and is always
marked by a burnished copper head or tip so it can be
easily identified. Before you can fire a trustworthy round,
you must call out a target. You don’t need to specify a
name; the target could be “The angry tiger attacking our
group on the left.” The round will only hit the specified
target and will turn to gossamer dust midair if it misses
the intended target or comes into contact with anything
else; this also prevents abilities that redirect attacks. The
round doesn’t have any capabilities beyond your own to
determine whether someone is who you think they are, so
you can’t use it to determine a disguised creature’s identity.
If you specify a target of “Seltyiel” and shoot someone
disguised as Seltyiel who you thought was Seltyiel, the
attack will still hit, whereas if you were about to hit a
disguised Seltyiel who you didn’t recognize to be Seltyiel,
the round would dissolve.
FEATHER TOKEN AMMUNITION
One of the more popular and commonly used tools of
adventurers across Golarion are feather tokens (Core
Rulebook 570). Several forms of feather token can be
purchased as ammunition by raising their item level by 2
and doubling the Price, replacing their normal activation
requirement with a Strike from a ranged weapon and
appearing in a space within that weapon’s range. While
not all feather tokens are suitable for use in this way,
the chest, holly bush, ladder, swan boat, and tree tokens
have all been converted into ammunition at one time or
another. While these utilitarian devices are not suitable
for direct offense in combat (a feather token fired into an
occupied space fails to deploy and is wasted), they are
incredibly useful for providing cover where none existed
previously, making a quick escape, or coordinating an
innovative heist.
Meteor Shot

================================================================================
PAGE 173
================================================================================

The advent of black powder is beginning to offer
a new sort of weapon to warriors in Golarion, one
that isn’t dependent on the physical strength of the
wielder. Siege weapons like ballistae and trebuchets
create tremendous force at a distance with the efforts
of multiple operators, allowing for destructive power
to rival even mighty spellcasters. Black powder siege
weapons take the potential of such machines of war
and amplify it to the next level, adding explosive power
to the cooperative efforts of the crew. In addition to the
force of the black powder ignition itself, black powder
siege weapons are able to funnel and direct the energy
through a reinforced barrel or muzzle in ways torsion
and counterweights cannot, increasing the accuracy,
range, and impact of the weapon.
Siege weapons of all kinds operate largely the same
way whether they incorporate black powder in their
design or not. The Aiming, Loading, Launching, and
Move Siege Weapon actions are all identical to the
rules found on page 72. The most notable change is
the chance of misfire; just like a firearm, improper use,
inadequate cleaning, and a number of other factors
BLACK POWDER SIEGE WEAPONS
can lead to deficiencies in a piece of artillery. The
construction of the weapons and ammunition are also
more expensive and harder to find due to the more
advanced makeup.
SIEGE WEAPON MISFIRE
Just as personal firearms require a meticulous regimen
of proper care and cleaning to operate at peak
performance, black powder siege weapons must be
properly maintained on a regular basis to avoid the risk
of terrible consequences that might otherwise befall
those who use them. If you attempt to fire a black
powder siege weapon that was used or assembled prior
to the current day and hasn’t been properly cleaned and
maintained since the last time it was used or assembled,
you must attempt a DC 5 flat check before making your
attack roll, risking misfire on a failure. A black powder
siege weapon can also potentially misfire as a result of
using a specific ability or due to using an unreliable
black powder siege weapon with the cobbled trait, such
as a siege weapon created at the risky pirate volcano
foundry known as the Motaku Ironworks.

HISTORY OF BLACK POWDER
ARTILLERY ON GOLARION
As with any other realm of scientific advancement, siege
weapon designs have evolved through time and across
the world. The earliest black powder siege weapons were
created by Tian alchemists experimenting with fireworks
and large-scale explosions. Many of these weapons were
simple devices made of bamboo or bound iron tubes
that fired stones or iron balls with many similarities to
firework launching instruments. While limited in range
and accuracy, the force was markedly more powerful
than typical weaponry of the time. Larger, clumsier
weapons like the hwacha increased their lethality and
range at the cost of mobility. It hasn’t been until recently,
however, with the advent of black powder weapons from
Dongun Hold and Alkenstar, that a new generation of
black powder artillery has begun to spread slowly across
the world.
If you fail this misfire flat check, the siege weapon
misfires and jams, and the attack also becomes a critical
failure. To clear the jam, the crew must collectively use
a number of Interact actions equal to the number of
actions required to complete a single Load activity for
the siege weapon. The weapon can then be reloaded and
fired again. Once the crew has spent at least an hour
cleaning and maintaining the weapon, they don’t need
to roll for a misfire until the next day unless an effect
says otherwise.
If you critically fail a misfire check when attempting to
fire a siege weapon, the siege weapon explodes, dealing
the damage listed in its Launch entry to all creatures in
a 30-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save. The DC of
the save is the standard DC of the siege weapon’s level
(Core Rulebook 503). When it explodes in this way, the
siege weapon is destroyed.
SIEGE WEAPON STATISTICS
A siege weapon uses the following stat block format. An
individual siege weapon might omit some of these sections,
especially a portable siege weapon. Since all these siege
weapon use black powder, they have (black powder) in their
usage entry.
ALCHEMICAL SPRINGALD
ITEM 13
UNCOMMON
HUGE
Price 6,000 gp; Ammunition bomb arrows (100 gp, 2 Bulk)
Usage mounted (black powder); Space 15 feet long, 12 feet
wide, 15 feet high
Crew 3 to 5; Proficiency martial
AC 29; Fort +23, Reflex +16
Hardness 15; HP 200 (BT 100); Immunities object immunities
Speed 10 feet (pulled or pushed)
Like the standard springald, an alchemical springald can
launch three arrows simultaneously when its paddle is
released. It fires specially crafted and balanced bomb arrows
that carry black powder enhanced alchemical payloads that
explode on impact.
Aim [two-actions] 30 feet, minimum distance 50 feet
Load [two-actions] (manipulate) 3 times
Launch [one-action] (manipulate, range increment 100 feet) 10d6
damage and 3 splash damage, three different targets
within a 15-foot burst, DC 30 Reflex. The damage type
depends on the alchemical ammunition used: acid, cold,
electricity, or fire. Creatures take the splash damage only
once from the launch, even if they’re in the area of more
than one of the three splashes.
BLASTING RAM
ITEM 7
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 360 gp; Ammunition ram powder charge (2 gp, 1 Bulk)
Usage portable (black powder), held in 8 hands; Bulk 14
Crew 4; Proficiency martial
A blasting ram is a smaller battering ram that supplements
the crew’s size with explosive force. A steel reservoir holds
a charge of black powder that ignites on impact. The body
of the ram is reinforced to absorb the force of the explosion,
while the head itself has a blast shield to protect the crew.
Despite being a portable siege weapon, a blast ram has the
Load action, which the crew uses to load the powder charge
in the ram’s head.
Load [two-actions] (manipulate) 2 times
Ram [two-actions] Requirements The other members of the crew have
Readied to Stride on your order; Effect You and the crew
Stride, with a maximum distance equal to the slowest crew
member’s Speed. Then, make a melee Strike with the ram
against a structure or unattended stationary object. As
you do, the black powder in the steel reservoir explodes,
significantly increasing the damage of your attack. Due
to the black powder’s additional force, the damage of
this Strike is 7d8 + the highest Strength modifier among
members of the crew.
BOMBARD

Bombards are some of the oldest and simplest of black
powder siege weapons, devised based on many of the same
principles as a hand cannon, but deploying them on a larger
scale and scope. A bombard’s body is usually made of brass
or iron, which causes the bombard to resemble the shape of
a large bell. While they are capable of moving very slowly,
their clumsy and weighty design means bombards usually
remain stationary. This in turn means they’re often used
more defensively than offensively.

Cannons are perhaps the most well known of all black powder
siege weapons, and that’s because they represent a good
midpoint between power and expense. Keeps and fortresses
in Alkenstar prefer to fortify their forces with cannons, as
they’re relatively easy to construct and their ammunition is
cheap enough to build up great supplies.

Fiend’s mouth cannons are large-scale cannons designed to
blast a target at great distance, from a stationary location.
They get their name from the fiendish features usually
adorning their barrels and frames. Compared to a standard
field cannon, a fiend’s mouth cannon can be aimed more
easily, but flexibility comes at the cost of mobility. The barrel
rests on a platform which can be rotated 360 degrees to
allow for precise aiming.

This alchemical black powder
hybrid siege weapon uses
a blast of black powder
to spray alchemical fire
from a long metal nozzle, often
sculpted or painted with designs resembling a
dragon’s neck and head. The nozzle turns on a
ratcheted, rotating disc with a reservoir in the
center to hold a barrel full of combustible alchemical liquid,
using black powder to propel the fire. This main structure is
atop a wheeled cart to allow it to be easily moved. Unlike
most mounted siege weapons, a firedrake is intended to be
wheeled out into the thick of a skirmish rather than shooting
from a distance.

Named for Brondar Steelheart, one of the most important
historical dwarven pioneers in the use of black powder, this
remarkable piece of new Dongun artillery uses metallurgy
and alchemy to negate nearly all of the immense amount
of recoil a shot from a siege weapon usually produces.
The barrel of the Steelheart 21 is suspended in a mix of
alchemical fluids that first compress to dampen the recoil
when fired, then expand to push the barrel back into place
afterwards. The result reduces the amount of time needed
to reset the aim of the siege weapon. The crew member who
launches the Steelheart 21 can use the Quick Aim reaction
(below), allowing them to adjust the weapon’s aim on the
fly as they fire to adapt to a faulty initial target, changing
battlefield conditions, the use of illusions by the enemy, or
any of a variety of other factors that lead to the need to alter
the siege weapon’s course.

A mortar fires its shells at a high angle, allowing it to bypass
obstacles and strike from above. A crew typically sets up
such a weapon behind a wall or in another hard-to-access

Due to the steep angle of its arc, such mortars are especially
useful when opposing barricaded targets.

CHAIN SHOT
A special type of ammunition for siege weapons,
chain shot is built to demolish masts, sails, and airship
gasbags. Each chain shot costs 2 gp. It resembles a
cannonball in shape and can be loaded only into a siege
weapon that hurls stones or similar ammunition. When
launched, the ball divides into its two halves, connected
by a sturdy chain.
When a siege weapon launches chain shot, it targets
one object instead of using its normal targets or area.
The target takes no damage, but on a failed Reflex save,
the object’s mast, sail, or gasbag becomes broken. The
pilot can attempt a piloting check in place of this Reflex
save. A broken mast, sail, or gasbag prevents a windpropelled vessel from moving, except by other means of
propulsion if available. For instance, a galley could still be
rowed if it had enough rowers. An airship with a broken
gasbag instead begins to slowly descend as it leaks gas,
automatically descending 20 feet at the start of each of
the pilot’s turns.
Named for Ancil Alkenstar, this bronze cannon is one of the
largest pieces of mobile artillery ever deployed, though its
immense weight limits just how mobile it actually is. The
barrel of an Alkenstar cannon is nearly 3 feet in diameter,
making it impractical to manufacture and handle cannonballs
of sufficient size. Instead, Alkenstar cannons spray buckshot
in a similar way to blunderbusses, firing large barrels that
break apart mid-flight and release a rain of scattershot over a
massive area. The slow movement and short range make this
siege weapon fit fewer situations than most, but when used
effectively, such as to stop a charge of Mana Waste mutants
against the walls of Alkenstar, the results are devastating.

Tiered A battery tower has five levels. The crew operate at
the bottom tier, turning a giant capstan, and up to four
passengers can fit on that floor, enough for a full crew for a
bombard. The remaining levels carry 50 passengers each.
The tiers are specifically meant to be protective, and give
those within the battery tower greater cover (or standard
cover if the battery tower is broken). A massive ladder
runs diagonally through the center of the battery tower,
from the front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier.
The ladder is wide enough for two crew or passengers to
climb simultaneously.
Weaponry A battery tower is usually loaded with black
powder siege weapons for heavy assaults, with bombards
on the bottom two floors and cannons on the other floors.
Their Price is included in that of the battery tower. When
building a battery tower, you can choose to replace any
of these with other siege weapons of a lower Price. If you
want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it
separately. Passengers of the battery tower can crew
these siege weapons.
Naval Siege Tools
Black powder has begun to revolutionize naval combat,
and the following siege tool, and the special chain shot
ammunition listed above, assist combat by sea, allowing
an attacking ship to disable enemy vessels and make
amphibious landings safely.
SAMBUCA
Using this device requires a complicated setup but
allows troops to siege a location on land from the sea.
SAMBUCA
ITEM 3
RARE
Price 120 gp
A sambuca is a long, covered troop bridge designed to help
troops move from sea to land. Preparing it for use requires
lashing together two galleys (Gamemastery Guide 178) or
other ships of similar size. The sambuca is then mounted
across the ships on one end with its length suspended
upward, and attached to pulleys fastened to the tops of the
ships’ masts. Once the ships are moved into position, the
sambuca can be lowered to rest on a battlement or other
surface, allowing troops to rush from the ships onto their
intended destination.
The sambuca has AC 17, Fort +11, Ref +5, Hardness 8, HP
32 (BT 16), and object immunities. It’s covered on all sides to
protect those who cross, granting them greater cover. The
end of the sambuca can be lowered by teams operating the
pulleys in concert. This requires three crew members on each
ship, and they can lower the far end of the sambuca by 15
feet each round they work.

A hero lives and dies by the tools of their trade. While
weapons, armor, staves, and other fancy items get a lot
of the spotlight, the ability to get the drop on the enemy
can make the difference between a glorious victory and
a humiliating defeat, so experienced combatants know
the value of a protective poncho that gives them an
advantage in a fight. Wise adventurers stock up on tools
and accessories to improve their chances of survival.
Foolish adventurers are lucky if they get a second chance
to learn from their mistakes.

Camouflage Suit: This lightweight mesh fits easily over
light armor. The suit is designed to incorporate local
flora and ground clutter into the mesh to help you blend
in seamlessly with the environment. Due to the abrasive
nature of the materials used, this item is unsuitable for
use by unarmored characters. You can prepare the suit
for use within your current environment by using an
exploration activity that takes at least 10 minutes, but
sometimes longer if the materials are hard to find or the
environment is unusual enough to warrant additional
difficulty in preparing camouflage that can blend with
it consistently.
A suit prepared in this manner grants you a +1 item
bonus to Stealth checks while you attempt to Hide or
Sneak in the specific environment it has been prepared for.

ATTACHED CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
This section introduces two new types of item that can
be attached to a firearm: scopes and firing mechanisms.
A given firearm can only have one of each type of item
attached. For instance, a firearm couldn’t have more than
one scope attached at the same time. To indicate this,
in much the same way that a magic item’s usage entry
might say “worn shoes” to indicate it can’t be worn with
other shoes, the usage entry for these attached options
lists “attached (scope)” or “attached (firing mechanism).”
The suit remains usable in this manner until you rest for
the night, though it doesn’t grant the benefit whenever you
aren’t in the appropriate environment. The GM might rule
that some environments are unusual enough that you can’t
create a camouflage suit appropriate for the environment.
A superb camouflage suit is fashioned from especially
well-blended materials and gives you a +2 item bonus to
the check instead of a +1 item bonus.
Concealed Holster: This leather holster is crafted
to better hide small firearms from view. Only firearms
designed for use in one hand are small enough to
disguise with this holster. You gain a +1 item bonus to
Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a firearm or
hand crossbow in this holster.
Earplugs: These small pieces of cloth and stuffing
have been crafted to dramatically muffle sound and
easily slide into and out of the ear canals of humanoid
creatures. You can insert or remove earplugs from your
ears or a willing creature’s ears with a single Interact
action using one hand. They take a –2 circumstance
penalty to all auditory Perception checks but also gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against
auditory effects.
Firearm Cleaning Kit: This kit contains cleaning cloth,
oil, small steel brushes, and other minor tools necessary
for proper cleaning and maintenance of a firearm.
Without a firearm cleaning kit, you can’t perform the
necessary tasks during your daily preparations to ensure
that your firearm isn’t at risk of misfiring under normal
use conditions.
Practice Targets: While gunslingers have many
methods for practicing their aim, these sturdy paper
targets are excellent for tracking a gunslinger’s progress
over time, keeping score of how close they came to
hitting the most vital spots. These targets are also used
in situations where more detailed accuracy must be
recorded, such as firearm competitions. Practice targets
can appear in many shapes and sizes and usually come
in packs of 10 held in protective cases made of heavy
cloth or light leather.
Silencer: One of the more prolifically used devices
developed in the infamous Alkenstar Gunworks, these
small firearm components are capable of muffling most
of the weapons’ explosive sound when fired. Without a
silencer, a firearm’s shot makes a loud and distinctive
bang, which can easily be heard through doors and thin
walls, but firearms equipped with silencers only make a
quiet noise when fired. Due to engineering constraints, a
silencer can’t be attached to any firearm with the scatter
trait. Attaching a silencer to a firearm takes 1 minute,
and the silencer is consumed the first time a shot is fired
through it.
Tripod: Tripods are designed for use with kickback
weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength
to accurately use these more powerful weapons by
sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and
attached to a firearm with a single Interact action using
one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this
sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don’t take
the –2 penalty for firing a kickback weapon, even if
your Strength isn’t high enough to avoid the penalty.
However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single
Interact action before you can move the firearm to a
different position. Normally, when you’re hidden or
undetected, you become observed if you do anything
except Hide, Sneak, or Step. However, deploying or
retrieving a tripod with an Interact action doesn’t
automatically make you observed, so long as you don’t
set up or remove the tripod when it’s in a spot where
creatures can see the tripod itself.
Waterproof Firearm Carrying Case: This buttoned,
leather case protects a firearm and up to 6 rounds of
ammunition from being damaged by water or other
environmental effects.
Customization Options
The potent stopping power, solid range, and relative
ease of use of firearms make them attractive options
for almost any warrior who can both obtain one and
maintain a healthy supply of ammunition, but these
benefits are only the most basic offered by the firearms
being produced in Golarion today. Everything from
bandoliers for the discerning pirate to specialized scopes
for snipers can be obtained from the talented gunsmiths
who ply their trades in Dongun Hold, Alkenstar, or
Arcadia for the right price.
HOLSTERS
Firearms and crossbows are generally efficient weapons
designed with an eye towards ease of use. However, the
act of managing ammunition, reloading, and keeping
a grip on a weapon can become cumbersome without
a good bandolier or holster to hold your weapons and
ammunition in a convenient position until they become
necessary in combat.

(whether through legal means or otherwise).
Leatherworkers, metalsmiths, crystal cutters,
and spellcasters specializing in the creation and
development of magical items all have a part to
play in the burgeoning industry. The finest crafters
often incorporate signature techniques or styles into the

Type greater magnetite scope; Level 17; Price 16,000 gp
The item bonus is +3, and activating the scope increases the
scatter radius by 10 feet.
MAGNIFYING SCOPE
ITEM 3+
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Usage attached to firearm or crossbow (scope); Bulk L
These scopes use magically enhanced lenses to extend the
range of your weapon and help spot distant foes. The scope
grants you a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks to
Seek creatures through the scope.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect While gazing through the scope,
you zoom in on your targets to make it easier to hit them
at a distance. You increase the range increment of the
weapon to which the scope is attached by 5 feet until
the beginning of your next turn or until you’re no longer
wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.
Type magnifying scope; Level 3; Price 70 gp

Type greater magnifying scope; Level 9; Price 800 gp
The item bonus is +2, and activating the scope increases the
range increment by 10 feet.
Type major magnifying scope; Level 17; Price 16,000 gp
The item bonus is +3, and activating the scope increases the
range increment by 20 feet.
SCOPE OF LIMNING
ITEM 10
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 900 gp
Usage attached to firearm (scope); Bulk L
The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created
these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground
areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a
creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light,
illuminating the target for all to see.
Activate [one-action] Interact (auditory, light, transmutation); Effect
If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope
is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact
transforms into light, causing the creature to glow
until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can’t
be concealed while they glow. If a creature is invisible,
they’re concealed while glowing, rather than being
undetected. Because the effect requires a solid impact,
incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can
deal force damage or has the effects of the ghost
touch property rune.
SCOPE OF TRUTH
ITEM 13
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 3,000 gp
Usage attached to firearm or crossbow (scope); Bulk L
The scope of truth is a bit bigger than most to
accommodate larger lenses, which have been magically
prepared with tiny shards from crystal balls to reveal the
truth. The scope grants you a +2 item bonus to Perception
checks made to Seek in areas you can see through the
scope.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency Once per day; Effect
For the next 10 minutes, you can see things through
the scope as they actually are. The GM rolls a secret
counteract check with a +20 counteract modifier and a
counteract level of 7 against any illusion or
transmutation in the area, but only for the
purpose of determining whether you see
through it, not to end the spell or effect. For instance, if
the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can
see the creature’s true form, but you don’t end the spell.
STABILIZERS
The ferocious kickback of firearms is part of the
functionality that makes them so appealing as weapons,
but it can also present a barrier in wielding them
effectively. To increase the functionality of firearms
and make them more accessible to a wider audience,
gunsmiths and engineers have created a large array
of supporting stabilization over the years. From the
humble tripod (page 179) to more elaborate arrays like
the gunner’s saddle, these tools can be an invaluable
part of any gunner’s loadout.
GUNNER’S SADDLE
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
Price 20 gp
Usage worn saddle; Bulk 2
Developed by marauders from the Mana Wastes, this
clockwork saddle comes with a retractable weapon mount
that can be used as a tripod to stabilize a weapon with the
kickback trait. Just like a normal tripod, you Interact to
deploy the tripod to stabilize the firearm, and then again
to retract the tripod to move it. The saddle uses complex
hydraulics to protect the steed from the firearm’s recoil.
IMMOVABLE TRIPOD
ITEM 10
UNCOMMON
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 700 gp
Bulk 1
This copper tripod with an immovable rod at its core is a
perfect example of engineering ingenuity applied to magic
items, adapting the eccentric power of an immovable rod
for the pragmatic use of stabilizing weapons without the
need for solid ground on which to stabilize them. In
addition to extraplanar and aquatic environments,
these devices have seen use by flying and climbing
snipers who would otherwise have no way to
mitigate their weapons’ fierce kickback.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You deploy the tripod
and press a button to lock it into place via the
immovable rod, allowing you to deploy the tripod in
midair, underwater, or anywhere else where you don’t
have a solid horizontal surface available. If you Activate
the tripod by pushing the button again, you release and
retrieve the tripod. While anchored, the tripod can be
moved only if 8,000 pounds of pressure are applied to
it or if a creature uses Athletics to Force Open the tripod
with a DC of 40 (though most intelligent creatures can
just push the button to release the tripod).
PORTABLE WEAPON MOUNT
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
Bulk 1
Powerful firearms like the arquebus were originally used
to defend fortifications or ships, mounted on casements
or pintles to steady their aim and offset their recoil. More
mobile means of stabilizing weapons with kickback were
developed as firearms began to spread across the Inner Sea.
The standard tripod takes an Interact action to deploy using
one hand.
Type monopod; Level 1; Price 2 sp
Monopods are lighter and can be deployed with a single
hand using the same action as drawing the firearm. They
still require an Interact action to retrieve. Monopods are

less stable than a tripod, and firing a kickback weapon from
a monopod without the necessary Strength reduces the
penalty to a –1 circumstance penalty instead of removing
it entirely.
Type tripod, shielded; Level 3; Bulk 5; Price 50 gp
A shielded tripod resembles a squat shield on a tripod. You
can deploy and retrieve a shielded tripod with an Interact
action, as normal, but while a shielded tripod is in your
square, you can use the Take Cover action to gain standard
cover behind the tripod’s shield. You can’t use this cover to
Hide or Sneak, as normal for times when your cover still
leaves your position obvious.
OTHER MODIFICATIONS
While holsters, scopes, and stabilizers are some of the
more common accessories associated with firearms and
crossbows, they’re far from the only innovations that
support such weapons. The variety of accessories is
matched only by the inventors’ creativity. Blazons and
emblems for paired weapons are popular purchases for
fashion-oriented aristocrats who like their weapons to
match aesthetically and magically. Talented gunsmiths
produce replaceable barrels, high-end firing mechanisms,
and other commodities for firearm enthusiasts to further
customize their weapons to their preferences.
AIR CARTRIDGE FIRING SYSTEM
ITEM 4
UNCOMMON
Price 75 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
Air cartridge firing mechanisms use a container of
compressed air affixed to a sealed
system that releases the air
in a small burst to propel
ammunition, and they’re the
default used in Arcadian air
repeaters. Any firearm can
be modified to replace its
normal firing mechanism
with an air cartridge firing
system, allowing the weapon
to be fired underwater or in
other conditions that would normally
prevent the ignition of black powder. The air cartridges lack
much of the propulsive power of black powder, however,
imposing a –10-foot penalty to the attached firearm’s range
increment. Weapons with the kickback trait don’t gain that
trait’s benefits when using an air cartridge firing system.
Attaching an air cartridge firing system takes one hour,
though this time can overlap with the standard time required
to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.
BLAZONS OF SHARED POWER
ITEM 3+
EVOCATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn and attached to two weapons (see below);
Bulk –
These brass emblems come in a variety of designs, usually
customized to the purchaser to reflect the heraldry of a
family or guild. Blazons of shared power come in sets of
three. When you invest the blazons, you wear one of the
three on your chest, and you attach the others to a pair of
one-handed weapons, choosing one as the primary weapon
and one as the secondary weapon. These weapons can be
either melee weapons or ranged weapons. As long as you’re
wielding both the primary weapon and the secondary
weapon, the secondary weapon gains the benefit of the
fundamental runes on the primary weapon. A weapon can
only have a single blazon of shared power attached to it at
a time.
Type blazons of shared power; Level 3; Price 52 gp
Type greater blazons of shared power; Level 11; Price 1,350 gp
A set of greater blazons of shared power also replicates
property runes from the primary weapon, so long as the
secondary weapon meets all the prerequisites for a given
rune and isn’t a specific weapon. The secondary weapon
gains the benefits of those runes. All of its own runes are
suppressed. When you invest the blazons, you can elect for
them to transfer only fundamental runes, in which case they
function as standard blazons of shared power.
BREECH EJECTORS
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
Price 10 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
These spring-loaded inserts can be fitted into the breech of
a double-barreled firearm over the course of 10 minutes or
during the firearm’s daily maintenance. After the weapon is
fired, the ejectors hasten the reloading
process by ejecting the spent
detritus from the fired rounds.
This allows you to reload
both barrels of the doublebarreled weapon as a single
Interact action the next time
you reload the weapon as
long as you do so before the
end of your next turn. However,
the ejectors are consumed in the
process, and you must spend the time to
insert a new set to gain the benefit again.
LARGE BORE MODIFICATIONS
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
Price 120 gp
Usage attached to firearm; Bulk 1
These modifications include a heavier stock and larger
replacement barrel designed to increase the stopping power
of firearms. Large bore modifications can only be applied to
firearms with the kickback or scatter traits, and attaching
large bore modifications takes 1 hour, though this time can
overlap with the standard time required to maintain and
clean your firearm to prevent misfires.
Blazons of shared power

================================================================================
PAGE 185
================================================================================

When you attach large bore modifications to a kickback
weapon, the circumstance bonus to damage granted by the
kickback trait increases from 1 to 2 additional damage and
the Strength requirement to fire the weapon without penalty
increases to 18.
When you attach large bore modifications to a weapon
with the scatter trait, the radius of the scatter effect
increases by 5 feet, but the weapon imposes a –2 penalty on
attack rolls if the wielder’s Strength score is less than 14. If
the weapon has both the kickback and scatter traits, apply
both sets of modifications with the Strength requirement
raised to 18 to avoid penalties when firing.
UNDERWATER FIRING MECHANISM
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
MAGICAL
Price 600 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
This device replaces the attached firearm’s normal firing
mechanism (normally, most of the guns in this chapter use a
flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm’s
wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of
stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark
that’s propelled through the firing mechanism and into the
firearm, launching its bullet. An underwater firing mechanism
allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in
other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of
black powder. Attaching an underwater firing mechanism to
a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the
standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to
prevent misfires.
Talismans
A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield,
or a weapon (which is called the affixed item). You must
be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman
attached to that item. Once activated, a talisman burns
out permanently. The talismans included in this section
are particularly useful for characters who wield firearms
or crossbows.

This long strip of linen is tightly wound around the barrel
of the affixed firearm or the grip of a bow. When activated,
the talisman’s magic dampens the sound of the triggering
shot, rendering it completely silent, and additionally skews
the angle of the shot, so it appears to come from a different
location and direction than your actual position. You don’t
become automatically observed to any creatures due to
making the triggering Strike.

THE ROTATING GEAR
My adventure started years ago when I left the port of Goka. I would like to say it was my
curiosity that drew me away from the place of my birth. It is more accurate, however, if
I also mention that several bounty hunters sought me on warrants for piracy. Regardless,
my impending capture also served as my opportunity to seek new horizons, and I arranged
passage to Vudra with a talented smuggler from whom I bought my powder kegs.
The trek across that land was educational. Vudrani methods of mixing black powder are
different than the process I learned, and their formula seems more stable, if less potent.
I also discovered strange wonders imported from even farther west. Clockwork toys that
move about under their own power—what kind of society could have the excess to craft
such devices? I asked that question and discovered an answer: Absalom.
So my journey continued ever westward. I had to see this fabled city, this monument
to humanity’s curiosity. Boarding a ship in Katheer, I exchanged drinks with a dwarf
captain whose clockwork hand was nimble and refined, and I listened with rapt attention
as he told me his story of crossing a blasted wasteland to reach the city of Alkenstar
and obtain the prosthetic to replace the hook that had served him for many years. And
finally, Absalom! Jewel of the Inner Sea! Repository of wonders from across the globe! A
fitting home for a man who has seen half the world and hopes to see the rest.

Realms of Innovation
The Rotating Gear is an expansive gazetteer following
the flow of technology across Golarion—from the ancient
automatons of the Jistka Imperium to the innovative
firearms produced on the continent of Arcadia, and
beyond. Each section touches on the history and culture
of a different part of Golarion, specifically focusing on
the context of the technologies that have arisen from or
are being actively developed in those areas. The sections
examine clockwork technology on one hand, and black
powder and firearms technology on the other.
Some of the sections describing these regions, such as
the section on Arcadia, explore new places on Golarion
in depth for the first time, while others, like the section
on Ustalav, focus on more recent developments and
technological discoveries.
The world of Golarion is a living, breathing entity,
shaped
by
adventurers,
innovators,
politicians,
smugglers, and pirates in a variety of ways. Beyond
the inventions and innovations of its
inhabitants, Golarion’s technology has
been impacted by beings from other
worlds, and travelers from Golarion
who return from distant planes
with their discoveries. This has led
to Golarion’s inhabitants making
new discoveries and advancing
technology at a pace unlike
anywhere else in the multiverse—
sometimes leaping ahead of the
progress
made
elsewhere
and
sometimes lagging behind as magic
and circumstance limit necessity and alter
the flow of innovation.
These sections also contain insights into the
associated regions, and their use of guns, gears, or
both, perfect for helping GMs unlock the full potential
of adventures set within those regions. For example,
GMs hoping to run an adventure in the gritty city of
Alkenstar will find detailed accounts of the people and
organizations vying for power there, while GMs who
set their adventures in Ustalav can benefit from a look
at how technologies from another world have spurred
amazing and sometimes terrifying advancements in a
variety of sciences. The streets of Absalom might seem a
little bit more wondrous than before after learning about
the clockwork inventions that serve as everything from
toys to weapons of powerful destruction. Examining
the development of black powder technology in context
with the geopolitics and history of its early spread on
the continents of Tian Xia and Vudra can help GMs add
depth to black powder adventures set in those areas.
While black powder weapons, clockwork technology,
and weird science might exist in hidden dungeons
anywhere on Golarion, the nations discussed in this
chapter are benefactors of technological advancement.
Technology doesn’t advance from one lone genius
experimenting in a hidden tower deep in the wilderness,
but instead through the iteration of ideas across various
people of different cultures, each of whom brings their
own unique elements and ideas to the table. Inventors
and gunslingers alike often find themselves drawn
to any of these regions as they search to advance and
perfect their craft, learning from the various innovations
and traditions across the world. Any scholar hoping to
understand how Golarion has been shaped by science and
mortal ingenuity can’t hope to reach that understanding
without knowing the details contained herein.
SECTION SUMMARIES
This chapter includes several different locations from
around the world of Golarion, each with their own
cultures and unique technological discoveries.
Dongun Hold and Alkenstar: This section covers the
history, culture, and modern politics of the dwarven Sky
Citadel of Dongun Hold and their human neighbors in
Alkenstar. It also includes a selection of dwarf ancestry
feats specific to dwarves from this region.
Absalom: Gadgets and Gizmos: This gazetteer talks
about the City at the Center of the World and the
clockwork gadgets and other advancements that can be
found there.
Arcadia: Beast Guns and Skymetals: This section
peels back the curtain on the continent of Arcadia with a
close-up look at the region known as the Deadshot Lands,
where they produce unusual firearms made of materials
incredibly difficult to obtain elsewhere in Golarion.
Jistka
Imperium:
Ancient
Automatons:
Learn
about the ancient empire known as the Jistka
Imperium, whose culture is still preserved in
the memories of the ageless automatons
crafted at the height of Jistkan power.
The Shackles: Cannons and Naval
Battles: Contained herein is a detailed
account of the proliferation of
firearms among the pirates of the
Shackles and how these weapons
influenced the tides of history.
Tian Xia and Vudra: Birth of Black
Powder: This treatise presents a brief
history of the black powder trade that
started in Tian Xia before crossing through
Vudra and on to the Inner Sea, and examines
the development and discovery of a variety of weapons
and explosives.
Ustalav: Spark and Shadow: This

DONGUN HOLD AND ALKENSTAR
When you appeared on our doorstep, Ancil Alkenstar, many insisted I would bring doom
to us all by granting you an audience. Instead, you became one of my dearest friends and a
life-long ally to our people, an alliance that has only grown stronger since your death, as the
city that bears your name has become inextricably bound to us through blood and battle.
You knew that would happen, didn’t you? You were barely more than a vagabond who’d
worn holes through the soles of your shoes, but your plans for the future inspired me right
from the beginning. You always saw friends and opportunities with an eye keen enough
to put any sniper to shame. You saw a future no one else could see and left it to me to
safeguard while you set out on your next grand adventure. How I miss and envy you!
There are still dwarves who say we should never have allied with you, graybeards who
respond to any evidence of the good the alliance has done us with doubtful nods and dire
warnings to “give it time.” Fools, I say! I have watched four generations of humanity grow
from children into adults of great renown and unimpeachable character, and in that time,
I have seen no more villains or criminals spring from their ranks than from our own. The
world you helped create is stronger than the one I inherited. Your children break bread and
sing songs with our own. If Geb and Nex should dare to bring their war to our doorstep once
more, humans and dwarves shall stand united, wielding weapons that can defend us from
any threat. If only you were alive to see what we have wrought, my friend!

or survivors but as defiant curators of their own
destinies—dwarves of Dongun Hold bid their Kulenett
kin farewell, destroyed the entrance to Dongun Hold,
and retreated below-ground.
This could have been their end, for without home or
purpose many dwarves found themselves without hope,
but the discovery of a strange black powder changed
the course of their lives. This volatile curiosity became a
balm for despair and provided hope for the future. With
every spark, explosion, and bullet impact, dwarves of
Dongun Hold crept closer to perfecting new weapons
they hoped would ensure their survival against enemies
they’d neither forgotten nor forgiven.
After four millennia, the dwarves have reclaimed
Dongun Hold and allied with Alkenstar. When the
nations of Geb and Nex next wage war, the dwarves
will be ready. They do not intend to lose the Hold again.
History of Dongun Hold
In the distant past, when nomadic dwarves completed
their Quest for Sky and spread across Golarion’s
surface, they constructed ten massive fortresses called
Sky Citadels which became bastions of dwarven culture,
craft, and commerce. While most dwarves engaged in
an endless war against their long-standing orc enemies,
the dwarves of the Dongun Hold Sky Citadel faced a
different threat: a wizard war. As the rival nations of
Geb and Nex battled, Dongun Hold became caught in
the crossfire. Their once-beautiful lands became a magicblasted wasteland where magic remained unstable,
the dead walked, and life mutated. As the battle lines
shifted, dwarven lands passed back and forth between
the warring human nations.
In 572 AR, the dwarves of Dongun Hold admitted
their way of life was unsustainable. Too stubborn to cede
their holdings to the petty warring humans who had
spoiled their lands, they bid farewell to their dwarven
kin, the Kulenett, traded news and gifts with them one
last time, and then retreated underground, collapsing
the entrance to Dongun Hold behind them. In time,
the dwarves settled deep below in the Darklands, in a
magic-dead cavern complex in Sekamina, where they
isolated themselves from the surface above.
EXPERIMENTATION IN EXILE
Among the final goods and gifts traded to dwarves
of Dongun Hold by the Kulenett was a strange black
powder. A costly novelty imported from the courts of
Tian Xia at great expense, Vudrani traders brought
the powder to Garund. Incredibly volatile, the black
powder exhibited explosive properties, and was quickly
deemed too dangerous to serve much purpose. But as
the centuries wore on, the dwarves of Dongun Hold saw
potential in the powder.
Driven by worry over the bickering wizards
aboveground, dwarves of Dongun Hold worked to
create weapons capable of overwhelming arcane
opponents and their minions—constructs, fiends,
undead, and the mutants of the Mana Wastes. With
fervent prayers to Torag and Angradd, the dwarven
gods of creation and war, the smiths of Dongun Hold
challenged the boundaries of invention, creating new
crafting methods, arms, and armor. Some among their
number experimented with black powder, creating
minor explosives. These dwarven smiths had received
a more controlled but weaker version of black powder
that Tian Xia had allowed to spread into Vudra. They
learned the powder’s composition, duplicated it, and
then improved it, unlocking the secrets of the more
volatile and stronger powder and setting the stage for
further innovation. In time, the dwarves used black
powder to create new weapons of war, including the first
matchlock—and later flintlock—firearms.
Although the new black powder weapons proved
powerful, their creation and use wasn’t without
incident or detractors. Dwarven smiths and warriors
lost fingers, hands, limbs, and lives to explosions and
misfires, leading many dwarves to question the value
of the weapons—for what use was a weapon that hurt
friend as well as foe? Living in a remote corner of the
Darklands forced the dwarves to rely on themselves
for healing and recovering from these accidents, which
strained resources that otherwise would have been
used to keep society safe from the dangers of Sekamina
that posed a constant threat. In addition to black
powder weapons, the dwarven smiths of Dongun Hold
pursued advancements in the ancient art of crafting
prostheses and mobility devices, which enabled
warriors and smiths to return to the forge and field
of battle. Effective, reliable, and designed for comfort,
dwarven prostheses have evolved over time into works
of exquisite craftsmanship and ingenuity, each richly
decorated and highly prized, even in countries with
their own traditions of producing such devices.
Over millennia, dwarves of Dongun Hold pushed the
boundaries of invention, creating a multitude of firearms,
bullets, explosives, siege weapons, and tools. Today,
they use breech-loaded flintlock firearms, including
a variety of pistols, muskets, and scatterguns. Many
dwarven gunsmiths continue to strive to create new and
more effective types of firearms, though prototypes of
these experimental weapons are incredibly rare, closely
guarded, and usually extremely volatile.

RETURN TO DONGUN HOLD
After generations of isolation, a human refugee named
Ancil Alkenstar visited the dwarves of Dongun Hold.
High King Anong Arunak met with the stranger,
discussing the state of the surface world and the end
of open hostilities between Geb and Nex. Shortly
thereafter, the dwarves returned to the surface, restored
their fallen Sky Citadel, and finally returned home to
the ancient, stone-carved halls of Dongun Hold. While
the dwarves rebuilt, Ancil united the other refugees and
clans of the Mana Wastes and established a settlement
just outside Dongun Hold, naming it the Grand Duchy
of Alkenstar.
In spite of the xenophobia of her people, High King
Arunak allied with Alkenstar, protecting the fledgling
settlers with dwarven sharpshooters and gunslingers.
Over the centuries, Alkenstar has grown drastically in
size. The innovators of Alkenstar’s massive Gunworks
manufacture dwarven firearms and explosives, tithing
a portion of the profits to Dongun Hold’s coffers. In
times of trouble, the dwarven sharpshooters still fight
to defend the city alongside their Alkenstar neighbors.
Throughout
the
Mana
Wastes, High King Arunak
and the dwarves of Dongun
Hold continue to be lauded
as brave heroes.
Despite
their
sudden
prosperity, the dwarves of Dongun Hold
struggle to find their place in a much-changed world.
They present a united front to outsiders but behind
closed doors there is division. The majority of dwarves
trust the judgment of their High King and celebrate
their return to Dongun Hold, taking great pride in their
position as respected defenders of both Dongun Hold
and Alkenstar. Despite a century of close contact with
Alkenstar, some individual dwarves remain accustomed
to seclusion, and tales of the human war that drove their
ancestors from Dongun Hold are held close in memory.
Among these traditionalist dwarves, extending trust and
friendship to their neighbors is a challenge with which
they remain uncomfortable.
Within the halls of Dongun Hold, three major
factions vie for the support of High King Arunak and
the dwarven people: the traditionalist Keepers of the
Skyflame, the mercantile Goldhand Lodge, and the
inventive Sparkforge Collective.
Keepers of the Skyflame
The Keepers of the Skyflame are dwarven traditionalists
who have long lobbied against the use of black powder
and the many inventions it has spawned. Citing the
danger and pain the devices have caused, the Keepers
urge their dwarven kin to abandon the use of firearms
and explosives, and instead refocus on traditional
methods of warfare.
At odds with the Sparkforge Collective, the Keepers
of the Skyflame lost respect for High King Arunak long
ago, when she chose to invest heavily in firearms, tripling
the resources and smiths devoted to their production,
and converting many traditional combat battalions to
firearm and demolition squads. The Keepers argued
against allying with Alkenstar and urge the High
King to sever ties with the human nation immediately.
They consider Dongun Hold’s status as a “holding”
of Alkenstar an unforgivable insult for which all of
Alkenstar owes recompense.
Although the Keepers of the Skyflame dislike the use
of firearms, they don’t deny their power and greatly fear
black powder weapons falling into unworthy hands—
which typically includes all non-dwarves. They believe
High King Arunak’s sharing of firearm technology with
Alkenstar represents a dangerous betrayal that threatens
all dwarven people.
As their pleas and warnings have continually been
ignored, some among the Keepers of the Skyflame turn
to extreme measures to preserve the future of Dongun
Hold. Rumormongers spread seeds of doubt
throughout the citizenry, playing upon
fear and xenophobia to
turn popular opinion
against High King
Arunak:
politicians
foil trade negotiations
and foreign alliances;
priests and historians encourage a return to traditional
and respected ways of life, glamorizing the past and
glorifying ancestral heroes; scoundrels steal or spoil
shipments of black powder; and renegades sabotage
forges and firearm shipments. The boldest among them
plan more direct action, including assassination and the
recent attacks against Alkenstar’s Gunworks.
Whatever the methods these desperate dwarves
utilize, they strive to keep their actions secret, often
blaming—and occasionally hiring—outsiders to do
their dirty work for them. Most dwarves caught taking
criminal action on behalf of the Keepers would rather
take the blame for their crimes alone than implicate their
organization, considering it an honorable sacrifice made
to ensure the survival of Dongun Hold and those who
would save it. This stubborn fanaticism has enabled the
Keepers of the Skyflame to continue their operations
without major setbacks.
Although High King Arunak has tried to maintain
peace between the factions of Dongun Hold, as
tensions rise, she’ll eventually have to take a stand
on these major ideological issues. Knowing the High
King’s opinion of their order, the Keepers of the
Skyflame prepare for her public condemnation, which
they hope to use to turn the dwarven populace against
her and spur an uprising that could change the course
of the future.

Goldhand Lodge
The Goldhand Lodge is a mercantile alliance that aims
to ensure the prosperity of Dongun Hold and its citizens
through commerce. Its members encourage the sale of
goods and services, from gold, metalwork, and firearms,
to contract mining, construction, and mercenary work.
During the dwarves’ long exile in the Darklands, the
Goldhand Lodge dwindled in importance. Under the
reign of High King Arunak, Dongun Hold reopened,
brokered an alliance with Alkenstar, and licensed the
right to create dwarven firearms to the Gunworks—all
measures which greatly empowered the Lodge.
In all ways, the Goldhand Lodge seeks to increase profits
for both their members and Dongun Hold as a whole.
They buck tradition, push boundaries, and embrace the
new—as long as it’s profitable. Their most influential
members negotiate trade agreements with Alkenstar and
other foreign nations, even including overtures to Nex
and Geb. As many dwarves still consider the citizens of
Nex and Geb their enemies, these maneuvers have earned
it little support among the dwarven populace. In hopes of
finding a profitable compromise, the Goldhand Lodge is
working to establish trading houses within Nex and Geb,
which would allow it to sell dwarven products far afield,
without dwarven crafters ever having to personally deal
with distasteful foreigners.
Since the creation of the Gunworks, High King
Arunak has tightly controlled the number of firearms it
produces, to ensure only a limited number are released
yearly. While many dwarves lauded this move as
practical, as it ensures dwarven firearms sell for high
prices and fewer enemies acquire them—members of
the Goldhand Lodge has long opposed the maneuver,
citing it as a hindrance that prevents dwarven goods
from reaching eager markets. They fear others will soon
create their own firearms and the need for weapons
from the Gunworks will dwindle. The Lodge urges High
King Arunak to vastly increase production quotas at the
Gunworks and allow dwarven gunsmiths to sell their
firearms direct to customers—with the aid of its brokers.
Until approval for such laws occurs, some members of
the Lodge turn to smuggling and other underhanded
tactics to ensure that dwarven goods and firearms reach
the open market and wealth flows into dwarven coffers.
Members of the Goldhand Lodge remain on the
lookout for innovative crafters in need of mercantile
connections.
They
regularly
hire
silver-tongued
negotiators, experienced mercenaries, and scoundrels
that aren’t afraid to bend the rules. On the third Fireday
of every month, they open their Dongun Hold and
Alkenstar offices to ambitious inventors, entrepreneurs,
and expedition leaders, inviting them to show off their
creations, businesses, and expedition plans. There they
purchase promising ideas outright, or offer investment
funding in exchange for partial ownership or control and
a hefty share of profits.
Sparkforge Collective
From humble beginnings, the Sparkforge Collective
rose to become one of the most influential—and
controversial—organizations
in
Dongun
Hold.
Originally a gathering of six dwarven crafters that
experimented with black powder, the Sparkforge
Collective now consists of hundreds of inventors and
gunsmiths, nearly a thousand sharpshooters, gunslingers,
and demolitionists, and countless dwarven citizens.
Regardless of role or station, members of the Sparkforge
Collective believe the future of Dongun Hold and the
survival of its people lies in the use of black powder.
The Collective’s founding members discovered how to
create, utilize, and weaponize black powder, creating
explosives, firearms, and other tools.
In the generations since its founding, the Sparkforge
Collective has grown by leaps and bounds, though its
goals remain consistent: develop new black powder
innovations and improve existing black powder
technologies and crafting methods. By embracing
these goals, members of the Sparkforge Collective
continually strive to not only create new firearms,
tools, and explosives for a wide range of specialties and
applications, but also improve the safety and reliability
of existing black powder devices and crafting methods.
Once a minor group of eccentric outsiders, the
Sparkforge Collective has expanded throughout Dongun
Hold and today, most dwarves support the Collective’s
actions and perceive the wisdom in the use of firearms.
Crafters and warriors associated with the Sparkforge
Collective remain well-respected throughout the Hold,
and those known to create, test, and utilize the newest
experimental creations and prototypes are celebrated as
heroes, for such work is incredibly dangerous. The practical
and stoic warriors that test devices, tools, and weapons
for the Sparkforge Collective must possess a steady hand
and extreme focus to ensure they minimize misfires and
other accidents. In contrast, inventors and experimental
gunsmiths typically have frazzled and scorched hair and
beards, and pock-marked skin that has endured numerous
explosions and fires. While some would consider these
qualities the signs of a poorly skilled smith, among the
Sparkforge Collective they serve as badges of bravery,
ingenuity, and honor.
The Sparkforge Collective has long been opposed by
the Keepers of the Skyflame and is often the target of
the Keepers’ ire. For their part, most members of the
Sparkforge Collective consider the Keepers so mired in
the past that they remain ignorant of true progress. The
Collective enjoys the support of High King Arunak and
the Goldhand Lodge, although the Collective and the
Lodge don’t always agree, as members of the Sparkforge
Collective often focus more on innovation and progress
than profit. The Sparkforge Collective is always looking
for smiths, alchemists, and inventors to join their ranks
and reliable warriors to test their creations in the field.

================================================================================

Preparations For War
Despite their differences, dwarves of Dongun Hold have
never forgotten the source of their troubles and long
exile—it was the warring human nations of Geb and Nex
that spoiled their lands and drove the dwarves from their
home. Aware that at any moment the old grudges between
these wizard nations could rekindle into devastating
war, the inhabitants of Dongun Hold remain alert for
signs of conflict which they both fear and consider to be
inevitable. The various factions and dwarves of Dongun
Hold offer their support to war preparations in
different, but invaluable ways.
Dwarves who dwell on the surface keep a
watchful eye out for trouble and their ears
open for rumors, both in Alkenstar and
further afield in Geb and Nex. Most work
to keep the citizens of Alkenstar on their
side and in fighting form, as Alkenstar
remains a convenient first line of
defense between Dongun Hold
and the neighboring wizard
nations. Other dwarves stay
in close contact with their
Kulenett kin, arming them
in secret to prepare for the
possibility of an undead
invasion of the Kulenett’s
underground highway.
Warriors train and invent
new combat styles relentlessly,
and practice methods for combating
spellcasters, undead, constructs, and fiends.
Many dwarves utilize firearms and explosives,
and those who don’t still know how the weapons
function for safety purposes.
Smiths of all kinds embrace Torag and Angradd as the
gods of creation and warfare, seeking their blessing as
they develop new arms and armor to protect themselves
and their people. Dwarven gunsmiths invent, advance,
and push boundaries, determined to create weapons
capable of overwhelming their enemies. Deep in the
Hold, the dwarves create the most ingenious weapons
in blessed forges, stamped with the seal of Angradd and
Torag, and keep them secret from the surface world.
Most Dongun dwarves are wary of spellcasters and
the undead, regardless of origin, and foreigners are
rarely invited into the halls of the Hold. Many dwarves
decorate their hair, beards, and armor with miniature
censers, embers, or tindertwigs—objects useful for
rapidly creating sparks and flame—and style their hair
with nonflammable cream while lathering their skin
with flame-repellent ointments and lotions.
The most cautious dwarves urge High King Arunak
to reopen the Darklands retreat they once called home,
while priests reinforce old protections and masons
refortify battlements, caverns, and other defenses.
BLACK POWDER INNOVATORS
The advent of black powder technology drastically
changed life in the Mana Wastes for dwarves of Dongun
Hold and their Alkenstar neighbors. Although many
alchemists, inventors, and smiths have contributed to the
evolution and advancement of black powder weaponry, the
contributions of six dwarves rise above all others. These
six dwarves were founding members of the Sparkforge
Collective and the very first to harness black powder. They
collaborated throughout their careers, sharing discoveries,
building upon one another’s successes, and learning
from each other’s failures. These respected
dwarven innovators are listed below.
Jarvek Goldtongue (N Male Dwarf
Politician): Remembered more as a politician
than an inventor, Jarvek is widely regarded
as the mastermind behind the Sparkforge
Collective. They’re responsible for acquiring
funding and facilities for the group to
conduct their work and for sharing
the
group’s
advances
and
inventions with leadership
and
security
councils.
Without Jarvek’s tireless
politicking, the Sparkforge
Collective wouldn’t exist.
Maribun
Enbit
(NG
Female Dwarf Alchemist):
An alchemist by trade,
Maribun was the first to deduce
the composition of black powder and
successfully recreate it. Although her formula has
been refined over the years, nearly all common iterations
are based upon her work.
Brondar Steelheart (N Agender Dwarf Blacksmith):
Brondar experimented with black powder’s explosive
qualities and was the first to create a controlled explosion
using it. Their efforts in creating and cataloging black
powder explosions paved the way for the safe creation of
explosives, firearms, and a variety of black powder tools.
Alrune Thengor (CG Male Dwarf Demolitionist): A
talented engineer and stonemason, Alrune was an expert
in demolitions. He created the first compact black powder
explosive, which he housed in a flammable mushroom husk.
Herrod the Brash (CE Male Dwarf Demolitionist): Known
for his mood swings, Herrod was the first to successfully
combine black powder weaponry with fuses.
Nelbi Firebrow (LN Female Dwarf Gunsmith, Deceased):
Nelbi created the first black powder firearm. Incredibly
volatile and hand lit, her creation numbers among the most
influential inventions in the history of the Mana Wastes.
Other major advancements in black powder weaponry
include the creation of the first matchlock firearm by Kravik
the Clanless (unknown) and the creation of the flintlock
mechanism by Oga Ulstod (LG female dwarf engineer).

Though Golarion has no shortage of fantastical cities and
locales, few are as unique as the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar
by pure necessity. Cradled in the blasted heart of the Mana
Wastes, the source of nearly all firearms in the Inner Sea
might seem to be no more than a large, walled town to
the casual observer. However, the unreliability of magic,
upon which most other societies depend, has bred a level
of innovation that would not be possible elsewhere. In
this young, isolated nation, science and technology are
a necessity, with human innovation joining dwarven
engineering to achieve all sorts of marvelous technological
advancements at breakneck speed. Founded by the refugee
Ancil Alkenstar after he fled arrest in Nex, the nation
has risen to prosperity by serving as a trade link between
the crafters of Dongun Hold and the wider world. With
little arable land to grow its own crops, Alkenstar relies
on specialized exports of iced wine to Geb, and weapons
and armaments forged by skilled artisans to the rest of the
Inner Sea to keep its citizens fed.
The duchy never forgets the debt it owes to the
dwarven fortress of Dongun Hold for the advances that
were shared between peoples, such as the development of
black powder and firearms, and the repeated assistance
the Sky Citadel continues to provide. Still, even the
smiths of Dongun Hold find themselves surprised and
impressed by some of the advancements the humans have
made in the realm of firearm development. Acting as
home to some of the most skilled crafters both humanity
and dwarvenkind have to offer, Alkenstar has become a
veritable pilgrimage destination for inventors, alchemists,
architects, and anyone else fascinated by innovation.
Situated near the heart of the Mana Wastes between
Nex and Geb, the City of Smog can’t easily be reached
from any direction using conventional means of travel.
Most travelers make their way south through Katapesh
and Nex, though the unregulated guides that serve as
escorts on this journey are often as likely to rob their
charges and leave them for dead as they are to see them to
the destination safely. One of the safer options is to travel
with one of the merchant caravans that carry goods
back and forth along the route. Engineers who journey
to Smog seeking fortune rarely return to their countries
of origin, as the gravity and excitement of Alkenstar’s
industries has a way of holding their attention.
ALKENSTAR, THE CITY OF SMOG

================================================================================
PAGE 197
================================================================================

The Factory Fortress
A small fortress in and of itself, the massive factory in the
heart of Alkenstar known as the Gunworks is the center
of firearms manufacturing in the Inner Sea. Though
Alkenstar’s High Parliament regulate all production
of firearms with input from dwarves of Dongun Hold,
several independent manufacturing companies lease
space inside the Gunworks for their own purposes. While
production has doubled in the last several years, allowing
a large enough flow of firearms and siege weapons for
some minor targeted trading outside of Alkenstar’s walls,
the Gunworks’ boundless capacity still leaves significant
room for development and expansion. Mechanists toil in
myriad sublevels of the factory, plotting improvements
to the massive bombard known as the Maw of Rovagug,
experimenting with stronger mixtures of gunpowder, and
devising new types of firearms.
Each level of the Gunworks supports a specific
purpose, with deeper basements dug with the help of
Dongun Hold’s dwarven engineers as the need arises. The
level just below the surface is the master stockpile, where
the Gunworks stores produced firearms for emergency
use or special sale. Below that is the shrapnel field, where
they test each weapon against rigorous performance
standards. Deeper still are the production lines, which
house hundreds of workbenches for artisans to
construct individual components of a firearm
before a foreman assembles the weapon in a
separate room, to limit the chance of a rogue
worker leaving with full knowledge of the
product’s creation. The walled structure that
resides on top of the complex serves as a secure fortress,
allowing for the shipment of orders and monitoring of
the Gunworks as a whole.
This security has recently been put to the most
strenuous test since the Gorilla King robbed the
Gunworks in 4690 AR. The Keepers of the Skyflame
have long protested the decision of Anong Arunak to
give Ancil Alkenstar the secrets of forging firearms and
processing black powder. Tensions have grown over
the last century and beyond, with younger members of
the faction plotting to take a firm stand. In 4719 AR a
dozen Keepers posing as dwarven contractors from the
Hold, seized control of a bombard near the entrance to
the master stockpile and set a match to the vast supply.
The resulting explosion collapsed the exit points for all
workers below, leaving them trapped. High King Arunak
quickly dispatched workers to dig temporary tunnels
for an evacuation while the shieldmarshals responsible
for the city’s safety mounted a desperate and costly
attack on the insurgents. When the fighters defeated the
assailants and rescued the survivors, the casualties were
in the hundreds, including all but one of the Keepers. The
surviving assailant accepted full responsibility for the
attack, evading any connections that might implicate the
Keepers as a whole. The High Parliament is still working
with High King Arunak to find an agreeable resolution to
the incident and address concerns about future attacks.
Even without proof, many still suspect the members of
the Keepers of the Skyflame encouraged the attack. In the
interim, trusted Dongun Hold engineers have repaired
the Gunworks at no cost to Alkenstar and Dongun Hold
has supplemented security around the site with veterans
and retirees who have fulfilled their other obligations.
Smoke in the Streets
Despite being the main source of gunpowder weaponry
in the Inner Sea, firearms are not a universal tool among
the citizenry of the city-state. Pistols have become a

symbol of status among the well-appointed in Alkenstar’s
high society, with prosperous merchants and nobles
brandishing their weapons openly to show off garish
gold plating and intricately carved ivory handles. In
the aristocratic Auburn District of the city, a subtrade
has bloomed, focused around designing additions to
firearms and swapping out fashion pieces for when the
styles change or weapons switch owners. This has in
turn helped propel all manner of businesses related to
the customization of firearms, from mounted scopes to
bandoliers with mithral straps.
For the less fortunate of Alkenstar, the quickest
way to obtain a firearm is to enlist as a member of
the city’s primary source of law-enforcement, the
shieldmarshals. Specially armed with black powder
weapons and trained in their use, the shieldmarshals
both maintain order within the City of Smog and watch
its walls for threats from the Mana Wastes. Serving as a
shieldmarshal requires extensive commitment, though
the pay is well above what most beyond the nobility
could expect to earn in any other occupation. Still, the
authority that comes with wielding a destructive weapon
and the weight of upholding the law can pose the potential
for corruptive influence. A great many among the
shieldmarshals have used their positions to jockey for more
influence, extorting common and noble citizens alike. In
4718 AR, an investigation into missing firearms from the
Gunworks exposed over two hundred shieldmarshals who
participated in an organized smuggling ring and criminal
enterprise. The perpetrators were stripped of their rank and
exiled into the Mana Wastes, leaving the shieldmarshals
with a vast shortage of personnel.
Though led in name by Ironmaster Vulane, most
shieldmarshals look to High Shieldmarshal Armand
Meneley (LG male human gunslinger) as their true
commander. Armand holds a seat in Alkenstar’s High
Parliament, where he serves as a check against both the
Grand Duchess and the less scrupulous nobles of the
Parliament. The aging lawman argues with a strong voice
both for the careful dispensation of firearms to protect
the City of Smog and against the ever-growing corruption
in the ranks of the shieldmarshals (something he privately
suspects is due to the Ironmaster’s own illicit dealings).
He also butts heads frequently with Eliza Baratella (NG
female human construct crafter), the designer of the Brass
Guardians that have begun to replace the humanoid
guard of Alkenstar.
The continuous corruption in the ranks of the
shieldmarshals has encouraged Parliament to seek
alternatives, and where there is opportunity to be had in
the city, there are inventors willing to create solutions.
Initially creating her clockwork sentinels to guard
against the mutants that crawl out from the separated
Ironside Quarter, Eliza lobbied for their deployment
throughout the city as supplemental forces. Against
Armand’s strenuous objections, the High Parliament
approved the motion. Over the last decade these entities
have begun to outnumber the living shieldmarshals,
resulting in a typical patrol consisting of multiple
Brass Guardians and a pair of humanoid officers to
communicate and provide directives. Despite their
touted benefits, these limited constructs are not capable
of judging the morality of their orders. Thus, some
corrupt shieldmarshals have been able to bolster their
efforts with imposing clockwork bodyguards who act
decisively with little need for persuasion. Despite reports
of shieldmarshals commanding their clockwork escorts
to destroy property as a means of extortion, Eliza insists
these are isolated incidents that the next update to the
Guardians’ mechanics will rectify.
BRASS GUARDIANS
The creation of magical constructs is exceptionally
difficult and foolishly dangerous within most of
the Mana Wastes, including the Brass Guardians,
clockwork guardians designed to serve Alkenstar as
guards. However, the Skyside half of Alkenstar to the
east has largely normal magical function. The Brass
Guild creates all the automatons in this prosperous
section of the City of Smog before deploying the
enforcers into the magical dead zones. For decades,
this production line has proved effective and functional.
However, in the summer of 4719 AR, complaints of
rogue Brass Guardians began to reach the Guild’s ears.
Investigation of the units showed evidence of rapid
degradation to the magical cortexes of the clockwork
soldiers. Researchers were able to narrow down that
all rogue units had recently patrolled neighborhoods in
Smokeside, magically dead sections of the city. A few
weeks later, the High Parliament received reports of
significant stirring among the mutants of the Wastes.
Not a believer in coincidence, Eliza Baratella, head of
the Brass Guild and creator of the first Brass Guardians,
commissioned a task force of her best engineers to see
if the Mana Wastes are beginning to worsen in a way
that could negatively affect her creations.
The results of the inquiry continue to evolve, but
preliminary findings indicate that the fundamental nature
of the Mana Wastes may be mutating even more rapidly
than the creatures that inhabit it. The degradation of the
Brass Guardians’ processing cores results from an active
force, not a simple antimagic effect.
Around the same time Eliza’s taskforce determined this,
the fleshforges in Ecanus, a nearby city in Nex, spun back
to life, ejecting monstrosities unheard of since the rule of
Nex’s legendary founder. Most of the researchers point
to a sudden shift in the Mana Wastes’ odd properties,
but one dissenter posited a more disturbing theory: the
imminent return of the archwizard Nex. For now, Eliza
has chosen to keep these developments a secret, but
information such as this rarely stays hidden for long.

The Politics of Powder
While those with knowledge of the recent stirrings in
Geb and Nex have thus far managed to avoid keeping the
information from spreading into wild rumormongering,
Alkenstar is not so remote or isolated that word of
the outside world fails to breach its walls. The people
of Alkenstar know that they exist wedged between
the two magical superpowers of Geb and Nex. Most
shieldmarshals carry at least one magical silver bullet in
their kit when traveling beyond the city’s walls just in case
they should encounter a vampire scout or other undead
creature sneaking across the border of the Mana Wastes.
As military activity in the neighboring kingdoms
continues to grow, the Grand Duchess has formed an
unlikely but politically savvy alliance with the nation
of Vidrian. Vidrian has its own struggles with pirates
and Chelaxian privateers, but possesses a powerful
navy, something the landlocked city-state of Alkenstar
lacks entirely. The two nations have formed an accord
wherein Alkenstar provides a small number of cannons
and firearms to Vidrian in exchange for Vidrian
providing naval escorts for valuable shipments and
keeping pressure on Nex and Geb politically to keep
their fighting to themselves. Though the two nations are
on opposite sides of the continent and separated by a
dangerous mountain range, magical communications
and shared interests have allowed them both to benefit
from this relationship.
Gunners of Fortune and
Infamy
As the font of most firearms in the Inner Sea, it is
unsurprising that Alkenstar is also the origin of the area’s
storied gunslingers. While the High Parliament sets rules
to contain the acquisition of firearms, it sets no true rules
on who can carry them or leave the city with one in their
possession. Theft of the weapons, or simply keeping a
service weapon after leaving the shieldmarshals, are a
shade more common than actually purchasing one. The
knowledge of the formula for gunpowder is much more
difficult to obtain, however, as it isn’t used outside the
secure confines of the Gunworks. The shieldmarshals
know that without this critical process a pistol is nothing
more than a short club before long. As a result, most
gunpowder must be purchased inside Alkenstar or stolen,
which keeps gunslingers close to the City of Smog.
The most infamous and active of these powder thieves
are a trio of vagabonds called the Lover’s Triangle.
Kastus (CN male human ruffian), is the apparent
leader, a former stockboy in the Gunworks who decided
robbing boats along the Ustradi River was an easier
and more entertaining career. Tarluc (NE male half-elf
charlatan) reportedly serves as the Triangle’s scout
and con artist, luring guards and travelers with stories
of attacking mutants or other lies. Elysse (N female
half-orc gunslinger) acts as the muscle for the group,
and has warrants for over a dozen murders to her
name. The band came together when Kastus
broke Tarluc and Elysse free during a prisoner
transfer years ago, and since then they have
continued to plague the merchant routes in
and out of Alkenstar. Their patterns of robbery
and preferred targets are erratic, fluctuating from
hijacking munitions transports bound for Vidrian to
stealing food shipments inbound from Geb.
Further outside the walls of Alkenstar, travelers have
reported a seemingly impossible sight: a mass of goblins,
each carrying a makeshift musket. At first locals suspected
they were simply sticks mistaken for firearms at a distance,
until the goblin clan opened fire on a barge, their giddy
laughter barely audible over the shots. A shieldmarshal
patrol was sent to investigate and came back with news
that the goblins called themselves the Powder-Teeth Clan.
The leader of the clan was able to provide a bill of sale for
the firearms, dated several years ago. The human listed
on the bill was a smuggler from Alkenstar, and when the
shieldmarshals pressed the goblins for more information
they revealed that she sold the weapons to the clan for
a collection of gems. Later, the goblins admitted, she
returned to steal her goods back, underestimating the
encampment’s security and the speed with which the

goblins would master their new black powder weaponry.
No amount of negotiation could convince the goblins to
reveal how they replace their supply of gunpowder, but
the shieldmarshal report notes craters throughout the
camp, suggesting experimentation.
Not all firearm wielders beyond Alkenstar’s walls,
nor within them, are the nefarious sort. Many
shieldmarshals are infuriated by the corruption of some
of their peers and work doubly hard to improve the
organization’s reputation within the city while keeping
a watchful eye open for actionable proof to bring their
corrupt counterparts to justice. Retired guards and
shieldmarshals often choose to purchase their service
weapons once their tour of duty is complete, using the
weapon to earn a new life for themselves beyond what a
10-year pension can afford. Dobra Brak (N male half-orc
shieldmarshal) and his partner Betta Blunak (LN female
dwarf sniper) run a small adventuring company of such
retirees, escorting merchants through the Mana Wastes.
Innovators in a New Age
All of the skill and proliferation of Alkenstar’s
mechanisms would be irrelevant without the genius
of the inventors who create them. The City of Smog
attracts the finest engineering minds in the Inner Sea, as
well as adventurers looking to hone their craft among
the symphony of clicking gears and drumming pistons.
Craftworks devoted to clockwork items, alchemical
solutions, and even prosthetic limbs ready for fitting line
the gilded streets of the Auburn District. The clockwork
guardians known as Brass Guardians stand at each
street corner, the methodical tick of their systems a quiet
reminder of Alkenstar’s technological progress.
The Greaseblood Infirmary, despite the unpleasant
name, is a building where the unfortunate flock. Founded
by Adrick Slatejoint (NG male dwarf physician)
and Tonra Slatejoint (CG male dwarf engineer), the
Infirmary is the foremost developer of prosthetic limbs in
Alkenstar. Husbands from Dongun Hold, the Slatejoints
use a dual solution of alchemy and clockwork to treat
patients, healing those sickened from the fumes of the
city’s thousands of chimneys and replacing appendages
lost in factory accidents. Though the expense of the
treatments can be high, patients pay only what they can
afford. Tonra comes from old dwarven aristocracy and
is always prepared to use his family fortune to cover any
losses the Infirmary incurs, though the high quality of
the facility’s prosthetics makes it a preferred vendor for
the aristocracy, and it’s incredibly rare for the Infirmary’s
operating budget to exceed its income.
While Alkenstar has no shortage of clockwork
engineers, none have the prestige or funding of
Professor Radpol (LN male gnome inventor). The
scientist came to Alkenstar decades ago, focusing on
the study of clockwork automatons as a way to stave
off the Bleaching. Though none of his designs ever
reached open market, he garnered the attention of
Grand Duchess Ricia, who has since financed his work
exclusively. Ten years of silence have passed from the
professor since the unveiling of the Black Ephemeron,
a massive creation of ebony steel that stands over the
raised bailey of Alkenstar Castle in a taciturn watch. No
one can deny the imposing presence of the construct, yet
few have ever witnessed it move, leading to accusations
that its functionality is merely an illusion. As Professor
Radpol makes no public appearances nor publishes any
academic papers, he has not yet refuted this claim.
With the lack of grain and other produce available
in Alkenstar, horses have proven to be a difficult
commodity to provide for, even among the wealthy of
the city’s elite. Racing has become a prestigious sport,
with room for alternative solutions to feeding the
athletic steeds. Capitalizing on this demand, Jamiria
Bronzehoof (N nonbinary halfling inventor) cornered
the market on clockwork horseracing, lobbying an
evolution of the sport revolving around the optimization
of artificial steeds. Jockeys require a different set of skills
than mundane horse racers, birthing a separate pool of
athletes than those who compete in other regions of the
Inner Sea. The optimization of clockwork mounts, as
well as the talented riders that can manipulate them, has
become an obsession in some circles of the elite. Riders
with a knack for piloting artificial steeds have quickly
become a commodity in the City of Smog, allowing
for well-to-do patrons to fund contesting teams in the
lucrative racing cups that serve as entertainment for rich
and poor spectators alike.
A HELPING HAND
With the presence of black powder weapons, deadly
mutants, and the occasional insurgent attack, serious
injuries in Alkenstar are far more common than the
magic capable of repairing them. Both Dongun Hold and
Alkenstar hold their veterans in high regard, and as a
result, the government supplies veterans wounded in the
line of duty with quality prostheses.
Though
Dongun
Hold’s
dwarves
have
had
well-developed prostheses since long before the advent
of Alkenstar, many veterans still struggled with mobility,
arthritis, and other pains brought on by their injuries.
In recent years, the human shieldmarshals recovering
from the loss of a limb have developed various forms of
physical therapy and targeted calisthenics, and they’ve
shared these practices with their dwarven allies. It is
now fairly common to see mixed groups of human and
dwarven veterans stretching and exercising together
near the city perimeter ahead of a daily run or other
activity. Younger guards who join these groups as soon
as they begin their recovery from a traumatic injury
sometimes even find themselves able to return to full
duty within a few short months.

Angradd, willing a higher power to guide your aim in the
heat of battle. On your next Strike with a ranged weapon
before the end of your turn, you gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target’s concealed
condition, as well as your target’s lesser, standard, and
greater cover.
DWARVEN IDIOMS OF DONGUN HOLD
Dongun dwarves developed their own unique sayings
from their time sequestered to the caverns of Sekamina
and their cultural diffusion with Alkenstar.
Ancillary magnet: A person who winds up taking all
the credit, while not necessarily trying to do so.
Between blobs and zombies: Facing the choice of two
terrible options. While the nation of Nex isn’t quite as evil
as Geb, that didn’t help the Dongun dwarves.
Nose: A firearm barrel.
Nosy: Too quick to solve problems with a gun.
Powder my nose: Reload my black powder firearm.
Taking Arunak’s wager: Extending trust and making
oneself vulnerable to earn trust, often involving thrusting
oneself into an uncomfortable social situation. Originally
used narrowly and meant as a positive, Keepers of
the Skyflame have begun to use it more broadly and
negatively to mean making a foolish wager or bargain.

The City at the Center of the World draws merchants
from across Golarion and points beyond, making it an
ideal place to seek out specialized items and services.
Clockworks can be found among the rare items for sale
in Absalom’s bazaars, and the city boasts several skilled
inventors and tinkers able to handle all sorts of different
custom commissions.
The Flow of Innovation
Absalom has long been a haven for innovation and the
development of new ideas and inventions alike. While
its immense size and crowded streets appeal to urbanites
more than to those who prefer the countryside, the city
consistently draws many inventors. Three key reasons
for the longstanding appeal to this diverse and eager
group are Absalom’s ready market for buyers, its
concentration of specialists, and the wide availability of
a variety of components.
Absalom’s size and prominent location make it a
buyer’s market for ordinary goods, as competition in the
city is extremely high. Eggs, plain furniture, or tools that
might command a reasonable price in tiny communities
such as Otari or Abberton sell at low prices here, or
don’t get purchased at all. The same isn’t true for
specialized items. Absalom remains arguably among
the best places in the Inner Sea region to sell specialized
goods. A cunning wind-up toy might not sell for any
price in a small community, where people don’t have
the time or coin for such luxuries. Inventors who live
far from a bustling city might plan to sell a specialized
device to a wealthy patron, but if the patron changes
their mind or lowers the price, there’s often not much
the seller can do. This isn’t the case in Absalom; no
matter how unusual or customized something is, there’s
guaranteed to be someone in the city willing to buy it.
Finding that buyer, of course, poses its own challenges.
The city’s market for specialized goods draws
specialists from far distances. If you’re in the business of
creating custom constructs or labor-saving devices, you
soon learn that living and working near your ultimate
market is more efficient. Proximity to specialists with
similar
interests—frequenting
the
same
vendors,
consulting the same reference libraries, and so on—
means you’re much more likely to find another specialist

with matching interests. Priests of Brigh, for example,
count on this camaraderie to spur innovation via
frequent lectures at their temple in the Ascendant Court.
Mechanics are a quirky lot; some are misanthropes who
dislike sharing any findings with others, but most enjoy
advancing their knowledge by consulting with peers.
This collegial learning is further amplified by Absalom’s
many universities and academies. The foremost
example is the Clockwork Cathedral, the preeminent
institution for specialists who might take a few courses
to expand their horizons, frequent the institution to
make like-minded acquaintances, or even take a turn at
teaching classes to other eager minds.
As the city develops multiple specialists, unusual
components become easier and easier to find. Exacting
specification is needed when engineering new tools
and precision machinery, and therefore any reclusive
tinkerer who needs a particular gear or spring must
normally make it themself or order it from a distant
manufacturer. However, these manufacturers bring their
wares right to Absalom, as there’s a sufficient number of
buyers looking for their components.
Other items are entirely constructed in Absalom,
as the city is a large manufacturing center. Not only
that, manufacturers produce greater quantities of these
components as demand grows, sometimes requiring
more skilled engineers in order to effectively increase
production. Premade and easily acquired components
are particularly important to the makers of clockwork
devices, because crafting each cog and wheel is
laborious for even the most exacting machinist. Most
inventors would prefer to receive base materials they
know they can trust to fit their standards to the most
minute inspections. They would rather focus their
efforts instead on dreaming up what sorts of brand new
inventions they can build by combining these parts in a
unique way.
All these factors combine to spur innovation
within the city of Absalom, but only a few of these
innovations are kept completely secret or restricted,
and thus progress doesn’t stay confined within its walls.
A well-educated specialist might have any number
of reasons to leave the city: a prestigious posting in
a distant metropolis, a change in financial or family
circumstances, or simply a desire to be away from the
crushing crowds of the City at the Center of the World.
Those who leave Absalom take their knowledge (and
often, their equipment and innovations) along with
them to their new homes, thus spreading their skills
to others in distant lands. After all, the opportunity
to learn from a student of the Clockwork Cathedral
isn’t something an inventor in, say Riddleport, is likely
to experience twice! This education, in turn, spurs the
inquisitive or talented to return to Absalom, whether
during the years or generations that follow. And so, the
flow of innovation through Absalom continues.
Absalom Locations
The following locations in Absalom are useful for any
adventure in the City at the Center of the World, but
they are of particular interest to those associated with
or seeking out unusual technology.

MECHANICAL ERRORS
Anyone seeking low-cost gadgets in Absalom’s markets
is likely to find intriguing items that don’t work entirely
as expected. Here are some malfunctions you can include
with any mechanical device.
Belches Smoke: The machine emits a puff of smoke
every few minutes. For the round after it malfunctions,
anything in the space occupied by the machine is
concealed, and all creatures are concealed from any
creature in that space. The smoke might eventually cause
a significant nuisance or even a breathing hazard if there
isn’t sufficient air circulation.
Erratically Fails: The mechanism has an activation
flat check (usually with a DC of 2 or 3); on a failure,
the contraption simply fails to activate. If the machine
successfully activates, it operates normally thereafter,
unless it has another malfunction from this list.
Injures Bystanders: The machine has an errant
flywheel, metal tang, or other piece that swings outward
at irregular intervals. When it malfunctions, each nearby
creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw with a
DC appropriate for the item’s level (Core Rulebook 503)
or take damage of a type appropriate to the malfunction.
This is typically no more than 1d4 damage but could be
more dangerous for larger or more complex clockworks.
Leaks: Once a day, the mechanism leaks oil, coolant,
or some other fluid into its space and a random adjacent
square (or, if the GM desires, whichever adjacent space
causes the party the most trouble). The affected squares
are uneven ground (Core Rulebook 476), requiring
creatures who pass through the square to succeed at an
Acrobatics check to Balance with a DC appropriate for
the item’s level.
Rattles: When it’s moved or jostled, the machine emits
a noisy rattling for 1 round that can be heard clearly by
nearby creatures.
Scorches Oil: The machine emits the stench of burnt oil
or rubber at unpredictable intervals (but usually no more
than once an hour). Creatures adjacent to the machine
when it malfunctions become sickened 1 by the smell.
Violently
Explodes:
The
machine’s
internal
mechanisms fly apart, destroying it. Obviously, it can
malfunction in this way only once, and the GM should
have a good reason to destroy a mechanism upon which
the party relies.

Coins district. The imposing structure of metal plates
and massive cogwheels resembles an enormous
mechanical centipede with a clock tower rising from its
back. The gears festooning the building aren’t merely
for decoration; its walls, inner chambers, and outer
plates all move at the behest of the building’s inscrutable
and unseen masters. The structure’s name is something
of a misnomer, as it’s not a religious building but an
educational one.
Aspiring students come from all across Golarion to
learn from the Clockwork Cathedral’s faculty, all of
whom are themselves students with several years of
experience. The mysterious masters of the Clockwork
Cathedral send their trudging servitor constructs around
the academy to do their business. This business includes
not only mundane errands such as tightening loose
screws or sweeping up, but also delivering admission
paperwork and collecting tuition (which is never seen
again). Visitors learn to sidestep these single-minded
servitors, which rarely bother to turn from their business
to avoid trampling an inattentive student or awestruck
passerby. Admission decisions and tuition amounts
seem to be wholly arbitrary, as eager students are just
as likely to be invited into the Clockwork Cathedral’s
shadowy iron halls as they are to be turned away.
Students and faculty of the Clockwork Cathedral
gather in groups called cognates. These groups generally
focus on a single discipline or area of expertise; for
example, the Alive and Ticking cognate specializes in
healing, applying a mechanical mindset to repairing
ailments of the body. The Cog’s Best Friend cognate
focuses on the creation of construct companions, doing
its best to instill ephemeral concepts such as loyalty into
clockwork mechanisms.
The Clockwork Cathedral’s founder and inventor
is a mysterious robed figure called the Assembler (N
agender construct 19). The Assembler arrived
in Absalom’s harbor aboard a clockwork ship
almost a century ago, claiming to be the only
living creature aboard. After purchasing the rights
to an abandoned plot of land near Misery Row, the
Assembler magically transported the clockwork ship
there and, over the course of a month, transformed the
ship into the academy’s current shape.
Despite the many mysteries of its operation, the
Clockwork Cathedral is held in great esteem. Graduates
of its programs in engineering, metallurgy, and
mechanics remain in high demand across the Inner Sea
region. Anyone interested in the lore of clockworks and
related sciences would do well to seek admittance, even
if only for a semester or two.
GALLERY OF INNOVATION
The Clockwork Cathedral isn’t the only place in
Absalom to delve into the mysteries of clockwork
mechanisms. Priests of Brigh in the Ascendant Court
happily chat about engineering and innovation to
visitors. Although each has their own specialties, they
generally know about other worshippers’ research areas
and can point inquirers to the best people to answer
specific or detailed questions.
Absalom’s prominent temple to Brigh is called the
Gallery of Innovation. In addition to functioning as a
museum (with detailed technological exhibits that rotate
regularly), the temple contains several lecture halls,
from which they give and host lectures on a regular
basis. Most of these lectures are on abstruse or highly
specialized topics, so the lecture schedule is set months
in advance to ensure the largest audience of specialized

knowledge-seekers from around the Inner Sea region.
The priests understand that collaboration propels
innovation and often waive entry fees for interested but
impoverished attendees who seem likely to contribute
some useful knowledge.
Priests at the Gallery of Innovation are required
to give lectures as part of their regular temple duties,
but those who don’t enjoy public speaking foist the
obligations onto junior acolytes. While this duty is a
great opportunity for the temple’s newest members—
as nothing sharpens one’s knowledge on a subject like
having to speak to a room full of experts on it—this
practice results in many of the lectures being somewhat
haphazard, with the audience often providing opinions
and corrections. Flindish Tanwhirl (N female gnome
cleric 10), the current high priest of Brigh, is an enigmatic
gnome whom some claim to be more
clockworks than flesh. She spends so
much of her time at the Clockwork
Cathedral that her rare appearances
at the Gallery of Innovation cause
ripples of excitement. The few
lectures Flindish gives each year are
as crowded as they are convoluted.
WINDARIUM
The Windarium in Westgate is often
an inventor’s first stop for supplies, as the
proprietors sell all manner of screws, springs,
gears, and assorted components. A married couple,
Symo (LG male half-orc expert 11) and Mirtion (LN
male human merchant 6), run the shop; Symo is the
mechanical genius, while Mirtion is better at inventory
management and sales. Symo recently accepted a
high-ranking position in Absalom’s military, supervising
siege weapons and similar mechanical contrivances,
so the frantic Mirtion often runs the Windarium by
himself. Due to his lack of mechanical know-how,
Mirtion is easily flustered by detailed questions from
knowledgeable shoppers. The Windarium also sells
completed toys, devices, and curiosities at modest prices;
most of these are Symo’s inventions created during his
off hours. Although these curiosities are usually reliable
and virtually never dangerous, Mirtion doesn’t provide
any guarantees about the effectiveness of his husband’s
ticking, clattering wares.
MARKETS
Absalom’s bustling markets are an excellent place to
seek out clockwork innovations, although someone new
to a market might have to ask around to find the right
vendor. The Grand Bazaar is the best place to purchase
cunning clockwork contraptions, but God’s Market
does a brisk trade in Brighite innovations. Unless a
purchaser is seeking something simple, the wares are
likely to be expensive and well protected. Like any
purveyors of expensive goods, Absalom’s merchants of
clockworks usually employ guards, whether discreet or
overt. These guards are sometimes clockwork soldiers
or similar constructs, particularly when the merchant
wants to demonstrate the effectiveness of their wares
while simultaneously protecting them.

If you need to quickly determine a seller of clockworks
or contraptions in one of Absalom’s markets, here are
several for your consideration.
Cogsmaster: This excitable, purple-haired halfling
has a wide banner above his stall proclaiming him the
“Cogsmaster!” He’s a showman who might have excelled
as a sideshow barker, as he’s quick to announce each
of his items as “futuristic innovations” or “labor-saving
devices” to any who will listen. In truth, he knows little
about how his wares operate; he simply buys them
cheaply and counts on his bluster to justify the markup.
Humphrin Geen: A gaunt, sallow-faced human in an
ill-fitting suit, Humphrin keeps his clockwork wares
on taller-than-normal tables, as though to keep them
away from the hands of halflings or gnomes. In
truth, Humphrin dotes on children and, knowing
that errant springs or grinding
gears might pinch their inquisitive
fingers, doesn’t want them to come
to any harm.
Nettle: This fastidious sunflower
leshy (Pathfinder Bestiary 2 160)
has an exacting attention to detail
and a meticulously sorted table of
spare parts, winding keys, springs,
and other bric-a-brac inventors might
find useful. She finds more delight in
sorting her wares than actually selling them, and
has an unpleasant tendency to comment unfavorably on
customers’ untidy appearances or dirty hands.
Ostinna Barbetler: This stern and fussy dwarf has
a good variety of wares, all clearly marked with fair
prices. The practice of haggling absolutely disgusts
her; if anyone suggests paying even a copper coin
less than the listed price, she unceremoniously ejects
the offender from her stall. She noisily denounces the
“bald-faced skinflint” to vendors nearby, most of whom
ignore her aspersions.
Rargin Hoffnatler: A bear-like Taldan man with a
wide grin and bellowing laugh, Rargin enjoys practical
jokes. Apart from the clockwork toys and devices in his
stall, he keeps a table bearing several joke items such
as itching powders and noisemakers. When customers
are scarce, he deftly incorporates these items into his
ordinary wares, offering the next customer a “close
demonstration” of the trapped device as a prank.

Arcadia has had firearms for over 10,000 years, though
of a distinctly different kind than can be found in the
Inner Sea. In the distant days prior to Earthfall—which
struck Arcadia not with huge, devastating meteors but
with a rain of skymetals across the central continent that
gave rise to great heroes and strange magical effects—
legendary figures bore handheld metal tubes powered by
magic that shot pellets of concentrated arcane energy.
Known as star guns or mystic arms, these guns ranged
from one-handed pistols to long rifles. Most star guns
fired white-hot energy that glowed like a star, giving them
their name, but the most ornate weapons could change
the weapon’s energies by means of cunning switches or
even the user’s sheer will.
Arcadian star guns were carried by great heroes of
legend in central and northern Arcadia, often wandering
law-keepers who fought bandits and monsters to ensure
peace. Sometimes, scheming villains wielded these
powerful weapons to further their own wealth and
influence. Janshar Even-Handed, Valliek Rustboots, and
Deft Onki are among these mythical gunslingers. Anyone
with a star gun could inflict devastating damage, and few
knew any equals beyond other wielders. The Star Code
bound all those who carried such weapons: to never
attack an unarmed opponent, to give parley to the weak
who request it, to eschew deceit, to honor the terms of a
duel, to respect one’s star gun, and many more rules that
vary in the retelling. Villainous wielders at least paid lip
service to the Star Code, though their stories of bending
the letter of the code to suit their own ends appear in folk
tales throughout Arcadia.
Creating a star gun required specialized knowledge. The
most notable crafters (and perhaps the only ones) were
a gaunt, isolationist people who inhabited monasteries
high in the Mildanesi Mountains. Imposing and mute,
with stone crowns protruding from their long heads, these
recluses gave no name for themselves but became known
as the Crowned Regents. Despite their mighty magic and
intricate crafts—which were not limited to the fabulous
starguns—the Crowned Regents showed no interest in

expanding their holdings or their influence. They traded
with a few trusted outsiders, and stories of brave travelers
seeking out a mountaintop monastery to bargain for a
star gun show up in many Arcadian folk tales, such as
Banjara’s Climb and Janshar’s Bold Request. The bustling
city of High Klesh is built around the ruins of the lowest
monastery; its human and halfling inhabitants are wealthy
from relics the Crowned Regents left behind, and the city’s
Spire Council members are each armed with a star gun.
Other monasteries can be found utterly abandoned or
inhabited by dangerous monsters; the Crowned Regents
have vanished into the mists of history and legend.
Today, star guns are exceedingly rare. Discovery of an
intact star gun is a monumental event, and rumors of lost
star guns have inspired generations of treasure-hunters.
Though these fabulous guns are all but gone, the Star Code
has trickled down into modern-day legal code throughout
Arcadia, providing protections to the dispossessed and
downtrodden. The legends of the gunkeepers and their
deeds loom large in Arcadian taletelling.
Lore of the Gun
Guns command respect and authority across Arcadia, a
legacy of the power of the star guns and the gunslingers
who lived the Code. Most people across the continent
have never seen an actual star gun; they know of these
ancient weapons only through legends. This legacy has
proven a fertile ground for invention. For millennia,
inventive and determined Arcadians have devised similar
weapons for generations to capitalize on the power and
prestige of star guns. These guns are the weapons that
now, most commonly, outfit those in authority, or are
wielded by those who challenge that authority.
Technological innovation is at its highest in the
region known as Three Craters, where soot-spewing
factories have an endless appetite for ore. These factories
produce an astonishing number of the most sophisticated
technological marvels on the continent. For centuries,
Three Craters produced air-powered pistols and rifles
that suffered from short range and insufficient stopping
power; as obviously inferior imitations of star guns,
these weapons were of limited use as anything other
than status symbols. About a decade ago, however, new
skymetal forging techniques made their way to Three
Craters. The city’s ruling Smog Lords immediately had
their greatest inventors reverse-engineer these reborn
star guns to replicate them. The conniving Smog Lords
initially tried to keep firearms for their exclusive use;
they realized their edge would disappear if superior guns
became publicly available. Their petulant animosity and
relentless double-dealing meant it wasn’t long before the
secrets of skymetal firearm creation spread to engineers
across the city-state. Factory owners quickly repurposed
their facilities to mass-produce skymetal firearms.
Fierce competition drove costs down and reliability
up, and firearms are now commonplace throughout
Three Craters. They have spread to many places beyond,
even as far as imperialist Razatlan in the distant south
and the subterranean kingdoms of Braskoff to the north.
Further from north-central Arcadia, the hybrid magic
and technology skymetal guns give way to more purely
magical firearms tied to ancient Arcadian traditions;
at the continent’s furthest extremes, magical tradition
is so prevalent that sophisticated technology is as rare
as it is unnecessary. Even among cultures that develop
magic rather than technology, gun lore dating back to
the star guns runs strong. Instead of creating guns from
steel, many of these cultures learned to fashion guns
from bone and magically altered flesh. Millennia ago,
these innovators learned that incorporating components
from powerful monsters made their guns more powerful,
producing creations such as dragon’s-throat firebelchers
and manticore-spike rifles. These beast guns are wholly
different from both the ancient arcane star guns and the
technological marvels of air guns, and their bearers carry
their unique and potent weapons with the honor and
pride common among Arcadian gunslingers.
Over the centuries, wizard-lords and arcane academies
across Arcadia have claimed to unlock the secrets of recreating star guns. (These claims are particularly common
in the magocracy of Heyopan, whose Nine Dynasties vie
for political supremacy.) While these skymetal firearms
and their magical firing mechanisms are certainly
impressive, they are not true star guns. Recreation efforts
occasionally produce truly bizarre guns, such as pistols
that use bound elementals to compress air and eject fiery
pellets of metal, rifles that launch bullets of concentrated
daylight, or shotguns that spew fragments of souls. These
inventions are rarely replicable on a large scale and are
often rushed, making for unreliable operation at best and
even a few disastrous mishaps. Yet, a determined hero or
even a curious traveler has a fair chance of locating—or
commissioning—a truly unique gun.
The Deadshot Lands
Arcadia is home to myriad nations, from icy Vallenhall
far to the north, past hero-forged Xopatl near the central
gulfs, all the way to the southern Ghostlands. Guns are
most prevalent in the region known as the Deadshot
Lands in north-central Arcadia, where the lore of the star
guns remains strongest. This region resembles an open
book lying face-down; the Mildanesi Mountains, where
the Crowned Regents once produced their peerless crafts,
run from north to south along its center. Deserts sprawl
to the west, and fertile plains and forests to the east. Each
of these regions echoes with the lore of guns, but these
echoes resound in different ways.
BRIARBOUGH
For untold ages, the vast forest of Briarbough has been the
home of beastkin who live in a loose coalition of treetop
settlements. The beastkin mark their holdings with stone

stelae, but these standing stones don’t denote actual
borders so much as areas of influence warded by ancient
magic. The people of Briarbough rallied together to repel
the invading Fire Army of Razatlan ages ago, whose
incursions torched much of the forest and created the
Firescar, a region still blighted with the invaders’ magic.
The settlements fell into fierce infighting afterward, each
claiming credit for the victory and demanding the Rowan
Rifle. This legendary star gun is
as much a badge of office as it
is a weapon, denoting dominion
over all Briarbough. The rifle is
held by powerful fey custodians
who bequeath it to a deserving
mortal for only one lifetime.
Fashioned from a tree whose roots
drank deeply from djezet (the skymetal
known as quickiron), the weapon doesn’t
discomfort the fey, unlike iron firearms.
That no claimant has yet received the Rowan
Rifle in this current age only intensifies the
clashes among those who believe they deserve it.
Many rulers throughout Briarbough have agents
desperately seeking lost star guns or other firearms,
believing that the fey will award the Rowan Rifle to
superlative gunslingers. Varkesh Wolfpaw, tyrant of
Ninebranches, amasses weapons and militarizes his
people with the aim of taking the Rowan Rifle from the
fey by force. The Firescar Bombers work to thwart his
plans, ranging from the desolate Firescar and slipping past
Varkesh’s enchanted border stelae, but these alchemists
and pyromaniacs are no heroes, either.
CROWNPEAKS
The Mildanesi Mountains comprise an enormous range
running nearly the entire length of Arcadia. The northern
mountains once inhabited by the Crowned Regents are
known today as the Crownpeaks. The few passes through
the region are high and difficult; most become impassable
with ferocious storms and deep snow during the winter.
The wealthy city of High Klesh, in the east, is the best
place to find guides through the Crownpeaks, as its
scouts know how best to negotiate with the Passkeepers,
a confederacy of roc-mounted halflings who watch over
the passes and demand tribute. Some Passkeepers prefer
long rifles to threaten travelers from a safe distance
and are willing to pay handsomely for such weaponry.
The fickle Passkeepers aren’t the only dangers in the
mountains: yeti-like creatures called antimoks, wendigos,
and stranger monsters haunt the peaks. A few smaller
settlements like Oathscrape and Picket Shelf provide
travelers with respite, but hospitality can prove hard to
come by in the mountains.
The Crownpeaks have few natural resources other
than ore, but they bear that ore in abundance. The
most extensive and advanced mining operations are in
the mountains nearest Three Craters, where the Smog
Lords mandate the backbreaking labor that pulls iron,
tin, and silver from large, lucrative mines. These peaks
harbor many smaller veins of these and other useful
metals, including skymetals from Earthfall. Thus, the
Crownpeaks continue to attract hardy individuals and
small companies with a willingness to work and a dream
of striking it rich. Such small-stakes prospectors diligently
guard their claims with picks and guns.
The abandoned monasteries once occupied by the
mysterious Crowned Regents are highly sought after, even
though these ruins tend to harbor dangerous creatures
who value a sheltered lair in the unforgiving peaks. Chief
among these monsters is Dwashtil, a wendigo of such
vast power and authority that other wendigos of
the Crownpeaks call her their master. Some of the
best-explored monasteries have extensive underground
passages, and rumors abound of connections through
these passages to other lost monasteries and deeper
areas inhabited by mysterious creatures that have
never seen daylight.
HALANA THEOCRACY
Northwest of Tazuni, the desert gives way
to rolling, fertile hills and a coastline of
rugged cliffs. Many tengu inhabit this
region, though humans still greatly
outnumber them. Although this
land seems pastoral, it’s under
the firm control of a despotic
government called the Halana
Theocracy. Headquartered in the
many-spired city of Rookery, the
church does its best to control all aspects of life within
its borders, from the timing of crops to the education of
its youth. Far from being an orderly place, however, the
dictates of the church are erratic and often contradictory,
so the nation is one of paranoia, toil, and misery. The
faith itself is no less convoluted, revering an ever-shifting
pantheon of malevolent sky gods centered on the demon
lord Pazuzu. It is heresy to utter the names of any sky
gods of the pantheon; the church claims that doing so
invites corruption and madness. Halana’s leaders, the
three Windborne Theocrats, can control the weather,
although they usually bring storms to evince their wrath
rather than good weather to benefit the populace. They
are known to be physically frail despite their divine
power, as their seals of office are made from a poisonous
skymetal called abysium, or feverstone.
The Halana Theocracy enforces its will through an
elite group of wicked soldiers known as the Mivanians.
Most Mivanians are tengu, but the force admits a fair
number of avian beastkin and tiefling humans with
birdlike features as well. All Mivanians carry beast guns
created from flying monsters, giving them unparalleled
range. For anyone outside the Mivanians, owning a
Beast Gun

gun of any kind is a capital offense. An extensive and
surprisingly well-armed rebellion is working to overthrow
the theocracy and has caches of guns hidden throughout
Halana; it only needs to recruit enough heroes willing to
fight to free their land.
ILLANI PLAINS
The sweeping plains across central Arcadia are stained
with old blood. Great civilizations of horselords and their
thunderous mounts have stampeded across these plains for
thousands of years. The western edge of these plains has
seen an age of relative peace in the last few generations,
thanks to the protection afforded by technology from Three
Craters, and the resilience of its orc and human inhabitants.
Ages ago after banding together with a group of
dwarves to defeat a massive gogiteth threat, the orcs of
Arcadia teamed up to assist the dwarves in achieving their
quest to find the surface. The two have been on good terms
ever since. Receiving a poor welcome from the beastkin of
Briarbough, the orcs migrated into the Illani Plains. Rather
than come as conquerors and warmongers, they knew
their struggling people must make peace to survive. The
humans of the plains, recently freed from oppressors to
the east and whose leadership was in turmoil, needed their
aid in turn. Humans and orcs became firm allies and have
been so ever since. Humans contributed their agricultural
and equestrian lore, and orcs brought numerous skills and
secrets from their subterranean homes. Not the least of
these was how to craft trophies torn from monstrous foes
into weapons. Combined with the star gun lore, the people
of the Illani Plains were among the first groups in Arcadia
to create beast guns. Hunts into the caverns beneath the
plains’ ancient buttes provide the raw materials for this
ancient art, still practiced today.
Bountiful farms and ranches across the Illani Plains
feed Three Craters and many other nearby nations.
Even the poorest citizens of Latwaria and Grassbutte,
the largest Illani cities, never fear starvation, although
a malignant plague is spreading in these urban centers.
This plague is kept in check by the region’s gun-toting
priests of Desna (known as “the Lady of Long Grasses”
here), but there’s serious concern for the fate of the region
should the plague spread into the fertile countryside.
TAZUNI
The western desert extending from the Crownpeaks is
bounded to the south by salty Lake Tapipallati, and to the
north by the Halana Theocracy and the cities of the insular
Primal League. This is a wild, dusty land of hard people,
desperate bandits, and steel-eyed law-bringers. Civilization
is clustered in cities such as Altameda, Carama, and New
Hayewood; each is surrounded by hardscrabble farms
and ranches. The land is in dire need of heroes to kill
marauding beasts, track down cattle thieves, and guard
wagons traveling from town to town. Local sheriffs
are often happy for the help—if they aren’t behind the
banditry themselves, as not all lawkeepers live up to the
honor of their badges. The law’s reach in Tazuni doesn’t
extend further than a rifle’s shot, so criminals who vanish
into the desert are free to simply move on elsewhere.
Travel is a way of life in Tazuni. Regular stagecoaches
take settlers, goods, and mail between communities.

Ranchers must keep their great herds of livestock on the
move to ensure they’re adequately fed before being driven
to market. The land’s few rivers are a vital source of life,
as all flow into the undrinkable Lake Tapipallati. Most
large towns are built on rivers; some, such as Carama
on the Carama River, span a waterway with a series of
wooden footbridges crowded with shops, market stalls,
inns, and fishing platforms. Despite picturesque bridges
and crowded piers, these rivers are far from docile.
Aquatic dangers on these waterways pose as much
trouble as bandits on stagecoach lines.
Tale-telling is a strong Tazunian tradition. Visitors are
expected to tell stories of past exploits, whether their own
or another’s, real or exaggerated. Stories are expected to
be free; thus, many bards and other storytellers must also
gamble at dice or cards in dusty saloons to make ends meet.
Headstone Rolsk, a cunning stone giant necromancer
who collects tombstones and hurls them at his foes,
recently combined several human and halfling gangs under
his brutal leadership, and supplemented the growing
Headstone Gang with ghouls he’s animated. Rolsk is
rumored to be stepping up the Headstone Gang’s activities
from robbery and livestock butchery to assaults on
towns. The feckless sheriff of New Hayewood, Brondell
Chanrodine, actively ignores rumors of Rolsk’s movement
near his town, much to the dismay of the townspeople.
THREE CRATERS
A massive city-state situated between three large lakes in
north-central Arcadia, Three Craters is one of Arcadia’s
largest metropolises. Its soot-belching factories produce
technological marvels unequaled in Arcadia, and perhaps
across the world. The ruling Smog Lords do their best
to assert control over the region, but their constant
infighting undercuts the draconian authority they crave.
Three Craters is exceptionally cosmopolitan; in addition
to extensive trade connections with the cities of High
Klesh, Latwaria, and Grassbutte in neighboring nations,
Three Craters has extensive dealings with the region
known as the Land of Northern Lakes to the northeast.
Three Craters has a virtually unending appetite for ore
with which to construct its technology. The Smog Lords
employ undersea miners who pull ore from the waters
of the three surrounding lakes (the pristine Moon’s Tear,
murky Oilpan, and misty Lake Awnkawak) and control
mining interests in the eastern Crownpeaks. Trade
agreements with the skymetal-rich Land of Northern Lakes
bring staggeringly valuable shipments along iron-cobbled
and heavily patrolled roads to the east.
Although most denizens of Three Craters are humans,
sizable populations of halflings, ratfolk, and an insectile
race called klinkois also live here. People divide much
more often by social class rather than ancestry and thus
mix frequently. Firearms are common enough that nearly
everyone knows how to maintain and operate one, and
bows are viewed as quaint and anachronistic.
DEADSHOT LANDS TIMELINE
The Deadshot Lands is not the only large, thematically
linked region in Arcadia. (The Primal League to the north,
the Land of Northern Lakes to the northeast, Salt Stretch
to the south, and Fallen Razatlan to the southeast are
some of many others.) The following are some key dates

Golarion shuddered 10,000 years ago when Earthfall
fractured the land, scattering its inhabitants and obliterating
the ancient Azlanti civilization. As ejecta shadowed the
sky, plants withered, trade networks disintegrated, and
Golarion’s societies crumbled, casting the planet into a
literal dark age of bitter survivalism. Yet, scraps of Azlanti
culture survived. Centuries later, along the southern coast
of the newly formed Inner Sea, the illiterate young local
Arustun uncovered a cache of Azlanti writings. Whether
through supernatural enlightenment or natural genius, he
somehow deciphered the texts, using these rediscovered
secrets to revolutionize his local communities. Arustun
swiftly exhausted the texts and craved more. With the help
of his wife, Minurna, and friend Venistos, he built a ship to
sail the seas in search of scattered cultures and other lost
literature—a voyage that eventually saw him traveling to
other planes of existence! Upon his return decades later,
he compiled his tales into the Poleiheira, a book of legends
and teachings that proved foundational throughout the
civilization Arustun helped found: the Jistka Imperium.
This new monarchy focused primarily on technological
development and military expansion, styling itself as an
empire that would unite humanity in a new golden age.
At its disposal, the Imperium boasted two crucial tools:
extraplanar servants and magical artifice. In his travels,
Arustun forged myriad connections to beings aligned with
law and the elements, and the powerful magistrates that
arose in the Jistka Imperium maintained that tradition
by conjuring the likes of aeons and genies to command
armies and evangelize the imperial vision for a bright (if
nonnegotiable) future. Meanwhile, Jistkan priest-artificers
adapted incomplete Azlanti clockwork manuscripts to
create their own schools of golemcraft and mechanization
that far surpassed their predecessors.
The Jistka Imperium’s arrogance and belligerence
stunted its growth and stability. Magistrates and
priest-artificers increasingly competed for power and
influence within the growing aristocracy. The inexorable
conquests of the Imperium’s supernatural armies branded
Jistka as evil invaders in the eyes of its neighbors.

Only Osirion’s ascendancy to the east united the
Imperium’s efforts, and the two nations clashed bitterly
in a war of attrition that Jistka slowly lost, though not
before creating and conjuring extremely dangerous
beings that threatened to destroy the Imperium as readily
as they devastated its enemies. At last, Jistka crumbled
under imperial succession crises and warfare, ground to
dust by Osirion’s equally grim armies.
Unlike the cultural revivals enjoyed by Thassilon and
Osirion, Jistka has remained a dead and largely forgotten
civilization whose influence rarely resurfaces directly.
Archaeologists and explorers occasionally uncover pristine
ruins or emergency caches where the Imperium hid golems
for a final counterattack. However, Jistka’s living legacy
also survives in automatons (page 36), who have started
reappearing after a millennia-long hiatus.
Infused Constructs
Without an animating force, a construct is merely a glorified
statue. While more ethically built constructs rely on a
powerful mote of positive energy, each Jistkan construct
required a trapped entity such as an earth elemental—the
more cumbersome the golem, the more powerful the bound
spirit needed. Although original Jistkan constructs are
now rare enough that most think of them as a monolithic
technology, the Imperium’s golemcraft techniques evolved
steadily over more than a thousand years as artificers
rediscovered lost techniques, tested theories, exhausted
resources, invented new tools, and laid groundwork for
construct design in the modern era.
ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCTS
During his voyages, Arustun uncovered and compiled
fragments of lost Azlanti clockwork and its underlying
theory. His companions eagerly deciphered these
techniques and created several of their own ticking
servitors, yet their clockwork creations always felt
hollow and lifeless—serviceable replicas of another
culture’s technology that didn’t reflect Jistkan values and
Arustun’s own vision. Early Jistkans had built grand cities,
attracting the scattered peoples of northern Garund to
prosper there. As the fledgling artificers reasoned, their
own constructs should arise in the same way, by creating
a magnificent articulated home, magically coaxing spirits
into the physical bodies, and benefiting from those new
inhabitants’ labor as recompense. Thus, these Jistkans
gradually developed their own golem technology powered
not by springs and gears, but by elementals inhabiting and
animating the lifeless bodies.
But how? Modern golemcraft often relies on arcane
spellcasting. Despite having unearthed elements of
Azlanti clockwork, these Jistkans lived centuries before
the legendary spellcaster Old-Mage Jatembe brought
arcane magic back to Golarion. Therefore, the magic
that bound these first Jistkan golems evolved from timehonored traditions of oral history, story craft, and occult
magic. Rather than forcibly bind elementals, these earliest
artificers imbued each golem with a compelling narrative.
Once a free-willed elemental drew near, the magic drew
it in, trapping it both inside a powerful body and within
an insidious story that reinforced loyalty to the golem’s
master. No doubt many artificers believed they had done
these elementals a favor by providing a home, and some
freed the trapped spirits after years of indentured servitude.
Yet at the core, this magic was glorified brainwashing,
and it laid the foundation for a millennium of subsequent
elemental enslavement.
Although reliance on elementals remained steady, the
techniques and demands evolved with time. The occult
techniques suffered from inherent limits, for capturing
errant elementals required careful customization and could
only ensnare those beings already wandering northern
Garund. Once the supply ran low, golem creation slowed.
A more economical and direct option later developed once
arcane magic was reintegrated into Jistkan technologies:
conjuring a limitless supply of elementals from the planes
into waiting construct bodies. With supply constraints
removed, golem creation expanded from a prestige craft
to an imperial industry, supported by a growing class of
priest-artificers who constructed arcane spell work to
power their creations. While these artificers maintained
some of their predecessors’ cultural values, traditional
binding rituals couldn’t compete with these new arcane
solutions, and the occult techniques faded from practice
and memory. Even in the modern era, Jistkan arcane
binding methodology forms the core of golem creation,
and the older occult approaches remain extremely rare.
For every problem solved, though, another arose. The
hypnotic narrative trapping elementals in occult golems
functioned like a maze, always redirecting the elemental’s
thoughts and tricking it deeper into the mental trap.
Arcane techniques act more like prisons, relying on raw
power and careful formulas to restrain their captives. But
no wall is impervious. Under great stress, an arcane golem’s
animating force strains at—and sometimes breaks free
of—these barriers. To bystanders, this struggle resembles
confusion and violent rage as the elemental’s desperate
struggles seize control of its artificial body before the
magic regains control.
Despite this, only the arcane designs could meet
Jistka’s needs, for their armies increasingly relied on large
quantities of ready-made golems as labor, shock troops,
and guardians. Jistkan miners and loggers directed golems
to harvest ever vaster resources to trade for reagents and
fuel the forges. Northern Garund’s arid conditions partly
hearken to this ravenous expansion. Few could oppose the
Imperium’s full might, at least until Osirion’s rise.
FIEND CONSTRUCTS
At first a distant curiosity to the east, Osirion grew quickly,
trespassing on Jistka’s spheres of influence and intercepting
crucial trade that sustained the Imperium. Tensions erupted

================================================================================
PAGE 215
================================================================================

into all-out war, and what early advantages Jistka enjoyed,
it lost to the centuries-old infighting between magisters
and artificers. By the time the Imperium could present a
united front, Osirion not only had the tools to devastate
its foes’ combined golem, genie, and mortal armies, but it
also developed insidious strategies to weaken Jistka from
within, such as the dreaded Night Plague. With its resources
dwindling, Jistka needed a new, unbeatable weapon.
The answer came from its northern territories, created in
the forge city of Rachikan and quickly shared among artificer
bastions. For generations, builders relied on capable and
relatively compliant elementals to power constructs. Under
pressure to supply shock troops, Rachikan’s engineers
began conjuring fiends to animate golems instead. In many
ways, it was brilliant. Fiends already displayed a penchant
for possession, so a greater fraction of their raw power
could transfer to the golems’ mechanical bodies, and a hint
of their intelligence manifested as rudimentary cunning
that granted the golems greater adaptability in combat.
Unlike elementals, many of the fiends also openly made
bargains with the priest-artificers to willingly inhabit the
lifeless statues, greatly reducing the cost of binding and
restraining the extraplanar entities.
Many fiends were stronger than their Inner Plane
counterparts, allowing them to empower ever-larger war
machines. The resulting fiend-infused golems provided
exactly what the desperate Imperium needed, allowing the
creation of legendary engines such as the dreaded behemoth
fortress golem, an elephantine walking fortress that
towered more than 50 feet tall and collapsed conventional
fortifications with the sheer force of its footsteps.
Although these fiendish golems at first obliterated
their opposition, tales of dire mishaps quickly tainted
the victories. A typical golem always ran the risk of its
elemental spirit rebelling; these new golems were rarely
built strongly enough to contain the fiendish fury sealed
within. The constructs regularly entered battle rages that
their commanders couldn’t control, often resulting in the
fiend breaking free entirely in a burst of unholy energy.
Even those inhabited by willing fiends ran amok. The only
blessing was that these blasphemous terrors
inflicted far more damage against the
Imperium’s Osirian enemies than
against their so-called allies.
Had
the
Imperium’s
artificers
drawn upon the magistrates’ expertise
in binding extraplanar creatures, and had
a gruesome war not limited their testing,
this foray into fiend-powered constructs
might have produced reliable, relatively safe
results. However, the artificers had developed
these war machines in relative secrecy, and to
avoid losing face to their magistrate rivals,
they actively destroyed evidence and sowed
disinformation to hide their experimental
constructs’ rampages. The Imperium might
not have cared. Succession crises and
assassination plots left the upper echelons in
disarray, and pretenders regularly sponsored
and claimed credit for any victories against
Osirion, no matter the circumstances, so
long as it supported their own agendas. So,
more demons, daemons, and devils poured
into construct shells.
Fiend-infused constructs were ultimately
unstable, not just in battle but in the passage of
years, with many of the fiends breaking freeing
in the millennia since. Thus, rediscovered Jistkan
golems are most often powered by elementals.
Combined with the pains some artificers took
to conceal their unholy creations’ misdeeds or
destroy their own research, the techniques for
creating constructs and binding fiends within
them barely survived the ages. However, with
the recent rediscovery of Rachikan, these
deadly secrets are increasingly accessible to
the most reckless engineers.

MORTAL CONSTRUCTS
Jistka was dying. Assailed by enemies from without
and internecine rot from within, it was only a matter of
time before the Imperium crumbled, its extraordinary
innovations obliterated by Osirion’s armies. In a last-ditch
effort to salvage their culture and sciences, a relatively
scrupulous cabal formed the Artificer Conclave, dedicated
to preserving its ways and ultimately restoring the Imperium
to its former glory. Within a few years, several members
had perished, and the survivors could see the impossible
enormity of their task. They could never achieve their goals
alone, and they certainly could never do so as infirmity and
attrition whittled down their numbers. In response, they
adapted their golemcraft traditions to accept a different
type of animating force: not an elemental or a fiend, but
their own mortal life forces and souls.
The experiments exceeded all expectations, far
surpassing any previous golemcraft in its intricacy and
performance. Known as an automaton (page 36), each of
these constructs preserved the intelligence, personality, and
skills of its mortal subject, all while providing the mortal
a golem’s physical might and longevity. The secret was
the automaton core, a marvelous fusion of spellcasting
traditions that sustained the mortal’s soul and powered
the automaton’s body. As with a lich’s phylactery, the
core’s destruction would destroy the individual. In theory,
the artificers hoped that if the core survived, it could be
transplanted into a new automaton body, allowing each
preserved Jistkan to survive even apparent destruction.
The Conclave swiftly recruited Jistka’s best, brightest,
and most scrupulous, creating a host of automatons
that preserved these paragons. Most of these champions
scattered across Golarion and the planes, seeking military
aid against the Imperium’s enemies, magic to rebuild the
Imperium’s devastated cities, and philosophies to restore
the Imperium’s soul. Insulated by immortal bodies and
confronted with the infinite potential of the planes, many
of these seekers became distracted, realizing that the
Imperium had already crumbled only by the time they
returned from a casual century of research. Others secured
help but returned to realize it was too little, too late; the
Imperium had become too beleaguered and too morally
bankrupt to save. Those who remained in northern Garund
fared little better; a few organized resistance forces to stave
off Osirion and imperial pretenders alike were destroyed
or scattered by the impossible odds. Others shepherded
Jistkan survivors to forgotten sanctuaries, where they
either abandoned their old affiliations or perished, leaving
only their demoralized automaton guardians.
Ultimately, the Artificer Conclave disintegrated. No
known record of its members survives, much less explains
where they went. While automatons still exist across the
multiverse, there’s no telling just how numerous they are.
Several live on Axis, where they dwell among the aeons
that inspired the earliest Jistkans. At least a few still roam
Golarion; among these, some cling to a fading Jistkan
dream, while others long ago forgot their futile quest
and adopted new causes. Others remain only as cores,
helplessly trapped in broken bodies or collapsed ruins.
Whatever the case, passing ages have reinforced one of
the automatons’ greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches.
For beings meant to live a century, only the strongest willed
have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and
lucidity after more than 8,000 years. Many automatons
can’t recall their ancient pasts. Others have developed
nervous tics as their minds wrestle with immortality.
Others still have dissociated completely from their mortal
identities, slowly transforming into emotionless constructs
except for fleeting moments where they can remember
what it means to be alive. With so few of the Conclave left,
it’s no wonder the secret to creating cores is presumed lost.
JISTKAN RUINS
Time and ancient Osirian vendettas demolished many
of Jistka’s wonders, yet forgotten sites periodically
resurface, tempting explorers the world over.
Lost Yemal: Once a remote town along Jistka’s
southern border, Yemal was one of the last refuges
from Osirion’s wrath. Jistkan officials hid many of the
Imperium’s greatest treasures there, sealing them within
a foreboding tomb. Osirion at last crushed the town,
but some supernatural force trapped and consumed
any soldiers who entered the tomb. The monument still
stands, daring any who would steal Jistka’s last legacy.
Rachikan: Considered the greatest forge city, Rachikan
was built within one of the massive Pillars of Anferita
rising along Cheliax’s west coast. There it refined and
created the terrifying fiend-infused golems until an
earthquake buried much of the city. Looters scavenged
from the upper ruins, yet many of the constructs remain
functional and vigilant, and the city was forgotten
and rediscovered by Pathfinders only a decade ago. In
addition to the animated marvels sealed inside, rumors
speak of territorial morlocks dwelling within the deepest
levels; their language, tools, and religion all resemble
Jistkan ones.
Teskra: The so-called Hanging City spanned a massive
canyon in Rahadoum’s Napsune Mountains, serving as
a crowning achievement late in Jistka’s rule. In addition
to its magnificent bridges, Teskra housed palatial
gardens occupied by wondrously lifelike constructs
that resembled and behaved like real animals. Shortly
after Teskra’s completion, citizens began disappearing
mysteriously, with all of the city’s dwindling population
wordlessly vanishing into the mountains in –3388 ar. In
the millennia since, the construct creatures have escaped
and roam the city freely, maintained by equally lifelike
yet ageless humanoid caretakers. No doubt some of
Jistka’s greatest construct technologies lie hidden within
Teskra’s ruins.

================================================================================
PAGE 217
================================================================================

Grafts
Any construct requires an animating energy that shapes
its powers and personality. While most Jistkan artifice
involved binding whole beings into artificial shells, it’s
equally viable to draw trace amounts of a host’s life essence
to power a prosthesis.
The earliest of these magical grafts were ponderous,
designed with technologies appropriate for towering golems
yet ill-suited for a living host’s comparably delicate joints
and mortal constitutions. With time came sophistication,
and by the Imperium’s zenith, prostheses were lightweight,
and sleek. Given the Age of Anguish’s many dangers,
such prostheses were commonplace, and the mechanical
advantages drove some to acquire artificial augmentations
to replace even fully functioning limbs. The aristocracy
marveled at prostheses so lifelike as to be indistinguishable
from flesh, artificial limbs made from precious metals with
interchangeable decorative elements, and arms infused
with magical spells the user could channel.
Records and inscriptions show a sudden decline in
prosthesis quality and a spike in pervasiveness as Jistka’s
wars with Osirion progressed, with rush jobs and
dwindling resources providing the bare minimum before
sending an augmented combatant back to the front lines
of the generations-long conflict. With incalculable golem
scrap salvaged from the battlefields, many prostheses
from the Imperium’s final centuries were recycled from
destroyed constructs. Not only were these limbs a poor
fit for their users, but also traces of the former animating
spirits sometimes infected the new hosts—a phenomenon
the desperate military tried to weaponize to limited effect.
Ultimately, a combination of unsafe practices and
the Osirian armies’ obliteration of Jistkan cities put
an end to the millennium-long prosthesis tradition,
burying it until its rediscovery and revival in 4327 ar.
Unearthed by Rahadoumi treasure-hunters, these first five
prostheses found their way to a pair of artificer studios
in Manaket, where able inventors deciphered and adapted
the technology. In the four centuries since, golem-based
prosthesis use in Rahadoum has become more widespread
and inexpensive, all the more so because grafting
replacement limbs bypasses the divine regeneration magic
so disdained there. This technology reached the wider
world’s attention in 4660 ar, when unsanctioned explorers
looted a few original prostheses in Napsune Mountain
ruins and published their findings in the Pathfinder
Chronicles as though they were their own inventions. The
article was quickly debunked and retracted, though it has
fueled concerns of industrial theft ever since.
Despite many improvements over Jistkan designs, the
article drove a ravenous demand for the millennia-old
originals, many of which still function properly. However,
just as recycled golem components instilled some of the
former golem’s old energy and personality into their new
hosts ages ago, these antique prostheses occasionally imbue
their new users with disjointed memories, quirks, or even
magical abilities. Several residents of Rahadoum began
worshipping long-forgotten Jistkan deities shortly after
installation, putting Rahadoum’s Pure Legion on edge.
Even so, prosthesis tourism remains a thriving yet
minor industry in Manaket, with disabled visitors
arriving from half a continent away to receive a new
limb or eye. Alternatives exist, yet few can compare to
the sleek and overall seamless Rahadoumi technology.
Magnimar’s Golemworks and Kaer Maga’s Ardoc family
both dabble in the technology, yet rarely offer the service
publicly. Absalom’s Clockwork Cathedral and Alkenstar’s
foundries have likewise created experimental clockwork
limbs, though these mechanical solutions require more
maintenance than golem limbs. And while Nex’s fleshforges
and Geb’s necrograft markets both provide functional
prostheses, few are willing to stomach these grisly options.
JISTKAN ADVENTURES
Millennia and malice have ground much of Jistka’s ruins
to dust, yet in places, its physical legacy survives and can
drive exciting adventures.
Evil Engineering: Bound to an incomplete iron golem
forgotten in an ancient workshop and recently recovered
for a museum, an ice devil has regained its free will and
now makes deals telepathically with anyone visiting the
Jistka exhibit. Several of its dupes have planned a heist
to steal their silent master’s golem body in anticipation
of greater crimes.
Forbidden Faiths: After millennia wandering the planes,
a powerful automaton returns to find Jistka demolished
and his homeland occupied by a godless regime. Learning
that several sacred Jistkan sites remain undiscovered, the
automaton assembles teams to infiltrate Rahadoum and
extract holy treasures for safekeeping, all while evading
the Pure Legion.
Old Debts: An extended family of shaitans served
Jistka in its wars, and the descendants have appeared
in Rahadoum, demanding that Jistka pay its old debts or
suffer punishment. The genies’ contract seems altered to
extort vast sums and interest, yet without a Jistkan copy
for comparison, Rahadoumi negotiators can’t convince
the shaitans to drop the complaint. Rahadoum has issued
a call for capable explorers to enter the ruins of Lost
Yemal in search of the tablet that preserves this ancient
debt’s original terms.
Sleeper Agent: Recycled Jistkan prostheses sometimes
impart ancient memories to their new hosts, and an
unearthed prosthesis still resonates with a long-dead
Jistkan magistrate’s hatred for Osirion. Now installed in
a new host, the limb has subtly taken control and begun
plotting the Ruby Prince’s assassination. Worse, dozens
of powerful elementals owed the magistrate favors, and
the arm’s host has begun calling these in to engineer a
new war between Osirion and Rahadoum.

Unafraid to ruthlessly pillage black powder technology
to get what they wanted, the pirates of the Shackles
became one of the first groups to gain enough access to
the new firearms coming from Alkenstar’s Gunworks
to truly embrace them. A typical Free Captain controls
a single vessel, often a small cutter or sloop, and if
they’re lucky, they might have replaced some of their
ballistas and catapults with cannons. Those with more
renown command larger vessels, or even multiple ships.
This advantage comes with an increased dependence on
supplies: cannons without powder are just ballast. The
increased use of guns has forced these captains to find
adequate amounts of powder, shot, and well-trained crew
to keep their vessel properly armed.
The first firearms in the Shackles were flintlocks and
pistols—the result of sporadic robberies, smuggling, and
black-market deals. While firearms could be carried by
individual members of a ship’s crew, they were initially
seen as a weak pirate’s folly. As gunpowder weapons
became more widely available through more daring raids,
personal firearms were eventually, grudgingly accepted as
valid weapons. As decades passed, they became the ranged
weapon of choice for most pirates across the region—
though incendiary risks have many pirates sticking to
bows. Despite the ever-present danger of fire on a ship,
pirates find that the noise, smoke, and confusion generated
by a gun battle provides an advantage in the pursuit of
murder and looting.
Compared to firearms, heavy guns such as cannons were
much trickier to steal and thus didn’t appear in the Shackles
until recently. Several Free Captains somehow managed
to get their hands on a few and began arming their ships
with cannons instead of ballistas or scatterguns. The
Chelaxian navy eventually captured one of these vessels
and slowly adopted the weaponry for itself, concentrating
its few cannon-armed ships in small, elite, anti-pirate
flotillas scouring the Arcadian Ocean. As time went on and
both sides saw increased cannon usage, individual ship
skirmishes became far bloodier and more decisive, usually
ending in the complete destruction of one ship or the other.
THE SHACKLES:
CANNONS AND NAVAL BATTLES

================================================================================

================================================================================

The Balance of Power
In 4715 AR, Captain Tessa Fairwind (CN female half-elf
pirate) unseated the former leader of the Pirate Council,
the Hurricane King Kerdak Bonefist, and took his place,
leading her fleet against an invading armada from
Cheliax and ending the battle with an overwhelming
victory. Captain Fairwind’s bravado and derring-do
impressed many a ship’s company, most of whom see her
as a near-mythical figure befitting her title of Hurricane
Queen. By contrast, many of the Free Captains (and even
some on the Pirate Council) are concerned by her risky
behavior and wonder how long Captain Fairwind’s luck
will last. Even those without the backbone for an outright
coup are positioning themselves for the day when news of
Captain Fairwind’s untimely death finally arrives.
In the bloody battles that led to her new title as
Hurricane Queen, Captain Fairwind saw firsthand the
power of cannons at sea, and she realized that it would
change the nature of naval power forever. Seizing the
opportunity and momentum gained by her victory
over the Chelaxian armada, she set about arming as
many Shackles vessels with cannons and black powder
bombards as she possibly could. With many nations vying
for the relatively limited supply of heavy guns stolen or
smuggled from Alkenstar, Captain Fairwind couldn’t
obtain the required number of guns for her fleet through
commerce alone, a fact that suited her daredevil nature
particularly well.
Beginning in late 4719 AR, Shackles pirates began
raiding cargo vessels carrying newly forged cannons
to Vidrian with uncanny foresight, despite Vidrian’s
attempts to use troops and naval vessels to protect
their precious (and dangerous) cargo. Thus, many of
the cannons purchased by Vidrian specifically to defend
against the pirate threat ended up arming pirate vessels
instead. An intensive investigation by Alkenstar revealed
that agents of the Hurricane Queen had infiltrated
not only every port used for the trade, but even the
Gunworks itself, allowing Shackles pirates to claim the
guns before they reached their buyers. Around the same
time, Shackles pirates began offering a choice to the gun
crews of any ships they captured: join the pirates or die.
Either way, they reduced the trained gun crew available
to their enemies and simultaneously helped address the
shortage of trained gun crew among pirates. This did,
however, have a side effect of increasing the rate of gun
crew mutinies, which have become a growing problem.
In response to these raids, Vidrian began sending
troops to escort cannons on a long and dangerous
overland journey to try to avoid the pirates’ schemes,
recruiting brave adventurers to protect the cannons
after thoroughly vetting the adventurers to ensure they
weren’t in the Hurricane Queen’s pocket. Those caravans
must deal with numerous other threats and dangers as
they cross Garund, and who knows what ambush the
Hurricane Queen has in store for them?
A New Source
Although her recent activities have kept cannons from
becoming a major weapon for her enemies, Captain Tessa
Fairwind was not able to obtain as many heavy guns for
her vessels as she desired. The limited supply and long
travel times from Alkenstar meant her fleet wouldn’t have
the firepower to stand against a combined assault from
two or more of her enemies for at least several years.
To remedy this situation, Captain Fairwind has turned
to a secret ally, a crafty goblin pirate named Volmurk (CN
male goblin inventor). Volmurk was gravely wounded in
a battle with the Chelaxian navy a decade before, losing
an arm and both legs to a broadside from a Chelaxian
man-of-war. Unable to continue life as a pirate, Volmurk
returned to his roots as a tinker and inventor, fashioning
a custom wheelchair to move about more freely and a
mechanical apparatus to serve in place of his lost hand.
Over time, Volmurk used the riches from his pirating life
to build a workshop in the pirate port of Quent, making
prosthetic limbs, mechanical devices, and the occasional
steam-powered mechanism for his customers. As his
reputation grew, Volmurk’s unconventional approach to
engineering led him to experiment with larger and more
dangerous devices. His attempt to create a steam-powered
flying machine led to an explosion that destroyed several
warehouses along Quent’s dockside and brought him to
Captains Fairwind’s attention once again.
Together, starting in 4720 AR, Volmurk and
Captain Fairwind hatched a daring plan: they would
reverse engineer black powder weapons from Alkenstar
and manufacture their own versions to equip the pirate
fleet. Tessa helped Volmurk arrange an “accident” that
destroyed his old workshop and supposedly killed him
and his best workers. With her support, Volmurk set up
a new workshop near the caldera of an active volcano
at the heart of Motaku Isle and set about trying to
recreate the Alkenstar cannons. After almost a year of
experimentation, Volmurk, concealing his identity behind
the anonymous moniker of “Chief Inventor,” discovered
a forging method that allows cannon barrels to withstand
the intense pressure of the powder explosion without
the fracturing that had made earlier cannons such a
risky proposition. The first of these “new” cannons was
test-fired at sea in mid-4721 AR; the first cannon to
survive its test-firing without dangerous misfires or burst
barrels followed two months later. Production of the
weapons began at a breakneck pace that cared little for
quality control or safety.
To handle the sale of these unreliable weapons, Captain
Fairwind set up the Motaku Isle Iron Works as a front.
The company sells common ironware and metal ship
fittings from its smithies located in Quent, but only a Free
Captain can purchase the guns and ammunition made in
the volcanic forge by the Chief Inventor and his team.
The new designs weren’t quite up to Alkenstar
standards, though, and the manufacturing process wasn’t

without its problems. By using a volcano’s natural heat
to power the forge and generate steam for the assembly
mechanisms, the engineers lost the degree of control over
the forging process necessary to ensure consistency. As a
result, some gun barrels from the Motaku Isle Iron Works
burst in combat, ruining the gun and often injuring
the crew. A few have exploded violently, although this
occurred in the heat of battle, so no one has yet been able
to attribute such an occurrence to faulty manufacturing.
As Motaku Isle Iron Works weapons become more
common on pirate vessels, however, the truth is likely to
come out unless Volmurk can improve his production
process while meeting the pirates’ insatiable demand for
black powder weaponry. It remains to be seen if Captain
Fairwind can weather the storm of opposition she’ll face
when the Free Captains learn it’s her company producing
the faulty cannons. In game terms, Motaku cannons and
weapons always have a chance to misfire, regardless of
attempts to upkeep them during daily preparations.
Uneven Distribution
While firearms from both Alkenstar and Motaku Isle
Iron Works are slowly finding their way to other parts
of the Inner Sea, the numbers and sources are far
from even. With the Free Captains constantly coming
into conflict with the navies of Cheliax, Vidrian, and
Rahadoum, many Motaku cannons and firearms have
been confiscated. Due to Volmurk’s sly habit of stamping
some of his knockoffs with marks and crests normally
used to identify the gunsmith who created a particular
weapon in Alkenstar, these appropriated weapons are
occasionally redistributed as gifts to naval officers by
well-meaning superiors who lack the familiarity with
firearms to distinguish between a Motaku knock-off and
an Alkenstar original.
As a Free Captain of significant skill and renown,
privateer Stella Fane (CN female human privateer) has
access to purchase firearms and cannons from Motaku
Isle Iron Works. She’s also a double-agent working for
the Pathfinder Society, using her ship and connections
to smuggle Pathfinder agents past pirate blockades and
even into Port Peril itself. Stella occasionally purchases
shipments of Motaku cannons and firearms to resell to
the Pathfinder Society and its agents.
Due to the Pathfinders recording and publishing
their adventures, recent stories have begun to
include cautionary tales of muskets and pistols
bursting mid-fight. More traditional smiths and
bowyers leap on these tales, repeating them to
their customers while suggesting a reliable mace or
crossbow as a safer weapon for an aspiring adventurer.
Though Motaku Isle Iron Works has greatly increased
the accessibility of firearms, the storied unreliability of
those same weapons has begun to breed a concerned
mistrust of black powder weapons in other parts of
the Inner Sea.
Naval Encounters In
The Shackles
There have been occasional engagements between Free
Captain vessels and those of the Land of the Linnorm
Kings, but nothing approaching a fleet battle. Raiding
ships from both sides occasionally range far enough afield
that they encounter each other. Once battle is joined,
these fights rarely end without the sinking of one side
or the other, and the Ulfen longships now often move to
ram Shackles pirate ships on sight rather than risk taking
cannon fire.

As some of the first places in the world to have black
powder, the nations and kingdoms of Tian Xia and Vudra
each have their own array of black powder technology,
most of which evolved from the basic designs of the
earliest tools and weapons that used explosives. Over
the years, the formula for black powder has changed
from time to time depending on usage, leading to some
discoveries being lost and later uncovered and improved
upon. Today, in addition to domestic inventions such as
fireworks and fire lances, firearms from other continents
are becoming slightly less rare, despite many attempts to
limit their spread.
Tian Xia
The discovery of black powder was a long process that
began in a remote region of what would be east Minkai
today. For centuries, mines and quarries in this particular
area often experienced cave-ins and rock falls after an
explosion. For a while, many believed that the introduction
of air and candle flame into the area caused the collapse.
It was not until the last few centuries of the Yixing empire
that alchemists took an interest in the phenomenon and
began experimenting on the mineral composition of the
terrain around these accident sites.
After concluding that the combination of sulfur, saltpeter,
and graphite dust were the culprits, miners used this
knowledge to survey for potentially dangerous locations
to avoid. As the demand for stone grew from construction
needs, however, people realized that perhaps the explosive
nature of the mixture could be put to good use.
Formulation was a dangerous and tedious task, and
many researchers died before one particularly stable
and reliable formula emerged. From this, many mining
companies developed their own formulas, which
they guarded jealously. Weaker versions also started
circulating among the common people, which saw some
usage in areas such as agriculture, fishing, and festivities.
Even magic users began using the powder in tandem with
fire-related spells, though its volatile nature drove many
to stay away.

The use of black powder in combat did not arise until the
dissolution of the Yixing empire. The conflict between the
rebels saw many instances of sabotage and defensive traps,
usually directed at cavalry troops. The rampant usage and
casualties caused left a deep impression on the first Emperor
of Shu. Once he came to power, he quickly mandated that
the substance—and creation of it—was prohibited unless
closely monitored by officials. While this greatly limited the
capacity of developing new technologies surrounding black
powder, it also pushed inventors to refine their creations to
pass the intense scrutiny of the imperial regulators.
FIREWORKS
Fireworks were among the first “creations” of black
powder technology, as the impurities and poor packing
technique of earlier mixes resulted in many unexpectedly
colorful explosions and accidental rockets.
During the rebellion that founded Shu, fireworks were
used as flares to send various signals to reinforcements,
or to report on an outcome of a battle at a far distance.
Officials seized the workhouses that created these flares
after the war and the majority were able to transition
into firework factories—a handful of which still exist
today. Rather than attempt to control these companies,
the government took over crucial mines and now oversee
the logistics of supplying them. Some factories only receive
enough to make small firecrackers and boxed fireworks,
while others are given so much that they must create large
and elaborate fireworks in order to use up their quota.
In addition, using bamboo test containers, the noise
they made proved to be an incredibly effective means
of scaring birds or monkeys that were preying on farm
produce. Because of this, some came to believe that the
noise, heat, and color of the explosions could ward off
evil, and began to use small fireworks during religious and
cultural ceremonies and celebrations. The use of fireworks
to celebrate the coming-of-age of the first heir of the Shu
Empire cemented the practice in history.
Flowers are a popular inspiration and theme for
designing fireworks, followed by other natural phenomena
such as rivers and snow. One can often tell an origin of a
firework by the flower depicted, such as chrysanthemum
for Minkai and mugunghwa for Hwanggot. Occasionally,
rich benefactors will commission fireworks with a religious
theme. A particularly famous example is the Thundering
Rainclouds created by Kwanlai’s first domestic fireworks
house. Dedicated to Hei Feng, the Duke of Thunder, the
roaring effect mimicked a real thunderstorm so closely that
many unaware inhabitants near the testing site evacuated
out of precaution, expecting a flood.
EXPLOSIVES
The usage of black powder in mines and quarries naturally
led to their use during warfare, particularly to induce
environmental hazards such as rockfall or avalanches.
The indiscriminate nature of the effects, in particular an
avalanche that killed both troops and commoners in the
thousands before the founding of Minkai, caused local
populations to resent the saboteurs. Over time, however,
the army engineers developed more precise explosives.
First came thrown black powder bombs, which offer a
variety of benefits, such as breaking enemy lines of sight
with smoke, making the air difficult to breathe, creating
sparks to scare mounts, and potentially injuring enemies.
The difficulty in precisely timing and throwing these
bombs, however, saw a shift in tactics after the collapse
of the Shu empire. Various groups began to develop land
THE SECRET OF BLACK POWDER
There are many tales of how the formulation of black
powder came about, most steeped with rumors and
hearsay. Some of the wilder stories do share surprising
commonalities, citing a competition between adventurers
going into the Darklands to retrieve a legendary alchemy
manual said to contain many astounding formulas—the
black powder formula among them. The story of Kana
is the most widely told, though also the most easily
disproved. After many expeditions, failures, and deaths, a
single explorer named Kana (heritage and gender lost to
time) emerged unscathed with a ripped page containing
the coveted formula in hand. The formula quickly sold
to the highest bidder, allowing the explorer to retire to a
luxurious lifestyle for the remainder of their life. When
asked in their twilight years how they managed such
a feat, the stories say, Kana deflected the question by
telling stories of all the times they had failed, as well as
the ridiculous amount of alcohol they needed in order to
achieve such an accomplishment.
Many tales assume that Kana meant that they had
to consume many drinks to cope with the terrors of the
Darklands. Unknown in even the most outlandish of
the legends, Kana was taking barrels of alcohol there
as tribute to the then-juvenile underworld dragon,
Kuenen. While the dragon did not actually own the
manual sought after, her draconic family did, so she had
permission to peruse it for her own alchemical interest.
Kuenen’s alchemical formula book therefore had partial
instructions on the preparation of black powder. Once
word got out that the secret of black powder had been
released into the mortal realm, Kuenen was punished
heavily. She was bound forever to her humanoid form
by a powerful ritual, a heavy humiliation for the proud
dragon. Following that, her family exiled and banished
her from entering the Darklands, citing that she is not
to return until she has erased the knowledge of black
powder from the surface world.
While there is no information on Kuenen’s progress,
she most likely took her revenge on Kana. The legends
say that Kana died after drinking poisoned alcohol in the
midst of revelry.

and trip mines with varying effectiveness and stability, and
for a time after Lung Wa’s establishment, several regions
were unlivable due to the number of explosives left behind.
Currently, many nations frown upon the very concept of
land mines. Historical designs were systemically destroyed
or neglected, and the technology has been intentionally left
to stagnate.
Underwater mines are a relatively new concept in Tian
Xia, though rumors among the weapons engineering and
alchemy community suggest that an arms race involving
them is slowly building up in the northeastern corner of
the continent due to the tensions between Wanshou and
Xidao. Many explosive experts who travel through the
two regions have not been heard from since, and other
governments nearby started considering planting spies
or sending investigators into the region to find out what
happened to these missing experts. Another place that has
been stockpiling explosives—thrown bombs, in this case—
is Hongal, reportedly in preparation for skirmishes with
the oni of Chu Ye.
FIRE ARROWS AND ROCKETS
In addition to their recent stockpile of bombs, Hongal
has been crafting many fire arrows with pouches or tubes
of black powder attached. Originally, alchemists crafted
the first fire arrows in Tian Xia in an attempt to set off
unreliable land mines when they failed to explode on their
own. In time, they became regarded as effective weapons
for a siege, especially for their ability to set structures
alight. Other nations used them in place of firework flares
before devising a stable self-propelling mechanism. This,
along with research into fireworks, led the way to the
development of rockets, which were capable of delivering
even more incendiary material to pursued targets.
These technologies saw relatively more usage during
Lung Wa’s imperialistic expansion. Outnumbered against
the growing empire, defending nations sought to find
anti-siege weapons they could use to defend themselves.
Hwanggot’s hwacha, capable of firing up to a hundred
arrows per cart, arose from this need. Though the pacifist
nation used it in only a few minor skirmishes to defend
border fortresses, it gave rise to other similar anti-siege
weapons in Dtang Ma and Xa Hoi, which helped push
Lung Wa back when the empire’s sights turned to them.
FIRE LANCES
Lung Wa’s cavalry and troops were so feared in part due
to their extensive use and training with fire lances. While
the concept of these close-range weapons had circulated
since the early days of black powder usage, the reliability
of Lung Wa’s formula and production techniques allowed
the empire to arm as many as half of their soldiers
with them. They developed fire lances that produced a
concentrated stream of sparks, and though these lances
were only a threat at very close quarters, the heat and light
served as an additional psychological tactic, especially
against mounted animals. Some of their fire lances were
intentionally loaded with materials that produce smoke to
blind enemies for a devastating lethal stab. The most highly
trained troops used fire lances that were set to explode with
a simple manipulation, sending shrapnel towards the target
like a scattershot. These firelancers trained battle-hardened
mounts that were unafraid of the explosive noise.
Historical text hails General Tang Ye Fei as one of the
most legendary wielders of the fire lance. In one instance,
when she was surrounded by enemy cavalry, she was able
to switch out the damp packet of black powder on the
lance and perfectly time the explosion with a circular
swing to blind all her enemies and cut herself from the
fray. Her weapon, the White Pear Blossom, is displayed in
the Gokan Palace, and many modern firelancers dream of
being allowed to catch a glimpse of it there.
Today, very few nations have a battalion dedicated to
the use of fire lances, meaning most wielders are either
self-taught or taught privately by a professional. Some
have sworn themselves into the service of a nation in
order to gain access to a steady supply of black powder,
while others remain discreet and buy their explosives or
the component ingredients on the black market. Luckily,
these rogue firelancers have been rare enough in numbers
that no authorities have yet to take a particular interest in
spending resources to track them down.
CANNONS
The concept of cannons arose around the time fireworks
became popular. The sight of fireworks and rockets
being propelled into the air had many military engineers
wondering if they could accomplish the same with a
projectile of substantial weight. For centuries, inventors
kept running into the same issue: they couldn’t find a
metal or alloy strong enough to withstand the blast of
an explosion sufficiently powerful enough to launch a
projectile effectively. Current historical records suggest
that metallurgy only developed cast iron strong enough
to propel a head-sized cannonball shortly after the
formation of Lung Wa. The ratfolk uprising became the
perfect opportunity to test these cannons, and they proved
effective in pushing back the invasion. Imperial Lung Wa
further mass-produced cannons and used them often in
siege and naval warfare, as well as for coastal defense as
the empire continued its expansion. They also developed
smaller portable hand cannons to be used by shock troops
when breaking through enemy defenses.
Despite written historical records claiming cannons
did not exist at all prior to Lung Wa, shipwrecks around
Minata suggest otherwise. Divers have recovered ruined
cannons, several times more intricate and lightweight,
but perhaps just as sturdy. Based on the writing on these
cannons, the original owners called them cetbang or
lantaka, and are likely relics of an advanced civilization
whose written records have not yet been recovered. Thus
far, they have been impossible to repair or duplicate.

GUNS AND RIFLES
While small projectiles and pellets appeared in black
powder weapons such as fire lances and bombs, the guns
and rifles currently in Tian Xia are extremely rare and
aren’t local inventions. In Tian Xia, firearms such as
pistols originate mostly from distant Alkenstar. Due to
their rarity and the imperial ban, firearms are more often
seen as works of art and put on display. A small few are
used as hunting or sporting weapons among the most
powerful and rich aristocrats, whose private hunting
grounds and shooting ranges have the privilege to escape
the scrutiny of the authorities.
Of course, some nations are secretly creating their own
firearms while enforcing a complete ban. After intercepting
and stealing rifles and design diagrams meant
for Hongal, Minkai reportedly created their
first prototype of a new type of firearm, the
hinawaju, in 4721 AR. It’s
unclear as of yet whether the
prototype was a success, or
whether they’ll be able to
mass-produce hinawaju
usable by anyone other
than the inventor.
Hongal’s
military
is evaluating whether
firearms will be a good
defense
against
the
oni
incursion. Meanwhile, there
are rumors that nations in
the south such as Nagajor, Xa
Hoi, and Dtang Ma have also
started
training
with
what
small number of firearms they
could get their hands on, hiding
these activities in the depths
of the rainforests within their
borders. The most widespread
rumors in central parts of Tian
Xia claim that a small group of
gunsmiths and gunslingers have
gathered in Quain, where they
are seeking to become the first
firearms guild on the continent—
provided they can convince King Wen
that their firearms can be an asset rather
than a liability.
Vudra
Positioned near to Tian Xia’s trade
metropolis Goka, Vudra became aware
of the existence of black powder
quite early on in history. However,
the mining company’s secrecy
over the formula meant only small
amounts reached them at first. Even once the
technology became more widespread, attempts to export
barrels encountered several setbacks; many kegs arrived
too damp to be of use, if the ship even managed to arrive
in port. Mid-voyage explosions were an unfortunately
commonplace occurrence. The rarity of black powder
and associated technology made it a subject of fascination
in early Vudran history as a result. Most commonly,
spellcasting entertainers used small amounts to produce
amazing effects during their performance.
After the establishment of the Shu empire, many of the
kingdoms in Vudra received fireworks formulas and a
book of designs as a diplomatic gesture of goodwill from
the newly formed empire. From there, the Impossible
Kingdoms were able to formulate their own version of
black powder in order to create more. Firearms, however,
came much more recently, dating back to the recent
formation of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which lies
west of the peninsula across the ocean.
FIREWORKS
The firework formulas given to Vudra—
breaking a precedent at the time—were
extremely limited in scale, strength, and
design when compared to existing Tian
counterparts. This meant that historical
Vudran fireworks were small and simple, but the
weakened version of black powder did come with
an unexpected boon: Vudra’s domestic black
powder was much safer than Tian Xia’s, meaning
non-experts could handle it in close proximity.
The first creations that reflected this paradigm
were handheld sparklers. The shape, color, and
speed the sparks emitted gave rise to a myriad of
designs with names like the bloom, the storm, and
the prismatic ribbon. As suggested by those
names, Vudran sparklers are capable of
changing colors while burning, and these
items are still used at celebratory events
and parties.
Today, the sparklers are popular
enough worldwide that some Vudran
fireworks companies have factories
on other continents dedicated to their
production and distribution, including
in the island nation of Jalmeray, Vudra’s
foothold in the Inner Sea. In addition to
sparklers, they also produce fireworks that
focus on producing geometric shapes
and patterns. This is quite
a difficult feat to obtain,
and the fact that Vudran
fireworks engineers appear
to
have
perfected
the
techniques necessary to do
so is an astounding feat of
engineering and design.

================================================================================

EXPLOSIVES AND CANNONS
Prior to the introduction of black powder, Vudra already
had access to quality alchemist’s fire. Considering the
black powder formula they received from Tian Xia was
so weak, it should come as no surprise that their first
attempts at creating black powder explosives involved
mixing it with these sticky substances to see what would
BLANKET BAN VERSUS CONTROLLED CONCESSION
Tian Xia’s and Vudra’s attitudes toward firearms couldn’t
differ more. While Tian Xia openly despises yet craves
them, Vudra accepts them with reverence and respect.
Tian Xia’s ban on imported firearms started almost
immediately after the creation of the first firearms in
Alkenstar, which suited the Grand Duchy well, as they
had no intention of spreading their engineering secrets
far and wide. Nonetheless, a single firearm managed
to reach the continent through Goka within months of
creation, and more have continued to arrive sporadically
ever since. Most rulers feared the lethal potential of the
weapons and saw them as an instrument that could
easily challenge their power if given out to the masses
in sufficient numbers. As a result, current firearm sales in
Tian Xia happen almost exclusively on the black market,
and the penalties associated with the trade are ruthless.
Extralegal sellers often question authorities’ motives
in bringing the hammer down on firearms; though the
stated goal is typically to discourage their use and
control their distribution, smugglers argue that such
desires ring hollow and hypocritical when the authorities
themselves then seek to bolster their own stores of these
weapons. There is currently no ban on firearm manuals or
designs, meaning officials and rulers can legally own and
import them if they can locate the often expensive and
secret documents. Officials that seize a shipment rarely
destroy them on the spot, allowing them to stockpile
confiscated firearms in the name of enforcing the ban. It’s
relatively easy for rich merchants and members of the
nobility to import a firearm missing the requisite trigger
components as an “art piece.” Of course, once they’ve
done so, they can secretly forge the trigger components
locally, if they have access to the necessary plans.
Meanwhile, in Vudra, firearms are not universally
banned, though many rajahs had concerns about their
impact on various aspects of daily life. As such, the sale
of physical firearms and designs are monitored and
regulated, and merchants can only sell to those of specific
castes and certain ranks, for a limited set of reasons.
Now that Vudra has begun to commission their own
firearm production houses, most firearms produced there
are considered to belong to the producers and given to
buyers on a “long-term lease”. This gives the government
the legal right to confiscate a weapon, should they feel
such a decision is warranted.
happen. The result was akin to a potent, long-burning
alchemical fire that had a wide splash zone, which they
called naptha. Too volatile to use in simple bombs,
naptha was nonetheless valuable in warfare to create
hazardous burning areas. It saw limited use, however,
as it caused more damage than expected when used in
urban or jungle areas common in Vudran warfare.
The idea of cannons arose independently in Vudra as
well, and Vudrans were much more persistent in finding
a design that could withstand the explosion compared
to efforts elsewhere, such as Tian Xia. Their weaker
black powder helped with that, in a sense, although it
limited the blasting power of their early cannons. In a
small, nameless Vudrani satrapy, the result of decades of
careful research was a cast bronze cannon of incredible
size, intended as a siege weapon that could replace a
ram. This success motivated the rajahs and satraps of
other regions to pursue similar creations, giving rise
to a range of cannons of all sizes, from large defensive
cannons that required numerous horses or other forms
of physical power to move, to lightweight mortars that
could be easily carried by hand. The most unexpected
invention to arise out of the arms race, however, is
the underwater cannon—easily hidden from view, it is
capable of firing and delivering an explosion through a
body of water to an enemy ship.
FIREARMS
Positioned between Alkenstar and Tian Xia, Vudra
encountered a few of the Grand Duchy’s new firearms
earlier even than black powder’s birthplace, adopting
designs and production techniques several years ahead
of their neighbors. Compared to Tian Xia, the populace
has also accepted these new firearms quite readily, with
some even viewing them as a status symbol. However,
symbolic or not, these firearms have led to a number
of accidental injuries and deaths—most kingdoms have
placed a temporary ban and penalty in place for such
acts and are trying to figure out how to best reduce the
dangers from celebratory firing.
While some kingdoms increased the production of
fireworks to make them more accessible in place of
these new firearms, other kingdoms quickly diverted
their fireworks engineers to work on new gun designs,
with the intention of building their own artillery units.
With a preference towards muskets, these kingdoms
have recently begun to sanction skilled artisans to set up
royal gunsmithing houses. The kingdoms plan to offer
a portion of the guns to the public for sale through a
“long-term lease,” with the kingdom’s army retaining
ownership of the vast majority of these firearms. Having
control over the weapon manufacturing also gives
them control over the number and type of bullets sold,
allowing the kingdoms to provide blanks to the public
with the hope that this will reduce the rates of accidental
injuries and deaths.

In recent years, a small number of Stasian coils, named
for their rumored link with the arrival and ascension of
Queen Anastasia, have trickled into Ustalav from the icy
realm of Irrisen. Although this strange new technology
is perilous and poorly understood, it has become highly
sought after in the nation’s principalities, where some
believe it may hold the key to driving back the Whispering
Tyrant’s forces—or at least escaping them. As has always
been true in Ustalav, others use these new devices to
pursue morbid lines of research in pursuit of their own
eccentric ends.
The eerie violet or blue lightning of Stasian coils
has led to many innovations: some purely scientific,
others hybridized with magic. Spirit-singers, galvaheart
zombies, and airships rowed by the dismembered arms
of the dead are but a sampling of the creations that have
arisen. Though a predictable backlash has begun among
the more superstitious citizens, this has done little to dim
the excitement—or the desperation—with which others
have seized onto the potential of these devices. You
can find more information on the mechanics of Stasian
technology on page 82.
For those willing to steal or smuggle Stasian coils out
of Irrisen, and then risk doing business with Ustalav’s
volatile inventors and treacherous aristocrats, the rewards
can be great. So, however, is the danger.
SOURCING STASIAN COILS
No one knows—or at least, no one will admit to
knowing—the precise source of Stasian coils in Irrisen.
Only the thinnest trickle of technology escapes Irrisen’s
frozen grasp, and much of what makes its way into
Ustalav is rust coated and half-broken by the time it
gets there. Even so, a few smugglers can procure these
goods, though almost none deal in them with any sort
of regularity.
One of those rare dealers is Vaskili Demarr, a river
pirate who has carved out a niche in Stasian coils and
counterfeits. He deals in authentic pieces often enough
to have established a regular clientele among the
knowledgeable but is quick to sell fakes to less discerning
buyers. Vaskili is not especially well versed in the
technology and often stores pieces incorrectly, sometimes
causing significant damage. Nevertheless, so long as
USTALAV: SPARK AND SHADOW

================================================================================
PAGE 227
================================================================================

the pirate remains one of the few traders with access to
genuine Stasian items, his services are invaluable.
Inventors in Lepidstadt and elsewhere have also begun
attempting to reverse engineer Stasian items and produce
their own replicas and iterations. Many of these pieces,
particularly early ones created before the foundational
principles were even remotely understood, are unstable
and highly dangerous. Nevertheless, they remain both
jealously guarded and extraordinarily difficult to
obtain, as many of these inventors worry that a clever
and resourceful student might be able to examine and
produce their own versions in turn.
SPIRIT SONGS AND SPECTRAL AURAS
Among the first Ustalavic inventions based upon the
new technology were etheric spirit-singers, comprised
of two long, perpendicular metal rods jutting from a
rune-scribed box containing at least one Stasian coil.
Each spirit-singer’s properties vary slightly, depending
on the metals used in its crafting, the dimensions of its
rods, the sigils and materials of its containment box, and
other factors. However, all function according to the
same basic principles: they sense disturbances of ethereal
energies between the two rods, and they emit an eerie,
spectral warbling in response. The pitch and volume of
the spirit-singer’s song varies according to the position of
the disturbance, permitting the user to play the device as
a musical instrument via etheric manipulation.
The discovery that etheric spirit-singers could sense
and respond to incorporeal spiritual essence, including
ghosts and haunts, stirred considerable excitement
in Ustalav. Spirit-singers have been installed as alarm
systems meant to detect spectral intruders, particularly
in defensive fortifications and surveillance sites near the
Gravelands. They have also been adopted by traveling
exorcists who sweep them about the sites of purported
hauntings to determine whether a spirit is present, and
whether it has been successfully dispelled. Frauds run
rampant, since genuine spirit-singers are extraordinarily
expensive and delicate, and a simple auditory illusion can
mimic the effect.
Perhaps the most popular use for etheric spirit-singers,
however, is in melodic séances. In these performances,
commissioned by Ustalavic nobility at great expense,
an ancestor’s ghost or other spirit is invited to visit the
audience and communicate through a spirit-singer. Other
musicians, illusionists, or magicians may accompany the
performance, or an “interpreter of song” may translate
the spirit-singer’s eerie sounds into words.
Recently, a new variation has begun to surface—etheric
spirit-catchers, which use the same base technology but
convert the etheric disturbances to visual impressions
rather than sound. Disturbing rumors have already arisen
around these devices. It is rumored that their images
have the potential to leave troubling and persistent
effects on viewers’ minds, far more pernicious than the
unsettling but innocuous music of spirit-singers. Some
say that spirit-catchers do not merely catch hallucinatory
images, but the actual spirits themselves—to grim, even
nightmarish effect.
ZEFIRENDI’S LACE
In a cold and unlit workshop perched high over a
derelict tenement in Caliphas, the Garundi inventor
and astrologer Zefirendi has built a remarkable loom
powered by clockworks and guided by the movements
of a precision-built orrery. She spends many nights on the
workshop’s roof, studying the heavens through a powerful
telescope and adjusting her model. As the orrery’s celestial
bodies move through their arcs, they change the filaments
of the ornate lace being woven on the looms. No living
hand touches the threads or their looms, so the lace is the
creation of pure mechanical science, and the reflection of
the mysteries among the stars.
Zefirendi has been spinning, and perfecting, her
lace for years. It is nearly finished, and the astrologer’s
excitement—and dread—is near its peak. She began the
project to test a hypothesis that there was some message
hidden in the movement of stars and planets through the
infinite black of night. As the weaving went on, however,
Zefirendi became increasingly convinced that it was the
Dark Tapestry itself that spoke through her orrery. Now,
with her lace almost complete, she is certain that this is
so, and that she will soon be able to read the mystery of
the heavens recorded by her machines.
THE SILVERLENS SNIPER
Among the earliest adopters of Ustalav’s new technologies
is a secretive, mercenary assassin known only as the
Silverlens Sniper. She wears a gray velvet cloak and
matching gloves tipped with mother-of-pearl claws, and
her face hides behind oversized moonstone lenses that
glow an opalescent blue. Though every rumor tells a
different story of her weapon’s appearance, it’s clear that
she uses some kind of arquebus mixing a combination of
magic and Stasian technology.
The magical and technological marvel of her arquebus
and her preternatural accuracy are what makes the
Silverlens Sniper so terrifying; she can kill her victims
from afar, often without anyone knowing she was there
in the first place. The Sniper’s confidence in her skills is so
legendary that it’s rumored she sets out five bullets at the
beginning of each job. If her target survives all five shots,
the Sniper ends her hunt and refunds the contract.
The Silverlens Sniper’s most famous quirk is that she
refuses to kill human targets. She will fearlessly accept
contracts on vampires, werewolves, and even once a lich,
but she will not shed human blood, regardless of the
contract’s intentions. When given a new job, the Sniper
first scouts her proposed victim to determine whether
the target is acceptable, rejecting the contract if her
assessment is unfavorable. No matter how well-disguised

a non-human quarry might be, the Sniper has never been
wrong. How she pierces her targets’ deceptions, and why
she refuses to kill humans, is unknown.
THE GALVANIC HEARTS OF THE DEAD
Galvaspheres are complex, knotlike configurations
of various metals enclosed in a pierced sphere of iron
or steel coated in zinc. The devices are embedded in a
fleshy body, where blood or other fluids can penetrate
the sphere to cause a surge of “animal electricity” when
touching the metals. The exact arrangement of the knots,
and the combinations of metals that work to produce
the effect, are among the most closely guarded secrets of
Stasian-derived technology.
While the methods of galvaspheres’ creation are
secret, their effect is very much not: galvaspheres
animate corpses via electrical pulses, in a
fashion similar to that of zombies or flesh
golems but distinctly its own. The duration of
the effect depends on the size of the corpse,
the condition of its bodily humors, and the
quality of the galvasphere, but in general a
corpse can remain animate for a matter
of minutes to days. Such creatures
move in jerky, clumsy fashion, their
irregularity obvious in their vacant
eyes and slack jaws—though there are
rumors of more refined spheres that can
eliminate these obvious tells, allowing
bodies to move around undetected.
Likewise, rumors persist of enhanced and
perhaps magically augmented galvaspheres
that can revive the corpse’s mental faculties
in addition to simply moving its body, but
reputable witnesses have yet to confirm,
and the church of Pharasma has declared
these hypothetical augmented versions
to be anathema if they exist.
The
original
intention
for
galvaspheres was to assist medical
researchers in understanding the body.
Some believed that they might have
applications in battlefield medicine,
where they might keep a gravely
injured
soldier’s
heart
beating
long enough for a healer to arrive.
Inventors soon discovered that
galvaspheres’
powerful
electrical
currents overwhelmed and stopped
the hearts of the living, limiting the
devices to the dead. In Ustalav, this
morbid discovery did nothing to
slow researchers’ interest—to the
contrary, it opened up new avenues
of
possibility.
When
inventors
realized that galvaheart zombies,
unlike true zombies, were immune to many of the
magical means of control and deterrence that relied
on necromantic manipulation, the tactical potential
seemed enormous.
Though they remain largely unknown in most
of Ustalav, galvaheart zombies have been decoys,
infiltrators, and saboteurs around the Gravelands.
Because a galvaheart zombie’s blood is alchemically
warmed, and its heart physically beats due to the electrical
currents pulsing through its body, these creatures are
augmented with illusion magic, laced with colloidal
silver, and set as bait for vampires who would grow
weak from feeding on their poisoned veins. Not only
would feeding upon such altered blood fail to provide
sustenance to a vampire, it usually deals damage to
the vampire equal to the amount of damage the
vampire would have normally healed by Drinking
Blood, and causes the vampire to become drained
2. Other galvaheart zombies carry scrying devices
past enemy lines or slip through undead-oriented
defenses that no living person could survive.
Still others, it is sometimes whispered, have
been used to commit atrocities against
civilians when Ustalav’s rulers believed
it useful to inflame the citizenry against
“undead attacks.”
THE REAPER AND THE CURSE
Long before Stasian technology came
to Ustalav, alchemists knew that certain
metals, when immersed in acid, spewed
boiling gas. It was also widely noted that this
gas was highly flammable and lighter than
air, such that it could lift pigs’ bladders and
other lightweight materials if captured.
However, it was not until Stasian coils
and their innovations in metallurgy and
insulation arrived that the next step was
realized: airships built around hollow metal
skeletons and filled with metal-acid gas.
As of yet, only a spare few inventors and
vehicle mechanics have gotten close to the
creation of such magical and technological
marvels, but many more are closing in,
only a few years away from the creation
of their own airships. For now, however,
only two such ships ply the skies over
Ustalav: the Twelve-Armed Reaper and the
Stormcrow’s Curse.
The Twelve-Armed Reaper is a grim ship.
The skin stretched over its framework is a semiliving thing grafted together from the hides of
a hundred victims, and a dozen dismembered
arms row the massive oars that propel
it through the sky, offering the tireless
strength of zombies without the weight

================================================================================

================================================================================

of intact bodies. Ordinarily, necromantic magic powers
this grisly array, but when its captain wishes to steer
the Reaper past wards or creatures that might detect
an undead presence, the ship switches to the galvanic
power of its Stasian coils to animate the arms instead.
Steel-masked and silent, the Reaper’s captain is a
mystery. It is not even certain whether the captain is a
living person, or an automaton built to disguise the fact
that the Reaper might command itself. All that is known
is that the Reaper is a partially undead monstrosity
that seems driven to destroy other undead, which it
attacks with aerial bombardments of
incendiary bombs, corrosive gases, or
flesh-eating acids.
Stormcrow’s Curse is a sleek, black
vessel with a crow’s head at its prow
and wings painted on its sides. Its
captain is Jacquinde Stormcrow, a
half-orc woman with a pierced lip
and a signature cloak of iridescent
black
feathers.
Though
she
cultivates a forbidding persona,
the captain is more enigmatic than
malign. Using her spyglass to locate
promising candidates, she swoops
down on battlefields bordering
Belkzen
and
the
Gravelands,
offering survivors safe transport on her airship in
exchange for valuables, favors, or information, much of
it concerning the Hungry Mountains. Jacquinde’s odd
requests and the rumors that spread from those she’s
saved suggest that she seeks something hidden, and that
she built her airship to reach it.
While other inventors have attempted to build and
launch airships of their own, so far none of these
endeavors have succeeded, and more than a few have
ended in spectacular disaster. For now, only two dirigibles
float over Ustalav, and though their paths must surely
have crossed—given the technical feats involved in each
one’s flight—the two always drift separately through the
night sky, their silhouettes stark against the cold moon.
THE MASTER OF THE MOON
Professor Gregorias Desmaske, a onetime professor
of natural sciences at the University of Lepidstadt,
claims to have discovered a technique for harnessing
the power of Stasian coils to create an effect he calls
“lunar magnetism.” Gregorias has created pendants of
magnetite and moonstone linked by metallic coils that
he claims can block the affliction of lycanthropy, and
even “paralyze” natural lycanthropes into one form or
the other.
Other experts in Stasian technology publicly doubt
Gregorias’s claims, asserting that there is no connection
between the electromagnetism of Stasian coils and
the lunar tides that exert such a dramatic effect on
afflicted lycanthropes. Moreover, this is not the first time
Gregorias has advanced questionable science; he lost
his position at the University of Lepidstadt following a
tragic accident in which a young student was horribly
maimed, and a fellow professor killed. The incident was
widely viewed as preventable, and perhaps even less
than accidental. Gregorias departed the university soon
thereafter under a heavy cloud of suspicion, though
official records all state he left to focus on his research
and the university has hushed up any further details.
Despite the professor’s dubious reputation, cursed
lycanthropes and their loved ones are often desperate
enough to offer sizable sums for one of Gregorias’s
lunar magnets. And at least on the surface it does seem
that they work, whether by Stasian technology or other
means. Several lycanthropes have broken through the
shame and silence of their conditions to give glowing
testimonials to the lunar magnets’ benefits.
Yet none of these lycanthropes
has remained a public face
for long. Although new
beneficiaries
regularly
appear to tout Gregorias’s
miracle cure, earlier patients
vanish within a few months, at
most, after first donning a lunar
magnet. The professor claims that this
is because, having been cured, they wish to
return to their private lives without further disturbance.
He has declined to give any further information.
THE GROBELARCH
The
Grobelarch,
an
early
attempt
at
creating
mechanized armor, originated as a project to create a
suit of extraordinarily heavy, thrice-reinforced plate
interwoven with Stasian coils. Powered joints would
enable the wearer to move within the impossibly
bulky suit, electrified spikes would cover the plates in
a crackling defensive array, and concentrator coils on
the gauntlets would allow the wearer to channel the
electrical pulses into incapacitating or even lethal bolts.
That, at least, was the plan. From the beginning,
however, the armor was ill fated. Early versions lacked
sufficient insulation and overheated or fatally shocked
their wearers. Gauntlet misfires and wrenched neck
joints claimed the lives of other testers. Later, as the
accidents grew both grislier and unlikelier, those
working on the Grobelarch came to believe that the
armor had absorbed enough misery and death that it
had attained a cursed sentience and a murderous will
of its own. Created for war, it seemed to understand
nothing else.
Eventually, the workers rebelled against their patron
and tried to destroy the armor, only to find that their
fears were well founded. The Grobelarch, acting under
its own power, killed half a dozen metalworkers and

machinists in a terrible spasm of destruction. Its glass
visor smeared with scorched gore and its gauntleted
fists alight with half-broken arcs of sputtering plasma,
the hulking automaton strode out from the workshop,
leaving a trail of boiling blood.
Since then, reputable sightings of the Grobelarch have
been few and far between, and none surviving is sure of
the exact specifics of its capabilities. Every few months,
however, new tales arise of the carnage wrought by
an armor-plated monstrosity with a host of terrible,
haunted visages that rise and sink behind the blank,
blood-smeared glass of its visored face. Some say that
the Grobelarch kills so that it can capture its victims’
vital energy in its own coils, and that it is trying to piece
together enough fragments of stolen consciousness
to find a way out of its misery. If so, the effort seems
doomed to fail, as surely such a creature cannot hope to
capture anything but more violence and pain.
THE VIVISECTIONIST’S SONGBIRDS
Doctor Jerivale of Caliphas, a chirurgeon noted for
her extraordinary surgical skills and slightly unseemly
passion for vivisection, has begun experimenting
with the grafting and implantation of Stasian-derived
technology into living animals. She has created songbirds
whose melodies reverse spirit-singers’ effects to produce
uncanny disturbances of air and ether rather than sound;
dogs with clacking, spiderlike prosthetic legs that run up
walls and across ceilings as easily as flat ground; and
pigeons who bear spoken messages recorded in tiny
metal boxes, rather than written slips of paper.
A few of these animals were sold as pets or scientific
curiosities, and others were lured away by thieves’
gangs hoping to train them for a variety of criminal
uses. As Doctor Jerivale’s animals have become more
widely known, a local druid, Kheseban the Pruner, has
begun inveighing against them as perversions of the
natural order, “machine monstrosities,” and the result of
unforgivable cruelty to animals. The local government
ignored Kheseban, so the druid has resorted to
rabble-rousing on the street instead. These efforts have
borne more fruit, and there is now a real threat that,
with the right spark, a violent mob may assail Doctor
Jerivale’s laboratory.
GALAFRAEL’S LABORATORY
In a crumbling fortress above an insular village in
Versex, the embittered exile Galafrael, once a noble
lady of Lastwall, now sits and plots against the
Whispering Tyrant who destroyed her ancestral land
and slaughtered her family. Galafrael has embraced
Stasian technology as the answer to her quest for
weapons that might be able to destroy Tar-Baphon’s
army and has poured all that remains of her once-great
fortune into buying coils and support equipment, hiring
inventors and engineers, and investing in workshops
that can convert Versex’s natural resources into the
devastating weaponry she seeks.
Those who have visited Galafrael’s laboratory speak
of horrors within. The weapons she has created are
unlike anything seen before, capable of unleashing
utter devastation. Not only are the weapons themselves
terrible, but whispers swirl that Galafrael has allowed
her single-minded obsession with defeating the
Whispering Tyrant to consume her humanity. Porters and
cart-drivers tell of eminent scientists kept as prisoners in
the fortress, locked in workshops where they are bound
to toil on Galafrael’s devices of death. They also say that
captured undead fill the fortress’s ancient dungeons,
awaiting gruesome ends as test subjects—and that when
Galafrael runs low on captured undead, she sometimes
swells her ranks of test subjects by allowing an errant
undead to create spawn from kidnapped peddlers,
refugees, and other unfortunates she deems unlikely to
be missed.
Any attempt to seek justice for these victims—
assuming that the tales are true—is complicated by the
fact that the local magistrate, Elassus Vandershale, owns
several nearby mines that have been made vastly more
profitable by Galafrael’s innovative machinery and the
high prices she’ll pay for good ore. Elassus has made a
fortune from this stroke of luck, and he is not willing to
see it endangered.
DOCTOR OSTREA’S BOX OF DREAMS
The renowned Doctor Sovrok Ostrea, a scholar of
dreams and repressed desires, has invented a device he
calls the “Casket of Unwanted Dreams,” which wraps
Stasian coils around a sleeping patient’s head and
bathes them in a low-intensity, finely calibrated net
of electromagnetic energy. Doctor Sovrok claims his
procedure can pull troubling impulses and recurrent
nightmares from a patient’s mind, safely burying them
in an attached casket so that the patient is never again
disturbed by such dark desires.
The procedure seems to work, in that Doctor Sovrok’s
patients report, with great relief, being freed from all
manner of disturbing obsessions. But the casket does
not destroy their thoughts—it only stores them, and it
is not clear why the doctor keeps them. He claims that
he wishes only to study such obsessions in a harmless,
neutralized context, the better to find more effective
treatments. Yet rumors persist that the doctor is
gathering the information for less benevolent purposes:
that he is selling them to unknowable horrors who feed
on poisonous emotions, refining them into phantasms
of incapacitating dread, and might even seek to unleash
the captured nightmares on new victims someday. These
may very well be true, or perhaps these rumors exist
only because the ever-suspicious citizens of Ustalav find
it difficult to accept that the doctor’s kindness could be
as simple as it appears.

manipulate or conjure air. Those
that manipulate air have no effect
in a vacuum or an area without air.
Creatures with this trait consist
primarily of air or have a magical

people that a creature belongs to.
Each player character chooses an ancestry as the first
step of character creation. CR 32–59, APG 6–47

trait is magical. A creature with this trait is primarily
constituted of or has a strong connection to arcane magic.
archetype (trait) This feat belongs to an archetype.
attached (weapon trait) An attached weapon
must be combined with another piece of
gear to be used. The trait lists what
type of item the weapon must be
attached to. You must be wielding
or wearing the item the weapon is
attached to in order to attack with
it. For example, shield spikes are attached
to a shield, allowing you to attack with
the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if
you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually
bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and
typically an item can have only one weapon attached to
it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with
10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting
check; this includes the time needed to remove the
weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is
destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
auditory (trait) Auditory actions and effects rely on sound.
An action with the auditory trait can be successfully
performed only if the creature using the action can
speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell
or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the
target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts
of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different
from a sonic effect, which
still affects targets who can’t
hear it (such as deaf targets)
as long as the effect itself
makes sound.

spellcasting archetypes. CR 219
black powder black powder is used to create ammunition for
firearms and other explosive weapons, like cannons. 169
bomb (trait) An alchemical bomb combines volatile
alchemical components that explode when the bomb
hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal
damage, though some produce other effects.
bulk A value indicating an item’s size,
weight, and general awkwardness. 10
items of light Bulk equal 1 Bulk, and
1,000 coins are 1 Bulk. A character

greater than 5 + their Strength modifier,
and they can’t carry more than 10 +
their Strength modifier. CR 29, 271–272
capacity (weapon trait) Weapons that
have the capacity trait typically have
multiple barrels or chambers capable of
containing a round of ammunition. Capacity is
always accompanied by a number indicating the
number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity
weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel
or chamber as an Interact action that doesn’t require a
free hand. Each barrel or chamber can be reloaded after
it’s fired as a separate Interact action. 150

clockwork
(trait)
Clockworks
are
intricate, complex constructs that can
be programmed to perform specific functions.
A clockwork creature must be wound regularly
to function.
cobbled (weapon trait) This firearm is cobbled together
and likely to misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it,
on a failed attack roll, the attack misses and you must
roll a DC 5 flat check. If you fail this check, the weapon
misfires. 157
cold (trait) Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures
with this trait have a connection to magical cold.
combination (weapon trait) Combination is a new trait
for weapons that combine the functionality of melee
weapons and firearms in unique or unusual ways. A
combination weapon has both a firearm form or usage
and a melee weapon form or usage. Table 4–3: Uncommon
Combination Weapons lists the firearm statistics first,
and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just
above the ammunition. 159
complex (trait) A hazard with this trait takes
turns in an encounter.
concealable (weapon trait) This weapon is
designed to be inconspicuous or easily
concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide
or conceal a weapon with this trait. 150
concentrate (trait) An action with this
trait requires a degree of mental
concentration and discipline.
concussive (weapon trait) These weapons
smash as much as puncture. When
determining a creature’s resistance
or immunity to damage from
this weapon, use the weaker of
the target’s resistance or immunity to piercing or to
bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune
to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to
bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from
a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all
physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal. 150
conjuration (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the conjuration school of magic,
typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation,
or moving things from place to place.
construct (trait) A construct is an artificial creature
empowered by a force other than necromancy. Constructs
are often mindless; they are immune to bleed damage,
death effects, disease, healing, necromancy, nonlethal
attacks, poison, and the doomed, drained, fatigued,
paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions; and
they may have Hardness based on the materials used
to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living
creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit
Points, a construct creature is destroyed.
construct companion 32–33
consumable (trait) An item with this
trait can be used only once. Unless
stated
otherwise,
it’s
destroyed
after activation. Consumable items
include alchemical items and magical
consumables such as scrolls and
talismans.
When
a
character
creates consumable items, they
can make them in batches of four.
66–71, CR 559–571, APG 252–259
critical fusion (weapon trait)
Critical fusion is a new trait for
combination weapons that grants
you two additional options for the critical specialization
effect when using the combination weapon’s melee
version to make a melee attack while the firearm is loaded.
If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee
usage’s normal critical specialization effect. First, you
can discharge the firearm to create a loud
bang and concussion, using the critical
specialization
effect
for
firearms
instead of the melee weapon group’s
critical specialization effect. Second, you
can choose to discharge the firearm to
increase the critical hit’s momentum or shoot
the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing
2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both
of these options discharge the firearm, which typically
means you have to reload it before firing it again. 159
cursed (trait) An item with this trait is cursed to cause
trouble for its owner. A curse isn’t detected when the
item is identified, though a critical success reveals both
the presence and exact nature of the curse. Cursed
items can’t be discarded once they’ve been triggered or
invested the first time. The item can be removed only if
the curse is removed. GMG 90, 251
darkvision (sense) See clearly in darkness, though in black
and white only. CR 465
deadly (weapon trait) On a critical hit, the weapon adds
a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after
doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two
dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three
dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.

dedication (trait) You must select a feat with this trait to
apply an archetype to your character. CR 219
disarm (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Disarm
with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand.
This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own)
and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any)
as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically
fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop
the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a
critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free
hand if you want to take the item.
divination (trait) The divination school of magic typically
involves obtaining or transferring information, or
predicting events.
divine (trait) This magic comes from the divine tradition,
drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything
with this trait is magical. CR 299
double barrel (weapon trait) This weapon has two barrels
that are each loaded separately. You can fire both barrels
of a double barrel weapon in a single Strike to increase
the weapon damage die by one step. If the weapon has
the fatal trait, this increases the fatal die by one step. 150
dwarf (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the
dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live
underground and typically have darkvision. An ability
with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves.
An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.
200–201, CR 34–37, APG 42
effect An effect is the result of an ability, though an ability’s
exact effect is sometimes contingent on the result of a
check or other roll.
electricity (trait) Effects with this trait deal electricity
damage. A creature with this trait has a magical
connection to electricity.
enchantment (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the enchantment school of magic,
typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and
other mental effects.
evil (trait) Evil effects often manipulate energy from
evil-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to good
divine servants or divine servants of good deities. A
creature with this trait is evil in alignment. An ability with
this trait can be selected or used only by evil creatures.
evocation (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the evocation school of magic, typically
involving energy and elemental forces.
exploration (trait) An activity with this trait takes more
than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during
exploration mode. CR 234
fatal aim (weapon trait) It’s possible to hold the stock of
this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a
single hand, but if you use both hands, the weapon can
make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two
hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die.
Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is
significantly more complicated than just releasing one
hand from the weapon, so switching between the two
grips requires its own Interact action, not via Releasing
or as part of reloading. 150
finesse (weapon trait) You can use your Dexterity modifier
instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using
this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier
when calculating damage.
fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or
either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate
fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures
with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical
connection to that element.
firearm Firearms are a new category of ranged weapons
presented in this book that typically, but not always, use
black powder ammunition.
 classic firearms 150–153
 fantasy firearms 154–167
firing mechanism (item) Firing mechanisms are a type of
item that can be attached to a firearm. Only one firing
mechanism can be attached to a weapon at a time.
183–184
flourish (trait) Flourish actions are actions that require too
much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You
can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
force (trait) Effects with this trait deal force damage or
create objects made of pure magical force.
forceful (weapon trait) This weapon becomes more
dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack
with it more than once on your turn, the second attack
gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the
number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent
attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to
double the number of weapon damage dice.
fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you
roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune
effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would
apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect
and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the
two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

free-hand (weapon trait) This weapon doesn’t take up
your hand, usually because it’s built into your armor.
A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use
the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield
other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You
can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding
anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand.
When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise
using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to
have a hand free as well as those that require you to be
wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can
have only one free‑hand weapon on it.
gadget (trait) Gadgets are consumable technological
inventions with innovative uses. 66–71
gargantuan (size) This size of creature takes up a space of
at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but
can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have
a reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are
long, but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
goblin (trait) A creature with this trait can be one of several
kinds of creature, including goblins, hobgoblins, and
bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability
with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins.
A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.
good (trait) Good effects often manipulate energy from
good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil
divine servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature
with this trait is good in alignment. An ability with this
trait can be selected or used only by good creatures.
gunslinger (class) 105–119
haunt (trait) A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo,
often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt
to rest often involves resolving the haunt’s unfinished
business. A haunt that hasn’t been properly put to rest
always returns after a time.
healing (trait) A healing effect restores a creature’s body,
typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by
removing diseases or other debilitating effects.
held item (magic item) CR 572–576, APG 260–265
heritage A choice made to further define your ancestry. CR 33
huge (size) A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot
space (9 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15
feet if the creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the illusion school of magic, typically
involving false sensory stimuli. CR 298
incapacitation (trait) An ability with this trait can take a
character completely out of the fight or even kill them,
and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a
spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more
than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their
check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one
degree of success better, or the result of any check the
spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of
success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation
trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature,
or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.
infused (trait) You create an alchemical item with the
infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a
limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent
effects from your infused alchemical items, with the
exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end
when you make your daily preparations again. CR 72, 75
injection (weapon trait) This weapon can be filled with an
injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with
the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded
poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon
with a new substance requires three Interact actions,
and uses both hands. 62
integrated Integrated weapons can replace prostheses or
automaton limbs. 162
intelligent (trait) An item with this trait is intelligent and
has its own will and personality, as well as several
statistics that most items don’t have. Intelligent items
can’t be crafted by normal means, and they are always
rare or unique. GMG 88
inventor (class) 15–33
invested (trait) A character can wear only 10 magical items
that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects
of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, nor
can it be activated, though the character still gains any
normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a
hat keeping rain off their head). CR 531

kickback (weapon trait) A kickback weapon is extra
powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A
kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all
attacks. Firing a kickback weapon
gives a –2 circumstance penalty
to the attack roll, but characters
with 14 or more Strength ignore
the penalty. Attaching a kickback
weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod,
or other stabilizer can lower or negate
this penalty. 150
light (trait) Light effects overcome non-magical
darkness in the area, and can counteract
magical darkness. You must usually target darkness
magic with your light magic directly to counteract the
darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to
counteract darkness.
linguistic (trait) An effect with this trait depends on
language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets
a creature works only if the target understands the
language you are using.
low-light vision (sense) See in dim light as though it were
bright light.
magical (trait) Something with the magical trait is imbued
with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of
magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with
its dominant school of magic.
Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular
tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the
arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the
magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item
is magical. CR 535
manipulate (trait) You must physically manipulate an item or
make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures
without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with
this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.
mechanical (trait) A hazard with this trait is a constructed
physical object. CR 521
mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind.
It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.
Mindless creatures and objects are entirely immune to a
mental creature and can’t perceive it.
misfire Firearms that are improperly maintained or
subjected to unusual strain can misfire. 107
modification (trait) A feat with this trait alters the
construction of your innovation. If you have the
reconfigure class feature (page 20), you can retrain such
a feat more easily.
modular (weapon trait) The weapon has multiple
configurations that you can switch between using
an Interact action. Typically, switching between
configurations of a modular weapon allows
it to deal different types of damage (listed
in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”),
though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s
description
to
list
more
complicated
configurations. 151
monk (weapon trait) Abilities with this
trait are from the monk class. Weapons
with this trait are primarily used by
monks. CR 283
mounted (siege weapon trait) Mounted
siege weapons take up a certain size
and space, and typically have statistics
to allow them to be attacked. They’re used for large-scale
warfare. 72–73
move (trait) An action with this trait involves moving from
one space to another. CR 473–475
necromancy (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the necromancy school of magic,
typically involving the forces of life and death.
occult (trait) This magic comes from the occult tradition,
calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything
with this trait is magical. CR 299
parry (weapon trait) This weapon can be used defensively
to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your
proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend
an Interact action to position your weapon defensively,
gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of
your next turn. CR 283
perception A statistic measuring your ability to notice
hidden objects or unusual situations. Perception is
usually used for initiative rolls. CR 13, 27, 448, 464-467
poison (trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or
deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous
and might cause an affliction. CR 457–458

polymorph (trait) These effects transform the target into
a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more
than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under
the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second
polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it
succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no
effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by
a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated,
polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the
appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather
just a generic creature of a type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell,
the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance
bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise
noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells,
speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require
hands. (If there’s doubt about whether you can use an
action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you;
the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you
can’t activate any items.
portable (siege weapon trait) Portable siege weapons, such as
battering rams, can be more easily carried and have a role
in both warfare and smaller conflicts or exploration. 73–74
primal (trait) This magic comes from the primal
tradition, connecting to the natural world
and instinct. Anything with this trait is
magical. CR 299
ranged trip (weapon trait) This weapon
can be used to Trip with the Athletics
skill at a distance up to the weapon’s
first range increment. The skill check
takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You
can add the weapon’s item bonus to
attack rolls as a bonus to the check.
As with using a melee weapon to trip, a
ranged trip doesn’t deal any damage when
used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on
a thrown weapon. 17, APG 248
rare (trait) This rarity indicates that a rules element is very
difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item
or the like is available to players only if the GM decides
to include it in the game, typically through discovery
during play. CR 13
reach (weapon trait) This weapon is long and can be used
to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only
adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have
reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the
weapon increases their reach by 5 feet. CR 283
reckless (trait) Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of
the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a
reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate
piloting check to keep control of the vehicle. 48
repeating (weapon trait) These weapons can’t be loaded
with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and
firearms; instead, they require a magazine of specialized
ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that
magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically
loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing
its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0).
When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be
loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions
(to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine,
and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don’t
need to be consecutive. 62, 152
scatter (weapon trait) This weapon fires a cluster of pellets
in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it,
indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary
target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed
damage, and the target and all other creatures
within the listed radius around it take
1 point of splash damage per weapon
damage die. 152
scope (item) Scopes are a type of item
that can be attached to a firearm or
crossbow. Only one scope can be attached
to a weapon at a time. 180–182
shove (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to
Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have
a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different
from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to
attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If
you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon,
you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a
failure instead of a critical failure.
siege weapons Siege weapons are powerful devices used for
large-scale warfare. They are similar to vehicles and can
be operated by one or more individuals. 72–77, 172–177
skill (trait) A general feat with the skill trait improves your
skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a
skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class
grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with
the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you
have that archetype’s dedication feat. CR 233–253
sleep (trait) This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep
or get drowsy.

================================================================================
PAGE 237
================================================================================

snare (trait) Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow
special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly
and used on the battlefield. 78–81, CR 589–591, APG 256
splash (trait) When you use a thrown weapon with the
splash trait, you don’t add your
Strength modifier to the damage
roll. If an attack with a splash
weapon fails, succeeds, or
critically succeeds, all creatures
within 5 feet of the target
(including the target) take the listed
splash damage. On a failure (but not a
critical failure), the target of the attack still
takes the splash damage. Add splash damage
together with the initial damage against the
target before applying the target’s weaknesses
or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a
critical hit. CR 544
stance (trait) A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until
you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are
violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter
a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use
an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another
one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in
encounter mode.
steam (trait) Items with this trait are powered by engines that
boil water to produce steam and move their components.
sweep (weapon trait) This weapon makes wide sweeping
or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple
enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already
attempted to attack a different target this turn using this
weapon. CR 283
talisman (trait) A talisman is a small object affixed to
armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item).
You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate
a talisman attached to it. Once activated,
a talisman burns out permanently.
184–185, CR 565–570
tethered (weapon trait) This weapon is
attached to a length of rope or chain
that allows you to retrieve it after it
has left your hand. If you have a free
hand, you can use an Interact action to
pull the weapon back into your grasp
after you have thrown it as a ranged
attack or after it has been disarmed
(unless it is being held by another
creature). 159
thrown (weapon trait) You can throw
this weapon as a ranged attack; it
is a ranged weapon when thrown. You
add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for
a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee
weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged
weapons with this trait use the range increment in the
weapon’s Range entry. CR 283
transmutation (trait) Effects and magic items with this
trait are associated with the transmutation school of
magic, typically changing something’s form.
trap (trait) A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to
hinder interlopers. CR 520
two-hand (weapon trait) This weapon can be wielded with
two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die
to the indicated value. This change applies to all the
weapon’s damage dice, such as those
from striking runes. CR 283
uncommon
(trait)
Something
of
uncommon rarity requires special
training or comes from a particular
culture or part of the world. Some
character choices give access to
uncommon options, and the GM
can choose to allow access for
anyone. CR 13
unique (trait) A rules element with
this trait is one-of-a-kind. CR 13
unstable (trait) Unstable actions
rely on experimental functions of
your innovation that even you can’t fully
predict. After an unstable action is used on an innovation,
using another one is dangerous. 17
usage An indication of how an item must be worn, held, or
otherwise used. CR 535
versatile
(weapon
trait)
A
versatile weapon can be used
to deal a different type of
damage than that listed
in the Damage entry. This
trait indicates the alternate
damage type. For instance, a
piercing weapon that is versatile
S can be used to deal piercing or
slashing damage. You choose the damage
type each time you make an attack. CR 283
visual (trait) A visual effect can affect only
creatures that can see it. This applies only to
visible parts of the effect, as determined by the
GM. CR 301
volley (weapon trait) This ranged weapon is less effective
at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are
at a distance less than the range listed take a –2 penalty.
CR 283
water (trait) Effects with the water trait either manipulate
or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no
effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait
consist primarily of water or have a magical connection
to the element.
weapon 62–64, 150–167, CR 278–286, APG 248
worn item (magic item) 179–180, CR 603–617, APG 260–264
