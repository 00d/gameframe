inspire a technological renaissance in the highest halls of
Ustalavic academia. While Stasian technology is the newest
form of electrical technology, and the one least dependent
on magic, it’s hardly the first time in Golarion’s history that
a civilization has attempted to harness electricity. Most
notably, aeromantic infadibulum technology allowed the
sky cities of the Shory empire to soar through the sky.
However, such previous electrical technologies relied
heavily on magic as a key component, as this made the
inventions that harnessed them drastically more stable and
powerful than a purely technological solution. After all,
magic-users could create lightning bolts—what need was
there for a non-magical alternative? While it might seem
frivolous on magic-soaked Golarion, Stasian technology
exists because it originates from another world where
magic is much rarer. By utilizing less magical energy,
Stasian tech offers a viable alternative. The core Stasian
technology can be found on page 82, but other sections
of this chapter have a few pieces of Stasian technology
sprinkled in as well.
STEAM-POWERED TECHNOLOGY
Steam technology is also an extremely recent invention,
making it far less known than clockwork but still more
accessible than Stasian technology, since it doesn’t require
the use of the heavily limited Stasian coils. Many regarded
the idea to use steam for power as particularly novel simply
because the world of Golarion contained so many other
power sources that seemed more obvious or useful than the
energy generated by the transition from water to steam. Most
steam engines currently in use include a magical component
used to heat the steam; for instance, a fire elemental
generates a steady supply of heat on its own, though prior
inventors would have used that energy directly rather than
through the creation of steam. Nonetheless, several small
proof-of-concept steam engines have successfully run safely
and stably without the use of magic, through the use of
a furnace to heat the water. Purely technological steam
power will remain mostly a curiosity, though, as long as
it continues to be less effective and convenient than steam
power sourced through magical means.
Cogs in the Machine
Each section in this chapter presents a different use for
new technologies. Depending on how you want to add
technology to your character and game, you can mix and
match these sections and choose the ones right for you.
The chapter map sidebar on this page provides a quick
glimpse of the page numbers for each section.
COMBAT GEAR
Combat gear items are the practical sort you can use to
fight your enemies, making them the premiere choice for
martial characters seeking technological upgrades. There
are new weapons, weapon-like technological items, and
items that can alter the way you use weapons.
GADGETS
Gadgets are technological consumable items that do
something special once and then break down. They’re
especially important for inventors, who can take feats
allowing them to make a few free gadgets each day.
SIEGE WEAPONS
Siege weapons are large, powerful, difficult to move,
and dependent on several people to reload, aim, and fire
them. They’re particularly effective in a large-scale battle
or war, leveraging rank-and-file infantry for powerful
attacks by the skilled leaders of siege crews.
SNARES AND HAZARDS
Snares and hazards are perfect for rangers, trapsmiths
(page 54), and other characters who like to control the
battlefield ahead of time. When you mix the devious
minds of trapmakers with the possibilities presented by
technology, the possibilities remain especially deadly.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
Stasian technology includes some of the fundamental
technological items that use Stasian coils. You can learn
even more about Stasian technology and how Ustalav has
been using it on page 82.
UTILITY GEAR
Utility gear describes items that are useful in society, though
they may or may not be useful to a typical adventurer. For
instance, the recent invention of the printing press might
one day revolutionize the way society presents written
texts, but on a typical adventuring day, few heroes have
particular use for one. On the other hand, a clockwork
disguise or diving suit could be just what an adventurer
needs to get themselves out of (or into) a sticky situation.
VEHICLES AND MOBILITY DEVICES
Vehicles and mobility devices allow you to travel in style,
using new inventions based on the latest technologies that
can propel your adventure. If you’d like more mobility for
any reason, you can’t go wrong here. You can find even
more mobility items starting on page 66 of Pathfinder Lost
Omens Grand Bazaar, and the original rules for vehicles
are on page 174 of the Gamemastery Guide.

COMBAT GEAR
Although invention thrives all across Golarion, not all
inventions have spread far. Many remain isolated, typically
due to cost, inconvenience, location, or lack of components
and materials. The weapons, combat gear, and equipment
presented below are all mechanical, non-magical, and based
off cutting-edge clockwork innovations, which occasionally
incorporate even newer, bleeding-edge steam technology.
Weapons
NEW WEAPON TRAITS
The weapons in this section use the following traits in
addition to those found on pages 282–283 of the Core
Rulebook and page 248 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
Injection: This weapon can be filled with an injury poison.
Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you
can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single
Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance
requires three Interact actions and uses both hands.
Repeating: These weapons can’t be loaded with
individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and firearms;
instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition
to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in
place, the ammunition loads automatically each time the
weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value
in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs
out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free
hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine,
retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in
place). These actions don’t need to be consecutive.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
BACKPACK BALLISTA
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
This complex wooden device, worn on the back, contains a
miniature ballista on a retractable arm. As an Interact action,
you can pull a lever to deploy or retract the ballista. As long as
it remains deployed, you must hold the ballista using that hand
or some of the components spill out onto the ground, just like
dropping any other weapon. While deployed, the device opens
and raises the ballista up over your shoulder. While retracted,

the ballista and its mount slide down and are concealed within
the device. Although a backpack ballista packs a punch, the
device is a challenge to operate. Reloading it takes 1 minute
and can’t be done while worn. As normal, you can’t wear a
backpack ballista with another backpack.
BACKPACK CATAPULT
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
This wooden device is worn on the back and contains a
miniature catapult mounted on a retractable frame. As an
Interact action, you can pull a lever to deploy or retract the
catapult. As long as it remains deployed, you must hold the
catapult using that hand or some of the components spill out
onto the ground, just like dropping any other weapon. While
deployed, the device opens and raises the catapult up over
your shoulder. While retracted, the catapult and its mount
slide down and are concealed within the device. A backpack
catapult fires specialized stone spheres that are loaded into the
bucket while unworn and retracted, through a sliding hatch;
the reloading process takes 1 minute. To prevent misfires and
accidental injury, the bucket fully encloses the stone while
deployed, only opening when fired. As normal, you can’t wear
a backpack catapult with another backpack.
DART UMBRELLA
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This umbrella fires tiny blowgun darts from its ferrule with a
twist of the handle. The darts are loaded into the shaft, and
though the damage they deal is minimal, the dart umbrella is
an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past inspections.
INJECTION SPEAR
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A hollow receptacle inside this spear’s head can store a single
dose of poison. A sliding trigger along the spear’s shaft can
inject the loaded poison into a damaged target.
PANTOGRAPH GAUNTLET
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
A pantograph gauntlet is a heavy, fist-like weight, mounted on
an extendable frame and attached to your outer arm with a
series of leather straps. The frame’s set of mechanical linkages
connected at various hinges allow movements to propagate
across the frame based on reshaping parallelograms, further
controlled by a crossbar grasped in your hand. A pantograph
gauntlet is driven by your own motion and mirrors your
arm’s movements—a punch thrown with your fist moves
the pantograph, extending the weight out at a rapid speed
to land blows up to 10 feet away. In some regions, such as
Alkenstar and Ustalav, pantograph gauntlets are occasionally
constructed entirely of metal and fashioned in the likeness
of oversized arms, incorporating a complex system of
gears or a miniature steam engine in place of the simpler
pantograph mechanism.

REPEATING CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This crossbow has an internal chamber that can be loaded
with up to five bolts. An automated catch mechanism at the
top of the flight groove, just in front of the latch, locks the
bowstring and launches bolts with the pull of a trigger.
REPEATING HAND CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This handheld crossbow features an ingeniously designed
catch mechanism at the top of the flight groove, just in
front of the latch, which automatically loads a bolt from a
magazine and resets the string each time the weapon is
fired. A typical repeating hand crossbow magazine holds
five bolts.
REPEATING HEAVY CROSSBOW
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This large crossbow has an internal chamber that
can be loaded with up to five bolts. While it uses
the same automated catch mechanism as other
repeating crossbows, a repeating heavy crossbow’s
design has significant trade-offs. It has increased
range and damage and is easier to learn how to use, but
requires a small amount of effort to reload.
UMBRELLA INJECTOR
ITEM 0
UNCOMMON
This umbrella’s ferrule is a hollow-tipped blade three
to four inches in length and often overlooked as decorative.
A receptacle inside the umbrella’s shaft can be loaded with
a single dose of injury poison and injected into a damaged
target with the pull of a sliding trigger. Reinforced ribs
enable you to parry and deflect blows with the umbrella’s
tear-resistant canopy.
Combat Gear
The following pieces of combat gear aren’t weapons
themselves, though several
enable you to deploy other
weapons in innovative ways.
BLADE LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 18 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a
handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either
a dagger, dart, shuriken, or starknife. Configuring a blade
launcher requires three Interact actions. Once properly
configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a
blade launcher requires a single Interact action. A blade
launcher can’t fire weapons for which it’s not currently
configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the
agile, monk, thrown, and versatile traits, if it has them, and
has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown
weapon trait, returning and most other effects that allow a
weapon to return don’t function; even if a launched weapon
did return, you’d still need to load it into the blade launcher
with an Interact action to fire the blade launcher again.
BOMB LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 20 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This long, hollow tube is held in two hands and braced over
the shoulder. Inside, it contains a small metal basket sized
to hold alchemical bombs. A chute in the top delivers an
alchemical bomb into the internal basket, while a lever
on the underside pulls the basket back and locks it
in place. Loading an alchemical bomb into a bomb
launcher requires a single Interact action. With a pull
of a trigger, the basket speeds forward, allowing you
to Strike with the loaded alchemical bomb over long
distances. Bombs fired with a bomb launcher have
a range increment of 60 feet.
DEPLOYABLE COVER
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This thick mat of canvas, foliage, and wood is mounted on a
tripod of flexible metal struts, folded into a baton-
like shape, and clamped shut. You can rapidly
deploy it on the ground with an Interact action to
create cover. Deployable cover is large enough to Take Cover
behind, allowing you (and others) to gain standard cover when
you use the Take Cover action. Before it can be used again,
deployable cover must be carefully folded and clamped shut,
which takes 1 minute.
Type deployable cover; Level 1; Price 15 gp
Type ballistic cover; Level 2; Price 35 gp
Specially crafted to protect against bullet fire, a ballistic cover
also works against other physical projectiles, such
as arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons. While
a creature has cover from Taking Cover
behind a ballistic cover, it gains resistance 2
to piercing damage from ranged weapons
and ranged unarmed attacks.
GRAPPLING GUN
ITEM 0+
UNCOMMON
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wooden, pistol-like device features a large reel coiled with
100 feet of thin metal cord and can fire a grappling hook up
to 100 feet. To reload the grappling gun, you must manually
recoil the cord by turning the reel’s crank, and then lock in
the grappling hook. Reloading a grappling gun takes 1 minute.
Type grappling gun; Level 0; Price 3 gp
Type clockwork grappling gun; Level 1; Price 15 gp
Clockwork controls the reel on this grappling gun, reeling the
grappling hook back in when you pull a lever. Reloading a
clockwork grappling gun takes three Interact actions.

NET LAUNCHER
ITEM 1
RARE
Price 16 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wide, hollow tube is two to three feet long and fires an
unattached net at much greater range than one can be thrown.
A net launcher can be wielded while propped up on your
shoulder or cradled under your arm. A net must be carefully
folded to be launched without tangling. Properly loading a
net into a net launcher takes 1 minute. A net fired with a net
launcher can target a Medium or smaller creature within 40
feet, rather than 20 feet.
WIND-UP WINGS
ITEM 3+
RARE
CLOCKWORK
Usage attached to a thrown weapon; Bulk —
These delicate clockwork wings enable thrown weapons to
soar through the air at high speeds, performing turns and
other aerial maneuvers midflight. Wind-up wings also have
different types of special effects depending on the type.
Wind-up wings must be attached to a thrown weapon and
wound to function. A thrown weapon with an attached set of
wind-up wings can’t have anything else attached to it, or the
wings cease to function.
Attaching or detaching a pair of wind-up wings to a
thrown weapon requires a repair kit, and the process takes
10 minutes. Winding an attached pair of wind-up wings takes
three Interact actions. There are a variety of wind-up wings,
with different effects.
Type flutterback wind-up wings; Level 3; Price 50 gp
When you make a thrown Strike with the weapon to which a
pair of flutterback wind-up wings are attached, and the wings
are wound, the wings fly the weapon back to your hand after
the Strike is complete. If your hands are full when the weapon
returns, the wings hover in place three feet above the ground.
At the end of your turn, the wings are wound down; they don’t
function again until wound. If you aren’t holding the weapon
when the flutterback wind-up wings become wound down, the
weapon falls to the ground.
Type homing wind-up wings; Level 12; Price 1,800 gp
When you make a thrown Strike with the weapon to which a
pair of homing wind-up wings are attached, and the wings are
wound, the wings seek out your target, flying through cover
and avoiding obstacles. You ignore the target’s concealed
condition and reduce the target’s cover by one step (lesser
cover to no cover, standard cover to lesser cover, or greater
cover to standard cover). After the Strike is complete, the
wings are wound down; they don’t function again until wound.

GADGETS
Gadgets are consumable technological inventions with
innovative uses. Gadgets take a variety of forms, some
handheld, others worn, and they often take a while to
put on or take off. Depending on their forms, gadgets
also have a variety of different effects. Due to the use of
technology, all gadgets are uncommon or rare, though
inventors and regions with access to inventors have
access to uncommon gadgets.
Gadgets are particularly important to inventors,
some of whom learn tricks and techniques to create a
number of temporary gadgets each day from spare parts
without needing to spend additional time and money
on the project. This, in turn, leads those inventors to be
particularly profligate in the use of gadgets, which leads
to an even stronger association between the two.
Gadgets are not, however, exclusive to inventors. In
truth, anyone can make a gadget if they have the time,
money, skill, and knowledge of how to do so. This
sometimes leads others to misidentify a particularly
technologically-savvy investigator or wizard using
gadgets as an inventor.
ABLATIVE ARMOR PLATING
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage attached to armor or traveler’s clothing; Bulk 1
Ablative armor plating is additional plating, combined with
springs, clever clockwork, and improvised padding, to absorb
damage by knocking the additional pieces free. The pieces
slowly come apart on their own with time and movement.
The process of attaching the plating takes 10 minutes and
grants the wearer of the armor the listed temporary Hit
Points for the stated duration or until lost. Removing the
plating early destroys it.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The wearer gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 1
minute or until lost.
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 12 gp
The wearer gains 10 temporary Hit Points that last for 10
minutes or until lost.
Type greater; Level 7; Price 70 gp
The wearer gains 20 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour
or until lost.

ABLATIVE SHIELD PLATING
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage attached to a shield; Bulk 1
Ablative shield plating is an amalgam device that provides
a layer of additional protection for a shield. Ablative shield
plating is cobbled together from parts of other shields, wires,
scraps, and bits of detritus, adding mass to a shield. The
process of attaching ablative shield plating takes 10 minutes,
and you can’t attach ablative shield plating to a shield that has
any other attached item, such as a shield boss or shield spikes.
When the shield is damaged, this additional material crumples,
breaks, and falls apart, absorbing some of the energy of
the blow. Otherwise, the additional material slowly
crumbles over time. Applying the plating grants
the shield temporary Hit Points that last for the
stated duration or until lost. Removing the plating
early destroys it.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 4 gp
The shield gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last
for 1 minute or until lost.
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 12 gp
The shield gains 10 temporary Hit Points that
last for 10 minutes or until lost.
Type greater; Level 7; Price 70 gp
The shield gains 20 temporary Hit
Points that last for 1 hour or until lost.
Type major; Level 13; Price 600 gp
The shield gains 30 temporary Hit Points that
last for 1 hour or until lost.
Type true; Level 19; Price 8,000 gp
The shield gains 40 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour
or until lost.
BLAST BOOTS
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage worn (attached to footwear or feet); Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing
footwear (or a creature’s feet). Inserting them and aligning
them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the blast
boots, you can High Jump or Long Jump, without the need to
Stride first. Higher-level versions increase the distance of your
High Jump or Long Jump.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 3 gp
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 11 gp
When you Activate the moderate blast boots to High Jump, you
can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 30
feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can increase
the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 45 feet.
Type greater; Level 9; Price 140 gp
When you Activate the greater blast boots to High Jump, you
can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up
to 50 feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can
increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to
75 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the greater blast boots
continue to boost your jumps. Every time you Leap during
the duration, you can move 30 feet in any direction, or your
normal Leap distance, whichever is further.
Type major; Level 17; Price 2,750 gp
When you Activate the major blast boots to High Jump, you
can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up
to 80 feet. When you Activate them to Long Jump, you can
increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up
to 120 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the major blast boots
remain active, allowing you to clumsily fly through the air for
the duration. You gain a 30-foot Fly speed for the duration,
but any time you Fly, you are clumsy 1 until the start of your
next turn.
CAUTERIZING TORCH
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This small, clockwork torch device uses a
trigger-operated sparker to ignite a flow of
flammable gas, creating a short, hot flame
capable of rapidly cauterizing wounds and
helping to stop bleeding. The cauterizing
torch is applied to yourself or an adjacent
target. The target attempts an immediate flat
check to end any persistent bleed effect with
the lower DC for particularly effective assistance
(Core Rulebook 62).
CHAMELEON SUIT
ITEM 4+
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage worn over armor and clothes; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
This complex clockwork outerwear, worn over armor or
other clothing, is composed of thin, interlocking scales of
myriad colors attached to numerous clockwork gears that
can rotate between all visible colors and shades.
When activated, the clockwork gears work double-time
to temporarily switch and adjust the scales to match the
exact coloration of the area around you, allowing you to
blend in as long as you stay still. For the duration, you can
Hide without needing cover or concealment to do so. This
doesn’t allow you to Sneak without ending your movement
in cover or concealment, however, as the clockwork flips
over and adjusts the scales to match your background as
you move, giving the impression of rippling waves of color
and revealing your movement. Once the duration expires,
the overworked clockwork and scales fall apart.
Type chameleon suit; Level 4; Price 16 gp

CLOCKWORK GOGGLES
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage worn eyepiece; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
This heavy set of mechanical goggles contains a variety of
different lenses for different situations, including lenses
that filter light at different intensities and frequencies and
even some that capture heat and other stimuli. Clockwork
mechanisms can swap between the lenses rapidly as needed.
However, many of these lenses can only capture a single
stimulus once and then are forever etched with it, making
them unsuitable for long-term use. When activated, the
clockwork mechanism on the goggles rapidly switches
between the different lenses, granting you the benefits of all
of them for a brief period of time.
Type clockwork goggles; Level 1; Price 3 gp
When activated, you gain low-light vision for 10 minutes.
Type greater clockwork goggles; Level 4; Price 15 gp
When activated, you gain low-light vision and darkvision for
10 minutes.
Type major clockwork goggles; Level 8; Price 80 gp
When activated, you gain low-light vision, darkvision, and
the effects of see invisibility for 10 minutes.
CRYOMISTER
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
COLD
CONSUMABLE
GADGET
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in
an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you’ve
done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist,
settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet
of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a radius depending
on the type, making the affected area difficult terrain for
1 minute; , at the GM’s discretion, however, this duration
might be reduced in unusually hot conditions or increased in
unusually cold ones. If an affected square takes fire damage,
the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a
weapon, the cryomister’s rapidly cooling mist deals cold
splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the
area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through
the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a
DC depending on the type to ignore the difficult terrain and
move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto
the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the
same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures
of the listed size.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 3 gp
The area is a 5-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 17, and the
cold splash damage is 1. The floating ice can support one
creature up to Medium size.
Type moderate; Level 5; Price 25 gp
The area is a 10-foot burst, the Acrobatics DC is 21, and the
cold splash damage is 3. The floating ice can support one
Large creature or two Medium or smaller creatures.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 250 gp

Price 3 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] Interact
When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the
ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode
when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in
advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground
before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth
to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you
don’t Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance.
Once activated, the mine is primed to explode when
enough pressure is placed on the square where it’s located.
Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves
onto the square, though it could happen if a creature
intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance
to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes,
dealing the listed fire damage to any creatures in a 5-foot

GADGET
Price 21 gp
Usage worn (attached to footwear or feet); Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact (move)
Gadget skates are metal devices that come in pairs and strap
onto existing footwear (or a creature’s feet).
When you Activate gadget skates, clockwork gears reveal
small wheels that propel you along the ground, moving you
up to twice your Speed. During this movement, you must
succeed at a DC 20 Acrobatics check to turn up to 90
degrees, and you can’t turn more than once or more than
90 degrees. During the activation and after the activation is
complete, you can’t Stride, Step, or otherwise move on the
ground until the end of your next turn. However, you can use
this movement instead of a Stride to perform a High Jump or
Long Jump just after the activation ends, in the direction of
your last movement using the gadget skates.
You can Sustain the Activation of your gadget skates
for up to 1 minute. Starting on the turn after you Activate
the gadget skates, the first time you Sustain the Activation
each turn, you gain the effects of the activation again: you
move up to twice your Speed in the same direction as your
last movement with the gadget skates, and the restrictions
continue to apply until you choose to cease Sustaining the
Activation or you reach the maximum duration. Once the
effect ends, the skates fall away and you can move normally.

While you’re wearing an impact foam chassis wrapped
around your body, it Activates automatically whenever you
fall at least 10 feet, causing a layer of soft, flexible impact
foam to expand beneath and around you to cushion the
fall. The impact foam decreases the falling damage by up
to the listed amount, taking damage equal to the amount
of falling damage the foam reduced. If this is enough to
destroy the foam, it disperses immediately. However, if the
foam has any Hit Points remaining, it remains surrounding
you for up to 1 minute. While you’re surrounded in foam,
you are immobilized and have standard cover against other
creatures, and other creatures have standard cover against
you. The foam has an Escape DC of 15; a creature can also
remove it by spending three Interact actions. You or others
can also attack the foam (the foam has an AC of 12), which
disperses if reduced to 0 Hit Points.

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
An instant spy is a tiny clockwork device that is small enough
to be easily hidden. It contains the same audio-recording
mechanisms as a clockwork spy (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 48),
as well as a short‑lived gemstone that can store up to 1 hour
of sound to play back later.
Once you have activated the instant spy, it surreptitiously
begins recording all the sounds around it for an hour. In
general, it can hear sounds that are clearly audible in the
location where you activated it, but not sounds that would
require a Perception check with a DC of 10 or greater to
hear. The GM determines exactly what the instant spy can
hear and record, as well as whether or not the recording
is clear in a situation where the original sound is quiet,
distorted, or intentionally obscured.
When the recording is complete, once within the next 24
hours, you or another creature can use an Interact action
to play back the stored audio in its entirety, after which the
gem crumbles to dust. If no one plays the recorded sounds
back within 1 day, the gem crumbles into dust anyway.
This prevents the information from falling into the wrong
hands later. It’s typical to use the Conceal an Object action
to hide an instant spy in a location once you’ve activated
it, since if you don’t hide it, it’s relatively easy to discover
in a thorough search, despite the fact that it’s small and
relatively unobtrusive.

SIEGE WEAPONS
Shattering towering palisades. Mowing down hordes of soldiers. Breaking through
barred castle gates. All of these tasks call for something heftier than the typical armaments
carried by the common soldier: siege weapons. These massive, often‑complex devices
require full crews to operate. In significant numbers, they allow attackers to lay siege
to entire fortifications, just as their name would suggest.
There are two categories of siege weapons: mounted and
portable. Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size
and space, typically have defensive statistics, and are used
for large-scale warfare. More adaptable are portable
siege weapons, such as battering rams, which can be
carried more easily and can serve a valuable role during
large-scale warfare, smaller conflicts, or even exploration.
All siege weapons need more than one person to operate
them, working together as a crew. These crew members all
need to be adjacent to the siege weapon for it to operate.
A siege weapon’s stat block lists the minimum number
needed and the maximum crew size. Adding additional
crew beyond the minimum is useful for ensuring a quick
and successful Load in uncertain conditions and allowing
for enough time to Aim the siege weapon when firing at
a moving target.
Mounted Siege Weapons
Properly using a mounted siege weapon involves three
activities: Loading, Aiming, and Launching the payload.
Generally, none of these activities can be taken unless the
weapon has enough crew, but the GM might allow a smaller
crew or even an individual to perform simpler parts of the
process, like Launching—especially at a dramatic moment!
AIMING
A cumbersome mounted siege weapon can’t be Aimed in
a moment like a bow could be. A member of the weapon’s

Introduction
Gears

Guns &
GEARS
crew needs to take the Aim activity to adjust a mounted
siege weapon’s aim. At a given time, the weapon is Aimed
in a particular way, depending on the target or area the
weapon uses.
•	 Single Target: Aimed at one square
•	 Burst: Aimed at one grid corner (that will be the
center of the burst)
•	 Cone or Line: Aimed in a particular direction, to the
nearest 45º angle.
When a siege crew member takes the Aim activity,
they can move the aim of a mounted siege weapon only
a certain distance (or rotate the weapon a certain amount
for a cone or line). Typically, the aim for a single target
or burst can’t be placed too close to the weapon due to
the arc in which the weapon shoots. The distance moved
or rotated can be found in each weapon’s stat block, as
is the minimum distance, if applicable. The Launch entry
notes whether the attack is against a single target or in a
burst, cone, or line.
LOADING
Any member of the crew can take the Load activity to
prepare the weapon, resetting its machinery or helping
Load the payload. The stat block lists how many times
the activity must be taken to prepare the weapon to
Launch. Some Load activities require successful checks to
be effective, such as ones that require an Athletics check
to Load heavy ammunition into the siege weapon. Once
the weapon is Loaded, trying to Load it further has no
effect. It doesn’t matter in what order the siege weapon
is Aimed and Loaded, and the crew could partially Load
the weapon, Aim it, and then continue Loading it without
disrupting the process.
LAUNCHING
A member of the crew adjacent to the siege weapon’s
release can use the Launch action to shoot the siege
weapon. After the weapon has been Launched, it must
be Loaded fully to be Launched again. No matter how
quickly it’s Loaded, a single siege weapon can never be
Launched more than once per round. The aim remains
where it was, and the weapon needs to be Aimed again
only if the crew wishes to change the aim.
Launch [one-action] (attack) Requirements The siege weapon is Loaded;
Effect The siege weapon launches its payload, which targets
or has an area where the weapon is Aimed.
•	 Single target Targets a creature, unattended object, or
structure in the square the weapon is Aimed at
•	 Burst Centered on the grid corner the weapon is Aimed at
•	 Cone or Line Directed where the weapon is Aimed
Each creature, unattended object, and structure the siege
weapon is Aimed at or that is in the area takes the amount
of damage listed in the Launch action, with a basic saving
throw against the DC listed in the stat block. If you’re trained
in any weapons of the category listed in the siege weapon’s
proficiency entry, you can use your class DC instead of the
weapon’s default save DC. The weapon’s range increment
penalty applies to the Launch DC, as does your multiple
attack penalty. If the weapon is mounted on a vehicle,
the penalties for attacking from a vehicle in combat also
apply (Gamemastery Guide 177). Though a siege weapon
doesn’t require an attack roll, the Launch action still has
the attack trait and therefore counts toward your multiple
attack penalty.
MOVING A MOUNTED SIEGE WEAPON
A mounted siege weapon has to be built on solid ground
and remains stationary while being operated. Some are
on wheels or are otherwise easier to move, but none can
be prepared or shot while being moved. The GM might
allow a mounted siege weapon to be placed on a large
enough vessel, such as a sailing ship.
Moving a mounted siege weapon takes concerted effort
from the whole crew pulling and pushing. This requires
acting in concert, as described under Portable Siege
Weapons, with the crew leader taking the Move Siege
Weapon activity. This requires the minimum number
of crew required to operate the siege weapon and gets
no extra benefit for additional crew helping. If a siege
weapon doesn’t list this action, it can’t be moved this
way; it has to be disassembled and reassembled.
Move Siege Weapon [two-actions] Requirements The rest of the crew
have Readied to Stride on your order; Effect You and the
crew Stride, moving the mounted siege weapon with you.
The maximum distance equals the slowest crew member’s
Speed, or the maximum Speed listed in the siege weapon’s
Move Siege Weapon entry, whichever is lower. The siege
weapon’s aim moves the same distance and direction the
siege weapon moved.
Portable Siege Weapons
Portable siege weapons require moving in concert and
making a single attack supported by the full crew.
ACTING IN CONCERT
Because portable siege weapons require coordination,
operating one requires following a crew leader. The rest of
the crew must Ready an action to be taken when the crew
leader calls to attack with the siege weapon. The siege
weapon’s special activity lists what action they need to
Ready. For example, all of the crew operating a battering
ram—except the crew leader—need to Ready to Stride.
Each portable siege weapon has a special activity the
crew leader can take if all the rest of the crew have Readied
the necessary action. The number of actions it requires
and the other specifics can vary greatly depending on
what it takes to operate the weapon. It typically requires
the crew leader to make a Strike.
STRIKING
A Strike with a siege weapon uses the crew leader’s
attack bonus. The siege weapon’s Proficiency entry
73
73

PAGE 75
================================================================================

indicates the weapon category for the siege weapon. The
crew leader rolls an attack roll against the target. Any
bonuses or penalties the crew leader is taking apply to the
attack roll. See the sidebar above for more on how attack
abilities work with portable siege weapons.
BULK
A portable siege weapon has a Bulk entry. This is
primarily used when someone is carrying the portable
siege weapon around. When it’s being used by a crew,
this Bulk is distributed among them as they see fit, and
it’s usually not worth tracking the Bulk unless they’re
already heavily loaded. If characters try to have more
than one of them carry the portable siege weapon when
it’s not being used (dragging it around a dungeon, for
example), this is cumbersome, and they’re encumbered
due to the challenge of constantly coordinating their
movement.
Siege Weapon Statistics
A siege weapon uses the following stat block format.
An individual siege weapon might omit some of these
sections, especially a portable siege weapon.
SIEGE WEAPON NAME

OTHER TRAITS
Price This entry lists the siege weapon’s Price; Ammunition
If the siege weapon requires special ammunition, the
ammunition’s name appears here, along with the Price and
Bulk of each piece.
Usage This entry shows whether the siege weapon is mounted
or held. The number of hands required for a held siege
weapon reflects how many the entire crew needs to use to
operate the weapon; Bulk A portable siege weapon has Bulk;
Space A mounted siege weapon has this entry to indicate
its dimensions, not including any creatures crewing it.
Crew The number of creatures needed to operate the siege
weapon is listed here. If additional creatures can assist,
there’s a second number to indicate the maximum number
that’s practical. For instance, “4 to 8” indicates the weapon
can’t be operated by fewer than four creatures, and that no
more than eight creatures total can crew the weapon at a
time; Proficiency This entry shows the proficiency required
to use your class DC when Launching a mounted weapon
(see the Launch action) or the proficiency used for your
attack roll with a portable siege weapon.
AC The siege weapon’s AC. This section appears only if the siege
weapon can normally be attacked and is more typical of
mounted siege weapons; Saving Throws The siege weapon’s
saves, which typically include only Fortitude and Reflex.
Hardness The siege weapon’s hardness; HP The siege weapon’s
Hit Points, with its Broken Threshold in parentheses;
Immunities The siege weapon’s immunities; Weaknesses
The siege weapon’s weaknesses, if any; Resistances The
siege weapon’s resistances, if any.
Speed This is the maximum Speed you can move the mounted
siege weapon using the Move Siege Weapon activity.
The description of the siege weapon.
Aim The entry for Aim shows the distance a creature can move
the aim by taking this activity and the minimum distance
away from the siege weapon the aim can be placed.
Load This entry shows how many actions the Load activity
takes and how many times this must be done to finish
Loading the weapon.
Launch This gives the specifics of the Launch action, including
the traits, damage, size and shape of the area, and default DC.

PORTABLE
Usage portable, held in 12 hands; Bulk 20
Crew 6; Proficiency martial
Simple but powerful, a battering ram is a full tree stripped of
limbs with one end clad in iron, often shaped like a ram’s head.
Large handles are affixed to the sides so it can be hefted and
carried by a crew.
SIEGE WEAPONS VS. NORMAL WEAPONS
Many of the benefits that apply to standard weapons—
daggers, bows, battleaxes, and the like—don’t work
on siege weapons. They’re simply too different in form
and function. The GM might allow using them in certain
circumstances, but this is fairly rare.
Character abilities that affect their attacks might work
with portable siege weapons. For example, a battering
ram might get the benefit of a character’s bonuses that
apply to attacks with two-handed weapons. The GM can
determine what’s reasonable and what’s not. Because
siege weapons require special actions to operate, a
character can’t use their special actions with them. Sorry,
no Attacks of Opportunity with a battering ram!

BUILDING SIEGE WEAPONS
Just like other items, building a siege weapon requires
using the Craft activity. However, due to the size, it
typically takes more than one person to prepare some of
the materials (such as felling tall trees and working them
to create a trebuchet arm) and assemble the weapon.
You typically need a number of workers equal to the
minimum crew size for the siege weapon to complete it
in the standard amount of time. It can take much longer
or even be impossible for a smaller team or individual.
Due to their specific uses, you might be able to use
Engineering Lore or Warfare Lore instead of the Crafting
skill when you Craft a siege weapon. The GM determines
whether you can—some strange or more complex engines
might not be constructible with Warfare Lore.
DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING
A mounted siege weapon without a Speed must be
disassembled to be moved, then reassembled in its new
location. The GM determines how long this takes, but it’s
typically 1 day or half a day of downtime to disassemble
a siege weapon and 1 to 2 days to rebuild it. As with
building a siege weapon, you need a larger crew to
disassemble or reassemble a siege weapon at full speed.

SIEGE TOWERS
A siege tower uses the vehicle rules from page 174 of
the Gamemastery Guide. The siege tower uses pushed
propulsion, which uses the same rules as pulled. The
helepolis uses both pushed propulsion and turned
propulsion to turn a capstan. Turned propulsion uses the
same rules as rowed propulsion.

Tiered A helepolis has six levels. The crew operate at
the bottom tier, turning a giant capstan. There’s room
remaining on that tier for up to six passengers (enough
for a full heavy ballista siege crew; see Weaponry). Each
of the remaining five levels carries up to 60 passengers.
The tiers are specifically meant to be protective and give
those within the helepolis greater cover (or standard
cover if the helepolis is broken). A massive ladder runs
diagonally through the center of the helepolis, from the
front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier. The
ladder is wide enough for two crew or passengers to
climb simultaneously.
Weaponry The siege tower is loaded to the brim with siege
weapons—typically bristling with heavy ballistas on its
first and second tiers and ballistas on its third, fourth,
and fifth. The Price of these weapons is included in that
of the helepolis. When building a helepolis, you can
choose to replace any of these with other siege weapons
with a lower Price. If you want a more expensive siege
weapon, you must Craft it separately. Because of the
helepolis’s structure, any siege weapon in it must launch
its payload straight ahead. For instance, a ballista or
springald could function in a helepolis, but not a catapult
or trebuchet. Passengers of the helepolis can crew these
siege weapons.

7-foot ladder.
The siege tower has a corvus at its highest tier: a
vertical bridge that can be lowered to allow creatures
to cross gaps. Lowering the corvus takes a total of
3 Interact actions. Moving the siege tower while the
corvus is lowered is highly dangerous, especially for
anyone on the corvus. When it’s open, creatures in the
top tier don’t have cover from the side with the corvus,
and creatures on the lowered corvus don’t have cover
except from below.
DISABLING SIEGE WEAPONS
Disable a Device can be used to deactivate most siege
weapons that have complex moving parts. This typically
doesn’t require thieves’ tools, takes one success, and uses
the standard DC for the item level of the siege weapon.

SNARES AND HAZARDS
New innovations bring about progress, but not all
progress makes the world a better place. While some
innovators are focused on lessening toil and providing
free time to pursue passions and pleasures, others are
less altruistic. Creators of a more devious bent often
channel their imagination toward the invention of
deadlier, more cunning traps. Below are just some of the
latest advances in their perilous craft.
Snares
The following snares take advantage of various
technological advances to terrifying and lethal effects.
They otherwise work like any other snares.
ACID SPITTER
SNARE 4
UNCOMMON
ACID
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 15 gp
This tin clockwork lizard is activated when a creature moves
adjacent to it, at which point it spits out a glob of acid. The
target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or take
3d6 acid damage.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes full damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and 5 persistent acid
damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and 10
persistent acid damage.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is knocked
prone and immobilized for 1 round (Escape DC 28).
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is knocked

CLOCKWORK CHIRPER
SNARE 3
UNCOMMON
AUDITORY CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 8 gp
This simple clockwork bird is no larger than a sparrow,
designed to be wound up and perched on a tree branch or
ledge. The Tiny clockwork remains immobile and silent until a
Small or larger creature enters the square beneath its perch,
at which point it springs into action. Once activated, it flies
around making a loud chirping sound that can be heard up
to 500 feet away. The bird then follows the creature that
activated it for up to one hour or until it is destroyed, doing
its best to stay just above the creature and out of reach,
and continuing its string of loud chirps. The bird is an object
with a Speed 10 feet, and a fly Speed of 25 feet. It has AC 15,
Hardness 5, HP 10 (BT 5) and object immunities. Once broken,
it can no longer fly. It can’t attack or otherwise damage other
creatures. After an hour has passed after its activation, the
clockwork chirper falls into a pile of useless components.
CLOCKWORK MONKEY
SNARE 2
UNCOMMON
AUDITORY CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 5 gp
These cute and unassuming toy monkeys are often dressed in
loud clothing and carry a percussion instrument. It’s activated
once a creature moves adjacent to the square it sits in, at
which point it leaps on the creature, scurrying about on its
agile hind legs while it pounds on its instrument, riding the
creature and raising a racket. The creature being assaulted by
the monkey must find a way to escape its agitator either via
flinging the monkey off with the Escape action (DC 18) or by
breaking the monkey. The monkey has AC 19, Hardness 2, HP
10 (BT 5) and object immunities.

Price 9,000 gp
This modified Stasian coil of metal and glass stands about
three feet tall. It activates when at least three creatures are
within 20 feet of it, or if at least one creature stays within
20 feet of it for more than 1 round. It then lashes out with a
torrent of electrical energy dealing 7d12 electricity damage
to all creatures within 20 feet of it. Due to the fact that it
doesn’t trigger immediately when a creature enters its square,
abilities like Surprise Snare (Advanced
Player’s Guide 194) don’t work with
a death coil. Creatures within that
area must attempt a DC 43 Fortitude
saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is
unaffected.
Success The creature takes half

Failure The creature takes full damage
and is stunned 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage
is stunned 4.

This snare uses clockwork stressed almost to the breaking
point, which activates with a powerful explosion that deals
3d8 piercing damage to the first creature entering the snare’s
square. The creature must attempt a DC 19 Reflex saving
throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and 3 persistent bleed

Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and 6
persistent bleed damage.
FLAME DRAKE SNARE
SNARE 5
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
CONSUMABLE
FIRE
MECHANICAL SNARE
TRAP
Price 25 gp
The snare takes the form of a Tiny, drake‑like
clockwork toy. When a creature enters
its square the snare activates, causing the
drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15-foot cone in
the direction from which the creature entered.
For instance, if a creature entered the square
coming from the east, the cone would
point east, to hit any allies behind the
triggering creature. Those within the
cone must succeed a DC 19 basic Reflex
save or take 6d6 fire damage. After spitting its fire,
the snare falls apart.
DANGEROUS TOYS
A fair number of clockwork snares take the form of toys
and curiosities. In fact, many were initially developed
by enterprising toymakers who sought to create an
interesting toy and accidentally invented something with
lethal potential. Pranksters, criminals, revolutionaries,
and even other inventors then sought out these designs,
made improvements, and unleashed them as snares.
Devious kobolds and gnomes in particular take great joy
in the use of their deadly little “gifts,” and the worst of
them are always looking for new innocuous disguises for
their dangerous playthings.
It’s rumored that various toymakers in Absalom
meet at least once a season in an undisclosed location
in the city to demonstrate their new designs to various
creators of snares and sell their base formulas to the
highest bidders. Once sold, these designs are repurposed
into destructive snares. The only restrictions toymakers
place on these illicit auctions are that their formulas
can’t be used to fabricate actual toys, and the outward
appearances of the snares must be substantially different
from the toys on which the mechanisms are based.

The snare takes the form of a Tiny frost worm clockwork
toy. When a creature enters its square, the snare activates,
causing the worm to let loose a 30-foot line of frost in the
direction from which the creature entered the square. For
instance, if a creature entered the square coming from
the south, the worm would shoot the line south, to hit
any allies of the triggering creature. Those within the line
must succeed a DC 25 basic Reflex save or take 10d6 cold
damage. After spitting its frost, the snare falls apart.

STRANGE NEW METHODS
Many inventors’ creations seem to defy reality. This
is made possible by their constant scientific study of
the various monumental powers that manifest upon
Golarion. While wizards have their formulas, clerics
their rituals, and occult casters their strange secrets,
inventors search for what they call the hidden laws of
reality. They believe mundane reality, untouched by the
mysteries of magic, has its own set of laws that are
for the most part unknown. For example, what makes
electricity choose its exact crackling path? It must
follow some kind of law.
Exactly what these laws are and how they should
be explained is a matter of debate. Many inventors
continue practices common to alchemists, where
they codify their research with strange symbols and
secret codes, believing the best way to protect their
craft, prestige, secrets, and income is to avoid sharing
their wildest theories with others. But there are more
openminded individuals, usually living in cosmopolitan
centers, who think sharing their secrets and having
peers assess their methods of research will benefit the
people of their kingdom, perhaps even the world. They
believe collaboration will lead to better explanations
and answers to the mysteries of these natural laws.
And while these naturalist societies are small and
secluded, most of their members believe that they and
those like them are on the right track toward solving
the mysteries of the multiverse. While wizards and
other academic spellcasters appreciate their rigor, they
believe the idea of separating the laws of mundane
reality from magic is an absurd and pointless constraint,
especially given that magical essences underpin the
very fabric of reality. For their part, naturalists believe
these spellcasters are missing the point.

triggering creature, Striding up to 50 feet, then roll initiative.
Routine (9 actions) Each of the mannequins uses three of
the haunt’s actions on each turn, and the haunt loses
three actions each turn for every disabled or destroyed
mannequin. Each mannequin uses its first action to Stride
up to 50 feet and its remaining two actions to make
clockwork fist Strikes. Each has its own separate multiple
attack penalty.
Melee [one-action] clockwork fist +29, Damage 2d10+18 bludgeoning
Reset The haunt deactivates after it has no target creatures
and resets, usually over the course of 1 round, as the
mannequins move to their original positions. If a mannequin
is more than 150 feet from its original position, the haunt
takes longer to reset, as the mannequin moves back 150
feet each round.
TINY SNARE, BIG EXPLOSION
While most snares take the form of large, carefully
hidden contraptions, some of the snares in this section
resemble tiny clockwork toys or other small objects
that pack a hidden punch. Often whimsical and strange,
these tiny snares might even be fun to play with if
they weren’t dangerous. Gnomes, goblins, kobolds, and
other small creatures take an almost perverse delight
in using these diminutive snares to shock, burn, or
damage any larger folks who make the mistake of
believing that small humanoids are easy pickings.
There is a fine line between legitimate defense and the
machinations of a malicious prankster, however. Many
times, the users of such snares blur those lines out of
schadenfreude or exuberance. Those who adventure
with snarecrafters and trapsmiths are advised to reach
an understanding or at least have a serious conversation
with them, to ensure that their cunning companion
respects their allies’ personal boundaries.

STASIAN TECH
Stasian technology uses electricity to produce strange
and unpredictable effects, sometimes, but not always, in
conjunction with magic. The Stasian coils necessary to
power such technology are limited and hard to acquire,
making Stasian technological items extremely rare.
However, slow imports and smuggling into Ustalav have
led to development of items based upon the technology,
making these items easier to acquire than other rare
items, if one knows the right places to look. You can find
more information on Ustalavic innovations using Stasian
technology on page 225.
Technological Items
The following items utilize Stasian technology alongside
or in place of magical components.

RARE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Price 970 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx,
supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres
with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body
comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze
electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic
energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge
that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create
a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse’s
final memories. Galvanic mortal coils are even rarer than other
galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Effect You
drive the coil into a living creature that has 0 HP while
attaching the other end to yourself, in order to damage
their heart and possibly siphon their life force. The galvanic
mortal coil casts death knell on the creature (DC 27).

This miniature Stasian coil talisman emits small sparks when
jostled. It uses a combination of Stasian technology and
evocation magic to erupt in electricity when discharged.
When you activate the coil, the foe takes 2d12 electricity
damage (DC 27 basic Reflex save). On a failed save, the foe is
flat-footed until the start of its next turn.
SPIRIT-SINGER
ITEM 5+
RARE
Etheric spirit-singers create an eerie spectral sound based on
the presence of spiritual essence and other ethereal
energies. All spirit-singers can be used as musical
instruments by manipulating the sensitivity to
ethereal energies. However, they have an even
greater benefit in areas heavy with spiritual
essence. When played in the presence of a
significant spiritual disturbance, such as
a haunt or an incorporeal undead, a
spirit‑singer grants you a +1 item
bonus to Performance checks. While
playing a spirit-singer, you also
gain a +1 item bonus to checks to
detect a haunt or incorporeal undead,
and you can roll a check to notice a haunt
even if you aren’t actively Searching for it, due to
the distortions of the spirit-singer’s music. A haunt or
incorporeal undead that is intelligent enough to notice
the effects it is having on the spirit-singer’s music and that
can’t otherwise communicate with the living might choose
to use the spirit-singer to do so if it wishes. For instance, it
could try to guide the spirit-singer player towards a location
by creating distortions in that direction or, if it understands
language, it could try to answer questions by creating one
distortion for yes and two distortions for no. Unless stated
otherwise in its usage entry, a spirit-singer functions like
a heavy musical instrument; rather than carrying it, the
musician places the spirit‑singer in a particular position and
uses both hands to play.

This spirit-singer is fine-tuned to the
point that you can analyze its song more
intricately. Increase the item bonus to
Performance checks near spiritual
disturbances, and the item bonus to

VIOLET RAY
ITEM 12
RARE
Price 1,893 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
One of the many wondrous devices brought into the world
by Stasian technology is the seemingly miraculous violet ray.
Physicians claim it anything from headaches to heartburn, or
nausea to deafness, all with an easy and painless treatment.
The device is a glass vacuum with an insulated handle
connected to a small Stasian coil. When powered, the glass
tube fills with purple light and becomes warm to the
touch. Pressing the tube to one’s body is
said to increase blood flow, eliminate
toxins, and many other beneficial
effects. A violet ray functions as a set
of healer’s tools and provides a +2 item
bonus to Medicine checks to Administer
First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or
Treat Wounds.
Activate [three-actions] Interact; Frequency once
per day; Effect You apply the violet ray
to an adjacent creature and attempt to
counteract the blinded, clumsy, confused,
deafened, drained, enfeebled, sickened, or
stupefied condition with a counteract level of 6 and
a counteract modifier of +22, using the source of the
condition to determine the condition’s counteract level
and DC. If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect
and you don’t remove that effect, the condition returns
after 1 minute. Each use of this ability can only counteract
a single condition.

Weaponry might be one of the flashiest forms of
clockwork technology, but it’s far from the only one.
For every inventor who devotes his labors to creating
clockwork instruments of destruction, there are ten
others who focus on creating devices which average
people can use to make life easier and more enjoyable.
These machines, built for society rather than
adventurers, are arguably more impactful than even
the most powerful weapon, for they affect thousands of
lives every day. Major trade centers reap these rewards
as inventors from far-flung lands meet and share their
methods and designs. As innovations from different
regions mingle, each breakthrough enables the next at a
quicker rate.
AQUARIUM LAMP
ITEM 8
UNCOMMON
ELECTRICITY
LIGHT
Bulk 20
Price 1,500 gp
Activate [one-action] Interact
The aquarium lamp is a combination light source and exotic
animal aquarium, intended to provide rich nobles amusement
and illumination. It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet
wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by
two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around
the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the
ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical
coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass
tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while
a number of animals belonging to species considered to be
the eels’ natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks.
With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller
tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank.
Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal,
using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this
happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy
into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send
the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result
produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though
it were midday.
This device is an expression of a recent trend among
certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their

manors’ interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious
decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as
“tacky” and “unrefined.” If a noble in such company wishes
not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration
adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The
aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race,
and it’s already proven popular with its target market.
When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in
a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each
activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use,
and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey
animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled,
though electric eels usually need feeding only once per
day, and won’t go after the prey if they’re all full. While
electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers
and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they
can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they
are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving
tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of
which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the
lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years
if kept well-fed.
CLOCKWORK BOOKSHELF
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 15 gp
This device was originally created by an inventor who had
way more books they wanted to access than available wall
space to store them. Each of the bookshelf’s six levels is
actually loaded with a pair of shelves instead of a single
shelf. A simple switch on the side of the bookshelf flips the
corresponding shelf to the other side, revealing any books
stored in the paired shelf. While this makes the clockwork
bookshelf a little deeper than a normal bookshelf, in order
to fit both shelves, it effectively allows you to store twice
as many books using the same amount of wall space. Those
who wish to keep volumes hidden from visitors (or perhaps
stow a weapon or potion within a false book) often load the
hidden shelf first, then switch to the second shelf lined with
more respectable volumes.
CLOCKWORK BOX PACKER
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 50 gp
This handy clockwork device is too expensive for most
warehouses and shipping docks to make use of it, but some
nobles have purchased the item for their staff as a status
symbol, and merchants who are in the shipping trade can
afford to slowly reap the benefits of its usage. It takes 1
minute to wind a clockwork box packer; after which, it can
function for up to 1 hour.
You can indicate how high you want the clockwork
box packer to stack boxes and what the packing storage
dimensions are. Once packing instructions have been input,
you can load a crate onto the clockwork box packer, and it
begins its task. Once the box is stacked, the clockwork box
packer closes the box, if necessary, then ties a ribbon or cord
around it from a supply loaded into the clockwork box packer
in advance. Once the package is secure, the clockwork box
packer stacks it and then swivels back into position, ready
to accept another box. In this way, the clockwork device can
finish within minutes a packing job that might take humanoid
workers an hour.
CLOCKWORK DISGUISE
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Usage worn armor; Bulk 2
Price 200 gp
Sometimes, just disguising one’s face just isn’t convincing
enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement
regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For
example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they
must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers
stationed there—or else have a very good explanation for
their commander as to why they’re out of proper uniform!
The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such
awkward, potentially fatal confrontations.
The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected
to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user’s
torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with
several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide
variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are
arranged and connected, they can be made to look like
almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor,
though armor embellishments such as those worn by high-
ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement
process takes some time, but once it’s completed, the
user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a
clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate
arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards,
when the user flips a switch on the harness’s belt to one
of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect
as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired
preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up
to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use
a minimum of two: the one required for their current task,
and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the
first configuration is unnecessary.
Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration
requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can
have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time,
and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made
of metal.
The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following
stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:
AC Bonus +2; Dex Cap +3; Check Penalty –1; Strength 12;
Group plate
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect Transform the clockwork
disguise into any one current preset configuration of the
user’s choice.

CLOCKWORK DIVING SUIT
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
AIR
CLOCKWORK
WATER
Usage Worn; Bulk 4
Price 200 gp
The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that
allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time
without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional
magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a
clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better
protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for
characters who prefer more protection. However, they also
come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits
circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed
suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped
bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe.
A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user
to see what’s going on in front of them.
The suit’s rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the
user’s range of movement and keeps them from moving
faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for
this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the
suit’s back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system
and separate air bladder; it’s activated with a simple pull of a
lever on the suit’s belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum
system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder
sprays the water out and propels the user short distances.
This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface
without walking to shore—it’s too heavy to float on its own.
Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back
to the water’s floor.
The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of
operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up
to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of
air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal.
This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an
area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process
that takes 10 minutes to complete.
The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the
following stats:
AC Bonus +4; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty –4; Speed Penalty
–15 ft; Strength 18
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect The diving suit shoots out a
water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight
line. The distance of this movement is unaffected by your
swim Speed, if you have one, or the armor’s Speed penalty.
However, difficult terrain, such as the difficult terrain for
moving up or down or moving against a current, still slows
this movement.

CLOCKWORK MEGAPHONE
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 1
Price 15 gp
A clockwork megaphone uses cunning clockwork gears to
adjust the shape and angle of the cone within the megaphone,
allowing you to raise or lower the volume, widen or contract
the angle in which you project your voice, or both at the same
time. This makes a clockwork megaphone far more useful
than an ordinary megaphone for situations where you want
to make sure that everyone in a particular venue or location
can hear you without being so loud that your voice comes
across as a painful shout. It takes 1 minute to wind up a
clockwork megaphone, which allows it to remain active for up
to 1 hour of adjustments, only counting the time you change
the megaphone’s settings, not the time you spend speaking.
Since it automatically enters standby mode when not in use,
this typically means you don’t have to wind up the clockwork
megaphone for months, or even years, depending on how
often you adjust the settings each day.
DAY GOGGLES
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
Price 30 gp
Usage worn eyepiece; Bulk L
The darkened lenses of these goggles protect sensitive eyes
from bright light but make seeing in the dark more difficult.
While wearing day goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to
saving throws against visual light effects. However, while
wearing the goggles, you take a –2 item penalty to visual
Perception checks and you treat areas of bright light as dim
light and areas of dim light as darkness for the purpose of
whether you can see. While this is normally a disadvantage,
if you have light blindness, you aren’t dazzled in bright light
as long as you continue wearing the day goggles, since to
your eyes, there is only dim light. You can wear the goggles
around your neck or on your forehead, granting no benefits,
but allowing you to move them over your eyes with a single
Interact action, without having to withdraw them first.
ELECTROCABLE
ITEM 3

ELECTRICITY
FIRE
Price 45 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
This footlong length of conductive cable is capped on both
ends by grounded handles containing Stasian coils. These coils
can be turned on or off as a single action. While on, the coils
electrify the cable, dealing 1d6 electricity and 1d6 fire damage
in a thin precise line to anything the cable touches, though the
cable is too unwieldy to use as a weapon. Electrocables are
typically used to “cut” a thin straight line through metal. They
ignore 10 points of a metal object’s hardness.

HOLY STEAM BALL
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
DIVINE
ENCHANTMENT

GOOD
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Price 30 gp; 2 gp per refill
Activate [one-action] Interact
The holy steam ball is an odd-looking device that’s
nevertheless effective at reinforcing its user’s mind against
fiendish control. It’s a hollow black-rubber ball with small,
flexible twin tubes sticking out from its center. Sealed within
the rubber ball is vapor made from a mixture of evaporated
holy water and a special type of incense smoke. The tube’s
twin prongs are placed into the user’s nostrils, after which
the user squeezes the rubber ball to activate the device,
forcing the vapor into the user’s body through their nose.
The holy power contained within the vapor strengthens the
user’s will against creatures that are weak to holy water,
making it tougher for malevolent creatures to subvert the
user’s mind.
When the holy steam ball was first introduced in Mendev
fifty years ago, few trusted it’s efficacy. The nation had seen
many charlatans peddle so-called “anti-demon” products, and
most thought this was no different. Only when soldiers of the
Mendevian Crusades used the ball and personally testified
to its effectiveness did suspicion gave way to enthusiastic
use. Nobody remembers who first invented the holy steam
ball; they’re likely lost to history because most initially
thought it was a scam. After receiving endorsement from
the Mendevian Crusade, a team of alchemists and inventors
were able to determine the vapor’s exact composition and
mass produce them. The holy steam ball’s highly specialized
purpose kept it from widespread use outside of the nations
that once bordered the Worldwound. Yet with the return of
the Whispering Tyrant in the past few years, the growing
undead threat presents a new opportunity for more citizens
to use holy steam balls for protection against the mind
control powers of vampires and other undead.

LIGHT WRITER
ITEM 6
RARE
CLOCKWORK
EVOCATION
LIGHT
Bulk 2
Price 200 gp; 3 gp for 10 metal plates
The light writer is a cutting edge invention,
first created in Absalom in late 4721,
combining magic and clockwork
innovation to allow its operator to
create a true-to-life, monochromatic
portrait of people or a scene over the
course of 20 minutes of exposure.
It consists of two flat metal squares,
one larger than the other, connected
by a tube of leather similar to that found
on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of
the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The
larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on
the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick
connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached
to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on
the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation,
magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady
light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and
projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of
the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed,
allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner
desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be
perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from
appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image
of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature
to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike
blurring of the final image.
MECHANICAL TORCH
ITEM 1
CLOCKWORK
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Powered by electricity, you can turn a mechanical torch on
and off by toggling a lever on the torch with an Interact
action. When active, the torch sheds bright light in either
a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet) or a
40‑foot cone (and dim light to the next 40 feet). Changing
this area requires a single Interact action to flip a switch. The
torch carries sufficient charge to operate for ten minutes.
You can recharge the torch in 1 minute via an integrated
crank-charging mechanism, turning the clockwork gears
and generating sparks to power the torch, though doing so
requires two hands.
NIGHTBREEZE MACHINE
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
AIR
CLOCKWORK
Bulk 4
Price 125 gp
The nightbreeze machine can turn a scorching hot room into
a comfortable one with just the pull of a lever. Its outer shell
is a brass cube half as tall as the average human
that houses a series of flat metal “blades” in
a circular arrangement. When placed on
a flat surface, a creature within reach can
Interact to flip the lever, turning the machine
on. When the machine is active, the blades
begin to spin rapidly, setting the air in
the room into motion, which cools off
the room’s inhabitants. A front-mounted
metal grate prevents anyone from coming
into accidental contact with the spinning
blades without impeding airflow.
The nightbreeze machine was recently
commissioned by Malduoni, Keeper of the
First Law, leader of the nation of Rahadoum.
He tasked the country’s brightest inventors with creating
devices that would, in his words, “Ensure that no mortal
need fear death from the desert heat.” This machine was the
first creation to come out of this consolidated engineering
effort, but it won’t be the last.
A nightbreeze machine can affect an enclosed area of
no more than 50 feet by 50 feet and has negligible effect
when used in a larger enclosed area or outside. While
active, it reduces the effects of severe heat by one step to
mild heat, and reduces extreme heat to severe heat (Core
Rulebook page 518). A nightbreeze machine isn’t powerful
enough to reduce the effects of incredible heat, though
fortunately such heat isn’t found naturally in the deserts
of Rahadoum. A nightbreeze machine runs for 8 hours,
after which it must be wound in a process that takes 10
minutes to complete. The 8 hours of activity don’t have to
be consecutive.

dangerous magical symbols inscribed upon it, incriminating
legal documents, or just simply paper waste, sometimes you
just need to make sure a document is completely destroyed
in a way that makes it nearly impossible to read afterwards.
Enter the paper shredder, a clockwork device that performs
exactly this function.
With 1 minute of wind-up, a paper shredder can function
for up to 1 hour of shredding, and it automatically enters
standby mode when not in use, meaning the device can
typically go for weeks between wind-ups unless you shred
an exceptionally large volume of paper.
Setting a piece of paper or parchment into the paper
shredder takes a single Interact action, which means you
can shred up to three pages of paper or parchment each
round. If the page is longer than normal, it takes longer
to shred, as determined by the GM. Additionally, only
one person can use the shredder each round, limiting
it to shredding three pages per round regardless of how
many people are available to feed paper into it. The paper
shredders rips and tears the paper or parchment apart into
tiny disjointed strips. This is typically sufficient to destroy
glyphs of warding and other similar dangerous magical
traps on the paper, though the GM might determine that
particularly resilient magical traps find some way to survive
their shredding. If the paper is magically protected or
otherwise has more Hardness than a normal sheet of paper
or parchment, the shredder can’t shred it. After churning
such hardened paper for 1 round, the shredder spits it back
out without harming the shredder. This prevents shredding
any other paper during that round.
PRINTING PRESS
ITEM 9
RARE
CLOCKWORK
Price 600 gp
Bulk 20
The printing press is a revolutionary machine that combines
movable type with a mechanical inking system and screw
press, allowing for the mass production of large volumes
of text. Using the press, a worker can produce up to 3,600
identical pages per day. In order to use the printing press,
you must first set the type for the page you want to print.
Time required to set type varies depending on the number
of characters used; from 1 hour for small pages with brief
text, to 8 hours for a full-sized normal page of text, though
extreme examples may be outside this range. When you
prepare a page for printing, you can include engraved
images in addition to text. No magical properties of text are
transferred in the printing process, so it cannot be used to
mass-produce magical scrolls, glyphs of warding, or similar
spells or magic items.
STEAMFLIGHT PACK
ITEM 15

The steamflight pack allows its user to fly without using
magic or wings. Each steamflight pack looks like a large
brass backpack with two large nozzles mounted on the
sides pointing downward. It also features metal arms
reaching around the front that terminate in handles with
activation buttons on them. When the user holds down an
activation button, a complex series of mechanisms pumps
water from the large tank in the backpack and releases it
through the nozzles as powerful jets of steam, enabling the
user to fly short distances. Tilting the handle adjusts the
nozzles’ angles, allowing the user to control the direction
of their flight.
When active, the steamflight pack gives the user a fly

This hefty winch is powered by a small steam engine and
includes a 100 ft. length of steel cable, which enables you
to haul a heavier load than you could with a hand cranked
winch or comealong (Lost Omens Pathfinder Society Guide
114). A steam winch allows you to slowly pull a heavy load
(usually up to 50 Bulk) along a flat surface or up and down
a vertical expanse.
Attaching a steam winch to a device takes three Interact

Bulk Limit: A wheelchair is strong enough to support
you and any amount of Bulk you could typically hold
or carry (Core Rulebook 272). Sum up the Bulk of all
the items you are wearing, carrying, and stowing on your
wheelchair. You take the usual consequences when there
is too much Bulk on you and your wheelchair: if there is
more than 5 + your Strength modifier, you’re encumbered,
and you and your wheelchair can’t hold or carry more
than 10 + your Strength modifier. The wheelchair’s own
Bulk does not count against your Bulk limit while riding
in the wheelchair; it’s listed in case you need to carry the
wheelchair separately.
Frame: A wheelchair is typically made from common
materials like wood. It can also be made from other
materials such as steel, or rarer materials like mithral. The
wheelchairs presented in this section are assumed to be
made from durable wood.
Magic: The wheelchair is considered an extension
of yourself. Spells or abilities that change your bodily
form are also applied to the chair and it transforms

with you so long as you’re using it. You can choose
what appearance this has. For example, when you
transform with wild shape, you can choose to have full
mobility of your limbs or have the chair transform to
become a wheelchair appropriate for that shape, such as
wheelchair harnesses for dogs.
Movement: While using a chair, you Stride at your
normal Speed (the Speed listed for your ancestry, with any
additional bonuses, penalties, and adjustments applied).
You propel a wheelchair by using the handrims. You can
propel the wheelchair even while holding something in
your hands, but not if you’ve restrained or otherwise
unable to move your hands freely. You are still affected
by difficult terrain and other terrain features, and any
effect that would immobilize you, give a penalty to your
Speeds, and so on based on entangling or hindering with
your legs applies to the wheelchair as well. You can use
all of your actions while in a wheelchair. The impulse
control add-on allows you to direct a wheelchair with
your fingers or nerve impulses instead.
Quick-Righting: If the chair is tipped or you are
knocked prone while in the chair, you can right yourself
using the Stand action, though in this case you are righting
the wheelchair instead. An ally can use an Interact action
to help right you, allowing you to Stand as a free action
triggered by their Interact action.
WHEELCHAIR TYPES
The following are some of the wheelchair types seen
throughout Golarion.
BASIC CHAIR
ITEM 0
Price 5 sp
Bulk 2
This common wheelchair is ideal for everyday use, but isn’t
designed for adventuring. Basic chairs are most common
among non-adventurers.
TRAVELER’S CHAIR
ITEM 1
Price 5 gp
Bulk 3
This wheelchair is tailored for adventures and travels. The
design is sleek and fashionable to provide excellent comfort
and support. A traveler’s chair has small mechanisms, either
made from interlocking wood pieces, clockwork, or other
devices, that allow the chair to traverse up or down stairs
without any additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still
difficult terrain, just like for other characters), and move
through other such environments that adventurers and
travelers encounter without any additional difficulty, such as
ladders and uneven ground.
Magical Wheelchairs
The following wheelchairs use technology and magic for
incredible effects, in addition to the basic benefits granted
from the base wheelchair (typically a traveler’s chair).

VEHICLES
It’s unsurprising that the advances in clockwork technology and the introduction of rare
Stasian and steam technology have led to the creation of many new and revolutionary
vehicles across the world. Some, like the apparatus of the octopus, have existed for
millennia but only recently rose to more wide-spread prevalence.
Vehicles
Included in this section are an array of new vehicles for
use in your game, each of which uses the new technology
described in this chapter, especially clockwork, steam,
and Stasian technology. The full rules for vehicles can
be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide starting
on page 174.
AUTOMATED CYCLE
VEHICLE 1
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 50 gp
This clockwork cycle provides most of its mobility via cogs
and gears, which allow the cycle to move at a reasonable
pace without the need for significant pedaling effort on
the part of the pilot. The pilot uses a system of pedals and
steering to control the speed and direction of the vehicle.
The vehicle comes equipped with two sidecars, one on each
side of the pilot.
Space 5 feet long, 10 feet wide, 3 feet high
Crew 1 pilot; Passengers 2

ADAPTABLE PADDLEBOAT
VEHICLE 2
UNCOMMON
MEDIUM
Price 110 gp
This amphibious clockwork boat moves through the water
using clockwork waterwheels to keep a slow, consistent
pace. When necessary, the boat uses ingenious clockwork to
reposition the waterwheels and transform them into wheels
suitable for land.

the clockwork components to transform the adaptable
paddleboat’s waterwheels into wheels for rolling along
the ground. This grants the adaptable paddleboat Speed
20 feet and reduces its swim Speed to 5 feet. This
transformation lasts until the pilot disengages the wheels
by using this activity again.

CLUNKERJUNKER
VEHICLE 1
UNCOMMON
MEDIUM
Price 30 gp
A favorite of goblins, a clunkerjunker is essentially an
armored cart built out of junk that uses volatile flammable
chemicals, explosions, and alchemical reactions to propel
itself bumpily along. While the initial idea is impressive and
the cost of creating one is surprisingly low, these junkers,
unfortunately, have a strong tendency to malfunction, and
they’re always one bad bump away from disaster.

Speed 30 feet (alchemical)
Collision 2d6 (DC 15)
Fall Apart When this vehicle takes physical damage the pilot
must attempt a DC 11 flat check (or a DC 20 flat check
when it takes a critical hit). On a failure, the armored hull
fractures and the vehicle loses its Hardness and takes a –4
circumstance penalty to AC.
Smog (aura, fire) 10 feet. Whenever this vehicle is being
piloted, it continually emits a thin haze of smoke and
chemicals. Creatures in the aura (including the pilot and
passengers) take a –1 circumstance penalty to visual
Perception checks.
Volatile Flamethrower [three-actions] (fire) The pilot performs a
three‑action activity on their turn to vent alchemical fire
out the sides of this vehicle. This requires three flasks
of minor alchemist’s fire, which the pilot loads into the
vent as part of the activity. The pilot must then attempt
a DC 5 flat check. On a success, creatures adjacent to this
vehicle take 1d8 fire damage (DC 15 basic Reflex save). On
a failure, it backfires, dealing 1d8 fire damage to the pilot
and any passengers, with no save.
PROPULSION
The vehicles in this section use the following new means
of propulsion, in addition to the forms listed in the
Gamemastery Guide.
CLOCKWORK PROPULSION
Powered by the measured release of energy stored in
springs via winding, clockwork propulsion is a fragile
thing of mechanical beauty and wonderous engineering.
Clockwork vehicles can often be piloted with the
Crafting skill.
A clockwork vehicle must be wound to remain
operational. Clockwork vehicles have the Wind-Up
trait, with the specifics listed in its stat block under the
wind‑up ability.
For a clockwork vehicle to move or take other actions,
it must be wound by a creature using a unique key. This
takes the amount of time listed. Once wound, it remains
operational for the listed amount of time, after which
time it becomes inactive and immobile until it’s wound
again. Some clockwork vehicles’ abilities require them
to spend some of their remaining operational time.
They can’t spend more than they have and shut down
immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it’s
unclear when a clockwork vehicle was last wound, most
vehicles are re-wound approximately half-way through
their operating time.
A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode
by its pilot as a 3-action activity. Its operational time
doesn’t decrease in standby.
A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a
clockwork vehicle down (with a DC listed in the wind-up
entry). For each success, the clockwork vehicle loses 10
minutes of operational time. This can be done even if the
clockwork vehicle is in standby mode.
Broken clockwork vehicles have difficulty holding
energy. The first time each round a broken clockwork
vehicle moves, it must make a DC 5 flat check. On a
failure, it loses 10 minutes of operational time.
ELECTRICAL PROPULSION
Electrical power, whether the vehicle uses magical
electricity or the extremely rare new Stasian coil
technology to store electricity without magic, allows for
vehicles that make significantly less disturbance than
some other propulsion methods. Electrical vehicles can
often be piloted with the Crafting skill.

Steam Cloud Whenever the steam cart takes collision
damage, its engine expels a dense cloud of steam in
a 5-foot emanation. The steam cart and all creatures in
the steam become concealed, and creatures outside the
steam become concealed to creatures within it. The steam
dissipates in 1 round.
CLOCKWORK WAGON
VEHICLE 3
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 160 gp
A clockwork wagon is a slow, bulky wagon with cogs and
gears running all along its interior and exterior, allowing it
to pull about twice as much cargo as an ordinary wagon.
However, it has less passenger space than an ordinary cart.

SAND DIVER
VEHICLE 3
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 155 gp
A sand diver is a vaguely scorpion-shaped vehicle that uses
alchemical reactions to propel itself. The tail-like structure
acts as a heat sink and releases alchemical fumes behind the
diver as it burrows. Instead of pincers, it has two burrowing
mechanisms in front that allow it to dig through sand.
Space 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, 6 feet high

Speed 20 feet, burrow 10 feet (alchemical)
Collision 2d10 (DC 18)
Shard Trail A sand diver can only burrow through sand,
using the heat and flame from its alchemical core to slowly
dig its way through. The alchemical fumes left behind
become trapped belowground as it Burrows, temporarily
catalyzing fragments of sand into a glass‑like byproduct.
Creatures that Burrow through a space this vehicle has
Burrowed through within the last 24 hours take 1d12
piercing damage from the shards (DC 17 basic Fortitude
save). A creature that continues Burrowing through
a stretch of the same space the sand diver recently
Burrowed through must continue to attempt this save
the first time each round that it Burrows through the
shards.
Sluggish This vehicle must move twice its length for each
90-degree turn it makes.
STEAM TROLLEY

it to create a brilliant flash of light. All creatures in the
bright light from its glow aura must succeed at a DC 19
Fortitude save or be dazzled 1 minute. The firefly’s light
dims for 10 minutes, reducing its glow to 10 feet of dim
light, during which time it can’t use flash. Flash stops
working if the firefly is broken.
Glow (electricity, evocation, light, magical) Powered by magical
lightning, this vehicle sheds bright light within 20 feet, and
dim light for a further 20 feet.
Hover This vehicle is held aloft by rapidly spinning propellers
that enable it to hover 1 foot in the air. It is incapable of
flying any higher, and when the pilot stops the magic or
the vehicle breaks, it descends 1 foot to the ground.
CLOCKWORK HOPPER
VEHICLE 6

Continuous Track This vehicle
travels on a continuous band of
heavy treads driven by a series
of gears and wheels, enabling it
to travel over rugged land with
ease. Earth, rock, rubble, slopes,
and underbrush are not difficult
terrain to an ambling surveyor.
The ambling surveyor ignores difficult
terrain from earth, rock, rubble, slopes, and
underbrush, and greater difficult terrain caused by
those features is normal difficult terrain to the ambling
surveyor.
Sluggish This vehicle must move twice its length for each
90-degree turn it makes.
Survey (concentrate, divination, exploration, magical,
manipulate, visual) Requirements The ambling surveyor
is not in motion; Effect The pilot and crew release a
collection of six clockwork birds, which spend two hours
flying over the surrounding area within a 1-mile radius
around the ambling surveyor. Everything the birds see
is magically transmitted back to the ambling surveyor’s
crew as illusory images, which the crew must catalogue
in real-time if they want to use the information to fully
survey the area and create a map. After two hours, the
birds return. The birds use the base statistics of clockwork
spies (Bestiary 3 page 48) if they are attacked, or if their
Perception is important to determine what they can see,
although they only perform the Survey action and they
don’t have any of the other abilities of a clockwork
spy. Replacement birds cost 250
gp each.

TITANIC STOMPER
VEHICLE 15
RARE
GARGANTUAN
Price 19,000 gp
Among the most dangerous vehicles
created in Ustalav with a mix of
magic and the new Stasian technology, a
titanic stomper is shaped like a long sinuous lizard or
behir with carefully placed Stasian coils and eight big
stomping legs. Titanic stompers were meant to devastate the
armies of the undead. Only two exist, making them almost
unique, and the means to create more have been stymied,
as some of the crucial inventors were killed in the process
of attempting to design a follow-up technology, a smaller but
more powerful suit of mechanized armor called the
Grobelarch that ultimately went berserk and killed its
creators.

Bolt Blast [three-actions] Two crew members each
perform a three-action activity on
their turn to fire a line of lightning
at the end of the second character’s
turn. This line of lightning erupts from
the front of the titanic stomper at an angle of the crew
members’ choice and deals 5d12 electricity damage to each
creature in a 120-foot line (DC 34 basic Reflex save). The
Bolt Blast stops working if the titanic stomper is broken.
Electrical Absorption [reaction] Trigger The titanic stomper
is targeted by, or in the area of, an effect that deals

Quaking Step The ground shakes with every step a titanic
stomper takes. Whenever this vehicle moves, creatures
on the ground within 20 feet of its movement path
must attempt a DC 32 Reflex save. On a failure, they are
flat‑footed for 1 round, and on a critical failure, they’re
knocked prone.
CLOCKWORK CASTLE
VEHICLE 16
RARE
GARGANTUAN
Price 30,000 gp
While the name slightly overstates its size, nonetheless a
magical clockwork castle is a sizable mobile fortress built on
ten spiderlike clockwork legs, with three stories of palatial
accommodations within. Legends tell of a unique clockwork
castle massively larger even than this size, perhaps an artifact
in its own right.

Environmental
Protections
This
vehicle’s interior temperature is magically
maintained. Creatures inside this vehicle
are protected from severe cold, severe heat,
extreme cold, and extreme heat.
Luxurious Accommodations This vehicle contains a bridge,
engineering room, private sleeping quarters for up to 13
creatures, and four additional rooms (typically a dining
room, kitchen, lavatory, and meeting room).
Maneuverable This vehicle is mounted on ten spider-like legs
that enable it to turn swiftly, turn in place, and even move
backward. Each 90-degree turn made in less than a vehicle
length costs 5 extra feet of movement; so, for example, it
costs 10 feet of movement for the vehicle to turn around
and begin moving backward. This vehicle loses these
benefits when broken.
Skewering Step [three-actions] (attack) Two crew members each
perform a 3-action activity on their turn to skewer nearby
enemies with the clockwork castle’s legs. All creatures
under or adjacent to the vehicle at the end of the second
character’s turn take 7d8 piercing damage (DC 35 basic
Reflex save).
Weapon Mounts This vehicle has four rooftop weapon mounts;
one mount on each corner of the vehicle. At purchase, these
weapon mounts are initially empty. Installing or uninstalling
a weapon into a weapon mount requires 10 minutes, a
successful DC 35 Crafting check, and an appropriate
weapon. Three of these weapon mounts can be equipped
with ranged weapons, and the fourth can be equipped with
a ranged siege weapon of size Large or smaller.
VONTHOS’S GOLDEN BRIDGE
VEHICLE 17
UNIQUE
LARGE
Price 50,000 gp
Crafted by the wizard Vonthos as part of his bid to attempt
the Test of the Starstone in Absalom, this strange vehicle
is considered to be a magical and technological marvel.
Vonthos’s Golden Bridge is a flying sphere made out of a
throne surrounded by several clockwork rings covered in gold
and gems infused with powerful adaptive abjurations that
grant it unique abilities.

creatures. Each creature that begins its turn
within the aura must attempt a DC 36 Will
save; on a failure, the creature is fascinated and stupefied
2 for as long as it remains within the aura. A creature that
succeeds is temporarily immune for 1 hour. Each time
Prismatic Defense is activated, the area of Captivating
Wealth is reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour, to a minimum of
0 feet.
Protective Barrier While the swirling rings of the vehicle
don’t fully cover the pilot, they offer incredible protection,
magically maintaining the temperature within and ablating
physical attacks. The pilot is protected from severe cold,
severe heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. The pilot
also gains resistance 10 to all physical damage (except
adamantine).
Prismatic Defense [one-action] (abjuration, magical) The pilot harnesses
power from the magical gemstones hidden among this
vehicle’s extravagant embellishments to grant the vehicle
additional defenses. This vehicle gains resistance 20 to one
of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity,
fire, force, or sonic. This immunity lasts until Prismatic
Defense is next activated.

GUNS CHARACTERS
I never liked hurting people. As a shield marshal, I knew my duty and kept my arquebus,
Alessandra, in top condition. But if I had the choice, I would have been a spotter. I tried
not to think too much about all the monsters we put down.
When I retired, I took my pension, gun, and family away from it all. Bought a farm. Buried
Alessandra in a sealed box under an old tree. This far from Alkenstar, few even know what a
gun is. The ones who do aren’t the kind of people you want knowing you have one. At least,
that’s what I told myself. Believed it too, right up until the bandits took everything from me.
I don’t know how long I laid in that pool of blood. All I remember is the sounds of
screaming, the snarling faces, and the smell of smoke. When I woke up, the farm and my
family were gone. So I crawled. I crawled to that old tree and dug in the dirt with my
bare hands until I uncovered the chest. I fumbled open the clasp and found Alessandra,
wrapped in leather and treated with oil, my shield marshal uniform folded neatly
underneath. Didn’t fit my battered body as well as Alessandra fit my hands, but it’d do.
The last thing out of the chest was my bandolier, loaded with a dozen cartridges. Fired
the first one, just to make sure the powder hadn’t spoiled. Eleven shots left, but that was
fine. There were only nine bandits. I’d faced monsters, desperadoes, and even a mutant
dragon. Nine murderous fools weren’t going to stand a chance against me and Alessandra.
