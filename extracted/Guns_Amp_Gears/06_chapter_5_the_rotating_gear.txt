THE ROTATING GEAR
My adventure started years ago when I left the port of Goka. I would like to say it was my
curiosity that drew me away from the place of my birth. It is more accurate, however, if
I also mention that several bounty hunters sought me on warrants for piracy. Regardless,
my impending capture also served as my opportunity to seek new horizons, and I arranged
passage to Vudra with a talented smuggler from whom I bought my powder kegs.
The trek across that land was educational. Vudrani methods of mixing black powder are
different than the process I learned, and their formula seems more stable, if less potent.
I also discovered strange wonders imported from even farther west. Clockwork toys that
move about under their own power—what kind of society could have the excess to craft
such devices? I asked that question and discovered an answer: Absalom.
So my journey continued ever westward. I had to see this fabled city, this monument
to humanity’s curiosity. Boarding a ship in Katheer, I exchanged drinks with a dwarf
captain whose clockwork hand was nimble and refined, and I listened with rapt attention
as he told me his story of crossing a blasted wasteland to reach the city of Alkenstar
and obtain the prosthetic to replace the hook that had served him for many years. And
finally, Absalom! Jewel of the Inner Sea! Repository of wonders from across the globe! A
fitting home for a man who has seen half the world and hopes to see the rest.

Realms of Innovation
The Rotating Gear is an expansive gazetteer following
the flow of technology across Golarion—from the ancient
automatons of the Jistka Imperium to the innovative
firearms produced on the continent of Arcadia, and
beyond. Each section touches on the history and culture
of a different part of Golarion, specifically focusing on
the context of the technologies that have arisen from or
are being actively developed in those areas. The sections
examine clockwork technology on one hand, and black
powder and firearms technology on the other.
Some of the sections describing these regions, such as
the section on Arcadia, explore new places on Golarion
in depth for the first time, while others, like the section
on Ustalav, focus on more recent developments and
technological discoveries.
The world of Golarion is a living, breathing entity,
shaped
by
adventurers,
innovators,
politicians,
smugglers, and pirates in a variety of ways. Beyond
the inventions and innovations of its
inhabitants, Golarion’s technology has
been impacted by beings from other
worlds, and travelers from Golarion
who return from distant planes
with their discoveries. This has led
to Golarion’s inhabitants making
new discoveries and advancing
technology at a pace unlike
anywhere else in the multiverse—
sometimes leaping ahead of the
progress
made
elsewhere
and
sometimes lagging behind as magic
and circumstance limit necessity and alter
the flow of innovation.
These sections also contain insights into the
associated regions, and their use of guns, gears, or
both, perfect for helping GMs unlock the full potential
of adventures set within those regions. For example,
GMs hoping to run an adventure in the gritty city of
Alkenstar will find detailed accounts of the people and
organizations vying for power there, while GMs who
set their adventures in Ustalav can benefit from a look
at how technologies from another world have spurred
amazing and sometimes terrifying advancements in a
variety of sciences. The streets of Absalom might seem a
little bit more wondrous than before after learning about
the clockwork inventions that serve as everything from
toys to weapons of powerful destruction. Examining
the development of black powder technology in context
with the geopolitics and history of its early spread on
the continents of Tian Xia and Vudra can help GMs add
depth to black powder adventures set in those areas.
While black powder weapons, clockwork technology,
and weird science might exist in hidden dungeons
anywhere on Golarion, the nations discussed in this
chapter are benefactors of technological advancement.
Technology doesn’t advance from one lone genius
experimenting in a hidden tower deep in the wilderness,
but instead through the iteration of ideas across various
people of different cultures, each of whom brings their
own unique elements and ideas to the table. Inventors
and gunslingers alike often find themselves drawn
to any of these regions as they search to advance and
perfect their craft, learning from the various innovations
and traditions across the world. Any scholar hoping to
understand how Golarion has been shaped by science and
mortal ingenuity can’t hope to reach that understanding
without knowing the details contained herein.
SECTION SUMMARIES

DONGUN HOLD AND ALKENSTAR
When you appeared on our doorstep, Ancil Alkenstar, many insisted I would bring doom
to us all by granting you an audience. Instead, you became one of my dearest friends and a
life-long ally to our people, an alliance that has only grown stronger since your death, as the
city that bears your name has become inextricably bound to us through blood and battle.
You knew that would happen, didn’t you? You were barely more than a vagabond who’d
worn holes through the soles of your shoes, but your plans for the future inspired me right
from the beginning. You always saw friends and opportunities with an eye keen enough
to put any sniper to shame. You saw a future no one else could see and left it to me to
safeguard while you set out on your next grand adventure. How I miss and envy you!
There are still dwarves who say we should never have allied with you, graybeards who
respond to any evidence of the good the alliance has done us with doubtful nods and dire
warnings to “give it time.” Fools, I say! I have watched four generations of humanity grow
from children into adults of great renown and unimpeachable character, and in that time,
I have seen no more villains or criminals spring from their ranks than from our own. The
world you helped create is stronger than the one I inherited. Your children break bread and
sing songs with our own. If Geb and Nex should dare to bring their war to our doorstep once
more, humans and dwarves shall stand united, wielding weapons that can defend us from
any threat. If only you were alive to see what we have wrought, my friend!

Caught between the warring armies of Geb and Nex for
over a millennium, dwarves of Dongun Hold endured
as their lands became the twisted Mana Wastes and the
surface world they’d fought to find became unlivable.
Determined to chart their own course—not as victims
or survivors but as defiant curators of their own
destinies—dwarves of Dongun Hold bid their Kulenett
kin farewell, destroyed the entrance to Dongun Hold,
and retreated below-ground.
This could have been their end, for without home or
purpose many dwarves found themselves without hope,
but the discovery of a strange black powder changed
the course of their lives. This volatile curiosity became a
balm for despair and provided hope for the future. With
every spark, explosion, and bullet impact, dwarves of
Dongun Hold crept closer to perfecting new weapons
they hoped would ensure their survival against enemies
they’d neither forgotten nor forgiven.
After four millennia, the dwarves have reclaimed
Dongun Hold and allied with Alkenstar. When the
nations of Geb and Nex next wage war, the dwarves
will be ready. They do not intend to lose the Hold again.
History of Dongun Hold
In the distant past, when nomadic dwarves completed
their Quest for Sky and spread across Golarion’s
surface, they constructed ten massive fortresses called
Sky Citadels which became bastions of dwarven culture,
craft, and commerce. While most dwarves engaged in
an endless war against their long-standing orc enemies,
the dwarves of the Dongun Hold Sky Citadel faced a
different threat: a wizard war. As the rival nations of
Geb and Nex battled, Dongun Hold became caught in
the crossfire. Their once-beautiful lands became a magic-
blasted wasteland where magic remained unstable,
the dead walked, and life mutated. As the battle lines
shifted, dwarven lands passed back and forth between
the warring human nations.
In 572 AR, the dwarves of Dongun Hold admitted
their way of life was unsustainable. Too stubborn to cede
their holdings to the petty warring humans who had
spoiled their lands, they bid farewell to their dwarven
kin, the Kulenett, traded news and gifts with them one
last time, and then retreated underground, collapsing
the entrance to Dongun Hold behind them. In time,
the dwarves settled deep below in the Darklands, in a
magic-dead cavern complex in Sekamina, where they
isolated themselves from the surface above.
EXPERIMENTATION IN EXILE
Among the final goods and gifts traded to dwarves
of Dongun Hold by the Kulenett was a strange black
powder. A costly novelty imported from the courts of
Tian Xia at great expense, Vudrani traders brought
the powder to Garund. Incredibly volatile, the black
powder exhibited explosive properties, and was quickly
deemed too dangerous to serve much purpose. But as
the centuries wore on, the dwarves of Dongun Hold saw
potential in the powder.
Driven by worry over the bickering wizards
aboveground, dwarves of Dongun Hold worked to
create weapons capable of overwhelming arcane
opponents and their minions—constructs, fiends,
undead, and the mutants of the Mana Wastes. With
fervent prayers to Torag and Angradd, the dwarven
gods of creation and war, the smiths of Dongun Hold
challenged the boundaries of invention, creating new
crafting methods, arms, and armor. Some among their
number experimented with black powder, creating
minor explosives. These dwarven smiths had received
a more controlled but weaker version of black powder
that Tian Xia had allowed to spread into Vudra. They
learned the powder’s composition, duplicated it, and
then improved it, unlocking the secrets of the more
volatile and stronger powder and setting the stage for
further innovation. In time, the dwarves used black
powder to create new weapons of war, including the first
matchlock—and later flintlock—firearms.
Although the new black powder weapons proved
powerful, their creation and use wasn’t without
incident or detractors. Dwarven smiths and warriors
lost fingers, hands, limbs, and lives to explosions and
misfires, leading many dwarves to question the value
of the weapons—for what use was a weapon that hurt
friend as well as foe? Living in a remote corner of the
Darklands forced the dwarves to rely on themselves
for healing and recovering from these accidents, which
strained resources that otherwise would have been
used to keep society safe from the dangers of Sekamina
that posed a constant threat. In addition to black
powder weapons, the dwarven smiths of Dongun Hold
pursued advancements in the ancient art of crafting
prostheses and mobility devices, which enabled
warriors and smiths to return to the forge and field
of battle. Effective, reliable, and designed for comfort,
dwarven prostheses have evolved over time into works
of exquisite craftsmanship and ingenuity, each richly
decorated and highly prized, even in countries with
their own traditions of producing such devices.
Over millennia, dwarves of Dongun Hold pushed the
boundaries of invention, creating a multitude of firearms,
bullets, explosives, siege weapons, and tools. Today,
they use breech-loaded flintlock firearms, including
a variety of pistols, muskets, and scatterguns. Many
dwarven gunsmiths continue to strive to create new and
more effective types of firearms, though prototypes of
these experimental weapons are incredibly rare, closely
guarded, and usually extremely volatile.

RETURN TO DONGUN HOLD
After generations of isolation, a human refugee named
Ancil Alkenstar visited the dwarves of Dongun Hold.
High King Anong Arunak met with the stranger,
discussing the state of the surface world and the end
of open hostilities between Geb and Nex. Shortly
thereafter, the dwarves returned to the surface, restored
their fallen Sky Citadel, and finally returned home to
the ancient, stone-carved halls of Dongun Hold. While
the dwarves rebuilt, Ancil united the other refugees and
clans of the Mana Wastes and established a settlement
just outside Dongun Hold, naming it the Grand Duchy
of Alkenstar.
In spite of the xenophobia of her people, High King
Arunak allied with Alkenstar, protecting the fledgling
settlers with dwarven sharpshooters and gunslingers.
Over the centuries, Alkenstar has grown drastically in
size. The innovators of Alkenstar’s massive Gunworks
manufacture dwarven firearms and explosives, tithing
a portion of the profits to Dongun Hold’s coffers. In
times of trouble, the dwarven sharpshooters still fight
to defend the city alongside their Alkenstar neighbors.
Throughout
the
Mana
Wastes, High King Arunak
and the dwarves of Dongun
Hold continue to be lauded
as brave heroes.
Despite
their
sudden
prosperity, the dwarves of Dongun Hold
struggle to find their place in a much-changed world.
They present a united front to outsiders but behind
closed doors there is division. The majority of dwarves
trust the judgment of their High King and celebrate
their return to Dongun Hold, taking great pride in their
position as respected defenders of both Dongun Hold
and Alkenstar. Despite a century of close contact with
Alkenstar, some individual dwarves remain accustomed
to seclusion, and tales of the human war that drove their
ancestors from Dongun Hold are held close in memory.
Among these traditionalist dwarves, extending trust and
friendship to their neighbors is a challenge with which
they remain uncomfortable.
Within the halls of Dongun Hold, three major
factions vie for the support of High King Arunak and
the dwarven people: the traditionalist Keepers of the
Skyflame, the mercantile Goldhand Lodge, and the
inventive Sparkforge Collective.
Keepers of the Skyflame
The Keepers of the Skyflame are dwarven traditionalists
who have long lobbied against the use of black powder
and the many inventions it has spawned. Citing the
danger and pain the devices have caused, the Keepers
urge their dwarven kin to abandon the use of firearms
and explosives, and instead refocus on traditional
methods of warfare.
At odds with the Sparkforge Collective, the Keepers
of the Skyflame lost respect for High King Arunak long
ago, when she chose to invest heavily in firearms, tripling
the resources and smiths devoted to their production,
and converting many traditional combat battalions to
firearm and demolition squads. The Keepers argued
against allying with Alkenstar and urge the High
King to sever ties with the human nation immediately.
They consider Dongun Hold’s status as a “holding”
of Alkenstar an unforgivable insult for which all of
Alkenstar owes recompense.
Although the Keepers of the Skyflame dislike the use
of firearms, they don’t deny their power and greatly fear
black powder weapons falling into unworthy hands—
which typically includes all non-dwarves. They believe
High King Arunak’s sharing of firearm technology with
Alkenstar represents a dangerous betrayal that threatens
all dwarven people.
As their pleas and warnings have continually been
ignored, some among the Keepers of the Skyflame turn
to extreme measures to preserve the future of Dongun
Hold. Rumormongers spread seeds of doubt
throughout the citizenry, playing upon
fear and xenophobia to
turn popular opinion
against High King
Arunak:
politicians
foil trade negotiations
and foreign alliances;
priests and historians encourage a return to traditional
and respected ways of life, glamorizing the past and
glorifying ancestral heroes; scoundrels steal or spoil
shipments of black powder; and renegades sabotage
forges and firearm shipments. The boldest among them
plan more direct action, including assassination and the
recent attacks against Alkenstar’s Gunworks.
Whatever the methods these desperate dwarves
utilize, they strive to keep their actions secret, often
blaming—and occasionally hiring—outsiders to do
their dirty work for them. Most dwarves caught taking
criminal action on behalf of the Keepers would rather
take the blame for their crimes alone than implicate their
organization, considering it an honorable sacrifice made
to ensure the survival of Dongun Hold and those who
would save it. This stubborn fanaticism has enabled the
Keepers of the Skyflame to continue their operations
without major setbacks.
Although High King Arunak has tried to maintain
peace between the factions of Dongun Hold, as
tensions rise, she’ll eventually have to take a stand
on these major ideological issues. Knowing the High
King’s opinion of their order, the Keepers of the
Skyflame prepare for her public condemnation, which
they hope to use to turn the dwarven populace against
her and spur an uprising that could change the course
of the future.

Goldhand Lodge
The Goldhand Lodge is a mercantile alliance that aims
to ensure the prosperity of Dongun Hold and its citizens
through commerce. Its members encourage the sale of
goods and services, from gold, metalwork, and firearms,
to contract mining, construction, and mercenary work.
During the dwarves’ long exile in the Darklands, the
Goldhand Lodge dwindled in importance. Under the
reign of High King Arunak, Dongun Hold reopened,
brokered an alliance with Alkenstar, and licensed the
right to create dwarven firearms to the Gunworks—all
measures which greatly empowered the Lodge.
In all ways, the Goldhand Lodge seeks to increase profits
for both their members and Dongun Hold as a whole.
They buck tradition, push boundaries, and embrace the
new—as long as it’s profitable. Their most influential
members negotiate trade agreements with Alkenstar and
other foreign nations, even including overtures to Nex
and Geb. As many dwarves still consider the citizens of
Nex and Geb their enemies, these maneuvers have earned
it little support among the dwarven populace. In hopes of
finding a profitable compromise, the Goldhand Lodge is
working to establish trading houses within Nex and Geb,
which would allow it to sell dwarven products far afield,
without dwarven crafters ever having to personally deal
with distasteful foreigners.
Since the creation of the Gunworks, High King
Arunak has tightly controlled the number of firearms it
produces, to ensure only a limited number are released
yearly. While many dwarves lauded this move as
practical, as it ensures dwarven firearms sell for high
prices and fewer enemies acquire them—members of
the Goldhand Lodge has long opposed the maneuver,
citing it as a hindrance that prevents dwarven goods
from reaching eager markets. They fear others will soon
create their own firearms and the need for weapons
from the Gunworks will dwindle. The Lodge urges High
King Arunak to vastly increase production quotas at the
Gunworks and allow dwarven gunsmiths to sell their
firearms direct to customers—with the aid of its brokers.
Until approval for such laws occurs, some members of
the Lodge turn to smuggling and other underhanded
tactics to ensure that dwarven goods and firearms reach
the open market and wealth flows into dwarven coffers.
Members of the Goldhand Lodge remain on the
lookout for innovative crafters in need of mercantile
connections.
They
regularly
hire
silver-tongued
negotiators, experienced mercenaries, and scoundrels
that aren’t afraid to bend the rules. On the third Fireday
of every month, they open their Dongun Hold and
Alkenstar offices to ambitious inventors, entrepreneurs,
and expedition leaders, inviting them to show off their
creations, businesses, and expedition plans. There they
purchase promising ideas outright, or offer investment
funding in exchange for partial ownership or control and
a hefty share of profits.
Sparkforge Collective
From humble beginnings, the Sparkforge Collective
rose to become one of the most influential—and
controversial—organizations
in
Dongun
Hold.
Originally a gathering of six dwarven crafters that
experimented with black powder, the Sparkforge
Collective now consists of hundreds of inventors and
gunsmiths, nearly a thousand sharpshooters, gunslingers,
and demolitionists, and countless dwarven citizens.
Regardless of role or station, members of the Sparkforge
Collective believe the future of Dongun Hold and the
survival of its people lies in the use of black powder.
The Collective’s founding members discovered how to
create, utilize, and weaponize black powder, creating
explosives, firearms, and other tools.
In the generations since its founding, the Sparkforge
Collective has grown by leaps and bounds, though its
goals remain consistent: develop new black powder
innovations and improve existing black powder
technologies and crafting methods. By embracing
these goals, members of the Sparkforge Collective
continually strive to not only create new firearms,
tools, and explosives for a wide range of specialties and
applications, but also improve the safety and reliability
of existing black powder devices and crafting methods.
Once a minor group of eccentric outsiders, the
Sparkforge Collective has expanded throughout Dongun
Hold and today, most dwarves support the Collective’s
actions and perceive the wisdom in the use of firearms.
Crafters and warriors associated with the Sparkforge
Collective remain well-respected throughout the Hold,
and those known to create, test, and utilize the newest
experimental creations and prototypes are celebrated as
heroes, for such work is incredibly dangerous. The practical
and stoic warriors that test devices, tools, and weapons
for the Sparkforge Collective must possess a steady hand
and extreme focus to ensure they minimize misfires and
other accidents. In contrast, inventors and experimental
gunsmiths typically have frazzled and scorched hair and
beards, and pock-marked skin that has endured numerous
explosions and fires. While some would consider these
qualities the signs of a poorly skilled smith, among the
Sparkforge Collective they serve as badges of bravery,
ingenuity, and honor.
The Sparkforge Collective has long been opposed by
the Keepers of the Skyflame and is often the target of
the Keepers’ ire. For their part, most members of the
Sparkforge Collective consider the Keepers so mired in
the past that they remain ignorant of true progress. The
Collective enjoys the support of High King Arunak and
the Goldhand Lodge, although the Collective and the
Lodge don’t always agree, as members of the Sparkforge
Collective often focus more on innovation and progress
than profit. The Sparkforge Collective is always looking
for smiths, alchemists, and inventors to join their ranks
and reliable warriors to test their creations in the field.

Preparations For War
Despite their differences, dwarves of Dongun Hold have
never forgotten the source of their troubles and long
exile—it was the warring human nations of Geb and Nex
that spoiled their lands and drove the dwarves from their
home. Aware that at any moment the old grudges between
these wizard nations could rekindle into devastating
war, the inhabitants of Dongun Hold remain alert for
signs of conflict which they both fear and consider to be
inevitable. The various factions and dwarves of Dongun
Hold offer their support to war preparations in
different, but invaluable ways.
Dwarves who dwell on the surface keep a
watchful eye out for trouble and their ears
open for rumors, both in Alkenstar and
further afield in Geb and Nex. Most work
to keep the citizens of Alkenstar on their
side and in fighting form, as Alkenstar
remains a convenient first line of
defense between Dongun Hold
and the neighboring wizard
nations. Other dwarves stay
in close contact with their
Kulenett kin, arming them
in secret to prepare for the
possibility of an undead
invasion of the Kulenett’s
underground highway.
Warriors train and invent
new combat styles relentlessly,
and practice methods for combating
spellcasters, undead, constructs, and fiends.
Many dwarves utilize firearms and explosives,
and those who don’t still know how the weapons
function for safety purposes.
Smiths of all kinds embrace Torag and Angradd as the
gods of creation and warfare, seeking their blessing as
they develop new arms and armor to protect themselves
and their people. Dwarven gunsmiths invent, advance,
and push boundaries, determined to create weapons
capable of overwhelming their enemies. Deep in the
Hold, the dwarves create the most ingenious weapons
in blessed forges, stamped with the seal of Angradd and
Torag, and keep them secret from the surface world.
Most Dongun dwarves are wary of spellcasters and
the undead, regardless of origin, and foreigners are
rarely invited into the halls of the Hold. Many dwarves
decorate their hair, beards, and armor with miniature
censers, embers, or tindertwigs—objects useful for
rapidly creating sparks and flame—and style their hair
with nonflammable cream while lathering their skin
with flame-repellent ointments and lotions.
The most cautious dwarves urge High King Arunak
to reopen the Darklands retreat they once called home,
while priests reinforce old protections and masons
refortify battlements, caverns, and other defenses.
BLACK POWDER INNOVATORS
The advent of black powder technology drastically
changed life in the Mana Wastes for dwarves of Dongun
Hold and their Alkenstar neighbors. Although many
alchemists, inventors, and smiths have contributed to the
evolution and advancement of black powder weaponry, the
contributions of six dwarves rise above all others. These
six dwarves were founding members of the Sparkforge
Collective and the very first to harness black powder. They
collaborated throughout their careers, sharing discoveries,
building upon one another’s successes, and learning
from each other’s failures. These respected
dwarven innovators are listed below.
Jarvek Goldtongue (N Male Dwarf
Politician): Remembered more as a politician
than an inventor, Jarvek is widely regarded
as the mastermind behind the Sparkforge
Collective. They’re responsible for acquiring
funding and facilities for the group to
conduct their work and for sharing
the
group’s
advances
and
inventions with leadership
and
security
councils.
Without Jarvek’s tireless
politicking, the Sparkforge
Collective wouldn’t exist.
Maribun
Enbit
(NG
Female Dwarf Alchemist):
An alchemist by trade,
Maribun was the first to deduce
the composition of black powder and
successfully recreate it. Although her formula has
been refined over the years, nearly all common iterations
are based upon her work.
Brondar Steelheart (N Agender Dwarf Blacksmith):
Brondar experimented with black powder’s explosive
qualities and was the first to create a controlled explosion
using it. Their efforts in creating and cataloging black
powder explosions paved the way for the safe creation of
explosives, firearms, and a variety of black powder tools.
Alrune Thengor (CG Male Dwarf Demolitionist): A
talented engineer and stonemason, Alrune was an expert
in demolitions. He created the first compact black powder
explosive, which he housed in a flammable mushroom husk.
Herrod the Brash (CE Male Dwarf Demolitionist): Known
for his mood swings, Herrod was the first to successfully
combine black powder weaponry with fuses.
Nelbi Firebrow (LN Female Dwarf Gunsmith, Deceased):
Nelbi created the first black powder firearm. Incredibly
volatile and hand lit, her creation numbers among the most
influential inventions in the history of the Mana Wastes.
Other major advancements in black powder weaponry
include the creation of the first matchlock firearm by Kravik
the Clanless (unknown) and the creation of the flintlock
mechanism by Oga Ulstod (LG female dwarf engineer).

Though Golarion has no shortage of fantastical cities and
locales, few are as unique as the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar
by pure necessity. Cradled in the blasted heart of the Mana
Wastes, the source of nearly all firearms in the Inner Sea
might seem to be no more than a large, walled town to
the casual observer. However, the unreliability of magic,
upon which most other societies depend, has bred a level
of innovation that would not be possible elsewhere. In
this young, isolated nation, science and technology are
a necessity, with human innovation joining dwarven
engineering to achieve all sorts of marvelous technological
advancements at breakneck speed. Founded by the refugee
Ancil Alkenstar after he fled arrest in Nex, the nation
has risen to prosperity by serving as a trade link between
the crafters of Dongun Hold and the wider world. With
little arable land to grow its own crops, Alkenstar relies
on specialized exports of iced wine to Geb, and weapons
and armaments forged by skilled artisans to the rest of the
Inner Sea to keep its citizens fed.
The duchy never forgets the debt it owes to the
dwarven fortress of Dongun Hold for the advances that
were shared between peoples, such as the development of
black powder and firearms, and the repeated assistance
the Sky Citadel continues to provide. Still, even the
smiths of Dongun Hold find themselves surprised and
impressed by some of the advancements the humans have
made in the realm of firearm development. Acting as
home to some of the most skilled crafters both humanity
and dwarvenkind have to offer, Alkenstar has become a
veritable pilgrimage destination for inventors, alchemists,
architects, and anyone else fascinated by innovation.
Situated near the heart of the Mana Wastes between
Nex and Geb, the City of Smog can’t easily be reached
from any direction using conventional means of travel.
Most travelers make their way south through Katapesh
and Nex, though the unregulated guides that serve as
escorts on this journey are often as likely to rob their
charges and leave them for dead as they are to see them to
the destination safely. One of the safer options is to travel
with one of the merchant caravans that carry goods
back and forth along the route. Engineers who journey
to Smog seeking fortune rarely return to their countries
of origin, as the gravity and excitement of Alkenstar’s
industries has a way of holding their attention.

================================================================================

The Factory Fortress
A small fortress in and of itself, the massive factory in the
heart of Alkenstar known as the Gunworks is the center
of firearms manufacturing in the Inner Sea. Though
Alkenstar’s High Parliament regulate all production
of firearms with input from dwarves of Dongun Hold,
several independent manufacturing companies lease
space inside the Gunworks for their own purposes. While
production has doubled in the last several years, allowing
a large enough flow of firearms and siege weapons for
some minor targeted trading outside of Alkenstar’s walls,
the Gunworks’ boundless capacity still leaves significant
room for development and expansion. Mechanists toil in
myriad sublevels of the factory, plotting improvements
to the massive bombard known as the Maw of Rovagug,
experimenting with stronger mixtures of gunpowder, and
devising new types of firearms.
Each level of the Gunworks supports a specific
purpose, with deeper basements dug with the help of
Dongun Hold’s dwarven engineers as the need arises. The
level just below the surface is the master stockpile, where
the Gunworks stores produced firearms for emergency
use or special sale. Below that is the shrapnel field, where
they test each weapon against rigorous performance
standards. Deeper still are the production lines, which
house hundreds of workbenches for artisans to
construct individual components of a firearm
before a foreman assembles the weapon in a
separate room, to limit the chance of a rogue
worker leaving with full knowledge of the
product’s creation. The walled structure that
resides on top of the complex serves as a secure fortress,
allowing for the shipment of orders and monitoring of
the Gunworks as a whole.
This security has recently been put to the most
strenuous test since the Gorilla King robbed the
Gunworks in 4690 AR. The Keepers of the Skyflame
have long protested the decision of Anong Arunak to
give Ancil Alkenstar the secrets of forging firearms and
processing black powder. Tensions have grown over
the last century and beyond, with younger members of
the faction plotting to take a firm stand. In 4719 AR a
dozen Keepers posing as dwarven contractors from the
Hold, seized control of a bombard near the entrance to
the master stockpile and set a match to the vast supply.
The resulting explosion collapsed the exit points for all
workers below, leaving them trapped. High King Arunak
quickly dispatched workers to dig temporary tunnels
for an evacuation while the shieldmarshals responsible
for the city’s safety mounted a desperate and costly
attack on the insurgents. When the fighters defeated the
assailants and rescued the survivors, the casualties were
in the hundreds, including all but one of the Keepers. The
surviving assailant accepted full responsibility for the
attack, evading any connections that might implicate the
Keepers as a whole. The High Parliament is still working
with High King Arunak to find an agreeable resolution to
the incident and address concerns about future attacks.
Even without proof, many still suspect the members of
the Keepers of the Skyflame encouraged the attack. In the
interim, trusted Dongun Hold engineers have repaired
the Gunworks at no cost to Alkenstar and Dongun Hold
has supplemented security around the site with veterans
and retirees who have fulfilled their other obligations.
Smoke in the Streets
Despite being the main source of gunpowder weaponry
in the Inner Sea, firearms are not a universal tool among
the citizenry of the city-state. Pistols have become a

symbol of status among the well-appointed in Alkenstar’s
high society, with prosperous merchants and nobles
brandishing their weapons openly to show off garish
gold plating and intricately carved ivory handles. In
the aristocratic Auburn District of the city, a subtrade
has bloomed, focused around designing additions to
firearms and swapping out fashion pieces for when the
styles change or weapons switch owners. This has in
turn helped propel all manner of businesses related to
the customization of firearms, from mounted scopes to
bandoliers with mithral straps.
For the less fortunate of Alkenstar, the quickest
way to obtain a firearm is to enlist as a member of
the city’s primary source of law-enforcement, the
shieldmarshals. Specially armed with black powder
weapons and trained in their use, the shieldmarshals
both maintain order within the City of Smog and watch
its walls for threats from the Mana Wastes. Serving as a
shieldmarshal requires extensive commitment, though
the pay is well above what most beyond the nobility
could expect to earn in any other occupation. Still, the
authority that comes with wielding a destructive weapon
and the weight of upholding the law can pose the potential
for corruptive influence. A great many among the
shieldmarshals have used their positions to jockey for more
influence, extorting common and noble citizens alike. In
4718 AR, an investigation into missing firearms from the
Gunworks exposed over two hundred shieldmarshals who
participated in an organized smuggling ring and criminal
enterprise. The perpetrators were stripped of their rank and
exiled into the Mana Wastes, leaving the shieldmarshals
with a vast shortage of personnel.
Though led in name by Ironmaster Vulane, most
shieldmarshals look to High Shieldmarshal Armand
Meneley (LG male human gunslinger) as their true
commander. Armand holds a seat in Alkenstar’s High
Parliament, where he serves as a check against both the
Grand Duchess and the less scrupulous nobles of the
Parliament. The aging lawman argues with a strong voice
both for the careful dispensation of firearms to protect
the City of Smog and against the ever-growing corruption
in the ranks of the shieldmarshals (something he privately
suspects is due to the Ironmaster’s own illicit dealings).
He also butts heads frequently with Eliza Baratella (NG
female human construct crafter), the designer of the Brass
Guardians that have begun to replace the humanoid
guard of Alkenstar.
The continuous corruption in the ranks of the
shieldmarshals has encouraged Parliament to seek
alternatives, and where there is opportunity to be had in
the city, there are inventors willing to create solutions.
Initially creating her clockwork sentinels to guard
against the mutants that crawl out from the separated
Ironside Quarter, Eliza lobbied for their deployment
throughout the city as supplemental forces. Against
Armand’s strenuous objections, the High Parliament
approved the motion. Over the last decade these entities
have begun to outnumber the living shieldmarshals,
resulting in a typical patrol consisting of multiple
Brass Guardians and a pair of humanoid officers to
communicate and provide directives. Despite their
touted benefits, these limited constructs are not capable
of judging the morality of their orders. Thus, some
corrupt shieldmarshals have been able to bolster their
efforts with imposing clockwork bodyguards who act
decisively with little need for persuasion. Despite reports
of shieldmarshals commanding their clockwork escorts
to destroy property as a means of extortion, Eliza insists
these are isolated incidents that the next update to the
Guardians’ mechanics will rectify.
BRASS GUARDIANS
The creation of magical constructs is exceptionally
difficult and foolishly dangerous within most of
the Mana Wastes, including the Brass Guardians,
clockwork guardians designed to serve Alkenstar as
guards. However, the Skyside half of Alkenstar to the
east has largely normal magical function. The Brass
Guild creates all the automatons in this prosperous
section of the City of Smog before deploying the
enforcers into the magical dead zones. For decades,
this production line has proved effective and functional.
However, in the summer of 4719 AR, complaints of
rogue Brass Guardians began to reach the Guild’s ears.
Investigation of the units showed evidence of rapid
degradation to the magical cortexes of the clockwork
soldiers. Researchers were able to narrow down that
all rogue units had recently patrolled neighborhoods in
Smokeside, magically dead sections of the city. A few
weeks later, the High Parliament received reports of
significant stirring among the mutants of the Wastes.
Not a believer in coincidence, Eliza Baratella, head of
the Brass Guild and creator of the first Brass Guardians,
commissioned a task force of her best engineers to see
if the Mana Wastes are beginning to worsen in a way
that could negatively affect her creations.
The results of the inquiry continue to evolve, but
preliminary findings indicate that the fundamental nature
of the Mana Wastes may be mutating even more rapidly
than the creatures that inhabit it. The degradation of the
Brass Guardians’ processing cores results from an active
force, not a simple antimagic effect.
Around the same time Eliza’s taskforce determined this,
the fleshforges in Ecanus, a nearby city in Nex, spun back
to life, ejecting monstrosities unheard of since the rule of
Nex’s legendary founder. Most of the researchers point
to a sudden shift in the Mana Wastes’ odd properties,
but one dissenter posited a more disturbing theory: the
imminent return of the archwizard Nex. For now, Eliza
has chosen to keep these developments a secret, but
information such as this rarely stays hidden for long.

================================================================================

The Politics of Powder
While those with knowledge of the recent stirrings in
Geb and Nex have thus far managed to avoid keeping the
information from spreading into wild rumormongering,
Alkenstar is not so remote or isolated that word of
the outside world fails to breach its walls. The people
of Alkenstar know that they exist wedged between
the two magical superpowers of Geb and Nex. Most
shieldmarshals carry at least one magical silver bullet in
their kit when traveling beyond the city’s walls just in case
they should encounter a vampire scout or other undead
creature sneaking across the border of the Mana Wastes.
As military activity in the neighboring kingdoms
continues to grow, the Grand Duchess has formed an
unlikely but politically savvy alliance with the nation
of Vidrian. Vidrian has its own struggles with pirates
and Chelaxian privateers, but possesses a powerful
navy, something the landlocked city-state of Alkenstar
lacks entirely. The two nations have formed an accord
wherein Alkenstar provides a small number of cannons
and firearms to Vidrian in exchange for Vidrian
providing naval escorts for valuable shipments and
keeping pressure on Nex and Geb politically to keep
their fighting to themselves. Though the two nations are
on opposite sides of the continent and separated by a
dangerous mountain range, magical communications
and shared interests have allowed them both to benefit
from this relationship.
Gunners of Fortune and
Infamy
As the font of most firearms in the Inner Sea, it is
unsurprising that Alkenstar is also the origin of the area’s
storied gunslingers. While the High Parliament sets rules
to contain the acquisition of firearms, it sets no true rules
on who can carry them or leave the city with one in their
possession. Theft of the weapons, or simply keeping a
service weapon after leaving the shieldmarshals, are a
shade more common than actually purchasing one. The
knowledge of the formula for gunpowder is much more
difficult to obtain, however, as it isn’t used outside the
secure confines of the Gunworks. The shieldmarshals
know that without this critical process a pistol is nothing
more than a short club before long. As a result, most
gunpowder must be purchased inside Alkenstar or stolen,
which keeps gunslingers close to the City of Smog.
The most infamous and active of these powder thieves
are a trio of vagabonds called the Lover’s Triangle.
Kastus (CN male human ruffian), is the apparent
leader, a former stockboy in the Gunworks who decided
robbing boats along the Ustradi River was an easier
and more entertaining career. Tarluc (NE male half-elf
charlatan) reportedly serves as the Triangle’s scout
and con artist, luring guards and travelers with stories
of attacking mutants or other lies. Elysse (N female
half-orc gunslinger) acts as the muscle for the group,
and has warrants for over a dozen murders to her
name. The band came together when Kastus
broke Tarluc and Elysse free during a prisoner
transfer years ago, and since then they have
continued to plague the merchant routes in
and out of Alkenstar. Their patterns of robbery
and preferred targets are erratic, fluctuating from
hijacking munitions transports bound for Vidrian to
stealing food shipments inbound from Geb.
Further outside the walls of Alkenstar, travelers have
reported a seemingly impossible sight: a mass of goblins,
each carrying a makeshift musket. At first locals suspected
they were simply sticks mistaken for firearms at a distance,
until the goblin clan opened fire on a barge, their giddy
laughter barely audible over the shots. A shieldmarshal
patrol was sent to investigate and came back with news
that the goblins called themselves the Powder-Teeth Clan.
The leader of the clan was able to provide a bill of sale for
the firearms, dated several years ago. The human listed
on the bill was a smuggler from Alkenstar, and when the
shieldmarshals pressed the goblins for more information
they revealed that she sold the weapons to the clan for
a collection of gems. Later, the goblins admitted, she
returned to steal her goods back, underestimating the
encampment’s security and the speed with which the

goblins would master their new black powder weaponry.
No amount of negotiation could convince the goblins to
reveal how they replace their supply of gunpowder, but
the shieldmarshal report notes craters throughout the
camp, suggesting experimentation.
Not all firearm wielders beyond Alkenstar’s walls,
nor within them, are the nefarious sort. Many
shieldmarshals are infuriated by the corruption of some
of their peers and work doubly hard to improve the
organization’s reputation within the city while keeping
a watchful eye open for actionable proof to bring their
corrupt counterparts to justice. Retired guards and
shieldmarshals often choose to purchase their service
weapons once their tour of duty is complete, using the
weapon to earn a new life for themselves beyond what a
10-year pension can afford. Dobra Brak (N male half-orc
shieldmarshal) and his partner Betta Blunak (LN female
dwarf sniper) run a small adventuring company of such
retirees, escorting merchants through the Mana Wastes.
Innovators in a New Age
All of the skill and proliferation of Alkenstar’s
mechanisms would be irrelevant without the genius
of the inventors who create them. The City of Smog
attracts the finest engineering minds in the Inner Sea, as
well as adventurers looking to hone their craft among
the symphony of clicking gears and drumming pistons.
Craftworks devoted to clockwork items, alchemical
solutions, and even prosthetic limbs ready for fitting line
the gilded streets of the Auburn District. The clockwork
guardians known as Brass Guardians stand at each
street corner, the methodical tick of their systems a quiet
reminder of Alkenstar’s technological progress.
The Greaseblood Infirmary, despite the unpleasant
name, is a building where the unfortunate flock. Founded
by Adrick Slatejoint (NG male dwarf physician)
and Tonra Slatejoint (CG male dwarf engineer), the
Infirmary is the foremost developer of prosthetic limbs in
Alkenstar. Husbands from Dongun Hold, the Slatejoints
use a dual solution of alchemy and clockwork to treat
patients, healing those sickened from the fumes of the
city’s thousands of chimneys and replacing appendages
lost in factory accidents. Though the expense of the
treatments can be high, patients pay only what they can
afford. Tonra comes from old dwarven aristocracy and
is always prepared to use his family fortune to cover any
losses the Infirmary incurs, though the high quality of
the facility’s prosthetics makes it a preferred vendor for
the aristocracy, and it’s incredibly rare for the Infirmary’s
operating budget to exceed its income.
While Alkenstar has no shortage of clockwork
engineers, none have the prestige or funding of
Professor Radpol (LN male gnome inventor). The
scientist came to Alkenstar decades ago, focusing on
the study of clockwork automatons as a way to stave
off the Bleaching. Though none of his designs ever
reached open market, he garnered the attention of
Grand Duchess Ricia, who has since financed his work
exclusively. Ten years of silence have passed from the
professor since the unveiling of the Black Ephemeron,
a massive creation of ebony steel that stands over the
raised bailey of Alkenstar Castle in a taciturn watch. No
one can deny the imposing presence of the construct, yet
few have ever witnessed it move, leading to accusations
that its functionality is merely an illusion. As Professor
Radpol makes no public appearances nor publishes any
academic papers, he has not yet refuted this claim.
With the lack of grain and other produce available
in Alkenstar, horses have proven to be a difficult
commodity to provide for, even among the wealthy of
the city’s elite. Racing has become a prestigious sport,
with room for alternative solutions to feeding the
athletic steeds. Capitalizing on this demand, Jamiria
Bronzehoof (N nonbinary halfling inventor) cornered
the market on clockwork horseracing, lobbying an
evolution of the sport revolving around the optimization
of artificial steeds. Jockeys require a different set of skills
than mundane horse racers, birthing a separate pool of
athletes than those who compete in other regions of the
Inner Sea. The optimization of clockwork mounts, as
well as the talented riders that can manipulate them, has
become an obsession in some circles of the elite. Riders
with a knack for piloting artificial steeds have quickly
become a commodity in the City of Smog, allowing
for well-to-do patrons to fund contesting teams in the
lucrative racing cups that serve as entertainment for rich
and poor spectators alike.
A HELPING HAND
With the presence of black powder weapons, deadly
mutants, and the occasional insurgent attack, serious
injuries in Alkenstar are far more common than the
magic capable of repairing them. Both Dongun Hold and
Alkenstar hold their veterans in high regard, and as a
result, the government supplies veterans wounded in the
line of duty with quality prostheses.
Though
Dongun
Hold’s
dwarves
have
had
well-developed prostheses since long before the advent
of Alkenstar, many veterans still struggled with mobility,
arthritis, and other pains brought on by their injuries.
In recent years, the human shieldmarshals recovering
from the loss of a limb have developed various forms of
physical therapy and targeted calisthenics, and they’ve
shared these practices with their dwarven allies. It is
now fairly common to see mixed groups of human and
dwarven veterans stretching and exercising together
near the city perimeter ahead of a daily run or other
activity. Younger guards who join these groups as soon
as they begin their recovery from a traumatic injury
sometimes even find themselves able to return to full
duty within a few short months.

or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn’t gain
the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a –2

The City at the Center of the World draws merchants
from across Golarion and points beyond, making it an
ideal place to seek out specialized items and services.
Clockworks can be found among the rare items for sale
in Absalom’s bazaars, and the city boasts several skilled
inventors and tinkers able to handle all sorts of different
custom commissions.
The Flow of Innovation
Absalom has long been a haven for innovation and the
development of new ideas and inventions alike. While
its immense size and crowded streets appeal to urbanites
more than to those who prefer the countryside, the city
consistently draws many inventors. Three key reasons
for the longstanding appeal to this diverse and eager
group are Absalom’s ready market for buyers, its
concentration of specialists, and the wide availability of
a variety of components.
Absalom’s size and prominent location make it a
buyer’s market for ordinary goods, as competition in the
city is extremely high. Eggs, plain furniture, or tools that
might command a reasonable price in tiny communities
such as Otari or Abberton sell at low prices here, or
don’t get purchased at all. The same isn’t true for
specialized items. Absalom remains arguably among
the best places in the Inner Sea region to sell specialized
goods. A cunning wind-up toy might not sell for any
price in a small community, where people don’t have
the time or coin for such luxuries. Inventors who live
far from a bustling city might plan to sell a specialized
device to a wealthy patron, but if the patron changes
their mind or lowers the price, there’s often not much
the seller can do. This isn’t the case in Absalom; no
matter how unusual or customized something is, there’s
guaranteed to be someone in the city willing to buy it.
Finding that buyer, of course, poses its own challenges.
The city’s market for specialized goods draws
specialists from far distances. If you’re in the business of
creating custom constructs or labor-saving devices, you
soon learn that living and working near your ultimate
market is more efficient. Proximity to specialists with
similar
interests—frequenting
the
same
vendors,
consulting the same reference libraries, and so on—
means you’re much more likely to find another specialist

with matching interests. Priests of Brigh, for example,
count on this camaraderie to spur innovation via
frequent lectures at their temple in the Ascendant Court.
Mechanics are a quirky lot; some are misanthropes who
dislike sharing any findings with others, but most enjoy
advancing their knowledge by consulting with peers.
This collegial learning is further amplified by Absalom’s
many universities and academies. The foremost
example is the Clockwork Cathedral, the preeminent
institution for specialists who might take a few courses
to expand their horizons, frequent the institution to
make like-minded acquaintances, or even take a turn at
teaching classes to other eager minds.
As the city develops multiple specialists, unusual
components become easier and easier to find. Exacting
specification is needed when engineering new tools
and precision machinery, and therefore any reclusive
tinkerer who needs a particular gear or spring must
normally make it themself or order it from a distant
manufacturer. However, these manufacturers bring their
wares right to Absalom, as there’s a sufficient number of
buyers looking for their components.
Other items are entirely constructed in Absalom,
as the city is a large manufacturing center. Not only
that, manufacturers produce greater quantities of these
components as demand grows, sometimes requiring
more skilled engineers in order to effectively increase
production. Premade and easily acquired components
are particularly important to the makers of clockwork
devices, because crafting each cog and wheel is
laborious for even the most exacting machinist. Most
inventors would prefer to receive base materials they
know they can trust to fit their standards to the most
minute inspections. They would rather focus their
efforts instead on dreaming up what sorts of brand new
inventions they can build by combining these parts in a
unique way.
All these factors combine to spur innovation
within the city of Absalom, but only a few of these
innovations are kept completely secret or restricted,
and thus progress doesn’t stay confined within its walls.
A well-educated specialist might have any number
of reasons to leave the city: a prestigious posting in
a distant metropolis, a change in financial or family
circumstances, or simply a desire to be away from the
crushing crowds of the City at the Center of the World.
Those who leave Absalom take their knowledge (and
often, their equipment and innovations) along with
them to their new homes, thus spreading their skills
to others in distant lands. After all, the opportunity
to learn from a student of the Clockwork Cathedral
isn’t something an inventor in, say Riddleport, is likely
to experience twice! This education, in turn, spurs the
inquisitive or talented to return to Absalom, whether
during the years or generations that follow. And so, the
flow of innovation through Absalom continues.
Absalom Locations
The following locations in Absalom are useful for any
adventure in the City at the Center of the World, but
they are of particular interest to those associated with
or seeking out unusual technology.

MECHANICAL ERRORS
Anyone seeking low-cost gadgets in Absalom’s markets
is likely to find intriguing items that don’t work entirely
as expected. Here are some malfunctions you can include
with any mechanical device.
Belches Smoke: The machine emits a puff of smoke
every few minutes. For the round after it malfunctions,
anything in the space occupied by the machine is
concealed, and all creatures are concealed from any
creature in that space. The smoke might eventually cause
a significant nuisance or even a breathing hazard if there
isn’t sufficient air circulation.
Erratically Fails: The mechanism has an activation
flat check (usually with a DC of 2 or 3); on a failure,
the contraption simply fails to activate. If the machine
successfully activates, it operates normally thereafter,
unless it has another malfunction from this list.
Injures Bystanders: The machine has an errant
flywheel, metal tang, or other piece that swings outward
at irregular intervals. When it malfunctions, each nearby
creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw with a
DC appropriate for the item’s level (Core Rulebook 503)
or take damage of a type appropriate to the malfunction.
This is typically no more than 1d4 damage but could be
more dangerous for larger or more complex clockworks.
Leaks: Once a day, the mechanism leaks oil, coolant,
or some other fluid into its space and a random adjacent
square (or, if the GM desires, whichever adjacent space
causes the party the most trouble). The affected squares
are uneven ground (Core Rulebook 476), requiring
creatures who pass through the square to succeed at an
Acrobatics check to Balance with a DC appropriate for
the item’s level.
Rattles: When it’s moved or jostled, the machine emits
a noisy rattling for 1 round that can be heard clearly by
nearby creatures.
Scorches Oil: The machine emits the stench of burnt oil
or rubber at unpredictable intervals (but usually no more
than once an hour). Creatures adjacent to the machine
when it malfunctions become sickened 1 by the smell.
Violently
Explodes:
The
machine’s
internal
mechanisms fly apart, destroying it. Obviously, it can
malfunction in this way only once, and the GM should
have a good reason to destroy a mechanism upon which
the party relies.

Coins district. The imposing structure of metal plates
and massive cogwheels resembles an enormous
mechanical centipede with a clock tower rising from its
back. The gears festooning the building aren’t merely
for decoration; its walls, inner chambers, and outer
plates all move at the behest of the building’s inscrutable
and unseen masters. The structure’s name is something
of a misnomer, as it’s not a religious building but an
educational one.
Aspiring students come from all across Golarion to
learn from the Clockwork Cathedral’s faculty, all of
whom are themselves students with several years of
experience. The mysterious masters of the Clockwork
Cathedral send their trudging servitor constructs around
the academy to do their business. This business includes
not only mundane errands such as tightening loose
screws or sweeping up, but also delivering admission
paperwork and collecting tuition (which is never seen
again). Visitors learn to sidestep these single-minded
servitors, which rarely bother to turn from their business
to avoid trampling an inattentive student or awestruck
passerby. Admission decisions and tuition amounts
seem to be wholly arbitrary, as eager students are just
as likely to be invited into the Clockwork Cathedral’s
shadowy iron halls as they are to be turned away.
Students and faculty of the Clockwork Cathedral
gather in groups called cognates. These groups generally
focus on a single discipline or area of expertise; for
example, the Alive and Ticking cognate specializes in
healing, applying a mechanical mindset to repairing
ailments of the body. The Cog’s Best Friend cognate
focuses on the creation of construct companions, doing
its best to instill ephemeral concepts such as loyalty into
clockwork mechanisms.
The Clockwork Cathedral’s founder and inventor
is a mysterious robed figure called the Assembler (N
agender construct 19). The Assembler arrived
in Absalom’s harbor aboard a clockwork ship
almost a century ago, claiming to be the only
living creature aboard. After purchasing the rights
to an abandoned plot of land near Misery Row, the
Assembler magically transported the clockwork ship
there and, over the course of a month, transformed the
ship into the academy’s current shape.
Despite the many mysteries of its operation, the
Clockwork Cathedral is held in great esteem. Graduates
of its programs in engineering, metallurgy, and
mechanics remain in high demand across the Inner Sea
region. Anyone interested in the lore of clockworks and
related sciences would do well to seek admittance, even
if only for a semester or two.
GALLERY OF INNOVATION
The Clockwork Cathedral isn’t the only place in
Absalom to delve into the mysteries of clockwork
mechanisms. Priests of Brigh in the Ascendant Court
happily chat about engineering and innovation to
visitors. Although each has their own specialties, they
generally know about other worshippers’ research areas
and can point inquirers to the best people to answer
specific or detailed questions.
Absalom’s prominent temple to Brigh is called the
Gallery of Innovation. In addition to functioning as a
museum (with detailed technological exhibits that rotate
regularly), the temple contains several lecture halls,
from which they give and host lectures on a regular
basis. Most of these lectures are on abstruse or highly
specialized topics, so the lecture schedule is set months
in advance to ensure the largest audience of specialized

knowledge-seekers from around the Inner Sea region.
The priests understand that collaboration propels
innovation and often waive entry fees for interested but
impoverished attendees who seem likely to contribute
some useful knowledge.
Priests at the Gallery of Innovation are required
to give lectures as part of their regular temple duties,
but those who don’t enjoy public speaking foist the
obligations onto junior acolytes. While this duty is a
great opportunity for the temple’s newest members—
as nothing sharpens one’s knowledge on a subject like
having to speak to a room full of experts on it—this
practice results in many of the lectures being somewhat
haphazard, with the audience often providing opinions
and corrections. Flindish Tanwhirl (N female gnome
cleric 10), the current high priest of Brigh, is an enigmatic
gnome whom some claim to be more
clockworks than flesh. She spends so
much of her time at the Clockwork
Cathedral that her rare appearances
at the Gallery of Innovation cause
ripples of excitement. The few
lectures Flindish gives each year are
as crowded as they are convoluted.
WINDARIUM
The Windarium in Westgate is often
an inventor’s first stop for supplies, as the
proprietors sell all manner of screws, springs,
gears, and assorted components. A married couple,
Symo (LG male half-orc expert 11) and Mirtion (LN
male human merchant 6), run the shop; Symo is the
mechanical genius, while Mirtion is better at inventory
management and sales. Symo recently accepted a
high-ranking position in Absalom’s military, supervising
siege weapons and similar mechanical contrivances,
so the frantic Mirtion often runs the Windarium by
himself. Due to his lack of mechanical know-how,
Mirtion is easily flustered by detailed questions from
knowledgeable shoppers. The Windarium also sells
completed toys, devices, and curiosities at modest prices;
most of these are Symo’s inventions created during his
off hours. Although these curiosities are usually reliable
and virtually never dangerous, Mirtion doesn’t provide
any guarantees about the effectiveness of his husband’s
ticking, clattering wares.
MARKETS
Absalom’s bustling markets are an excellent place to
seek out clockwork innovations, although someone new
to a market might have to ask around to find the right
vendor. The Grand Bazaar is the best place to purchase
cunning clockwork contraptions, but God’s Market
does a brisk trade in Brighite innovations. Unless a
purchaser is seeking something simple, the wares are
likely to be expensive and well protected. Like any
purveyors of expensive goods, Absalom’s merchants of
clockworks usually employ guards, whether discreet or
overt. These guards are sometimes clockwork soldiers
or similar constructs, particularly when the merchant
wants to demonstrate the effectiveness of their wares
while simultaneously protecting them.
GADGET MERCHANTS
If you need to quickly determine a seller of clockworks
or contraptions in one of Absalom’s markets, here are
several for your consideration.
Cogsmaster: This excitable, purple-haired halfling
has a wide banner above his stall proclaiming him the
“Cogsmaster!” He’s a showman who might have excelled
as a sideshow barker, as he’s quick to announce each
of his items as “futuristic innovations” or “labor-saving
devices” to any who will listen. In truth, he knows little
about how his wares operate; he simply buys them
cheaply and counts on his bluster to justify the markup.
Humphrin Geen: A gaunt, sallow-faced human in an
ill-fitting suit, Humphrin keeps his clockwork wares
on taller-than-normal tables, as though to keep them
away from the hands of halflings or gnomes. In
truth, Humphrin dotes on children and, knowing
that errant springs or grinding
gears might pinch their inquisitive
fingers, doesn’t want them to come
to any harm.
Nettle: This fastidious sunflower
leshy (Pathfinder Bestiary 2 160)
has an exacting attention to detail
and a meticulously sorted table of
spare parts, winding keys, springs,
and other bric-a-brac inventors might
find useful. She finds more delight in
sorting her wares than actually selling them, and
has an unpleasant tendency to comment unfavorably on
customers’ untidy appearances or dirty hands.
Ostinna Barbetler: This stern and fussy dwarf has
a good variety of wares, all clearly marked with fair
prices. The practice of haggling absolutely disgusts
her; if anyone suggests paying even a copper coin
less than the listed price, she unceremoniously ejects
the offender from her stall. She noisily denounces the
“bald-faced skinflint” to vendors nearby, most of whom
ignore her aspersions.
Rargin Hoffnatler: A bear-like Taldan man with a
wide grin and bellowing laugh, Rargin enjoys practical
jokes. Apart from the clockwork toys and devices in his
stall, he keeps a table bearing several joke items such
as itching powders and noisemakers. When customers
are scarce, he deftly incorporates these items into his
ordinary wares, offering the next customer a “close
demonstration” of the trapped device as a prank.

Arcadia has had firearms for over 10,000 years, though
of a distinctly different kind than can be found in the
Inner Sea. In the distant days prior to Earthfall—which
struck Arcadia not with huge, devastating meteors but
with a rain of skymetals across the central continent that
gave rise to great heroes and strange magical effects—
legendary figures bore handheld metal tubes powered by
magic that shot pellets of concentrated arcane energy.
Known as star guns or mystic arms, these guns ranged
from one-handed pistols to long rifles. Most star guns
fired white-hot energy that glowed like a star, giving them
their name, but the most ornate weapons could change
the weapon’s energies by means of cunning switches or
even the user’s sheer will.
Arcadian star guns were carried by great heroes of
legend in central and northern Arcadia, often wandering
law-keepers who fought bandits and monsters to ensure
peace. Sometimes, scheming villains wielded these
powerful weapons to further their own wealth and
influence. Janshar Even-Handed, Valliek Rustboots, and
Deft Onki are among these mythical gunslingers. Anyone
with a star gun could inflict devastating damage, and few
knew any equals beyond other wielders. The Star Code
bound all those who carried such weapons: to never
attack an unarmed opponent, to give parley to the weak
who request it, to eschew deceit, to honor the terms of a
duel, to respect one’s star gun, and many more rules that
vary in the retelling. Villainous wielders at least paid lip
service to the Star Code, though their stories of bending
the letter of the code to suit their own ends appear in folk
tales throughout Arcadia.
Creating a star gun required specialized knowledge. The
most notable crafters (and perhaps the only ones) were
a gaunt, isolationist people who inhabited monasteries
high in the Mildanesi Mountains. Imposing and mute,
with stone crowns protruding from their long heads, these
recluses gave no name for themselves but became known
as the Crowned Regents. Despite their mighty magic and
intricate crafts—which were not limited to the fabulous
starguns—the Crowned Regents showed no interest in

expanding their holdings or their influence. They traded
with a few trusted outsiders, and stories of brave travelers
seeking out a mountaintop monastery to bargain for a
star gun show up in many Arcadian folk tales, such as
Banjara’s Climb and Janshar’s Bold Request. The bustling
city of High Klesh is built around the ruins of the lowest
monastery; its human and halfling inhabitants are wealthy
from relics the Crowned Regents left behind, and the city’s
Spire Council members are each armed with a star gun.
Other monasteries can be found utterly abandoned or
inhabited by dangerous monsters; the Crowned Regents
have vanished into the mists of history and legend.
Today, star guns are exceedingly rare. Discovery of an
intact star gun is a monumental event, and rumors of lost
star guns have inspired generations of treasure-hunters.
Though these fabulous guns are all but gone, the Star Code
has trickled down into modern-day legal code throughout
Arcadia, providing protections to the dispossessed and
downtrodden. The legends of the gunkeepers and their
deeds loom large in Arcadian taletelling.
Lore of the Gun
Guns command respect and authority across Arcadia, a
legacy of the power of the star guns and the gunslingers
who lived the Code. Most people across the continent
have never seen an actual star gun; they know of these
ancient weapons only through legends. This legacy has
proven a fertile ground for invention. For millennia,
inventive and determined Arcadians have devised similar
weapons for generations to capitalize on the power and
prestige of star guns. These guns are the weapons that
now, most commonly, outfit those in authority, or are
wielded by those who challenge that authority.
Technological innovation is at its highest in the
region known as Three Craters, where soot-spewing
factories have an endless appetite for ore. These factories
produce an astonishing number of the most sophisticated
technological marvels on the continent. For centuries,
Three Craters produced air-powered pistols and rifles
that suffered from short range and insufficient stopping
power; as obviously inferior imitations of star guns,
these weapons were of limited use as anything other
than status symbols. About a decade ago, however, new
skymetal forging techniques made their way to Three
Craters. The city’s ruling Smog Lords immediately had
their greatest inventors reverse-engineer these reborn
star guns to replicate them. The conniving Smog Lords
initially tried to keep firearms for their exclusive use;
they realized their edge would disappear if superior guns
became publicly available. Their petulant animosity and
relentless double-dealing meant it wasn’t long before the
secrets of skymetal firearm creation spread to engineers
across the city-state. Factory owners quickly repurposed
their facilities to mass-produce skymetal firearms.
Fierce competition drove costs down and reliability
up, and firearms are now commonplace throughout
Three Craters. They have spread to many places beyond,
even as far as imperialist Razatlan in the distant south
and the subterranean kingdoms of Braskoff to the north.
Further from north-central Arcadia, the hybrid magic
and technology skymetal guns give way to more purely
magical firearms tied to ancient Arcadian traditions;
at the continent’s furthest extremes, magical tradition
is so prevalent that sophisticated technology is as rare
as it is unnecessary. Even among cultures that develop
magic rather than technology, gun lore dating back to
the star guns runs strong. Instead of creating guns from
steel, many of these cultures learned to fashion guns
from bone and magically altered flesh. Millennia ago,
these innovators learned that incorporating components
from powerful monsters made their guns more powerful,
producing creations such as dragon’s-throat firebelchers
and manticore-spike rifles. These beast guns are wholly
different from both the ancient arcane star guns and the
technological marvels of air guns, and their bearers carry
their unique and potent weapons with the honor and
pride common among Arcadian gunslingers.
Over the centuries, wizard-lords and arcane academies
across Arcadia have claimed to unlock the secrets of re-
creating star guns. (These claims are particularly common
in the magocracy of Heyopan, whose Nine Dynasties vie
for political supremacy.) While these skymetal firearms
and their magical firing mechanisms are certainly
impressive, they are not true star guns. Recreation efforts
occasionally produce truly bizarre guns, such as pistols
that use bound elementals to compress air and eject fiery
pellets of metal, rifles that launch bullets of concentrated
daylight, or shotguns that spew fragments of souls. These
inventions are rarely replicable on a large scale and are
often rushed, making for unreliable operation at best and
even a few disastrous mishaps. Yet, a determined hero or
even a curious traveler has a fair chance of locating—or
commissioning—a truly unique gun.
The Deadshot Lands
Arcadia is home to myriad nations, from icy Vallenhall
far to the north, past hero-forged Xopatl near the central
gulfs, all the way to the southern Ghostlands. Guns are
most prevalent in the region known as the Deadshot
Lands in north-central Arcadia, where the lore of the star
guns remains strongest. This region resembles an open
book lying face-down; the Mildanesi Mountains, where
the Crowned Regents once produced their peerless crafts,
run from north to south along its center. Deserts sprawl
to the west, and fertile plains and forests to the east. Each
of these regions echoes with the lore of guns, but these
echoes resound in different ways.
BRIARBOUGH
For untold ages, the vast forest of Briarbough has been the
home of beastkin who live in a loose coalition of treetop
settlements. The beastkin mark their holdings with stone

stelae, but these standing stones don’t denote actual
borders so much as areas of influence warded by ancient
magic. The people of Briarbough rallied together to repel
the invading Fire Army of Razatlan ages ago, whose
incursions torched much of the forest and created the
Firescar, a region still blighted with the invaders’ magic.
The settlements fell into fierce infighting afterward, each
claiming credit for the victory and demanding the Rowan
Rifle. This legendary star gun is
as much a badge of office as it
is a weapon, denoting dominion
over all Briarbough. The rifle is
held by powerful fey custodians
who bequeath it to a deserving
mortal for only one lifetime.
Fashioned from a tree whose roots
drank deeply from djezet (the skymetal
known as quickiron), the weapon doesn’t
discomfort the fey, unlike iron firearms.
That no claimant has yet received the Rowan
Rifle in this current age only intensifies the
clashes among those who believe they deserve it.
Many rulers throughout Briarbough have agents
desperately seeking lost star guns or other firearms,
believing that the fey will award the Rowan Rifle to
superlative gunslingers. Varkesh Wolfpaw, tyrant of
Ninebranches, amasses weapons and militarizes his
people with the aim of taking the Rowan Rifle from the
fey by force. The Firescar Bombers work to thwart his
plans, ranging from the desolate Firescar and slipping past
Varkesh’s enchanted border stelae, but these alchemists
and pyromaniacs are no heroes, either.
CROWNPEAKS
The Mildanesi Mountains comprise an enormous range
running nearly the entire length of Arcadia. The northern
mountains once inhabited by the Crowned Regents are
known today as the Crownpeaks. The few passes through
the region are high and difficult; most become impassable
with ferocious storms and deep snow during the winter.
The wealthy city of High Klesh, in the east, is the best
place to find guides through the Crownpeaks, as its
scouts know how best to negotiate with the Passkeepers,
a confederacy of roc-mounted halflings who watch over
the passes and demand tribute. Some Passkeepers prefer
long rifles to threaten travelers from a safe distance
and are willing to pay handsomely for such weaponry.
The fickle Passkeepers aren’t the only dangers in the
mountains: yeti-like creatures called antimoks, wendigos,
and stranger monsters haunt the peaks. A few smaller
settlements like Oathscrape and Picket Shelf provide
travelers with respite, but hospitality can prove hard to
come by in the mountains.
The Crownpeaks have few natural resources other
than ore, but they bear that ore in abundance. The
most extensive and advanced mining operations are in
the mountains nearest Three Craters, where the Smog
Lords mandate the backbreaking labor that pulls iron,
tin, and silver from large, lucrative mines. These peaks
harbor many smaller veins of these and other useful
metals, including skymetals from Earthfall. Thus, the
Crownpeaks continue to attract hardy individuals and
small companies with a willingness to work and a dream
of striking it rich. Such small-stakes prospectors diligently
guard their claims with picks and guns.
The abandoned monasteries once occupied by the
mysterious Crowned Regents are highly sought after, even
though these ruins tend to harbor dangerous creatures
who value a sheltered lair in the unforgiving peaks. Chief
among these monsters is Dwashtil, a wendigo of such
vast power and authority that other wendigos of
the Crownpeaks call her their master. Some of the
best-explored monasteries have extensive underground
passages, and rumors abound of connections through
these passages to other lost monasteries and deeper
areas inhabited by mysterious creatures that have
never seen daylight.
HALANA THEOCRACY
Northwest of Tazuni, the desert gives way
to rolling, fertile hills and a coastline of
rugged cliffs. Many tengu inhabit this
region, though humans still greatly
outnumber them. Although this
land seems pastoral, it’s under
the firm control of a despotic
government called the Halana
Theocracy. Headquartered in the
many-spired city of Rookery, the
church does its best to control all aspects of life within
its borders, from the timing of crops to the education of
its youth. Far from being an orderly place, however, the
dictates of the church are erratic and often contradictory,
so the nation is one of paranoia, toil, and misery. The
faith itself is no less convoluted, revering an ever-shifting
pantheon of malevolent sky gods centered on the demon
lord Pazuzu. It is heresy to utter the names of any sky
gods of the pantheon; the church claims that doing so
invites corruption and madness. Halana’s leaders, the
three Windborne Theocrats, can control the weather,
although they usually bring storms to evince their wrath
rather than good weather to benefit the populace. They
are known to be physically frail despite their divine
power, as their seals of office are made from a poisonous
skymetal called abysium, or feverstone.
The Halana Theocracy enforces its will through an
elite group of wicked soldiers known as the Mivanians.
Most Mivanians are tengu, but the force admits a fair
number of avian beastkin and tiefling humans with
birdlike features as well. All Mivanians carry beast guns
created from flying monsters, giving them unparalleled
range. For anyone outside the Mivanians, owning a

gun of any kind is a capital offense. An extensive and
surprisingly well-armed rebellion is working to overthrow
the theocracy and has caches of guns hidden throughout
Halana; it only needs to recruit enough heroes willing to
fight to free their land.
ILLANI PLAINS
The sweeping plains across central Arcadia are stained
with old blood. Great civilizations of horselords and their
thunderous mounts have stampeded across these plains for
thousands of years. The western edge of these plains has
seen an age of relative peace in the last few generations,
thanks to the protection afforded by technology from Three
Craters, and the resilience of its orc and human inhabitants.
Ages ago after banding together with a group of
dwarves to defeat a massive gogiteth threat, the orcs of
Arcadia teamed up to assist the dwarves in achieving their
quest to find the surface. The two have been on good terms
ever since. Receiving a poor welcome from the beastkin of
Briarbough, the orcs migrated into the Illani Plains. Rather
than come as conquerors and warmongers, they knew
their struggling people must make peace to survive. The
humans of the plains, recently freed from oppressors to
the east and whose leadership was in turmoil, needed their
aid in turn. Humans and orcs became firm allies and have
been so ever since. Humans contributed their agricultural
and equestrian lore, and orcs brought numerous skills and
secrets from their subterranean homes. Not the least of
these was how to craft trophies torn from monstrous foes
into weapons. Combined with the star gun lore, the people
of the Illani Plains were among the first groups in Arcadia
to create beast guns. Hunts into the caverns beneath the
plains’ ancient buttes provide the raw materials for this
ancient art, still practiced today.
Bountiful farms and ranches across the Illani Plains
feed Three Craters and many other nearby nations.
Even the poorest citizens of Latwaria and Grassbutte,
the largest Illani cities, never fear starvation, although
a malignant plague is spreading in these urban centers.
This plague is kept in check by the region’s gun-toting
priests of Desna (known as “the Lady of Long Grasses”
here), but there’s serious concern for the fate of the region
should the plague spread into the fertile countryside.
TAZUNI
The western desert extending from the Crownpeaks is
bounded to the south by salty Lake Tapipallati, and to the
north by the Halana Theocracy and the cities of the insular
Primal League. This is a wild, dusty land of hard people,
desperate bandits, and steel-eyed law-bringers. Civilization
is clustered in cities such as Altameda, Carama, and New
Hayewood; each is surrounded by hardscrabble farms
and ranches. The land is in dire need of heroes to kill
marauding beasts, track down cattle thieves, and guard
wagons traveling from town to town. Local sheriffs
are often happy for the help—if they aren’t behind the
banditry themselves, as not all lawkeepers live up to the
honor of their badges. The law’s reach in Tazuni doesn’t
extend further than a rifle’s shot, so criminals who vanish
into the desert are free to simply move on elsewhere.
Travel is a way of life in Tazuni. Regular stagecoaches
take settlers, goods, and mail between communities.

Ranchers must keep their great herds of livestock on the
move to ensure they’re adequately fed before being driven
to market. The land’s few rivers are a vital source of life,
as all flow into the undrinkable Lake Tapipallati. Most
large towns are built on rivers; some, such as Carama
on the Carama River, span a waterway with a series of
wooden footbridges crowded with shops, market stalls,
inns, and fishing platforms. Despite picturesque bridges
and crowded piers, these rivers are far from docile.
Aquatic dangers on these waterways pose as much
trouble as bandits on stagecoach lines.
Tale-telling is a strong Tazunian tradition. Visitors are
expected to tell stories of past exploits, whether their own
or another’s, real or exaggerated. Stories are expected to
be free; thus, many bards and other storytellers must also
gamble at dice or cards in dusty saloons to make ends meet.
Headstone Rolsk, a cunning stone giant necromancer
who collects tombstones and hurls them at his foes,
recently combined several human and halfling gangs under
his brutal leadership, and supplemented the growing
Headstone Gang with ghouls he’s animated. Rolsk is
rumored to be stepping up the Headstone Gang’s activities
from robbery and livestock butchery to assaults on
towns. The feckless sheriff of New Hayewood, Brondell
Chanrodine, actively ignores rumors of Rolsk’s movement
near his town, much to the dismay of the townspeople.
THREE CRATERS
A massive city-state situated between three large lakes in
north-central Arcadia, Three Craters is one of Arcadia’s
largest metropolises. Its soot-belching factories produce
technological marvels unequaled in Arcadia, and perhaps
across the world. The ruling Smog Lords do their best
to assert control over the region, but their constant
infighting undercuts the draconian authority they crave.
Three Craters is exceptionally cosmopolitan; in addition
to extensive trade connections with the cities of High
Klesh, Latwaria, and Grassbutte in neighboring nations,
Three Craters has extensive dealings with the region
known as the Land of Northern Lakes to the northeast.
Three Craters has a virtually unending appetite for ore
with which to construct its technology. The Smog Lords
employ undersea miners who pull ore from the waters
of the three surrounding lakes (the pristine Moon’s Tear,
murky Oilpan, and misty Lake Awnkawak) and control
mining interests in the eastern Crownpeaks. Trade
agreements with the skymetal-rich Land of Northern Lakes
bring staggeringly valuable shipments along iron-cobbled
and heavily patrolled roads to the east.
Although most denizens of Three Craters are humans,
sizable populations of halflings, ratfolk, and an insectile
race called klinkois also live here. People divide much
more often by social class rather than ancestry and thus
mix frequently. Firearms are common enough that nearly
everyone knows how to maintain and operate one, and
bows are viewed as quaint and anachronistic.
DEADSHOT LANDS TIMELINE
The Deadshot Lands is not the only large, thematically
linked region in Arcadia. (The Primal League to the north,
the Land of Northern Lakes to the northeast, Salt Stretch
to the south, and Fallen Razatlan to the southeast are
some of many others.) The following are some key dates
in the history of the Deadshot Lands.

Golarion shuddered 10,000 years ago when Earthfall
fractured the land, scattering its inhabitants and obliterating
the ancient Azlanti civilization. As ejecta shadowed the
sky, plants withered, trade networks disintegrated, and
Golarion’s societies crumbled, casting the planet into a
literal dark age of bitter survivalism. Yet, scraps of Azlanti
culture survived. Centuries later, along the southern coast
of the newly formed Inner Sea, the illiterate young local
Arustun uncovered a cache of Azlanti writings. Whether
through supernatural enlightenment or natural genius, he
somehow deciphered the texts, using these rediscovered
secrets to revolutionize his local communities. Arustun
swiftly exhausted the texts and craved more. With the help
of his wife, Minurna, and friend Venistos, he built a ship to
sail the seas in search of scattered cultures and other lost
literature—a voyage that eventually saw him traveling to
other planes of existence! Upon his return decades later,
he compiled his tales into the Poleiheira, a book of legends
and teachings that proved foundational throughout the
civilization Arustun helped found: the Jistka Imperium.
This new monarchy focused primarily on technological
development and military expansion, styling itself as an
empire that would unite humanity in a new golden age.
At its disposal, the Imperium boasted two crucial tools:
extraplanar servants and magical artifice. In his travels,
Arustun forged myriad connections to beings aligned with
law and the elements, and the powerful magistrates that
arose in the Jistka Imperium maintained that tradition
by conjuring the likes of aeons and genies to command
armies and evangelize the imperial vision for a bright (if
nonnegotiable) future. Meanwhile, Jistkan priest-artificers
adapted incomplete Azlanti clockwork manuscripts to
create their own schools of golemcraft and mechanization
that far surpassed their predecessors.
The Jistka Imperium’s arrogance and belligerence
stunted its growth and stability. Magistrates and
priest-artificers increasingly competed for power and
influence within the growing aristocracy. The inexorable
conquests of the Imperium’s supernatural armies branded
Jistka as evil invaders in the eyes of its neighbors.

Only Osirion’s ascendancy to the east united the
Imperium’s efforts, and the two nations clashed bitterly
in a war of attrition that Jistka slowly lost, though not
before creating and conjuring extremely dangerous
beings that threatened to destroy the Imperium as readily
as they devastated its enemies. At last, Jistka crumbled
under imperial succession crises and warfare, ground to
dust by Osirion’s equally grim armies.
Unlike the cultural revivals enjoyed by Thassilon and
Osirion, Jistka has remained a dead and largely forgotten
civilization whose influence rarely resurfaces directly.
Archaeologists and explorers occasionally uncover pristine
ruins or emergency caches where the Imperium hid golems
for a final counterattack. However, Jistka’s living legacy
also survives in automatons (page 36), who have started
reappearing after a millennia-long hiatus.
Infused Constructs
Without an animating force, a construct is merely a glorified
statue. While more ethically built constructs rely on a
powerful mote of positive energy, each Jistkan construct
required a trapped entity such as an earth elemental—the
more cumbersome the golem, the more powerful the bound
spirit needed. Although original Jistkan constructs are
now rare enough that most think of them as a monolithic
technology, the Imperium’s golemcraft techniques evolved
steadily over more than a thousand years as artificers
rediscovered lost techniques, tested theories, exhausted
resources, invented new tools, and laid groundwork for
construct design in the modern era.
ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCTS
During his voyages, Arustun uncovered and compiled
fragments of lost Azlanti clockwork and its underlying
theory. His companions eagerly deciphered these
techniques and created several of their own ticking
servitors, yet their clockwork creations always felt
hollow and lifeless—serviceable replicas of another
culture’s technology that didn’t reflect Jistkan values and
Arustun’s own vision. Early Jistkans had built grand cities,
attracting the scattered peoples of northern Garund to
prosper there. As the fledgling artificers reasoned, their
own constructs should arise in the same way, by creating
a magnificent articulated home, magically coaxing spirits
into the physical bodies, and benefiting from those new
inhabitants’ labor as recompense. Thus, these Jistkans
gradually developed their own golem technology powered
not by springs and gears, but by elementals inhabiting and
animating the lifeless bodies.
But how? Modern golemcraft often relies on arcane
spellcasting. Despite having unearthed elements of
Azlanti clockwork, these Jistkans lived centuries before
the legendary spellcaster Old-Mage Jatembe brought
arcane magic back to Golarion. Therefore, the magic
that bound these first Jistkan golems evolved from time-
honored traditions of oral history, story craft, and occult
magic. Rather than forcibly bind elementals, these earliest
artificers imbued each golem with a compelling narrative.
Once a free-willed elemental drew near, the magic drew
it in, trapping it both inside a powerful body and within
an insidious story that reinforced loyalty to the golem’s
master. No doubt many artificers believed they had done
these elementals a favor by providing a home, and some
freed the trapped spirits after years of indentured servitude.
Yet at the core, this magic was glorified brainwashing,
and it laid the foundation for a millennium of subsequent
elemental enslavement.
Although reliance on elementals remained steady, the
techniques and demands evolved with time. The occult
techniques suffered from inherent limits, for capturing
errant elementals required careful customization and could
only ensnare those beings already wandering northern
Garund. Once the supply ran low, golem creation slowed.
A more economical and direct option later developed once
arcane magic was reintegrated into Jistkan technologies:
conjuring a limitless supply of elementals from the planes
into waiting construct bodies. With supply constraints
removed, golem creation expanded from a prestige craft
to an imperial industry, supported by a growing class of
priest-artificers who constructed arcane spell work to
power their creations. While these artificers maintained
some of their predecessors’ cultural values, traditional
binding rituals couldn’t compete with these new arcane
solutions, and the occult techniques faded from practice
and memory. Even in the modern era, Jistkan arcane
binding methodology forms the core of golem creation,
and the older occult approaches remain extremely rare.
For every problem solved, though, another arose. The
hypnotic narrative trapping elementals in occult golems
functioned like a maze, always redirecting the elemental’s
thoughts and tricking it deeper into the mental trap.
Arcane techniques act more like prisons, relying on raw
power and careful formulas to restrain their captives. But
no wall is impervious. Under great stress, an arcane golem’s
animating force strains at—and sometimes breaks free
of—these barriers. To bystanders, this struggle resembles
confusion and violent rage as the elemental’s desperate
struggles seize control of its artificial body before the
magic regains control.
Despite this, only the arcane designs could meet
Jistka’s needs, for their armies increasingly relied on large
quantities of ready-made golems as labor, shock troops,
and guardians. Jistkan miners and loggers directed golems
to harvest ever vaster resources to trade for reagents and
fuel the forges. Northern Garund’s arid conditions partly
hearken to this ravenous expansion. Few could oppose the
Imperium’s full might, at least until Osirion’s rise.
FIEND CONSTRUCTS
At first a distant curiosity to the east, Osirion grew quickly,
trespassing on Jistka’s spheres of influence and intercepting
crucial trade that sustained the Imperium. Tensions erupted
213
213

PAGE 215
================================================================================

into all-out war, and what early advantages Jistka enjoyed,
it lost to the centuries-old infighting between magisters
and artificers. By the time the Imperium could present a
united front, Osirion not only had the tools to devastate
its foes’ combined golem, genie, and mortal armies, but it
also developed insidious strategies to weaken Jistka from
within, such as the dreaded Night Plague. With its resources
dwindling, Jistka needed a new, unbeatable weapon.
The answer came from its northern territories, created in
the forge city of Rachikan and quickly shared among artificer
bastions. For generations, builders relied on capable and
relatively compliant elementals to power constructs. Under
pressure to supply shock troops, Rachikan’s engineers
began conjuring fiends to animate golems instead. In many
ways, it was brilliant. Fiends already displayed a penchant
for possession, so a greater fraction of their raw power
could transfer to the golems’ mechanical bodies, and a hint
of their intelligence manifested as rudimentary cunning
that granted the golems greater adaptability in combat.
Unlike elementals, many of the fiends also openly made
bargains with the priest-artificers to willingly inhabit the
lifeless statues, greatly reducing the cost of binding and
restraining the extraplanar entities.
Many fiends were stronger than their Inner Plane
counterparts, allowing them to empower ever-larger war
machines. The resulting fiend-infused golems provided
exactly what the desperate Imperium needed, allowing the
creation of legendary engines such as the dreaded behemoth
fortress golem, an elephantine walking fortress that
towered more than 50 feet tall and collapsed conventional
fortifications with the sheer force of its footsteps.
Although these fiendish golems at first obliterated
their opposition, tales of dire mishaps quickly tainted
the victories. A typical golem always ran the risk of its
elemental spirit rebelling; these new golems were rarely
built strongly enough to contain the fiendish fury sealed
within. The constructs regularly entered battle rages that
their commanders couldn’t control, often resulting in the
fiend breaking free entirely in a burst of unholy energy.
Even those inhabited by willing fiends ran amok. The only
blessing was that these blasphemous terrors
inflicted far more damage against the
Imperium’s Osirian enemies than
against their so-called allies.
Had
the
Imperium’s
artificers
drawn upon the magistrates’ expertise
in binding extraplanar creatures, and had
a gruesome war not limited their testing,
this foray into fiend-powered constructs
might have produced reliable, relatively safe
results. However, the artificers had developed
these war machines in relative secrecy, and to
avoid losing face to their magistrate rivals,
they actively destroyed evidence and sowed
disinformation to hide their experimental
constructs’ rampages. The Imperium might
not have cared. Succession crises and
assassination plots left the upper echelons in
disarray, and pretenders regularly sponsored
and claimed credit for any victories against
Osirion, no matter the circumstances, so
long as it supported their own agendas. So,
more demons, daemons, and devils poured
into construct shells.
Fiend-infused constructs were ultimately
unstable, not just in battle but in the passage of
years, with many of the fiends breaking freeing
in the millennia since. Thus, rediscovered Jistkan
golems are most often powered by elementals.
Combined with the pains some artificers took
to conceal their unholy creations’ misdeeds or
destroy their own research, the techniques for
creating constructs and binding fiends within
them barely survived the ages. However, with
the recent rediscovery of Rachikan, these
deadly secrets are increasingly accessible to
the most reckless engineers.

MORTAL CONSTRUCTS
Jistka was dying. Assailed by enemies from without
and internecine rot from within, it was only a matter of
time before the Imperium crumbled, its extraordinary
innovations obliterated by Osirion’s armies. In a last-ditch
effort to salvage their culture and sciences, a relatively
scrupulous cabal formed the Artificer Conclave, dedicated
to preserving its ways and ultimately restoring the Imperium
to its former glory. Within a few years, several members
had perished, and the survivors could see the impossible
enormity of their task. They could never achieve their goals
alone, and they certainly could never do so as infirmity and
attrition whittled down their numbers. In response, they
adapted their golemcraft traditions to accept a different
type of animating force: not an elemental or a fiend, but
their own mortal life forces and souls.
The experiments exceeded all expectations, far
surpassing any previous golemcraft in its intricacy and
performance. Known as an automaton (page 36), each of
these constructs preserved the intelligence, personality, and
skills of its mortal subject, all while providing the mortal
a golem’s physical might and longevity. The secret was
the automaton core, a marvelous fusion of spellcasting
traditions that sustained the mortal’s soul and powered
the automaton’s body. As with a lich’s phylactery, the
core’s destruction would destroy the individual. In theory,
the artificers hoped that if the core survived, it could be
transplanted into a new automaton body, allowing each
preserved Jistkan to survive even apparent destruction.
The Conclave swiftly recruited Jistka’s best, brightest,
and most scrupulous, creating a host of automatons
that preserved these paragons. Most of these champions
scattered across Golarion and the planes, seeking military
aid against the Imperium’s enemies, magic to rebuild the
Imperium’s devastated cities, and philosophies to restore
the Imperium’s soul. Insulated by immortal bodies and
confronted with the infinite potential of the planes, many
of these seekers became distracted, realizing that the
Imperium had already crumbled only by the time they
returned from a casual century of research. Others secured
help but returned to realize it was too little, too late; the
Imperium had become too beleaguered and too morally
bankrupt to save. Those who remained in northern Garund
fared little better; a few organized resistance forces to stave
off Osirion and imperial pretenders alike were destroyed
or scattered by the impossible odds. Others shepherded
Jistkan survivors to forgotten sanctuaries, where they
either abandoned their old affiliations or perished, leaving
only their demoralized automaton guardians.
Ultimately, the Artificer Conclave disintegrated. No
known record of its members survives, much less explains
where they went. While automatons still exist across the
multiverse, there’s no telling just how numerous they are.
Several live on Axis, where they dwell among the aeons
that inspired the earliest Jistkans. At least a few still roam
Golarion; among these, some cling to a fading Jistkan
dream, while others long ago forgot their futile quest
and adopted new causes. Others remain only as cores,
helplessly trapped in broken bodies or collapsed ruins.
Whatever the case, passing ages have reinforced one of
the automatons’ greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches.
For beings meant to live a century, only the strongest willed
have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and
lucidity after more than 8,000 years. Many automatons
can’t recall their ancient pasts. Others have developed
nervous tics as their minds wrestle with immortality.
Others still have dissociated completely from their mortal
identities, slowly transforming into emotionless constructs
except for fleeting moments where they can remember
what it means to be alive. With so few of the Conclave left,
it’s no wonder the secret to creating cores is presumed lost.
JISTKAN RUINS
Time and ancient Osirian vendettas demolished many
of Jistka’s wonders, yet forgotten sites periodically
resurface, tempting explorers the world over.
Lost Yemal: Once a remote town along Jistka’s
southern border, Yemal was one of the last refuges
from Osirion’s wrath. Jistkan officials hid many of the
Imperium’s greatest treasures there, sealing them within
a foreboding tomb. Osirion at last crushed the town,
but some supernatural force trapped and consumed
any soldiers who entered the tomb. The monument still
stands, daring any who would steal Jistka’s last legacy.
Rachikan: Considered the greatest forge city, Rachikan
was built within one of the massive Pillars of Anferita
rising along Cheliax’s west coast. There it refined and
created the terrifying fiend-infused golems until an
earthquake buried much of the city. Looters scavenged
from the upper ruins, yet many of the constructs remain
functional and vigilant, and the city was forgotten
and rediscovered by Pathfinders only a decade ago. In
addition to the animated marvels sealed inside, rumors
speak of territorial morlocks dwelling within the deepest
levels; their language, tools, and religion all resemble
Jistkan ones.
Teskra: The so-called Hanging City spanned a massive
canyon in Rahadoum’s Napsune Mountains, serving as
a crowning achievement late in Jistka’s rule. In addition
to its magnificent bridges, Teskra housed palatial
gardens occupied by wondrously lifelike constructs
that resembled and behaved like real animals. Shortly
after Teskra’s completion, citizens began disappearing
mysteriously, with all of the city’s dwindling population
wordlessly vanishing into the mountains in –3388 ar. In
the millennia since, the construct creatures have escaped
and roam the city freely, maintained by equally lifelike
yet ageless humanoid caretakers. No doubt some of
Jistka’s greatest construct technologies lie hidden within
Teskra’s ruins.
215

PAGE 217
================================================================================

Grafts
Any construct requires an animating energy that shapes
its powers and personality. While most Jistkan artifice
involved binding whole beings into artificial shells, it’s
equally viable to draw trace amounts of a host’s life essence
to power a prosthesis.
The earliest of these magical grafts were ponderous,
designed with technologies appropriate for towering golems
yet ill-suited for a living host’s comparably delicate joints
and mortal constitutions. With time came sophistication,
and by the Imperium’s zenith, prostheses were lightweight,
and sleek. Given the Age of Anguish’s many dangers,
such prostheses were commonplace, and the mechanical
advantages drove some to acquire artificial augmentations
to replace even fully functioning limbs. The aristocracy
marveled at prostheses so lifelike as to be indistinguishable
from flesh, artificial limbs made from precious metals with
interchangeable decorative elements, and arms infused
with magical spells the user could channel.
Records and inscriptions show a sudden decline in
prosthesis quality and a spike in pervasiveness as Jistka’s
wars with Osirion progressed, with rush jobs and
dwindling resources providing the bare minimum before
sending an augmented combatant back to the front lines
of the generations-long conflict. With incalculable golem
scrap salvaged from the battlefields, many prostheses
from the Imperium’s final centuries were recycled from
destroyed constructs. Not only were these limbs a poor
fit for their users, but also traces of the former animating
spirits sometimes infected the new hosts—a phenomenon
the desperate military tried to weaponize to limited effect.
Ultimately, a combination of unsafe practices and
the Osirian armies’ obliteration of Jistkan cities put
an end to the millennium-long prosthesis tradition,
burying it until its rediscovery and revival in 4327 ar.
Unearthed by Rahadoumi treasure-hunters, these first five
prostheses found their way to a pair of artificer studios
in Manaket, where able inventors deciphered and adapted
the technology. In the four centuries since, golem-based
prosthesis use in Rahadoum has become more widespread
and inexpensive, all the more so because grafting
replacement limbs bypasses the divine regeneration magic
so disdained there. This technology reached the wider
world’s attention in 4660 ar, when unsanctioned explorers
looted a few original prostheses in Napsune Mountain
ruins and published their findings in the Pathfinder
Chronicles as though they were their own inventions. The
article was quickly debunked and retracted, though it has
fueled concerns of industrial theft ever since.
Despite many improvements over Jistkan designs, the
article drove a ravenous demand for the millennia-old
originals, many of which still function properly. However,
just as recycled golem components instilled some of the
former golem’s old energy and personality into their new
hosts ages ago, these antique prostheses occasionally imbue
their new users with disjointed memories, quirks, or even
magical abilities. Several residents of Rahadoum began
worshipping long-forgotten Jistkan deities shortly after
installation, putting Rahadoum’s Pure Legion on edge.
Even so, prosthesis tourism remains a thriving yet
minor industry in Manaket, with disabled visitors
arriving from half a continent away to receive a new
limb or eye. Alternatives exist, yet few can compare to
the sleek and overall seamless Rahadoumi technology.
Magnimar’s Golemworks and Kaer Maga’s Ardoc family
both dabble in the technology, yet rarely offer the service
publicly. Absalom’s Clockwork Cathedral and Alkenstar’s
foundries have likewise created experimental clockwork
limbs, though these mechanical solutions require more
maintenance than golem limbs. And while Nex’s fleshforges
and Geb’s necrograft markets both provide functional
prostheses, few are willing to stomach these grisly options.
JISTKAN ADVENTURES
Millennia and malice have ground much of Jistka’s ruins
to dust, yet in places, its physical legacy survives and can
drive exciting adventures.
Evil Engineering: Bound to an incomplete iron golem
forgotten in an ancient workshop and recently recovered
for a museum, an ice devil has regained its free will and
now makes deals telepathically with anyone visiting the
Jistka exhibit. Several of its dupes have planned a heist
to steal their silent master’s golem body in anticipation
of greater crimes.
Forbidden Faiths: After millennia wandering the planes,
a powerful automaton returns to find Jistka demolished
and his homeland occupied by a godless regime. Learning
that several sacred Jistkan sites remain undiscovered, the
automaton assembles teams to infiltrate Rahadoum and
extract holy treasures for safekeeping, all while evading
the Pure Legion.
Old Debts: An extended family of shaitans served
Jistka in its wars, and the descendants have appeared
in Rahadoum, demanding that Jistka pay its old debts or
suffer punishment. The genies’ contract seems altered to
extort vast sums and interest, yet without a Jistkan copy
for comparison, Rahadoumi negotiators can’t convince
the shaitans to drop the complaint. Rahadoum has issued
a call for capable explorers to enter the ruins of Lost
Yemal in search of the tablet that preserves this ancient
debt’s original terms.
Sleeper Agent: Recycled Jistkan prostheses sometimes
impart ancient memories to their new hosts, and an
unearthed prosthesis still resonates with a long-dead
Jistkan magistrate’s hatred for Osirion. Now installed in
a new host, the limb has subtly taken control and begun
plotting the Ruby Prince’s assassination. Worse, dozens
of powerful elementals owed the magistrate favors, and

Unafraid to ruthlessly pillage black powder technology
to get what they wanted, the pirates of the Shackles
became one of the first groups to gain enough access to
the new firearms coming from Alkenstar’s Gunworks
to truly embrace them. A typical Free Captain controls
a single vessel, often a small cutter or sloop, and if
they’re lucky, they might have replaced some of their
ballistas and catapults with cannons. Those with more
renown command larger vessels, or even multiple ships.
This advantage comes with an increased dependence on
supplies: cannons without powder are just ballast. The
increased use of guns has forced these captains to find
adequate amounts of powder, shot, and well-trained crew
to keep their vessel properly armed.
The first firearms in the Shackles were flintlocks and
pistols—the result of sporadic robberies, smuggling, and
black-market deals. While firearms could be carried by
individual members of a ship’s crew, they were initially
seen as a weak pirate’s folly. As gunpowder weapons
became more widely available through more daring raids,
personal firearms were eventually, grudgingly accepted as
valid weapons. As decades passed, they became the ranged
weapon of choice for most pirates across the region—
though incendiary risks have many pirates sticking to
bows. Despite the ever-present danger of fire on a ship,
pirates find that the noise, smoke, and confusion generated
by a gun battle provides an advantage in the pursuit of
murder and looting.
Compared to firearms, heavy guns such as cannons were
much trickier to steal and thus didn’t appear in the Shackles
until recently. Several Free Captains somehow managed
to get their hands on a few and began arming their ships
with cannons instead of ballistas or scatterguns. The
Chelaxian navy eventually captured one of these vessels
and slowly adopted the weaponry for itself, concentrating
its few cannon-armed ships in small, elite, anti-pirate
flotillas scouring the Arcadian Ocean. As time went on and
both sides saw increased cannon usage, individual ship
skirmishes became far bloodier and more decisive, usually
ending in the complete destruction of one ship or the other.

CANNONS AND NAVAL BATTLES
217

================================================================================

The Balance of Power
In 4715 AR, Captain Tessa Fairwind (CN female half-elf
pirate) unseated the former leader of the Pirate Council,
the Hurricane King Kerdak Bonefist, and took his place,
leading her fleet against an invading armada from
Cheliax and ending the battle with an overwhelming
victory. Captain Fairwind’s bravado and derring-do
impressed many a ship’s company, most of whom see her
as a near-mythical figure befitting her title of Hurricane
Queen. By contrast, many of the Free Captains (and even
some on the Pirate Council) are concerned by her risky
behavior and wonder how long Captain Fairwind’s luck
will last. Even those without the backbone for an outright
coup are positioning themselves for the day when news of
Captain Fairwind’s untimely death finally arrives.
In the bloody battles that led to her new title as
Hurricane Queen, Captain Fairwind saw firsthand the
power of cannons at sea, and she realized that it would
change the nature of naval power forever. Seizing the
opportunity and momentum gained by her victory
over the Chelaxian armada, she set about arming as
many Shackles vessels with cannons and black powder
bombards as she possibly could. With many nations vying
for the relatively limited supply of heavy guns stolen or
smuggled from Alkenstar, Captain Fairwind couldn’t
obtain the required number of guns for her fleet through
commerce alone, a fact that suited her daredevil nature
particularly well.
Beginning in late 4719 AR, Shackles pirates began
raiding cargo vessels carrying newly forged cannons
to Vidrian with uncanny foresight, despite Vidrian’s
attempts to use troops and naval vessels to protect
their precious (and dangerous) cargo. Thus, many of
the cannons purchased by Vidrian specifically to defend
against the pirate threat ended up arming pirate vessels
instead. An intensive investigation by Alkenstar revealed
that agents of the Hurricane Queen had infiltrated
not only every port used for the trade, but even the
Gunworks itself, allowing Shackles pirates to claim the
guns before they reached their buyers. Around the same
time, Shackles pirates began offering a choice to the gun
crews of any ships they captured: join the pirates or die.
Either way, they reduced the trained gun crew available
to their enemies and simultaneously helped address the
shortage of trained gun crew among pirates. This did,
however, have a side effect of increasing the rate of gun
crew mutinies, which have become a growing problem.
In response to these raids, Vidrian began sending
troops to escort cannons on a long and dangerous
overland journey to try to avoid the pirates’ schemes,
recruiting brave adventurers to protect the cannons
after thoroughly vetting the adventurers to ensure they
weren’t in the Hurricane Queen’s pocket. Those caravans
must deal with numerous other threats and dangers as
they cross Garund, and who knows what ambush the
Hurricane Queen has in store for them?
A New Source
Although her recent activities have kept cannons from
becoming a major weapon for her enemies, Captain Tessa
Fairwind was not able to obtain as many heavy guns for
her vessels as she desired. The limited supply and long
travel times from Alkenstar meant her fleet wouldn’t have
the firepower to stand against a combined assault from
two or more of her enemies for at least several years.
To remedy this situation, Captain Fairwind has turned
to a secret ally, a crafty goblin pirate named Volmurk (CN
male goblin inventor). Volmurk was gravely wounded in
a battle with the Chelaxian navy a decade before, losing
an arm and both legs to a broadside from a Chelaxian
man-of-war. Unable to continue life as a pirate, Volmurk
returned to his roots as a tinker and inventor, fashioning
a custom wheelchair to move about more freely and a
mechanical apparatus to serve in place of his lost hand.
Over time, Volmurk used the riches from his pirating life
to build a workshop in the pirate port of Quent, making
prosthetic limbs, mechanical devices, and the occasional
steam-powered mechanism for his customers. As his
reputation grew, Volmurk’s unconventional approach to
engineering led him to experiment with larger and more
dangerous devices. His attempt to create a steam-powered
flying machine led to an explosion that destroyed several
warehouses along Quent’s dockside and brought him to
Captains Fairwind’s attention once again.
Together, starting in 4720 AR, Volmurk and
Captain Fairwind hatched a daring plan: they would
reverse engineer black powder weapons from Alkenstar
and manufacture their own versions to equip the pirate
fleet. Tessa helped Volmurk arrange an “accident” that
destroyed his old workshop and supposedly killed him
and his best workers. With her support, Volmurk set up
a new workshop near the caldera of an active volcano
at the heart of Motaku Isle and set about trying to
recreate the Alkenstar cannons. After almost a year of
experimentation, Volmurk, concealing his identity behind
the anonymous moniker of “Chief Inventor,” discovered
a forging method that allows cannon barrels to withstand
the intense pressure of the powder explosion without
the fracturing that had made earlier cannons such a
risky proposition. The first of these “new” cannons was
test-fired at sea in mid-4721 AR; the first cannon to
survive its test-firing without dangerous misfires or burst
barrels followed two months later. Production of the
weapons began at a breakneck pace that cared little for
quality control or safety.
To handle the sale of these unreliable weapons, Captain
Fairwind set up the Motaku Isle Iron Works as a front.
The company sells common ironware and metal ship
fittings from its smithies located in Quent, but only a Free
Captain can purchase the guns and ammunition made in
the volcanic forge by the Chief Inventor and his team.
The new designs weren’t quite up to Alkenstar
standards, though, and the manufacturing process wasn’t

without its problems. By using a volcano’s natural heat
to power the forge and generate steam for the assembly
mechanisms, the engineers lost the degree of control over
the forging process necessary to ensure consistency. As a
result, some gun barrels from the Motaku Isle Iron Works
burst in combat, ruining the gun and often injuring
the crew. A few have exploded violently, although this
occurred in the heat of battle, so no one has yet been able
to attribute such an occurrence to faulty manufacturing.
As Motaku Isle Iron Works weapons become more
common on pirate vessels, however, the truth is likely to
come out unless Volmurk can improve his production
process while meeting the pirates’ insatiable demand for
black powder weaponry. It remains to be seen if Captain
Fairwind can weather the storm of opposition she’ll face
when the Free Captains learn it’s her company producing
the faulty cannons. In game terms, Motaku cannons and
weapons always have a chance to misfire, regardless of
attempts to upkeep them during daily preparations.
Uneven Distribution
While firearms from both Alkenstar and Motaku Isle
Iron Works are slowly finding their way to other parts
of the Inner Sea, the numbers and sources are far
from even. With the Free Captains constantly coming
into conflict with the navies of Cheliax, Vidrian, and
Rahadoum, many Motaku cannons and firearms have
been confiscated. Due to Volmurk’s sly habit of stamping
some of his knockoffs with marks and crests normally
used to identify the gunsmith who created a particular
weapon in Alkenstar, these appropriated weapons are
occasionally redistributed as gifts to naval officers by
well-meaning superiors who lack the familiarity with
firearms to distinguish between a Motaku knock-off and
an Alkenstar original.
As a Free Captain of significant skill and renown,
privateer Stella Fane (CN female human privateer) has
access to purchase firearms and cannons from Motaku
Isle Iron Works. She’s also a double-agent working for
the Pathfinder Society, using her ship and connections
to smuggle Pathfinder agents past pirate blockades and
even into Port Peril itself. Stella occasionally purchases
shipments of Motaku cannons and firearms to resell to
the Pathfinder Society and its agents.
Due to the Pathfinders recording and publishing
their adventures, recent stories have begun to
include cautionary tales of muskets and pistols
bursting mid-fight. More traditional smiths and
bowyers leap on these tales, repeating them to
their customers while suggesting a reliable mace or
crossbow as a safer weapon for an aspiring adventurer.
Though Motaku Isle Iron Works has greatly increased
the accessibility of firearms, the storied unreliability of
those same weapons has begun to breed a concerned
mistrust of black powder weapons in other parts of
the Inner Sea.
Naval Encounters In
The Shackles
There have been occasional engagements between Free
Captain vessels and those of the Land of the Linnorm
Kings, but nothing approaching a fleet battle. Raiding
ships from both sides occasionally range far enough afield
that they encounter each other. Once battle is joined,
these fights rarely end without the sinking of one side
or the other, and the Ulfen longships now often move to
ram Shackles pirate ships on sight rather than risk taking
cannon fire.

As some of the first places in the world to have black
powder, the nations and kingdoms of Tian Xia and Vudra
each have their own array of black powder technology,
most of which evolved from the basic designs of the
earliest tools and weapons that used explosives. Over
the years, the formula for black powder has changed
from time to time depending on usage, leading to some
discoveries being lost and later uncovered and improved
upon. Today, in addition to domestic inventions such as
fireworks and fire lances, firearms from other continents
are becoming slightly less rare, despite many attempts to
limit their spread.
Tian Xia
The discovery of black powder was a long process that
began in a remote region of what would be east Minkai
today. For centuries, mines and quarries in this particular
area often experienced cave-ins and rock falls after an
explosion. For a while, many believed that the introduction
of air and candle flame into the area caused the collapse.
It was not until the last few centuries of the Yixing empire
that alchemists took an interest in the phenomenon and
began experimenting on the mineral composition of the
terrain around these accident sites.
After concluding that the combination of sulfur, saltpeter,
and graphite dust were the culprits, miners used this
knowledge to survey for potentially dangerous locations
to avoid. As the demand for stone grew from construction
needs, however, people realized that perhaps the explosive
nature of the mixture could be put to good use.
Formulation was a dangerous and tedious task, and
many researchers died before one particularly stable
and reliable formula emerged. From this, many mining
companies developed their own formulas, which
they guarded jealously. Weaker versions also started
circulating among the common people, which saw some
usage in areas such as agriculture, fishing, and festivities.
Even magic users began using the powder in tandem with
fire-related spells, though its volatile nature drove many
to stay away.

The use of black powder in combat did not arise until the
dissolution of the Yixing empire. The conflict between the
rebels saw many instances of sabotage and defensive traps,
usually directed at cavalry troops. The rampant usage and
casualties caused left a deep impression on the first Emperor
of Shu. Once he came to power, he quickly mandated that
the substance—and creation of it—was prohibited unless
closely monitored by officials. While this greatly limited the
capacity of developing new technologies surrounding black
powder, it also pushed inventors to refine their creations to
pass the intense scrutiny of the imperial regulators.
FIREWORKS
Fireworks were among the first “creations” of black
powder technology, as the impurities and poor packing
technique of earlier mixes resulted in many unexpectedly
colorful explosions and accidental rockets.
During the rebellion that founded Shu, fireworks were
used as flares to send various signals to reinforcements,
or to report on an outcome of a battle at a far distance.
Officials seized the workhouses that created these flares
after the war and the majority were able to transition
into firework factories—a handful of which still exist
today. Rather than attempt to control these companies,
the government took over crucial mines and now oversee
the logistics of supplying them. Some factories only receive
enough to make small firecrackers and boxed fireworks,
while others are given so much that they must create large
and elaborate fireworks in order to use up their quota.
In addition, using bamboo test containers, the noise
they made proved to be an incredibly effective means
of scaring birds or monkeys that were preying on farm
produce. Because of this, some came to believe that the
noise, heat, and color of the explosions could ward off
evil, and began to use small fireworks during religious and
cultural ceremonies and celebrations. The use of fireworks
to celebrate the coming-of-age of the first heir of the Shu
Empire cemented the practice in history.
Flowers are a popular inspiration and theme for
designing fireworks, followed by other natural phenomena
such as rivers and snow. One can often tell an origin of a
firework by the flower depicted, such as chrysanthemum
for Minkai and mugunghwa for Hwanggot. Occasionally,
rich benefactors will commission fireworks with a religious
theme. A particularly famous example is the Thundering
Rainclouds created by Kwanlai’s first domestic fireworks
house. Dedicated to Hei Feng, the Duke of Thunder, the
roaring effect mimicked a real thunderstorm so closely that
many unaware inhabitants near the testing site evacuated
out of precaution, expecting a flood.
EXPLOSIVES
The usage of black powder in mines and quarries naturally
led to their use during warfare, particularly to induce
environmental hazards such as rockfall or avalanches.
The indiscriminate nature of the effects, in particular an
avalanche that killed both troops and commoners in the
thousands before the founding of Minkai, caused local
populations to resent the saboteurs. Over time, however,
the army engineers developed more precise explosives.
First came thrown black powder bombs, which offer a
variety of benefits, such as breaking enemy lines of sight
with smoke, making the air difficult to breathe, creating
sparks to scare mounts, and potentially injuring enemies.
The difficulty in precisely timing and throwing these
bombs, however, saw a shift in tactics after the collapse
of the Shu empire. Various groups began to develop land
THE SECRET OF BLACK POWDER
There are many tales of how the formulation of black
powder came about, most steeped with rumors and
hearsay. Some of the wilder stories do share surprising
commonalities, citing a competition between adventurers
going into the Darklands to retrieve a legendary alchemy
manual said to contain many astounding formulas—the
black powder formula among them. The story of Kana
is the most widely told, though also the most easily
disproved. After many expeditions, failures, and deaths, a
single explorer named Kana (heritage and gender lost to
time) emerged unscathed with a ripped page containing
the coveted formula in hand. The formula quickly sold
to the highest bidder, allowing the explorer to retire to a
luxurious lifestyle for the remainder of their life. When
asked in their twilight years how they managed such
a feat, the stories say, Kana deflected the question by
telling stories of all the times they had failed, as well as
the ridiculous amount of alcohol they needed in order to
achieve such an accomplishment.
Many tales assume that Kana meant that they had
to consume many drinks to cope with the terrors of the
Darklands. Unknown in even the most outlandish of
the legends, Kana was taking barrels of alcohol there
as tribute to the then-juvenile underworld dragon,
Kuenen. While the dragon did not actually own the
manual sought after, her draconic family did, so she had
permission to peruse it for her own alchemical interest.
Kuenen’s alchemical formula book therefore had partial
instructions on the preparation of black powder. Once
word got out that the secret of black powder had been
released into the mortal realm, Kuenen was punished
heavily. She was bound forever to her humanoid form
by a powerful ritual, a heavy humiliation for the proud
dragon. Following that, her family exiled and banished
her from entering the Darklands, citing that she is not
to return until she has erased the knowledge of black
powder from the surface world.
While there is no information on Kuenen’s progress,
she most likely took her revenge on Kana. The legends
say that Kana died after drinking poisoned alcohol in the
midst of revelry.

and trip mines with varying effectiveness and stability, and
for a time after Lung Wa’s establishment, several regions
were unlivable due to the number of explosives left behind.
Currently, many nations frown upon the very concept of
land mines. Historical designs were systemically destroyed
or neglected, and the technology has been intentionally left
to stagnate.
Underwater mines are a relatively new concept in Tian
Xia, though rumors among the weapons engineering and
alchemy community suggest that an arms race involving
them is slowly building up in the northeastern corner of
the continent due to the tensions between Wanshou and
Xidao. Many explosive experts who travel through the
two regions have not been heard from since, and other
governments nearby started considering planting spies
or sending investigators into the region to find out what
happened to these missing experts. Another place that has
been stockpiling explosives—thrown bombs, in this case—
is Hongal, reportedly in preparation for skirmishes with
the oni of Chu Ye.
FIRE ARROWS AND ROCKETS
In addition to their recent stockpile of bombs, Hongal
has been crafting many fire arrows with pouches or tubes
of black powder attached. Originally, alchemists crafted
the first fire arrows in Tian Xia in an attempt to set off
unreliable land mines when they failed to explode on their
own. In time, they became regarded as effective weapons
for a siege, especially for their ability to set structures
alight. Other nations used them in place of firework flares
before devising a stable self-propelling mechanism. This,
along with research into fireworks, led the way to the
development of rockets, which were capable of delivering
even more incendiary material to pursued targets.
These technologies saw relatively more usage during
Lung Wa’s imperialistic expansion. Outnumbered against
the growing empire, defending nations sought to find
anti-siege weapons they could use to defend themselves.
Hwanggot’s hwacha, capable of firing up to a hundred
arrows per cart, arose from this need. Though the pacifist
nation used it in only a few minor skirmishes to defend
border fortresses, it gave rise to other similar anti-siege
weapons in Dtang Ma and Xa Hoi, which helped push
Lung Wa back when the empire’s sights turned to them.
FIRE LANCES
Lung Wa’s cavalry and troops were so feared in part due
to their extensive use and training with fire lances. While
the concept of these close-range weapons had circulated
since the early days of black powder usage, the reliability
of Lung Wa’s formula and production techniques allowed
the empire to arm as many as half of their soldiers
with them. They developed fire lances that produced a
concentrated stream of sparks, and though these lances
were only a threat at very close quarters, the heat and light
served as an additional psychological tactic, especially
against mounted animals. Some of their fire lances were
intentionally loaded with materials that produce smoke to
blind enemies for a devastating lethal stab. The most highly
trained troops used fire lances that were set to explode with
a simple manipulation, sending shrapnel towards the target
like a scattershot. These firelancers trained battle-hardened
mounts that were unafraid of the explosive noise.
Historical text hails General Tang Ye Fei as one of the
most legendary wielders of the fire lance. In one instance,
when she was surrounded by enemy cavalry, she was able
to switch out the damp packet of black powder on the
lance and perfectly time the explosion with a circular
swing to blind all her enemies and cut herself from the
fray. Her weapon, the White Pear Blossom, is displayed in
the Gokan Palace, and many modern firelancers dream of
being allowed to catch a glimpse of it there.
Today, very few nations have a battalion dedicated to
the use of fire lances, meaning most wielders are either
self-taught or taught privately by a professional. Some
have sworn themselves into the service of a nation in
order to gain access to a steady supply of black powder,
while others remain discreet and buy their explosives or
the component ingredients on the black market. Luckily,
these rogue firelancers have been rare enough in numbers
that no authorities have yet to take a particular interest in
spending resources to track them down.
CANNONS
The concept of cannons arose around the time fireworks
became popular. The sight of fireworks and rockets
being propelled into the air had many military engineers
wondering if they could accomplish the same with a
projectile of substantial weight. For centuries, inventors
kept running into the same issue: they couldn’t find a
metal or alloy strong enough to withstand the blast of
an explosion sufficiently powerful enough to launch a
projectile effectively. Current historical records suggest
that metallurgy only developed cast iron strong enough
to propel a head-sized cannonball shortly after the
formation of Lung Wa. The ratfolk uprising became the
perfect opportunity to test these cannons, and they proved
effective in pushing back the invasion. Imperial Lung Wa
further mass-produced cannons and used them often in
siege and naval warfare, as well as for coastal defense as
the empire continued its expansion. They also developed
smaller portable hand cannons to be used by shock troops
when breaking through enemy defenses.
Despite written historical records claiming cannons
did not exist at all prior to Lung Wa, shipwrecks around
Minata suggest otherwise. Divers have recovered ruined
cannons, several times more intricate and lightweight,
but perhaps just as sturdy. Based on the writing on these
cannons, the original owners called them cetbang or
lantaka, and are likely relics of an advanced civilization
whose written records have not yet been recovered. Thus
far, they have been impossible to repair or duplicate.

GUNS AND RIFLES
While small projectiles and pellets appeared in black
powder weapons such as fire lances and bombs, the guns
and rifles currently in Tian Xia are extremely rare and
aren’t local inventions. In Tian Xia, firearms such as
pistols originate mostly from distant Alkenstar. Due to
their rarity and the imperial ban, firearms are more often
seen as works of art and put on display. A small few are
used as hunting or sporting weapons among the most
powerful and rich aristocrats, whose private hunting
grounds and shooting ranges have the privilege to escape
the scrutiny of the authorities.
Of course, some nations are secretly creating their own
firearms while enforcing a complete ban. After intercepting
and stealing rifles and design diagrams meant
for Hongal, Minkai reportedly created their
first prototype of a new type of firearm, the
hinawaju, in 4721 AR. It’s
unclear as of yet whether the
prototype was a success, or
whether they’ll be able to
mass-produce hinawaju
usable by anyone other
than the inventor.
Hongal’s
military
is evaluating whether
firearms will be a good
defense
against
the
oni
incursion. Meanwhile, there
are rumors that nations in
the south such as Nagajor, Xa
Hoi, and Dtang Ma have also
started
training
with
what
small number of firearms they
could get their hands on, hiding
these activities in the depths
of the rainforests within their
borders. The most widespread
rumors in central parts of Tian
Xia claim that a small group of
gunsmiths and gunslingers have
gathered in Quain, where they
are seeking to become the first
firearms guild on the continent—
provided they can convince King Wen
that their firearms can be an asset rather
than a liability.
Vudra
Positioned near to Tian Xia’s trade
metropolis Goka, Vudra became aware
of the existence of black powder
quite early on in history. However,
the mining company’s secrecy
over the formula meant only small
amounts reached them at first. Even once the
technology became more widespread, attempts to export
barrels encountered several setbacks; many kegs arrived
too damp to be of use, if the ship even managed to arrive
in port. Mid-voyage explosions were an unfortunately
commonplace occurrence. The rarity of black powder
and associated technology made it a subject of fascination
in early Vudran history as a result. Most commonly,
spellcasting entertainers used small amounts to produce
amazing effects during their performance.
After the establishment of the Shu empire, many of the
kingdoms in Vudra received fireworks formulas and a
book of designs as a diplomatic gesture of goodwill from
the newly formed empire. From there, the Impossible
Kingdoms were able to formulate their own version of
black powder in order to create more. Firearms, however,
came much more recently, dating back to the recent
formation of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which lies
west of the peninsula across the ocean.
FIREWORKS
The firework formulas given to Vudra—
breaking a precedent at the time—were
extremely limited in scale, strength, and
design when compared to existing Tian
counterparts. This meant that historical
Vudran fireworks were small and simple, but the
weakened version of black powder did come with
an unexpected boon: Vudra’s domestic black
powder was much safer than Tian Xia’s, meaning
non-experts could handle it in close proximity.
The first creations that reflected this paradigm
were handheld sparklers. The shape, color, and
speed the sparks emitted gave rise to a myriad of
designs with names like the bloom, the storm, and
the prismatic ribbon. As suggested by those
names, Vudran sparklers are capable of
changing colors while burning, and these
items are still used at celebratory events
and parties.
Today, the sparklers are popular
enough worldwide that some Vudran
fireworks companies have factories
on other continents dedicated to their
production and distribution, including
in the island nation of Jalmeray, Vudra’s
foothold in the Inner Sea. In addition to
sparklers, they also produce fireworks that
focus on producing geometric shapes
and patterns. This is quite
a difficult feat to obtain,
and the fact that Vudran
fireworks engineers appear
to
have
perfected
the
techniques necessary to do
so is an astounding feat of
engineering and design.

EXPLOSIVES AND CANNONS
Prior to the introduction of black powder, Vudra already
had access to quality alchemist’s fire. Considering the
black powder formula they received from Tian Xia was
so weak, it should come as no surprise that their first
attempts at creating black powder explosives involved
mixing it with these sticky substances to see what would
BLANKET BAN VERSUS CONTROLLED CONCESSION
Tian Xia’s and Vudra’s attitudes toward firearms couldn’t
differ more. While Tian Xia openly despises yet craves
them, Vudra accepts them with reverence and respect.
Tian Xia’s ban on imported firearms started almost
immediately after the creation of the first firearms in
Alkenstar, which suited the Grand Duchy well, as they
had no intention of spreading their engineering secrets
far and wide. Nonetheless, a single firearm managed
to reach the continent through Goka within months of
creation, and more have continued to arrive sporadically
ever since. Most rulers feared the lethal potential of the
weapons and saw them as an instrument that could
easily challenge their power if given out to the masses
in sufficient numbers. As a result, current firearm sales in
Tian Xia happen almost exclusively on the black market,
and the penalties associated with the trade are ruthless.
Extralegal sellers often question authorities’ motives
in bringing the hammer down on firearms; though the
stated goal is typically to discourage their use and
control their distribution, smugglers argue that such
desires ring hollow and hypocritical when the authorities
themselves then seek to bolster their own stores of these
weapons. There is currently no ban on firearm manuals or
designs, meaning officials and rulers can legally own and
import them if they can locate the often expensive and
secret documents. Officials that seize a shipment rarely
destroy them on the spot, allowing them to stockpile
confiscated firearms in the name of enforcing the ban. It’s
relatively easy for rich merchants and members of the
nobility to import a firearm missing the requisite trigger
components as an “art piece.” Of course, once they’ve
done so, they can secretly forge the trigger components
locally, if they have access to the necessary plans.
Meanwhile, in Vudra, firearms are not universally
banned, though many rajahs had concerns about their
impact on various aspects of daily life. As such, the sale
of physical firearms and designs are monitored and
regulated, and merchants can only sell to those of specific
castes and certain ranks, for a limited set of reasons.
Now that Vudra has begun to commission their own
firearm production houses, most firearms produced there
are considered to belong to the producers and given to
buyers on a “long-term lease”. This gives the government
the legal right to confiscate a weapon, should they feel
such a decision is warranted.
happen. The result was akin to a potent, long-burning
alchemical fire that had a wide splash zone, which they
called naptha. Too volatile to use in simple bombs,
naptha was nonetheless valuable in warfare to create
hazardous burning areas. It saw limited use, however,
as it caused more damage than expected when used in
urban or jungle areas common in Vudran warfare.
The idea of cannons arose independently in Vudra as
well, and Vudrans were much more persistent in finding
a design that could withstand the explosion compared
to efforts elsewhere, such as Tian Xia. Their weaker
black powder helped with that, in a sense, although it
limited the blasting power of their early cannons. In a
small, nameless Vudrani satrapy, the result of decades of
careful research was a cast bronze cannon of incredible
size, intended as a siege weapon that could replace a
ram. This success motivated the rajahs and satraps of
other regions to pursue similar creations, giving rise
to a range of cannons of all sizes, from large defensive
cannons that required numerous horses or other forms
of physical power to move, to lightweight mortars that
could be easily carried by hand. The most unexpected
invention to arise out of the arms race, however, is
the underwater cannon—easily hidden from view, it is
capable of firing and delivering an explosion through a
body of water to an enemy ship.
FIREARMS
Positioned between Alkenstar and Tian Xia, Vudra
encountered a few of the Grand Duchy’s new firearms
earlier even than black powder’s birthplace, adopting
designs and production techniques several years ahead
of their neighbors. Compared to Tian Xia, the populace
has also accepted these new firearms quite readily, with
some even viewing them as a status symbol. However,
symbolic or not, these firearms have led to a number
of accidental injuries and deaths—most kingdoms have
placed a temporary ban and penalty in place for such
acts and are trying to figure out how to best reduce the
dangers from celebratory firing.
While some kingdoms increased the production of
fireworks to make them more accessible in place of
these new firearms, other kingdoms quickly diverted
their fireworks engineers to work on new gun designs,
with the intention of building their own artillery units.
With a preference towards muskets, these kingdoms
have recently begun to sanction skilled artisans to set up
royal gunsmithing houses. The kingdoms plan to offer
a portion of the guns to the public for sale through a
“long-term lease,” with the kingdom’s army retaining
ownership of the vast majority of these firearms. Having
control over the weapon manufacturing also gives
them control over the number and type of bullets sold,
allowing the kingdoms to provide blanks to the public
with the hope that this will reduce the rates of accidental
injuries and deaths.

In recent years, a small number of Stasian coils, named
for their rumored link with the arrival and ascension of
Queen Anastasia, have trickled into Ustalav from the icy
realm of Irrisen. Although this strange new technology
is perilous and poorly understood, it has become highly
sought after in the nation’s principalities, where some
believe it may hold the key to driving back the Whispering
Tyrant’s forces—or at least escaping them. As has always
been true in Ustalav, others use these new devices to
pursue morbid lines of research in pursuit of their own
eccentric ends.
The eerie violet or blue lightning of Stasian coils
has led to many innovations: some purely scientific,
others hybridized with magic. Spirit-singers, galvaheart
zombies, and airships rowed by the dismembered arms
of the dead are but a sampling of the creations that have
arisen. Though a predictable backlash has begun among
the more superstitious citizens, this has done little to dim
the excitement—or the desperation—with which others
have seized onto the potential of these devices. You
can find more information on the mechanics of Stasian
technology on page 82.
For those willing to steal or smuggle Stasian coils out
of Irrisen, and then risk doing business with Ustalav’s
volatile inventors and treacherous aristocrats, the rewards
can be great. So, however, is the danger.
SOURCING STASIAN COILS
No one knows—or at least, no one will admit to
knowing—the precise source of Stasian coils in Irrisen.
Only the thinnest trickle of technology escapes Irrisen’s
frozen grasp, and much of what makes its way into
Ustalav is rust coated and half-broken by the time it
gets there. Even so, a few smugglers can procure these
goods, though almost none deal in them with any sort
of regularity.
One of those rare dealers is Vaskili Demarr, a river
pirate who has carved out a niche in Stasian coils and
counterfeits. He deals in authentic pieces often enough
to have established a regular clientele among the
knowledgeable but is quick to sell fakes to less discerning
buyers. Vaskili is not especially well versed in the
technology and often stores pieces incorrectly, sometimes
causing significant damage. Nevertheless, so long as
USTALAV: SPARK AND SHADOW
225
225

PAGE 227
================================================================================

the pirate remains one of the few traders with access to
genuine Stasian items, his services are invaluable.
Inventors in Lepidstadt and elsewhere have also begun
attempting to reverse engineer Stasian items and produce
their own replicas and iterations. Many of these pieces,
particularly early ones created before the foundational
principles were even remotely understood, are unstable
and highly dangerous. Nevertheless, they remain both
jealously guarded and extraordinarily difficult to
obtain, as many of these inventors worry that a clever
and resourceful student might be able to examine and
produce their own versions in turn.
SPIRIT SONGS AND SPECTRAL AURAS
Among the first Ustalavic inventions based upon the
new technology were etheric spirit-singers, comprised
of two long, perpendicular metal rods jutting from a
rune-scribed box containing at least one Stasian coil.
Each spirit-singer’s properties vary slightly, depending
on the metals used in its crafting, the dimensions of its
rods, the sigils and materials of its containment box, and
other factors. However, all function according to the
same basic principles: they sense disturbances of ethereal
energies between the two rods, and they emit an eerie,
spectral warbling in response. The pitch and volume of
the spirit-singer’s song varies according to the position of
the disturbance, permitting the user to play the device as
a musical instrument via etheric manipulation.
The discovery that etheric spirit-singers could sense
and respond to incorporeal spiritual essence, including
ghosts and haunts, stirred considerable excitement
in Ustalav. Spirit-singers have been installed as alarm
systems meant to detect spectral intruders, particularly
in defensive fortifications and surveillance sites near the
Gravelands. They have also been adopted by traveling
exorcists who sweep them about the sites of purported
hauntings to determine whether a spirit is present, and
whether it has been successfully dispelled. Frauds run
rampant, since genuine spirit-singers are extraordinarily
expensive and delicate, and a simple auditory illusion can
mimic the effect.
Perhaps the most popular use for etheric spirit-singers,
however, is in melodic séances. In these performances,
commissioned by Ustalavic nobility at great expense,
an ancestor’s ghost or other spirit is invited to visit the
audience and communicate through a spirit-singer. Other
musicians, illusionists, or magicians may accompany the
performance, or an “interpreter of song” may translate
the spirit-singer’s eerie sounds into words.
Recently, a new variation has begun to surface—etheric
spirit-catchers, which use the same base technology but
convert the etheric disturbances to visual impressions
rather than sound. Disturbing rumors have already arisen
around these devices. It is rumored that their images
have the potential to leave troubling and persistent
effects on viewers’ minds, far more pernicious than the
unsettling but innocuous music of spirit-singers. Some
say that spirit-catchers do not merely catch hallucinatory
images, but the actual spirits themselves—to grim, even
nightmarish effect.
ZEFIRENDI’S LACE
In a cold and unlit workshop perched high over a
derelict tenement in Caliphas, the Garundi inventor
and astrologer Zefirendi has built a remarkable loom
powered by clockworks and guided by the movements
of a precision-built orrery. She spends many nights on the
workshop’s roof, studying the heavens through a powerful
telescope and adjusting her model. As the orrery’s celestial
bodies move through their arcs, they change the filaments
of the ornate lace being woven on the looms. No living
hand touches the threads or their looms, so the lace is the
creation of pure mechanical science, and the reflection of
the mysteries among the stars.
Zefirendi has been spinning, and perfecting, her
lace for years. It is nearly finished, and the astrologer’s
excitement—and dread—is near its peak. She began the
project to test a hypothesis that there was some message
hidden in the movement of stars and planets through the
infinite black of night. As the weaving went on, however,
Zefirendi became increasingly convinced that it was the
Dark Tapestry itself that spoke through her orrery. Now,
with her lace almost complete, she is certain that this is
so, and that she will soon be able to read the mystery of
the heavens recorded by her machines.
THE SILVERLENS SNIPER
Among the earliest adopters of Ustalav’s new technologies
is a secretive, mercenary assassin known only as the
Silverlens Sniper. She wears a gray velvet cloak and
matching gloves tipped with mother-of-pearl claws, and
her face hides behind oversized moonstone lenses that
glow an opalescent blue. Though every rumor tells a
different story of her weapon’s appearance, it’s clear that
she uses some kind of arquebus mixing a combination of
magic and Stasian technology.
The magical and technological marvel of her arquebus
and her preternatural accuracy are what makes the
Silverlens Sniper so terrifying; she can kill her victims
from afar, often without anyone knowing she was there
in the first place. The Sniper’s confidence in her skills is so
legendary that it’s rumored she sets out five bullets at the
beginning of each job. If her target survives all five shots,
the Sniper ends her hunt and refunds the contract.
The Silverlens Sniper’s most famous quirk is that she
refuses to kill human targets. She will fearlessly accept
contracts on vampires, werewolves, and even once a lich,
but she will not shed human blood, regardless of the
contract’s intentions. When given a new job, the Sniper
first scouts her proposed victim to determine whether
the target is acceptable, rejecting the contract if her
assessment is unfavorable. No matter how well-disguised

a non-human quarry might be, the Sniper has never been
wrong. How she pierces her targets’ deceptions, and why
she refuses to kill humans, is unknown.
THE GALVANIC HEARTS OF THE DEAD
Galvaspheres are complex, knotlike configurations
of various metals enclosed in a pierced sphere of iron
or steel coated in zinc. The devices are embedded in a
fleshy body, where blood or other fluids can penetrate
the sphere to cause a surge of “animal electricity” when
touching the metals. The exact arrangement of the knots,
and the combinations of metals that work to produce
the effect, are among the most closely guarded secrets of
Stasian-derived technology.
While the methods of galvaspheres’ creation are
secret, their effect is very much not: galvaspheres
animate corpses via electrical pulses, in a
fashion similar to that of zombies or flesh
golems but distinctly its own. The duration of
the effect depends on the size of the corpse,
the condition of its bodily humors, and the
quality of the galvasphere, but in general a
corpse can remain animate for a matter
of minutes to days. Such creatures
move in jerky, clumsy fashion, their
irregularity obvious in their vacant
eyes and slack jaws—though there are
rumors of more refined spheres that can
eliminate these obvious tells, allowing
bodies to move around undetected.
Likewise, rumors persist of enhanced and
perhaps magically augmented galvaspheres
that can revive the corpse’s mental faculties
in addition to simply moving its body, but
reputable witnesses have yet to confirm,
and the church of Pharasma has declared
these hypothetical augmented versions
to be anathema if they exist.
The
original
intention
for
galvaspheres was to assist medical
researchers in understanding the body.
Some believed that they might have
applications in battlefield medicine,
where they might keep a gravely
injured
soldier’s
heart
beating
long enough for a healer to arrive.
Inventors soon discovered that
galvaspheres’
powerful
electrical
currents overwhelmed and stopped
the hearts of the living, limiting the
devices to the dead. In Ustalav, this
morbid discovery did nothing to
slow researchers’ interest—to the
contrary, it opened up new avenues
of
possibility.
When
inventors
realized that galvaheart zombies,
unlike true zombies, were immune to many of the
magical means of control and deterrence that relied
on necromantic manipulation, the tactical potential
seemed enormous.
Though they remain largely unknown in most
of Ustalav, galvaheart zombies have been decoys,
infiltrators, and saboteurs around the Gravelands.
Because a galvaheart zombie’s blood is alchemically
warmed, and its heart physically beats due to the electrical
currents pulsing through its body, these creatures are
augmented with illusion magic, laced with colloidal
silver, and set as bait for vampires who would grow
weak from feeding on their poisoned veins. Not only
would feeding upon such altered blood fail to provide
sustenance to a vampire, it usually deals damage to
the vampire equal to the amount of damage the
vampire would have normally healed by Drinking
Blood, and causes the vampire to become drained
2. Other galvaheart zombies carry scrying devices
past enemy lines or slip through undead-oriented
defenses that no living person could survive.
Still others, it is sometimes whispered, have
been used to commit atrocities against
civilians when Ustalav’s rulers believed
it useful to inflame the citizenry against
“undead attacks.”
THE REAPER AND THE CURSE
Long before Stasian technology came
to Ustalav, alchemists knew that certain
metals, when immersed in acid, spewed
boiling gas. It was also widely noted that this
gas was highly flammable and lighter than
air, such that it could lift pigs’ bladders and
other lightweight materials if captured.
However, it was not until Stasian coils
and their innovations in metallurgy and
insulation arrived that the next step was
realized: airships built around hollow metal
skeletons and filled with metal-acid gas.
As of yet, only a spare few inventors and
vehicle mechanics have gotten close to the
creation of such magical and technological
marvels, but many more are closing in,
only a few years away from the creation
of their own airships. For now, however,
only two such ships ply the skies over
Ustalav: the Twelve-Armed Reaper and the
Stormcrow’s Curse.
The Twelve-Armed Reaper is a grim ship.
The skin stretched over its framework is a semi-
living thing grafted together from the hides of
a hundred victims, and a dozen dismembered
arms row the massive oars that propel
it through the sky, offering the tireless
strength of zombies without the weight
227

================================================================================

of intact bodies. Ordinarily, necromantic magic powers
this grisly array, but when its captain wishes to steer
the Reaper past wards or creatures that might detect
an undead presence, the ship switches to the galvanic
power of its Stasian coils to animate the arms instead.
Steel-masked and silent, the Reaper’s captain is a
mystery. It is not even certain whether the captain is a
living person, or an automaton built to disguise the fact
that the Reaper might command itself. All that is known
is that the Reaper is a partially undead monstrosity
that seems driven to destroy other undead, which it
attacks with aerial bombardments of
incendiary bombs, corrosive gases, or
flesh-eating acids.
Stormcrow’s Curse is a sleek, black
vessel with a crow’s head at its prow
and wings painted on its sides. Its
captain is Jacquinde Stormcrow, a
half-orc woman with a pierced lip
and a signature cloak of iridescent
black
feathers.
Though
she
cultivates a forbidding persona,
the captain is more enigmatic than
malign. Using her spyglass to locate
promising candidates, she swoops
down on battlefields bordering
Belkzen
and
the
Gravelands,
offering survivors safe transport on her airship in
exchange for valuables, favors, or information, much of
it concerning the Hungry Mountains. Jacquinde’s odd
requests and the rumors that spread from those she’s
saved suggest that she seeks something hidden, and that
she built her airship to reach it.
While other inventors have attempted to build and
launch airships of their own, so far none of these
endeavors have succeeded, and more than a few have
ended in spectacular disaster. For now, only two dirigibles
float over Ustalav, and though their paths must surely
have crossed—given the technical feats involved in each
one’s flight—the two always drift separately through the
night sky, their silhouettes stark against the cold moon.
THE MASTER OF THE MOON
Professor Gregorias Desmaske, a onetime professor
of natural sciences at the University of Lepidstadt,
claims to have discovered a technique for harnessing
the power of Stasian coils to create an effect he calls
“lunar magnetism.” Gregorias has created pendants of
magnetite and moonstone linked by metallic coils that
he claims can block the affliction of lycanthropy, and
even “paralyze” natural lycanthropes into one form or
the other.
Other experts in Stasian technology publicly doubt
Gregorias’s claims, asserting that there is no connection
between the electromagnetism of Stasian coils and
the lunar tides that exert such a dramatic effect on
afflicted lycanthropes. Moreover, this is not the first time
Gregorias has advanced questionable science; he lost
his position at the University of Lepidstadt following a
tragic accident in which a young student was horribly
maimed, and a fellow professor killed. The incident was
widely viewed as preventable, and perhaps even less
than accidental. Gregorias departed the university soon
thereafter under a heavy cloud of suspicion, though
official records all state he left to focus on his research
and the university has hushed up any further details.
Despite the professor’s dubious reputation, cursed
lycanthropes and their loved ones are often desperate
enough to offer sizable sums for one of Gregorias’s
lunar magnets. And at least on the surface it does seem
that they work, whether by Stasian technology or other
means. Several lycanthropes have broken through the
shame and silence of their conditions to give glowing
testimonials to the lunar magnets’ benefits.
Yet none of these lycanthropes
has remained a public face
for long. Although new
beneficiaries
regularly
appear to tout Gregorias’s
miracle cure, earlier patients
vanish within a few months, at
most, after first donning a lunar
magnet. The professor claims that this
is because, having been cured, they wish to
return to their private lives without further disturbance.
He has declined to give any further information.
THE GROBELARCH
The
Grobelarch,
an
early
attempt
at
creating
mechanized armor, originated as a project to create a
suit of extraordinarily heavy, thrice-reinforced plate
interwoven with Stasian coils. Powered joints would
enable the wearer to move within the impossibly
bulky suit, electrified spikes would cover the plates in
a crackling defensive array, and concentrator coils on
the gauntlets would allow the wearer to channel the
electrical pulses into incapacitating or even lethal bolts.
That, at least, was the plan. From the beginning,
however, the armor was ill fated. Early versions lacked
sufficient insulation and overheated or fatally shocked
their wearers. Gauntlet misfires and wrenched neck
joints claimed the lives of other testers. Later, as the
accidents grew both grislier and unlikelier, those
working on the Grobelarch came to believe that the
armor had absorbed enough misery and death that it
had attained a cursed sentience and a murderous will
of its own. Created for war, it seemed to understand
nothing else.
Eventually, the workers rebelled against their patron
and tried to destroy the armor, only to find that their
fears were well founded. The Grobelarch, acting under
its own power, killed half a dozen metalworkers and

machinists in a terrible spasm of destruction. Its glass
visor smeared with scorched gore and its gauntleted
fists alight with half-broken arcs of sputtering plasma,
the hulking automaton strode out from the workshop,
leaving a trail of boiling blood.
Since then, reputable sightings of the Grobelarch have
been few and far between, and none surviving is sure of
the exact specifics of its capabilities. Every few months,
however, new tales arise of the carnage wrought by
an armor-plated monstrosity with a host of terrible,
haunted visages that rise and sink behind the blank,
blood-smeared glass of its visored face. Some say that
the Grobelarch kills so that it can capture its victims’
vital energy in its own coils, and that it is trying to piece
together enough fragments of stolen consciousness
to find a way out of its misery. If so, the effort seems
doomed to fail, as surely such a creature cannot hope to
capture anything but more violence and pain.
THE VIVISECTIONIST’S SONGBIRDS
Doctor Jerivale of Caliphas, a chirurgeon noted for
her extraordinary surgical skills and slightly unseemly
passion for vivisection, has begun experimenting
with the grafting and implantation of Stasian-derived
technology into living animals. She has created songbirds
whose melodies reverse spirit-singers’ effects to produce
uncanny disturbances of air and ether rather than sound;
dogs with clacking, spiderlike prosthetic legs that run up
walls and across ceilings as easily as flat ground; and
pigeons who bear spoken messages recorded in tiny
metal boxes, rather than written slips of paper.
A few of these animals were sold as pets or scientific
curiosities, and others were lured away by thieves’
gangs hoping to train them for a variety of criminal
uses. As Doctor Jerivale’s animals have become more
widely known, a local druid, Kheseban the Pruner, has
begun inveighing against them as perversions of the
natural order, “machine monstrosities,” and the result of
unforgivable cruelty to animals. The local government
ignored Kheseban, so the druid has resorted to
rabble-rousing on the street instead. These efforts have
borne more fruit, and there is now a real threat that,
with the right spark, a violent mob may assail Doctor
Jerivale’s laboratory.
GALAFRAEL’S LABORATORY
In a crumbling fortress above an insular village in
Versex, the embittered exile Galafrael, once a noble
lady of Lastwall, now sits and plots against the
Whispering Tyrant who destroyed her ancestral land
and slaughtered her family. Galafrael has embraced
Stasian technology as the answer to her quest for
weapons that might be able to destroy Tar-Baphon’s
army and has poured all that remains of her once-great
fortune into buying coils and support equipment, hiring
inventors and engineers, and investing in workshops
that can convert Versex’s natural resources into the
devastating weaponry she seeks.
Those who have visited Galafrael’s laboratory speak
of horrors within. The weapons she has created are
unlike anything seen before, capable of unleashing
utter devastation. Not only are the weapons themselves
terrible, but whispers swirl that Galafrael has allowed
her single-minded obsession with defeating the
Whispering Tyrant to consume her humanity. Porters and
cart-drivers tell of eminent scientists kept as prisoners in
the fortress, locked in workshops where they are bound
to toil on Galafrael’s devices of death. They also say that
captured undead fill the fortress’s ancient dungeons,
awaiting gruesome ends as test subjects—and that when
Galafrael runs low on captured undead, she sometimes
swells her ranks of test subjects by allowing an errant
undead to create spawn from kidnapped peddlers,
refugees, and other unfortunates she deems unlikely to
be missed.
Any attempt to seek justice for these victims—
assuming that the tales are true—is complicated by the
fact that the local magistrate, Elassus Vandershale, owns
several nearby mines that have been made vastly more
profitable by Galafrael’s innovative machinery and the
high prices she’ll pay for good ore. Elassus has made a
fortune from this stroke of luck, and he is not willing to
see it endangered.
DOCTOR OSTREA’S BOX OF DREAMS
The renowned Doctor Sovrok Ostrea, a scholar of
dreams and repressed desires, has invented a device he
calls the “Casket of Unwanted Dreams,” which wraps
Stasian coils around a sleeping patient’s head and
bathes them in a low-intensity, finely calibrated net
of electromagnetic energy. Doctor Sovrok claims his
procedure can pull troubling impulses and recurrent
nightmares from a patient’s mind, safely burying them
in an attached casket so that the patient is never again
disturbed by such dark desires.
The procedure seems to work, in that Doctor Sovrok’s
patients report, with great relief, being freed from all
manner of disturbing obsessions. But the casket does
not destroy their thoughts—it only stores them, and it
is not clear why the doctor keeps them. He claims that
he wishes only to study such obsessions in a harmless,
neutralized context, the better to find more effective
treatments. Yet rumors persist that the doctor is
gathering the information for less benevolent purposes:
that he is selling them to unknowable horrors who feed
on poisonous emotions, refining them into phantasms
of incapacitating dread, and might even seek to unleash
the captured nightmares on new victims someday. These
may very well be true, or perhaps these rumors exist
only because the ever-suspicious citizens of Ustalav find
it difficult to accept that the doctor’s kindness could be
as simple as it appears.
