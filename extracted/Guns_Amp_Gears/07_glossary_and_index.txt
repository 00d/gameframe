GLOSSARY AND INDEX
acid (trait) Effects with this trait deal acid damage. Creatures
with this trait have a magical connection to acid.
agile (weapon trait) The multiple attack penalty you take
with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is
–4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and
subsequent attacks in the turn. CR 282
air (trait) Effects with the air trait either
manipulate or conjure air. Those
that manipulate air have no effect
in a vacuum or an area without air.
Creatures with this trait consist
primarily of air or have a magical
connection to that element.
alchemical (trait) Alchemical items
are powered by reactions of
alchemical reagents. Alchemical
items aren’t magical and don’t
radiate a magical aura.
ammunition (magic item) 168–171,
CR 559–561, APG 256–259
ancestry A broad family of
people that a creature belongs to.
Each player character chooses an ancestry as the first
step of character creation. CR 32–59, APG 6–47
arcane (trait) This magic comes from the arcane tradition,
which is built on logic and rationality. Anything with this
trait is magical. A creature with this trait is primarily
constituted of or has a strong connection to arcane magic.
archetype (trait) This feat belongs to an archetype.
attached (weapon trait) An attached weapon
must be combined with another piece of
gear to be used. The trait lists what
type of item the weapon must be
attached to. You must be wielding
or wearing the item the weapon is
attached to in order to attack with
it. For example, shield spikes are attached
to a shield, allowing you to attack with
the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if
you’re wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually
bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and
typically an item can have only one weapon attached to
it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with
10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting
check; this includes the time needed to remove the
weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is
destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
auditory (trait) Auditory actions and effects rely on sound.
An action with the auditory trait can be successfully
performed only if the creature using the action can
speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell
or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the
target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts
of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different
from a sonic effect, which
still affects targets who can’t
hear it (such as deaf targets)
as long as the effect itself
makes sound.
aura (trait) An aura is an emanation
that continually ebbs out from you,
affecting creatures within a certain radius.
Aura can also refer to the magical signature of
an item or a creature with a strong alignment.
automaton (trait) Automatons are living constructs
sustained by a magical core. 36, 212–216
background CR 60, APG 48–51
backstabber (weapon trait) When you hit a flat-footed
creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in
addition to its normal damage. The precision damage
increases to 2 if the weapon is a +3 weapon.

a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next
attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with
this weapon before the end of your turn.
basic spellcasting benefits These benefits are granted by
spellcasting archetypes. CR 219
black powder black powder is used to create ammunition for
firearms and other explosive weapons, like cannons. 169
bomb (trait) An alchemical bomb combines volatile
alchemical components that explode when the bomb
hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal
damage, though some produce other effects.
bulk A value indicating an item’s size,
weight, and general awkwardness. 10
items of light Bulk equal 1 Bulk, and
1,000 coins are 1 Bulk. A character
becomes encumbered if they carry Bulk
greater than 5 + their Strength modifier,
and they can’t carry more than 10 +
their Strength modifier. CR 29, 271–272
capacity (weapon trait) Weapons that
have the capacity trait typically have
multiple barrels or chambers capable of
containing a round of ammunition. Capacity is
always accompanied by a number indicating the
number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity
weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel
or chamber as an Interact action that doesn’t require a
free hand. Each barrel or chamber can be reloaded after
it’s fired as a separate Interact action. 150
chaotic (trait) Chaotic effects often manipulate energy
from chaos-aligned Outer Planes and are anathema

deities. A creature with this trait is chaotic in alignment.
An ability with this trait can be selected or used only by
chaotic creatures.
class The adventuring profession chosen by a character.
Each player character picks a class during character
creation. CR 67–68, APG 52–143
class DC A class DC sets
the difficulty for some
abilities granted by your
character’s class. Class DC
= 10 + proficiency bonus +
key ability modifier. CR 29
clockwork
(trait)
Clockworks
are
intricate, complex constructs that can
be programmed to perform specific functions.
A clockwork creature must be wound regularly
to function.
cobbled (weapon trait) This firearm is cobbled together
and likely to misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it,
on a failed attack roll, the attack misses and you must
roll a DC 5 flat check. If you fail this check, the weapon
misfires. 157
cold (trait) Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures
with this trait have a connection to magical cold.
combination (weapon trait) Combination is a new trait
for weapons that combine the functionality of melee
weapons and firearms in unique or unusual ways. A
combination weapon has both a firearm form or usage
and a melee weapon form or usage. Table 4–3: Uncommon
Combination Weapons lists the firearm statistics first,
and the melee weapon statistics indented beneath, just
above the ammunition. 159
complex (trait) A hazard with this trait takes
turns in an encounter.
concealable (weapon trait) This weapon is
designed to be inconspicuous or easily
concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide
or conceal a weapon with this trait. 150
concentrate (trait) An action with this
trait requires a degree of mental
concentration and discipline.
concussive (weapon trait) These weapons
smash as much as puncture. When
determining a creature’s resistance
or immunity to damage from
this weapon, use the weaker of
the target’s resistance or immunity to piercing or to
bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune
to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to
bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from
a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all
physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal. 150
conjuration (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the conjuration school of magic,
typically involving summoning, creation, teleportation,
or moving things from place to place.
construct (trait) A construct is an artificial creature
empowered by a force other than necromancy. Constructs
are often mindless; they are immune to bleed damage,
death effects, disease, healing, necromancy, nonlethal
attacks, poison, and the doomed, drained, fatigued,
paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions; and
they may have Hardness based on the materials used
to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living
creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit
Points, a construct creature is destroyed.
construct companion 32–33
consumable (trait) An item with this
trait can be used only once. Unless
stated
otherwise,
it’s
destroyed
after activation. Consumable items
include alchemical items and magical
consumables such as scrolls and
talismans.
When
a
character
creates consumable items, they
can make them in batches of four.
66–71, CR 559–571, APG 252–259
critical fusion (weapon trait)
Critical fusion is a new trait for
combination weapons that grants
you two additional options for the critical specialization
effect when using the combination weapon’s melee
version to make a melee attack while the firearm is loaded.
If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee
usage’s normal critical specialization effect. First, you
can discharge the firearm to create a loud
bang and concussion, using the critical
specialization
effect
for
firearms
instead of the melee weapon group’s
critical specialization effect. Second, you
can choose to discharge the firearm to
increase the critical hit’s momentum or shoot
the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing
2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both
of these options discharge the firearm, which typically
means you have to reload it before firing it again. 159
cursed (trait) An item with this trait is cursed to cause
trouble for its owner. A curse isn’t detected when the
item is identified, though a critical success reveals both
the presence and exact nature of the curse. Cursed
items can’t be discarded once they’ve been triggered or
invested the first time. The item can be removed only if
the curse is removed. GMG 90, 251
darkvision (sense) See clearly in darkness, though in black
and white only. CR 465
deadly (weapon trait) On a critical hit, the weapon adds
a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after
doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two
dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three
dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.

dedication (trait) You must select a feat with this trait to
apply an archetype to your character. CR 219
disarm (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to Disarm
with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand.
This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own)
and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any)
as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically
fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop
the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a
critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free
hand if you want to take the item.
divination (trait) The divination school of magic typically
involves obtaining or transferring information, or
predicting events.
divine (trait) This magic comes from the divine tradition,
drawing power from deities or similar sources. Anything
with this trait is magical. CR 299
double barrel (weapon trait) This weapon has two barrels
that are each loaded separately. You can fire both barrels
of a double barrel weapon in a single Strike to increase
the weapon damage die by one step. If the weapon has
the fatal trait, this increases the fatal die by one step. 150
dwarf (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the
dwarf ancestry. Dwarves are stout folk who often live
underground and typically have darkvision. An ability
with this trait can be used or selected only by dwarves.
An item with this trait is created and used by dwarves.
200–201, CR 34–37, APG 42
effect An effect is the result of an ability, though an ability’s
exact effect is sometimes contingent on the result of a
check or other roll.
electricity (trait) Effects with this trait deal electricity
damage. A creature with this trait has a magical
connection to electricity.
enchantment (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the enchantment school of magic,
typically involving mind control, emotion alteration, and
other mental effects.
evil (trait) Evil effects often manipulate energy from
evil-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to good
divine servants or divine servants of good deities. A
creature with this trait is evil in alignment. An ability with
this trait can be selected or used only by evil creatures.
evocation (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the evocation school of magic, typically
involving energy and elemental forces.
exploration (trait) An activity with this trait takes more
than a turn to use, and can usually be used only during
exploration mode. CR 234
fatal aim (weapon trait) It’s possible to hold the stock of
this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a
single hand, but if you use both hands, the weapon can
make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two
hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die.
Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is
significantly more complicated than just releasing one
hand from the weapon, so switching between the two
grips requires its own Interact action, not via Releasing
or as part of reloading. 150
finesse (weapon trait) You can use your Dexterity modifier
instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using
this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier
when calculating damage.
fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or
either conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate
fire have no effect in an area without fire. Creatures
with this trait consist primarily of fire or have a magical
connection to that element.
firearm Firearms are a new category of ranged weapons
presented in this book that typically, but not always, use
black powder ammunition.
	 classic firearms 150–153
	 fantasy firearms 154–167
firing mechanism (item) Firing mechanisms are a type of
item that can be attached to a firearm. Only one firing
mechanism can be attached to a weapon at a time.
183–184
flourish (trait) Flourish actions are actions that require too
much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You
can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
force (trait) Effects with this trait deal force damage or
create objects made of pure magical force.
forceful (weapon trait) This weapon becomes more
dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack
with it more than once on your turn, the second attack
gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the
number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent
attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to
double the number of weapon damage dice.
fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you
roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune
effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would
apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect
and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the
two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

free-hand (weapon trait) This weapon doesn’t take up
your hand, usually because it’s built into your armor.
A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use
the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield
other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You
can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding
anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand.
When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise
using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to
have a hand free as well as those that require you to be
wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can
have only one free‑hand weapon on it.
gadget (trait) Gadgets are consumable technological
inventions with innovative uses. 66–71
gargantuan (size) This size of creature takes up a space of
at least 20 feet by 20 feet (16 squares on the grid), but
can be much larger. Gargantuan creatures typically have
a reach of 20 feet if they are tall, or 15 feet if they are
long, but larger ones could have a much longer reach.
goblin (trait) A creature with this trait can be one of several
kinds of creature, including goblins, hobgoblins, and
bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability
with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins.
A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.
good (trait) Good effects often manipulate energy from
good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil
divine servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature
with this trait is good in alignment. An ability with this
trait can be selected or used only by good creatures.
gunslinger (class) 105–119
haunt (trait) A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo,
often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt
to rest often involves resolving the haunt’s unfinished
business. A haunt that hasn’t been properly put to rest
always returns after a time.
healing (trait) A healing effect restores a creature’s body,
typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by
removing diseases or other debilitating effects.
held item (magic item) CR 572–576, APG 260–265
heritage A choice made to further define your ancestry. CR 33
huge (size) A Huge creature takes up a 15-foot-by-15-foot
space (9 squares on the grid). It typically has a reach of 15
feet if the creature is tall or 10 feet if the creature is long.
illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the illusion school of magic, typically
involving false sensory stimuli. CR 298
incapacitation (trait) An ability with this trait can take a
character completely out of the fight or even kill them,
and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a
spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more
than twice the spell’s level treats the result of their
check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one
degree of success better, or the result of any check the
spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of
success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation
trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature,
or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.
infused (trait) You create an alchemical item with the
infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a
limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent
effects from your infused alchemical items, with the
exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end
when you make your daily preparations again. CR 72, 75
injection (weapon trait) This weapon can be filled with an
injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with
the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded
poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon
with a new substance requires three Interact actions,
and uses both hands. 62
integrated Integrated weapons can replace prostheses or
automaton limbs. 162
intelligent (trait) An item with this trait is intelligent and
has its own will and personality, as well as several
statistics that most items don’t have. Intelligent items
can’t be crafted by normal means, and they are always
rare or unique. GMG 88
inventor (class) 15–33
invested (trait) A character can wear only 10 magical items
that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects
of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it, nor
can it be activated, though the character still gains any
normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a
hat keeping rain off their head). CR 531

grant an item bonus or penalty to certain checks. CR

kickback (weapon trait) A kickback weapon is extra
powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A
kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all
attacks. Firing a kickback weapon
gives a –2 circumstance penalty
to the attack roll, but characters
with 14 or more Strength ignore
the penalty. Attaching a kickback
weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod,
or other stabilizer can lower or negate
this penalty. 150
light (trait) Light effects overcome non-magical
darkness in the area, and can counteract
magical darkness. You must usually target darkness
magic with your light magic directly to counteract the
darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to
counteract darkness.
linguistic (trait) An effect with this trait depends on
language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets
a creature works only if the target understands the
language you are using.
low-light vision (sense) See in dim light as though it were
bright light.
magical (trait) Something with the magical trait is imbued
with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of
magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with
its dominant school of magic.
Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular
tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the
arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the
magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item
is magical. CR 535
manipulate (trait) You must physically manipulate an item or
make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures
without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with
this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.
mechanical (trait) A hazard with this trait is a constructed
physical object. CR 521
mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind.
It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.
Mindless creatures and objects are entirely immune to a
mental creature and can’t perceive it.
misfire Firearms that are improperly maintained or
subjected to unusual strain can misfire. 107
modification (trait) A feat with this trait alters the
construction of your innovation. If you have the
reconfigure class feature (page 20), you can retrain such
a feat more easily.
modular (weapon trait) The weapon has multiple
configurations that you can switch between using
an Interact action. Typically, switching between
configurations of a modular weapon allows
it to deal different types of damage (listed
in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”),
though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s
description
to
list
more
complicated
configurations. 151
monk (weapon trait) Abilities with this
trait are from the monk class. Weapons
with this trait are primarily used by
monks. CR 283
mounted (siege weapon trait) Mounted
siege weapons take up a certain size
and space, and typically have statistics
to allow them to be attacked. They’re used for large-scale
warfare. 72–73
move (trait) An action with this trait involves moving from
one space to another. CR 473–475
necromancy (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait
are associated with the necromancy school of magic,
typically involving the forces of life and death.
occult (trait) This magic comes from the occult tradition,
calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything
with this trait is magical. CR 299
parry (weapon trait) This weapon can be used defensively
to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your
proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend
an Interact action to position your weapon defensively,
gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of
your next turn. CR 283
perception A statistic measuring your ability to notice
hidden objects or unusual situations. Perception is
usually used for initiative rolls. CR 13, 27, 448, 464-467
poison (trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or
deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous
and might cause an affliction. CR 457–458

polymorph (trait) These effects transform the target into
a new form. A target can’t be under the effect of more
than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under
the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second
polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it
succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no
effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by
a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated,
polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the
appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather
just a generic creature of a type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell,
the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance
bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise
noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells,
speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require
hands. (If there’s doubt about whether you can use an
action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you;
the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you
can’t activate any items.
portable (siege weapon trait) Portable siege weapons, such as
battering rams, can be more easily carried and have a role
in both warfare and smaller conflicts or exploration. 73–74
primal (trait) This magic comes from the primal
tradition, connecting to the natural world
and instinct. Anything with this trait is
magical. CR 299
ranged trip (weapon trait) This weapon
can be used to Trip with the Athletics
skill at a distance up to the weapon’s
first range increment. The skill check
takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You
can add the weapon’s item bonus to
attack rolls as a bonus to the check.
As with using a melee weapon to trip, a
ranged trip doesn’t deal any damage when
used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on
a thrown weapon. 17, APG 248
rare (trait) This rarity indicates that a rules element is very
difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item
or the like is available to players only if the GM decides
to include it in the game, typically through discovery
during play. CR 13
reach (weapon trait) This weapon is long and can be used
to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only
adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have
reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the
weapon increases their reach by 5 feet. CR 283
reckless (trait) Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of
the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a
reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate
piloting check to keep control of the vehicle. 48
repeating (weapon trait) These weapons can’t be loaded
with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and
firearms; instead, they require a magazine of specialized
ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that
magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically
loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing
its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0).
When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be
loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions
(to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine,
and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don’t
need to be consecutive. 62, 152
scatter (weapon trait) This weapon fires a cluster of pellets
in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it,
indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary
target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed
damage, and the target and all other creatures
within the listed radius around it take
1 point of splash damage per weapon
damage die. 152
scope (item) Scopes are a type of item
that can be attached to a firearm or
crossbow. Only one scope can be attached
to a weapon at a time. 180–182
shove (weapon trait) You can use this weapon to
Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have
a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different
from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to
attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If
you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon,
you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a
failure instead of a critical failure.
siege weapons Siege weapons are powerful devices used for
large-scale warfare. They are similar to vehicles and can
be operated by one or more individuals. 72–77, 172–177
skill (trait) A general feat with the skill trait improves your
skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a
skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class
grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with
the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you
have that archetype’s dedication feat. CR 233–253
sleep (trait) This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep
or get drowsy.

snare (trait) Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow
special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly
and used on the battlefield. 78–81, CR 589–591, APG 256
splash (trait) When you use a thrown weapon with the
splash trait, you don’t add your
Strength modifier to the damage
roll. If an attack with a splash
weapon fails, succeeds, or
critically succeeds, all creatures
within 5 feet of the target
(including the target) take the listed
splash damage. On a failure (but not a
critical failure), the target of the attack still
takes the splash damage. Add splash damage
together with the initial damage against the
target before applying the target’s weaknesses
or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a
critical hit. CR 544
stance (trait) A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until
you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are
violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter
a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use
an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another
one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in
encounter mode.
steam (trait) Items with this trait are powered by engines that
boil water to produce steam and move their components.
sweep (weapon trait) This weapon makes wide sweeping
or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple
enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already
attempted to attack a different target this turn using this
weapon. CR 283
talisman (trait) A talisman is a small object affixed to
armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item).
You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate
a talisman attached to it. Once activated,
a talisman burns out permanently.
184–185, CR 565–570
tethered (weapon trait) This weapon is
attached to a length of rope or chain
that allows you to retrieve it after it
has left your hand. If you have a free
hand, you can use an Interact action to
pull the weapon back into your grasp
after you have thrown it as a ranged
attack or after it has been disarmed
(unless it is being held by another
creature). 159
thrown (weapon trait) You can throw
this weapon as a ranged attack; it
is a ranged weapon when thrown. You
add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for
a melee weapon. When this trait appears on a melee
weapon, it also includes the range increment. Ranged
weapons with this trait use the range increment in the
weapon’s Range entry. CR 283
transmutation (trait) Effects and magic items with this
trait are associated with the transmutation school of
magic, typically changing something’s form.
trap (trait) A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to
hinder interlopers. CR 520
two-hand (weapon trait) This weapon can be wielded with
two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die
to the indicated value. This change applies to all the
weapon’s damage dice, such as those
from striking runes. CR 283
uncommon
(trait)
Something
of
uncommon rarity requires special
training or comes from a particular
culture or part of the world. Some
character choices give access to
uncommon options, and the GM
can choose to allow access for
anyone. CR 13
unique (trait) A rules element with
this trait is one-of-a-kind. CR 13
unstable (trait) Unstable actions
rely on experimental functions of
your innovation that even you can’t fully
predict. After an unstable action is used on an innovation,
using another one is dangerous. 17
usage An indication of how an item must be worn, held, or
otherwise used. CR 535
versatile
(weapon
trait)
A
versatile weapon can be used
to deal a different type of
damage than that listed
in the Damage entry. This
trait indicates the alternate
damage type. For instance, a
piercing weapon that is versatile
S can be used to deal piercing or
slashing damage. You choose the damage
type each time you make an attack. CR 283
visual (trait) A visual effect can affect only
creatures that can see it. This applies only to
visible parts of the effect, as determined by the
GM. CR 301
volley (weapon trait) This ranged weapon is less effective
at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are
at a distance less than the range listed take a –2 penalty.
CR 283
water (trait) Effects with the water trait either manipulate
or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no
effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait
consist primarily of water or have a magical connection
to the element.
