INTRODUCTION
The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game features a high-fantasy setting where almost any story
can be told. Where the Core Rulebook provides classic options for play and Secrets of
Magic provides options for characters to delve deep into the magical mysteries of Golarion,
Guns & Gears presents the secrets of black powder weapons and clockwork technology,
combining grit and steampunk to produce a flavor all its own.
Gears, Guns, or Both
Guns & Gears is presented as three smaller but
interconnected “books” bundled inside a single cover. The
Gears “book” is split into two chapters: Gears Characters
and Gears Equipment. The first chapter features the
inventor class and automaton ancestry, along with several
archetypes that support innovation as a theme. The second
chapter presents an array of gadgets and vehicles that
embrace themes of inventiveness. This chapter includes rules
for clockwork and steam-tech mechanisms as well as other
more esoteric forms of technology.
The Guns “book” has also been separated into two
chapters: Guns Characters and Guns Equipment. The first
section presents the gunslinger class along with an array of
archetypes that support exciting combat styles built around
firearms and crossbows. The second chapter offers a wide
array of new firearms, from classic black powder weapons
like the flintlock musket and arquebus to more fantastic
options like versatile combination weapons or magical beast
guns. Support for firearms and crossbows goes beyond just
new weapons and includes other exciting accessories for
customizing your weapon of choice, like bayonets and
reinforced stocks to attach a melee option to your guns,
magical scopes to improve your visual prowess, magical
bandoliers and holsters, and even replacement barrels and
firing mechanisms to change your weapon’s parameters.
The final “book,” The Rotating Gear, offers a standalone
gazetteer describing different areas of Golarion where black
powder, clockworks, and other forms of technology are
likely to be found. This chapter isn’t limited to just the Inner
Sea. It explores continents like Arcadia, Casmaron, and Tian
Xia, describing the technological traditions of those regions
and how they’ve influenced the growth and proliferation of
technology across the entire planet.
How To Use This Book
The options here expand upon the rules contained in the
Core Rulebook, and that book is required to use Guns &
Gears. Some rules indicate other material found in this book
with page references. Other products referencing the rules in
this book might do so using the superscript citation “G&G.”
ACCESS ENTRIES
Most of the rules content in this book is uncommon or
rare because such technology is unusual in Golarion.
However, sometimes a stat block for an uncommon rules
element includes an Access entry that lists specific criteria.
A character who meets the criteria listed in the Access
entry, such as hailing from a particular locale, gains
access to the rules element. This book often groups access
requirements by section. For example, the introduction to
the Gears Characters chapter (page 12) details the areas
of Golarion that grant access to the inventor class and its
related uncommon weapons and gadgetry, so the areas
detailed there as granting access serve the role of access
requirements for most of the section (not including rare
items and certain other elements called out as needing
additional approval from the GM, such as vehicles).
As always, the GM has the final say on who can access
uncommon or rarer options or whether to allow specific
options in the game at all. They might decide that a
character’s upbringing or abilities make sense for a specific
rules option and grant them access even if the character
doesn’t automatically qualify, or they might decide those
same options can’t be taken by anyone.
World-Building and Tone
Guns & Gears introduces elements of fantasy that might
not fit into every game. The world of Golarion has a
lot in common with the Renaissance period of Earth,
supplemented with magic and old-fashioned technologies
that were replaced on Earth before being refined to the point
they’ve reached in Golarion. This high fantasy world is
home to pirates with bandoliers of flintlock pistols, reckless
scientists animating the dead with electric coils, knights in
shining armor riding mighty griffons, and wizards casting
spells in tall towers. Each of those character concepts
has a place in Golarion; it’s just that to find some of the
technological elements, you need to know where to look.
For a home campaign, especially in a homebrew
setting, some GMs might prefer a world that embraces
the age of piracy and includes cannons and firearms
with greater frequency than Golarion without the
presence of steam-powered jetpacks and clockwork
grappling hooks. Other GMs might prefer a world where
clockworks and steam engines exist, but guns and other
black powder weapons are absent. Guns & Gears takes
steps to facilitate this world-building. As mentioned,
this tome is divided into three smaller “books.” A GM
who only wants to allow black powder weaponry

without adding weird science to the game can allow
their players to use the Guns chapters, eschewing the
Gears chapters. A GM who wants to create a world of
clockwork constructs and fantastic inventions unmarred
by black powder weaponry can instead allow players
to use the Gears chapters without giving access to the
Guns chapters. Finally, a GM who remains unsure how
any of these elements might fit into their game world is
encouraged to read The Rotating Gear at the back of
this book to see how these technologies have grown and
spread through Golarion, and perhaps gain inspiration
regarding how these elements might fit into their game.
FUNCTIONALITY AND BALANCE
Golarion is a world of magic with rune-bedecked swords
forged out of metal fallen from the sky, full plate armor
similar to that produced on Earth during the 15th century,
and other armaments unlike anything the people of Earth
ever had access to. As such, the black powder weapons
and technological gadgets presented in this book are
mechanically balanced to the other options available to
all characters. Firearms, though capable of devastating
critical hits, work alongside crossbows and composite
longbows rather than replace them, in much the same
way firearms and bows were both actively used in Asia
for nearly 900 years of human history.
AREN’T GUNS MORE POWERFUL THAN BOWS?
The guns presented in this book are representative of fairly
early firearms with just a few unique twists, as explained
in the introduction of the Guns Equipment chapter (page
146). Those old guns, which used black powder that did
not exhibit the refinements of modern ammunition and
lacked the rifle barrel technology for increasing range and
accuracy, were extremely inaccurate and no more lethal
with a glancing blow than most bows and crossbows;
however, these firearms’ penetrating power was superior,
and a wound to a vital area could prove incredibly deadly.
This lethality is represented mechanically by the fatal
trait given to most firearms, with a critical hit indicating
a gunshot to a vital organ or other important body part.
This mechanic allows a firearm to do far more damage in

ARMOR AND PERSISTENT TECHNOLOGY
In Golarion, technology has moved much slower than
on Earth. Many modern conveniences still have yet to be
invented or discovered. That doesn’t mean technology has
stood still, however. Because certain types of technology
persisted for centuries on Golarion instead of being
replaced as they were on Earth, many fantastic innovations
remain prevalent since competing technologies developed
more slowly or didn’t spread as quickly.
While clockwork dragons and alchemical boots that
rocket their wearer through the sky are manifestations
of less frequent technological replacement, many other,
more subtle examples are scattered throughout the
game. At its height in the 16th century, a suit of full
plate could stop even the penetrating power, if not the
full force, of a shot from a firearm, though its expense
and weight made it impractical for all but the wealthiest
of individuals. Golarion, on the other hand, is a fantasy
world where dragons and other supernatural monsters
with destructive power akin to or in excess of a firearm
are relatively common, and where adventurers accrue
great wealth that they constantly reinvest into better
arms and armor. Moreover, Golarion’s armaments can
be enhanced with magical runes that elevate them far
beyond anything that could be replicated on Earth
without the application of advanced technology from
beyond the age of swords and plate armor.
Similarly for lighter armors, on Earth, techniques for
incorporating silk that can stop bullets from penetrating
into armor and other techniques for creating bullet-resistant
armaments, such as painting layers of paper with lacquer to
create a rudimentary analogue to modern-day Kevlar, have
existed for a very long time, but didn’t often come into
popular use before evolving into a form that is no longer
recognizable. Several nations in Tian Xia have techniques
for creating black powder weapons, like the hand cannon
and fire lance, and lacquered armor. The intersection of
these technologies means it’s not unlikely to find variants
of studded leather armor or chainmail lined with layers
of such early bulletproofing. In Avistan and the Inner Sea,
knights who have encountered firearms imported or stolen
from Alkenstar likely know armorers who know techniques
to craft layered plates and silk surcoats or undergarments
that provide additional protection from bullets.
ALCHEMY’S INFLUENCE ON TECHNOLOGY
Considering that certain technologies have seen more
refinement or followed divergent development paths
7

PAGE 9
================================================================================

on Golarion in comparison to Earth, the influence of
alchemy on Golarion’s technology can’t be understated.
In addition to enabling the creation of elemental weapons,
such as alchemist’s fire and bottled lightning, alchemical
techniques have often been applied to a variety of other
fields and industries. Alchemical treatments for armor
can create stronger materials; alchemical distillations
allow for a variety of different forms and potencies in
black powder; alchemy and the people who practice it
even influence the most basic of needs, like preserving
volatile substances for transport.
Much like firearms, alchemy is something of an
everyman’s tool, usable by most anyone who can get
their hands on its components without requiring the
specialized training or unique bloodlines of wizards and
sorcerers. A single alchemist who makes their home in
a community can quickly improve the quality of
life for everyone there, reducing death by
disease, improving the community’s ability
to defend itself from outside threats,
and providing other benefits both
large and small. While it stands
as a distinct science of its own,
alchemy inextricably has ties
to black powder weapons and
other technologies of Golarion,
enabling the development of
sturdier metals and more volatile
explosives to allow creations on a grand
scale. For example, while steam technology is
extremely new on Golarion, steam engines
are much more likely to use alchemically
derived heat sources than the coal
furnaces used in our world.
TECHNOLOGY IN GOLARION
TODAY
Over the last two decades,
Golarion, and especially the
Inner Sea region comprised
of
the
continent
of
Avistan and the northern
portion of the continent
of Garund, have been beset by
catastrophe after catastrophe. Armies
of demons pouring forth from a wound
in the world itself, time‑displaced wizards
inciting chaos to restore their faded glory,
armies of giants and hobgoblins, and an
evil lich leading undead hordes have all
assaulted the people of Golarion and set
them reeling time and time again. While
these events have delayed certain
technological
advancements,
they
have
spurred
others.
Firearms are more prevalent in Golarion than they’ve
ever been before, and artificers in Varisia, Absalom,
and northern Garund constantly create new devices
both wondrous and terrible. Golarion stands on a cusp,
with alchemy prominent, clockworks poised to expand,
and steam-powered technology just entering its early
days of exciting innovation. These technologies may be
limited in their spread now but are positioned to bring
great change and advancement to Golarion. That isn’t a
guarantee, however. These advancements might all come
crashing down if the forces that seek the dissolution of
science and social cohesion have their way. Fortunately,
Golarion is also a world where heroes inevitably rise
up to face such challenges and take action to secure a
future of limitless possibility.
MODULARITY
As mentioned at the beginning of this introduction, Guns
& Gears has been organized so that you can use as
much, or as little, of the book as
is appropriate for your game
world. While some obvious
elements can help make this
intent apparent, such as the border art
changing between the Gears “book,” Guns
“book,” and The Rotating Gear “book,”
we’ve taken other steps as well that might not
be immediately obvious. Vehicles and siege
weapons, which can be fun and engaging
rules but might not be an appropriate fit for
all campaigns, each have their own separate
section. The firearms section is divided
between “Classic Firearms” and “Fantasy
Firearms,” so that if your preferred
setting has smooth-bore black powder
weapons as the technological “ceiling,”
you can allow only the classic firearms
in your campaign. If your high fantasy
setting blends the highlights of Earth’s
renaissance with fantastical or outright
magical
technology,
like
firearms
that
transform into swords or axes, or gun-like
weapons made from the taxidermic bodies
of supernatural creatures, you can add
those fantasy firearms to your game as well.
With all the possible permutations of a
fantasy world, we’ve endeavored to create
a book that speaks to as many people and
settings as possible, allowing people to
include the storytelling elements they most
enjoy without feeling overly pressured
to
include
those
that
negatively
impact their immersion or gaming
experience. Whether you want to play
a swashbuckling pirate with a black
powder pistol or a ysoki engineer
with a tesla coil backpack that

disrupts magical energy and a grappling hook with a
retractable clockwork cord, this book is for you. Feel
free to use the elements of this book that align strongly
with your vision for the characters, adventures, and game
world you create while leaving the rest behind!
BORDERS AND CHANGE
When constructing a fantasy world or playing in a
world like Golarion where wizards live next door
to gunslingers and even the most magical of realms
might have technological clockwork soldiers and other
scientific discoveries that simulate, enhance, or even
replace magic—it can become hard to picture how all
these disparate elements coexist alongside each other.
Why don’t firearms get adopted by other nearby
nations? Why would someone spend vast troves of gold
to build a clockwork dragon when they could teleport
an egg away from a nest and get the real thing much
more cheaply?
There are quite a few possible answers to these
questions, and figuring out those answers can help
make your campaign setting more vibrant and relatable.
To start, we’ll talk about some of the ways in which
Golarion answers these questions before diving into ways
to integrate these kinds of themes deeper into your own
original setting.
Dongun Hold and Alkenstar are strong examples of
areas in Golarion that can have a technology level that’s
significantly above the average technology level for the
rest of the world, without undermining or significantly
changing the general dynamics of Golarion and nearby
regions. Wedged between two warring nations ruled
by wizard kings, Alkenstar and Dongun Hold have no
significant ports of their own and are surrounded by a
wasteland filled with mutants and monsters. Moreover,
the ancient magical wars that scarred the Mana Wastes
also created pockets of unstable magic or magical dead
zones where magic remains unreliable at best and
virtually nonexistent at worst. As a
result, it makes sense that the hearty
smiths of Dongun Hold craft firearms
as the primary method to protect
themselves from dangerous creatures and
threats, as does the fact that the weapons
have remained available only in this
small region of the Inner Sea until
quite recently.
In your homebrew world, you
can use similar levers to partition the
different countries and regions you create
according to similar circumstances, or you
can use completely different options
as appropriate. For example, if your
campaign world is one in which
firearms exist but are limited to a very
specific part of the world, ask yourself why these weapons
have been restricted. Is there a powerful organization
that relies on its stranglehold over the secrets of firearm
production to protect its interests? Perhaps magic is
so prevalent that only a rare, aberrant individual who
lacks a talent for magic would be interested in pursuing
technological advancements. Maybe the dynamics of the
world itself comes into play; for example, some element
in the atmosphere or properties of the metals
drawn from below the surface resist being
shaped and manipulated to the degree
necessary for creating firearms or other
technological weapons and gadgets,
so the only way to obtain such items
is to purchase them from extraplanar
merchants who import them from
distant planes. The possibilities are
endless, and it doesn’t matter so much
what reason you decide on, as long
as you have some understanding of
how the world you create weaves
together.
Of course, your world could also be
a wild and boundless convergence of planar
nexuses, where gunslingers fight alongside
sword-swinging knights and psychic snakes.
Anything is possible and only needs to make
as much sense as is required for you and your
friends to enjoy yourselves and tell the kinds of
stories you want!
WHAT ABOUT NUMERIA?
The nation of Numeria is known to have technology levels
that greatly exceed those of the rest of Golarion. With a
crashed spaceship from a distant planet thrust into the
middle of its landscape, Numeria has lasers, artificial
intelligences, and other technology that transcend
steampunk or clockwork influences and approach the
realm of science fiction. Numeria and its technology
aren’t represented in this book, as those themes and
mechanics are better reserved for a presentation that can
give them the focus they deserve.
Some players might want to play a character from
Numeria, however, perhaps envisioning a ysoki inventor
who didn’t have access to technology from the crashed
spaceship and instead innovated based on what they
saw, using clockworks and steam engines to emulate the
functionality, if not the technological level, of weapons
and devices scavenged in the region. GMs who allow
access to the inventor class would be fully justified in also
giving characters from Numeria access to the inventor
and its gadgets, though with a clear understanding that
the technology level represented by the inventor is very
different from the highly advanced equipment normally
associated with the region.

In the world of Golarion, technology moves at its own
unusual pace. The widespread use of magic advanced
the ability for certain developments and discoveries, as
spells provided a natural way to discover new data or
solve a technological issue that required generations of
innovation on Earth. However, magic has been equally
a hindrance in the development of other technologies,
as the relative advancement and availability of low-level
magic meant it simply wasn’t worth the development
cost and time it would take to devote resources to
expanding other technologies whose benefits were easily
replicable by magic.
Another influencing factor in the development of
technology has been the many horrific cataclysms that
have befallen the planet of Golarion as a whole, and
various regions and nations in turn. Sometimes, a
technology discovered in ancient times is lost to Golarion
for millennia, only to resurface much later. For instance,
Xin, the first emperor of the ancient empire of Thassilon,
mastered the creation of clockworks over 10,000 years
ago, only to see his palace sink to the bottom of the ocean
and his discoveries lost to the ages.
Across much of Golarion, the options presented in this
chapter are uncommon at best, and some of them, like
Stasian technology, are rare or even unique in the world.
If you’re playing in a different setting than Golarion, your
group should decide if some or all of the technologies in
this chapter are more widely available, or if they aren’t
available at all.
Lands of Gears
In some corners of Golarion, these options are more
available than in others. Whether it’s due to discoveries
of ancient technology, the determination of a few
obsessed visionaries, or a storied history of innovation,
these tech-friendly locations, nations, and regions are
places where an enterprising player character looking
for technology might find that which they seek... and
possibly more than they bargained for as well.
CLOCKWORK
Absalom, the “City at the Center of the World,” naturally,
has access to engineering techniques from across the world,
and its famed Clockwork Cathedral (page 203) is a center
of learning for clockwork technologies. Meanwhile, many
inhabitants of the nation of New Thassilon, which recently
returned to the world after spending centuries displaced in
time, still remember some of First Emperor Xin’s secrets
regarding clockworks. These people tend to eagerly
explore new innovations that were created during their
GEARS CHARACTERS
The scorch marks on the wall made it clear: dragon breath. From what our wizard
said, that would probably make our adversary a red dragon. It wouldn’t have been
hard for a creature so greedy, powerful, and proud to beat us into these ancient ruins,
recently unsealed by a massive earthquake. Though something still didn’t seem right.
Most of the scorch marks weren’t fresh at all and were covered by ancient dust. When
we exited the tunnel into the great ruined chamber, we saw a gleaming metal dragon
made of thousands of clockwork parts, its fangs and claws tapering off into a dark
black metal. Adamantine, maybe? How could this be? The ruins were sealed for ages,
and I’d only ever seen a creature like this once before in Absalom. I remember hearing
the one from Absalom was cutting edge, too, but its design was much more rudimentary.
This shouldn’t be possible! But then the gears began to click and whir, and the dragon
construct’s mouth snapped open. A wave of flame arose from deep within its mechanical
body, licking from its maw in tongues of fire. Fortunately, this dragon wasn’t the only one
with a few tricks up its chassis. Sparks flew from my experimental armor as I activated
the new, if somewhat unstable, feature I created for situations just like this. When the
smoke cleared, I was barely singed, thanks to the heat-dispersing properties of my armor.
Our wizard wasn’t in the best of shape, though, and a pouch of my medicinal herbs had
caught fire. Thinking quickly, I finished what the dragon had started and vaporized
the herbs in an explosion, delivering much-needed relief to the wounded wizard. As I
pounded my fists together, electricity sparking between my two armored gauntlets, I
turned to face the dragon anew.
