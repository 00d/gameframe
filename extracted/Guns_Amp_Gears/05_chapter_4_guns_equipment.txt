tray that wielders can load with powder and shot and
then quickly prep to fire with minimal effort. Many
dwarves of Dongun Hold have gone so far as to retire
the signatory clan daggers of their extended family
units, replacing them with clan pistols to showcase
the family’s gunsmithing skills. The most proud and
unyielding families might even refuse to acknowledge
that a child has reached adulthood until they craft
their own clan pistol designed in accordance with the
family’s exacting standards.
In Casmaron and Vudra, firearms obtained from
either Garund or Tian Xia are held in high regard and
often become family heirlooms, particularly among
families of merchants and guards. Because it’s difficult
to obtain replacement parts for these weapons, the
jezail has become a particularly common weapon of
choice. Typically starting from the barrel and firing
mechanism of a long gun, such as a musket or even
an arquebus, a jezail has a stock handcrafted by each
successive owner, customized to their grip and build
for maximum utility and often accented with artistic
patterns that celebrate the owner’s, or their family’s,
history and accomplishments.
Arcadia’s
modern
firearms
include
magical
innovations alongside technological ones, making them
just as mystical as their ancient predecessor weapons.
Beast guns in particular have benefitted from millennia
to perfect the rituals and magic used to create them,
allowing for the creation of several types of beast guns
with powerful effects or longer range compared to
most black powder firearms.
REVOLVERS AND WORLD WAR I–ERA WEAPONS
A small number of weapons that are more advanced
than anything that can be reproduced on Golarion
have found their way into Golarion from time to time.
In a few Adventure Paths, player characters have the
opportunity to travel to other worlds where modern
weaponry is available. The assumption is that some
of these revolvers, World War I–era weapons, and
other devices may have made their way into the hands
of collectors throughout Golarion, but never in a
significant enough quantity to be considered anything
other than absolute rarities.
Because these weapons, and the ammunition used
to fire them, aren’t something that can be reliably
reproduced on Golarion, statistics for them aren’t
included in this book. A GM looking to introduce these
types of guns has several options to choose from, but
before you begin, it’s important to note that doing so
can have an imbalanced effect. The guns of Golarion
are designed to work well along the other weapons
in the world, giving you more options that each have
power in certain situations. Firearms with additional
advantages would simply be more powerful than
anything else available, potentially raising damage
output significantly while negatively impacting an
array of other gunslinger options.
For a mechanical expression that works similarly
to a cartridge-fed rifle, a GM might look at creating
a non-magical version of the Rowan Rifle (page 166)
with the repeating trait. However, the resulting weapon
would be more powerful than an advanced firearm, so
it’s not recommended. For a GM looking to create a
revolver, a similar mechanical expression might result
from adding the repeating trait to the dueling pistol,
but again, this would make it more powerful than an
advanced firearm, so it isn’t recommended.
An option that might work better if you’re
interested in using newer, more modern guns as the
main firearms in your campaign is to instead adjust
the baseline expectations for them. Being able to load
the breech-loading weapons included in this book
with just a single Interact action is a pretty big stretch,
created to make them more fun to use than a simulated
reality, but if you want to use more modern guns in
your setting, you can just say that breech loaders take
a more realistic time to reload (making them very weak
compared to other weapons), and then use the statistics
currently listed for a pepperbox as a revolver instead.
This option will have no knock-on implications that
throw off the weapon balance in your game, but it’s
an all-or-nothing choice that’s only appropriate if
modern firearms are the ones that are mainly used in
your world.
The final option you might consider to handle these
firearms is to create statistics for specific magical
versions of certain modern guns and say those were the
only expressions of those guns available to be found.
This allows you to give the gun enhanced statistics
without causing any problems because the weapon
starts out at a significantly higher level and is unable
to add property runes, whereas other weapons can add
property runes to gain additional benefits.
BLACK POWDER PRESERVATIVES?
On both Golarion and Earth, black powder contains
elements that can help preserve and even season food.
On Earth in the early 1800s, Napoleon Bonaparte is said
to have used gunpowder to season and preserve horse
meat to feed his wounded troops when supplies were
particularly low after a major battle. On Golarion, this
same technique has been used in years past by Casmar
and Vudrani traders, when storms or other events
threatened to spoil rations or even cause the black
powder itself to go to waste. Today, the demand for black
powder across the Inner Sea is high enough, and the
availability of black powder from Tian Xia low enough,
that the practice is largely discontinued. Preserving or
seasoning your rations with black powder would be akin
to salting a steak with gold!

================================================================================

The following rules cover the use of firearms and
includes the firearms and ammunition types available.
All firearms are subject to misfires if they’re not properly
maintained, as described in the sidebar.
The clan pistol and dwarven scattergun have the dwarf
trait, the mithral tree has the elf trait, and the flingflenser
has the goblin trait. However, feats such as Dwarven
Weapon Familiarity, which normally grants access to all
uncommon weapons with the dwarf trait, don’t grant
access to firearms with the listed traits unless the character
separately has access to firearms. For instance, dwarves
who’ve never seen a firearm and then train in traditional
dwarven weapons don’t have access to clan pistols and
dwarven scatterguns. You can find more information on
this and other firearm access details on page 148.
AMMUNITION
Firearms require ammunition consisting of a projectile
and black powder. A round of ammo can vary in its
composition but is typically either a prepackaged paper
cartridge, including wadding, bullet, and black powder,
or loose shot packed in manually. Some weapons,
like hand cannons and blunderbusses, can fire other
materials, but their ammunition has the same Price due
to the cost of the black powder. Because making rounds
of firearm ammunition requires creating black powder,
you need the Alchemical Crafting skill feat to make
them. Firearm rounds are a valid option for magical
ammunition, just like arrows or bolts. Crafting magical
firearm ammunition requires you to be able to craft
both alchemical and magical items.
WEAPON TRAITS
These weapons include the following traits, in addition
to any described in the Core Rulebook.
Capacity: Weapons that have the capacity trait
typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of
containing a round of ammunition. Capacity is always
accompanied by a number indicating the number of
barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired,
you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an
Interact action that doesn’t require a free hand. Each
barrel or chamber can be reloaded after it’s fired as a
separate Interact action.
CLASSIC FIREARMS
Concealable: This weapon is designed to be
inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide
or conceal a weapon with this trait.
Concussive: These weapons smash as much as
puncture. When determining a creature’s resistance or
immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker
of the target’s resistance or immunity to piercing or
bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune
to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to
bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from
a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all
physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.
Double Barrel: This weapon has two barrels that are
each loaded separately. You can fire both barrels of a
double barrel weapon in a single Strike to increase the
size of the weapon damage die by one step. If the weapon
has the fatal trait, this increases the size of the fatal die by
one step as well.
Fatal Aim: It’s possible to hold the stock of this weapon
under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand as
long as the other hand isn’t holding a weapon, shield, or
anything else you would need to move and position, to
ensure the weapon doesn’t slip out from under your arm.
However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make
fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands,
it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding
the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly
more complicated than just releasing one hand from the
weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must
do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as
part of reloading.
Kickback: A kickback weapon is extra powerful and
difficult to use. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional
damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a
–2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters
with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a
kickback weapon to stabilizers can lower or negate this
penalty (page 182).
Modular: The weapon has multiple configurations
that you can switch between using an Interact action.
Typically, switching between configurations of a modular
weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed
in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or S”), though it’s

complicated configurations.
Repeating: Repeating weapons can’t be loaded
with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows
and firearms can; instead, they require a magazine of
specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special
slot. Once the magazine is in place, the ammunition is
automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to
fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry
(typically 0).

When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must
be loaded, which requires a free hand and three Interact
actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new
magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). As with
other types of reloading that take multiple actions, these
actions don’t need to be consecutive.
Scatter: This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide
spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating
the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of an
attack with a scatter weapon takes the listed damage, and
the target and all other creatures within the listed radius
around it take 1 splash damage per weapon damage die.
FIREARMS CRITICAL SPECIALIZATION
This book introduces the firearm weapon group, which
has the following critical specialization effect.
Firearm: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
against your class DC or be stunned 1.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
Each of the weapons listed in Table 4–1: Melee Weapons
and Table 4–2: Ranged Weapons are detailed below.
Air Repeater: A thin-barreled firearm that uses a
container of pressurized air instead of black powder to
propel small metal bullets from an attached cartridge,
the air repeater has fallen out of common use in Arcadia
due to its poor stopping power, though it’s still used
occasionally for casual hunting and sport shooting. The
air repeater and its longer-ranged, two-handed variant are
still valued by some for their ability to allow a shooter to
fire multiple rounds without needing to stop to reload or
crank to a new chamber. A typical air repeater magazine
holds 6 pellets.
Arquebus: This is a long rifle that offers more range
than the average firearm, though the long barrel and
ferocious kickback make the weapon particularly
unsteady unless a tripod or other stand is used to stabilize
it. The arquebus is one of the most commonly used long
guns among the soldiers of Dongun Hold and Alkenstar.
Bayonet: This blade or spike can be attached to a
crossbow or firearm but, unlike other attached weapons,
can be wielded in one hand as its own weapon. When
used as a separate weapon, it can’t benefit from any runes
or abilities that function only for attached weapons.
Blunderbuss: This weapon fires pellets from a
trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an excellent choice for
hunting brush fowl or dealing damage within a short, broad
area. Adventuring gunslingers often carry a blunderbuss to
deal with swarms of vermin and similar threats.
Clan Pistol: The tradition of dwarves displaying their
clan affiliations with special clan daggers goes back
millennia, but many of the dwarf clans of Dongun Hold
have their own take on the tradition, with promising
young gunsmiths claiming their adulthood by crafting
a specialized personal firearm using the clan’s unique
smithing traditions. Losing or being forced to surrender
their clan pistol is a terrible embarrassment for the
dwarves that carry them.
Coat Pistol: This small pistol is easily concealed inside
a jacket or some other article of clothing. Rarely kept as
a primary weapon, coat pistols are equally favored by
clever assassins and traveling Alkenstar aristocrats.
Double-Barreled Musket: This flintlock breech-loader
has two side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate
than a standard musket, a double-barreled musket
offers versatility in firing options. Many of Alkenstar’s
famous shield marshals save their earnings to buy a
double-barreled musket as their first personal firearm.
Double-Barreled Pistol: This flintlock pistol has two
side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate than a standard
pistol, a double-barreled pistol is a useful and versatile
weapon. It’s generally banned in areas where duels with
pistols are relatively common, in much the same way that
arriving at an aristocratic duel with a scattergun would
be considered crass, at best.
Dragon-Mouth Pistol: Similar to the blunderbuss,
a dragon-mouth pistol fires pellets from a flared
barrel. Though less powerful than a blunderbuss, the
dragon-mouth pistol is appreciated for its portability
and one-handed design. Though the name was coined
because of the destructive belch of this handheld scatter
weapon, many gunsmiths craft dragon-mouth pistols
with elaborate embellishments that resemble a stylized
dragon’s maw framing the barrel.
Dueling Pistol: Made for settling disputes when
diplomacy fails, dueling pistols are finely crafted and
made to fit easily into a holster or pocket. Noble and
wealthy merchants in both Alkenstar and Dongun Hold
often own matching pairs of dueling pistols in case
they’re called upon to address a challenge—though this
practice has become increasingly rare in the modern age.
MISFIRES
Firearms that are improperly maintained or subjected to
unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt to fire a firearm
that was fired the previous day or earlier and hasn’t been
cleaned since then, roll a DC 5 flat check before making
your attack roll. If you fail this misfire check, the weapon
misfires and jams. The attack is an automatic critical
failure, and you must use an Interact action to clear the
jam before you can reload the weapon and fire again.
Once you have spent at least an hour cleaning a weapon,
you don’t need to roll for a misfire until the next day
unless an effect says otherwise. You can clean multiple
firearms during this hour, up to a reasonable limit as
determined by the GM (typically no more than five).
Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as part of
their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an
attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed
attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a
critical failure.

GEARS
Dwarven Scattergun: A favored weapon of dwarf
scouts from Dongun Hold, the dwarven scattergun is a
powerful weapon designed to take advantage of a dwarf’s
sturdy frame. A dwarven scattergun fires a large paper
cartridge stuffed with black powder and knuckle-sized
lumps of metal, creating a devastating burst so destructive
that a foolish dwarf might find themself catching
painful ricochets when firing at a too-close target. Some
scatterguns are crafted with a clockwork firing tray that
can quickly sort and load black powder and shot without
needing a prepackaged cartridge, though this is largely an
aesthetic feature with no real mechanical benefit.
Fire Lance: This amazingly simple projectile weapon
is nothing more than a metal tube packed with black
powder and a stopper, attached to the sharpened head of
a javelin. A loaded fire lance can be wielded as a normal
spear, though it requires an Interact action to regrip the
weapon and hold it properly when switching from one
use to another. Fire lances are most commonly found in
Tian Xia, though occasionally one makes its way all the
way to Avistan, typically in the hands of a Tien mercenary
or caravan guard.
Flingflenser: A flingflenser is a
goblin-designed weapon ending in
an ovoid tube with a hatch and
handle on the narrow end.
A cluster of circular
blades held together
and attached to a
black powder packet
with a thin leather strap
serves as ammunition and is
loaded through the hatch before
being fired with a flintlock or other external ignition
mechanism. The flingflenser’s sturdy design also places it
among the more reliable goblin weapons.
Flintlock Musket: The most commonly available of
firearms in Alkenstar, the flintlock musket includes an
external firing mechanism and an efficient and relatively
compact frame. Though lacking the range and firing
power of the arquebus preferred by Alkenstar and
Dongun Hold’s military members, the flintlock musket is
popular among civilians for its ease of use.
Flintlock Pistol: Though less accurate and powerful
than a flintlock musket, the flintlock pistol is a preferred
weapon of privateers thanks to its more compact size and
affordability. Pirate captains often wear a brace of such
pistols in a bandolier so they can draw and fire without
stopping to reload.
Forked Bipod: Developed by Alkenstar scouts who
often don’t have time to break down a tripod when beset
by the chaotic mutant monsters of the Mana Wastes, this
two-pronged stabbing weapon can be used as a bipod to
stabilize a gun with potent kickback. A forked bipod can
be deployed or retrieved for use as a melee weapon as an
Interact action.
Hand Cannon: Popular among privateers and
mercenaries in Goka, hand cannons are little more than
a hardened tube with a handle and external ignition
attached. A hand cannon can be used to fire almost
anything that can be packed into its barrel. The wielder
of a hand cannon can change the damage type granted
by its modular trait as part of the same Interact action
used to reload.
Harmona Gun: A favored weapon of monster hunters
in Arcadia, the harmona gun is a large-bore long gun that
fires a heavy, slow-moving round. The gun got its name
due to the eerie similarity between the buzzing sound its
oversized projectiles make flying through the air and the
flight of a fey bird called a harmona.
Jezail: Jezails are simple, efficient long guns developed
in Casmaron that typically feature a custom stock and
a flintlock firing mechanism. Though lacking the range
and stopping power of an arquebus or the raw force of
a harmona gun, the jezail is an elegant, well-balanced
weapon suitable for a variety of combat
situations. It’s even possible to tuck it
under one arm to fire a less accurate
attack that uses only one hand.
Knuckle Duster: This bit of
hardened metal, favored by street
toughs, is typically made of brass
and features four finger holes so
that it can sit atop the knuckles, adding
extra power to a punch.
Long Air Repeater: Like the one-handed air
repeater, this thin-barreled firearm uses a container
of pressurized air instead of black powder to propel
small metal pellets from an attached cartridge. The long
air repeater has better range and ammo capacity than
the one-handed variant, though it still lacks significant
stopping power. A typical long air repeater magazine
holds 8 pellets.
Mithral Tree: Neither mithral nor a tree, this long gun
takes its name from the legends of the elves of Jinin and
is most commonly found within the nation. An elegant
weapon, a mithral tree does somewhat resemble a tree; its
fanned stock and long, sweeping barrel reinforced with
metal rings enable a wielder to parry melee attacks while
moving back into safe firing range.
Pepperbox: This weapon is a specialty of the smiths
of Alkenstar. The pepperbox has three barrels that each
hold a single shot, and the shooter can manually rotate
the whole barrel assembly to align a loaded barrel with
the firing mechanism.
Reinforced Stock: A reinforced stock is a weighted
crossbow, firearm haft, or grip customized for striking
in melee.
Slide Pistol: Also known as a harmonica gun,
this weapon is essentially a stock, trigger, and firing
mechanism attached to a sliding brace of barrels that can
each hold a round of ammunition.

While their power and rarity make Golarion firearms
fantastical in their own right, this hasn’t stopped
engineers, craftsman, and even fey smiths from attempting
to improve the weapons or create their own versions.
Whether these fantastic weapons include the beast guns
of Arcadia, the combination weapons wielded by gunners
of the Inner Sea seeking to stretch their meager supplies of
black powder, or the goblin-forged “cobbled firearms” of
the Shackles, Golarion is home to a diverse and unlikely
array of unusual black powder weapons.
Beast Guns
Arcadia’s history of gunsmithing goes back centuries,
and Arcadia may very well have been the first
continent on Golarion in which firearms were
developed. While Arcadia’s Deadshot Lands are
famous for their rare and prestigious skymetal
guns, patterned after the star guns of old,
more common in other regions are beast
guns, created as part of a long-standing rite
of passage.
While they don’t look much like
ancient star guns and use a different kind
of magic, beast guns are particularly
notable in that, like star guns, they rely
on magic rather than black powder.
Beast guns can produce unique effects
beyond simply damaging their targets.
Beast guns aren’t loaded with the
same ammunition as other guns, but
they do still use ammunition, rather
than shooting magical energy like
a star gun. This ammunition comes
as specially designed rounds, such as miniature
tentacles fired from the tentacle gun or javelin-like
spikes from the spike gun. Unless otherwise stated, these
rounds come in packs of 10 that cost 1 sp and have
light Bulk. The only weapon in this section that works
significantly differently is the growth gun, which grows
back a gob of its own ammunition once per round,
ensuring you always have enough ammunition to fire a
shot every round.
Monster hunters of all kinds roam Arcadia slaying
beasts and harvesting their body parts to produce new
beast guns, both new examples of established models and
brand new types never seen or imagined before. Even after
thousands of years, innovators expand the possibilities of
what a beast gun can do.
The following pages contain a small sample of the
many kinds of beast guns crafted in Arcadia. Each
beast gun is a specific magic item. You can find more
information on the ritual used in hunting the beasts to
create a beast gun on page 130.

A breath blaster is a +1 striking blunderbuss most commonly
crafted from the trachea of a dragon, though other creatures
with breath weapons or the ability to spit energy are
occasionally used. The implementation of the dragon’s trachea
allows the firearm to unleash a torrent of pure energy in the
form of gouts of flame or bolts of electricity.
A breath blaster’s Strikes deal either acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or poison damage, depending on the dragon
type or other creature from which it was made, though
it can otherwise be used like a normal
blunderbuss. A breath blaster also can
be activated to fire a line of energy in a
30-foot line or 15-foot cone, chosen when
it’s created and typically corresponding to the
shape of the breath weapon used by the type
of dragon or creature from which the breath
blaster was created.
In theory, the foundational techniques
required to create a breath blaster would
allow for other damage types, but such
breath blasters would require the trachea
from the correct dragon or creature type
and additional creation techniques, making such a
breath blaster rare rather than uncommon.

is a +1 weapon. It’s a distinct type of martial firearm that
deals 1d10 damage with a range increment of 150 feet and
reload 1. It deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage,
depending on the drake from which it was made. On a critical
hit, the spittle clings to the target and they take persistent
damage of the same type as the weapon equal to 1d4 + the
number of weapon damage dice. A drake rifle does not add
critical specialization effects.
Activate [three-actions] Interact (evocation, magical); Frequency
once per day; Effect You fire a large, specialized burst
designed to hamper your foes. Make a ranged Strike
with the drake rifle. As long as the Strike isn’t a critical
failure, the drake rifle deals 1 splash damage per weapon
damage die to the target and creatures within 5 feet of
the target. This splash damage is of the same type as its
normal damage.
On a hit, the drake rifle provides one of the following
additional effects based on its damage type:
•	 Acid Clinging acid makes it painful and sickening to
move. The target becomes sickened 1.
•	 Cold Frozen spittle clings to the target. The target takes
a –10-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 1 minute.
•	 Electricity
Small
bursts
of
electricity continue to
spark and jolt the target.
The
target
becomes
dazzled and flat-footed
for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Fire
A
massive
explosion
knocks
the target back. The target is pushed 10 feet away from
you, and if it’s on the ground, it falls prone.
•	 Poison Noxious vapors fill the target’s lungs. The target
becomes enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 for 1 minute.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include
the saliva glands of a ritually hunted drake with a breath
weapon that deals the appropriate damage type for the
drake rifle.

Cobbled Firearms
Goblins are nothing if not creative and adaptable, and
have a unique gift for recognizing an advantage when
they see one. Even with the relative rarity of firearms,
only the most secluded goblins are unaware of the deadly
metal tubes that fling death over long distances using
fire and explosive powder. The goblin gunsmiths of the
Motaku Isle Ironworks in Absalom’s Shackles constantly
experiment with new weapon designs using spare parts
from their clients’ weapons shipments and whatever
happens to be lying around. The more successful versions
of these junk guns often get added to the catalogue
of weapons available from the ironworks, while the
less effective ones usually kill their creators before the
unfortunate gunsmiths have a chance to iterate on
their designs. All cobbled firearms have the
cobbled trait, which causes them to
misfire on a failure.
The big boom gun and
spoon gun both have the
goblin trait. However, feats
such as Goblin Weapon Familiarity, which
normally grants access to all uncommon
weapons with the goblin trait, do not grant
access to firearms with the goblin trait unless the
character separately has access to firearms. You
can find more information on this and other firearm
access details on page 148.
MUNDANE COBBLED FIREARMS
Big boom guns and spoon guns are modified versions
of hand cannons with potential benefits and drawbacks
alike, rather than separate weapons. If you have access
to the spoon gun or big boom gun modifications, you
can purchase them whenever you would purchase a hand
cannon, and effects that depend upon and apply to hand
cannons apply to both weapons.
SPOON GUN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
GOBLIN
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
No one’s entirely certain who
developed the spoon gun, but
all authorities agree that it was
probably a goblin. Essentially a terrible
idea in firearm form, the spoon gun is a
spring‑powered hand cannon with a modified
grip that uses miscellaneous knives, forks, chopsticks,
and spoons as ammunition. Users typically upend the entire
contents of their cutlery drawer into the gun, aim it in the
general direction of the foe, and hope it hits something.
This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple
weapon. It has the scatter (5 feet) trait and uses cutlery or
similar-sized objects as ammunition instead of bullets (enough
cheap cutlery to fire ten shots costs 1 sp).
BIG BOOM GUN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
GOBLIN
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 2
Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the ‘hand’
part of ‘hand cannon’, this comically-oversized gun has a
heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome
quantity of gunpowder.
This hand cannon is a martial weapon,
instead of a simple weapon. It has the
fatal d12 trait and a range of 20 feet. It also
has the following modified critical failure
condition:
Critical Failure The attack misses, the weapon
misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it
explodes in your face.
MAGICAL COBBLED FIREARMS
When you take the already volatile
technology of cobbled firearms and add unstable
evocation magic to the mix, you can be sure that
something either wonderful or terrifying is going to come
from it, and perhaps both at once. The liar’s gun is the
embodiment of that certainty. The liar’s gun is a specific
magic item.
LIAR’S GUN
ITEM 7
UNCOMMON
COBBLED
MAGICAL
Price 360 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This dubious weapon gets its name
from the fact that it’s typically
crafted with multiple false barrels
so that it’s more difficult for enemies
to predict the weapon’s angle of fire
from the four working barrels. Most of the time, this
gun functions as a +1 striking pepperbox with capacity 4
instead of capacity 3, albeit one with a complicated loading
mechanism involving rotating the barrels. In a pinch though,
all four of the real barrels can be fired simultaneously.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect Make up to four Strikes with
the liar’s gun. Each of the four Strikes must be against
a different target within a 20-foot cone. You apply and
increasing your multiple attack penalty for the four Strikes
only after resolving all attacks. If the weapon misfires on
any of these attacks, wait to apply the misfire until you
resolve all of the attacks.
ADDITIONAL TRAITS
The following new trait is applicable to all the weapons
in this section.
Cobbled: This firearm is cobbled together and likely to
misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it, on a failed
attack roll, the attack misses and you must roll a DC 5 flat
check. If you fail this check, the weapon misfires.

Combination Weapons
With the advent of firearms, there have been a number of
gunslingers, inventors, and alchemists who have created a
variety of combination weapons using black powder. The
explosive dogslicer, gnome amalgam musket, and three
peaked tree all have traits corresponding to an ancestry.
However, feats such as Elven Weapon Familiarity, which
normally grants access to all uncommon weapons with the
elf trait, do not grant access to firearms with the given trait
unless the character separately has access to firearms. You
can find more information on this and other firearm access
details on page 148.

COMBINATION WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
The weapons listed in Table 4–3: Uncommon Combination
Weapons are detailed below.
Axe Musket: This item, favored by firearms-using
dwarves and barbarians, takes the form of a sturdy musket
with an axeblade attached near the muzzle.
Black Powder Knuckle Dusters:
This pair of knuckle dusters is fitted
with an explosive charge of black
powder within the hollowed spikes of
the weapon and a firing mechanism you
hold in your hand while in use.
Cane Pistol: This fashionable cane’s handle
hides a dueling pistol fired through the thin, painted
cap at the bottom of the cane.
Dagger Pistol: This weapon, favored by rangers and
other wilderness wanderers, takes the form of a stoutly
built pistol with a dagger blade attached beneath the barrel
and extending out past the muzzle.
Explosive Dogslicer: An explosive dogslicer is a sneaky,
explosive weapon that often brings perverse joy to the
goblins who use them. At first glance, it appears to be a
triple-bladed dogslicer with an oversized guard.
Gnome Amalgam Musket: Rumored to be the result of
a gnomish dare to make a variant of a hooked hammer
that’s even more intricate and complex, this weapon adds
a musket to the mix of an already overcomplicated device.
Gun sword: This weapon consists of a large sword with
a powerful gun based on a harmona gun down the center.
Vanguards and other characters who rely on Strength
and Dexterity enjoy the power and
flexibility of a gun sword.
Hammer Gun: This weapon, favored
by dwarves and those who like smashing
and shooting, takes the form of a stoutly
built gun designed similarly to an arquebus
with a hammer head built into the muzzle,
decreasing kickback but limiting range.
Mace Multipistol: At first glance this weapon
looks like nothing more than an iron-bound club.
But the top of the weapon features a latch that opens
to reveal three rotating pistol muzzles concealed in the
mace’s head that can be fired and rotated using triggers
built into the weapon’s haft.
Piercing Wind: Favored by caravan guards who traverse
the Mana Wastes, a piercing wind is similar to a jezail,
in that you can carry it in one hand as long as the other
hand’s free, by holding it under one arm. Additionally, it’s
fitted with an underslung curved blade.
Rapier Pistol: This elegant weapon is shaped similarly
to a rapier with a pistol down the length of the blade.
Three Peaked Tree: A recently developed weapon created
for an elven champion from Jinin, the three-peaked tree can
be used as both a trident and a mithral tree. A three-peaked
tree has a length of silken rope attached to the butt of its
haft, allowing it to be quickly retrieved after thrown.
ADDITIONAL TRAITS
The following traits are applicable to various weapons in
this section.
Combination: Combination is a new trait for weapons
that combine the functionality of melee weapons and
firearms in unique or unusual ways. A combination
weapon has a firearm form or usage and a melee weapon
form or usage. Table 4–3: Uncommon Combination
Weapons lists the firearm statistics first and the melee
weapon statistics indented beneath, just above the
ammunition. Switching between the melee weapon
usage and the firearm usage requires an Interact
action. However, if your last action was a successful
melee Strike against a foe using a combination
weapon, you can make a firearm Strike with the
combination weapon against that foe without
fully switching to the firearm usage, firing the
firearm just as you hit with the melee attack. In this
case, the combination weapon returns to its melee
usage after the firearm Strike.
Since a combination weapon is one weapon with
two usages, both usages share any fundamental
runes. You can put a property rune on a combination
weapon as long as it’s appropriate for either of the two
usages, but if only one of the usages meets the property
rune’s requirements, the effects of the property rune only
apply for that usage. For instance, a vorpal axe musket
only applies the vorpal property rune when you are
using it as an axe. Due to their complexity, combination
weapons can’t have another weapon, such as a bayonet or
reinforced stock, attached to them.
Critical Fusion: Critical fusion is a new trait for
combination weapons that grants you two additional
options for their critical specialization effect when using
the combination weapon’s melee version to make a melee
attack while the firearm is loaded. If you choose to use
one of them, they replace the melee usage’s normal critical
specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm
to create a loud bang and concussion, using the
critical specialization effect for firearms instead
of the melee weapon group’s critical specialization
effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm
to increase the critical hit’s momentum or shoot the
foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2
additional damage per weapon damage die.
Both options discharge the firearm, which
typically means you have to reload it before
firing it again.
Tethered: This weapon is attached to a
length of rope or chain that allows you to
retrieve it after it’s left your hand. If you
have a free hand, you can use an Interact
action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you
have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been
disarmed (unless it’s being held by another creature).

Rare and Unique Magic
Firearms
While firearms are relatively uncommon in Golarion
and extremely unusual to encounter in the Inner
Sea region outside of a few specific areas, they are
nonetheless an attractive choice for use in crafting
unique signature weapons and other great works.
The fey of Arcadia created their own firearm in the
form of the Rowan Rifle to gift to their champions,
while in the Inner Sea heroes from several countries
and regions have traveled to Alkenstar to have their
trophies immortalized as part of a powerful and
unusual weapon.
The following are rare and unique specific magic
firearms, possessing unusual and sometimes outlandish
special effects. Some among these firearms are cursed,
haunted, or even intelligent. You can find more
information on cursed items on Gamemastery Guide
page 90, and more information on intelligent items
on Gamemastery Guide page 88. A haunted firearm
is simply a cursed firearm whose curse derives from a
confused, enraged, or tormented spirit attached
to the weapon. It is often possible, though
difficult, to discover and resolve the unfinished
business that will put that spirit to rest. In
this case, the firearm’s curse might be
forever lifted as the spirit goes free
to the afterlife, never to bother the
firearm’s wielder again.
CURSED FIREARMS
ARBOREAL’S REVENGE
ITEM 6
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This walnut and brass +1 striking blunderbuss has a natural
look, with wood worn smooth by time, but left knotted and
gnarled. The handgrip beneath the flared muzzle is a well-
positioned bulging tree knot, and the long stock looks as if it
was grown to fit you. On closer examination, the whorls and
rings in the wood resemble eyes.
Arboreal’s revenge is a haunted firearm constructed with
wood hewn from a living arboreal, slaying the arboreal and
trapping its spirit in the firearm. Perhaps a patient wielder
could one day put the arboreal’s spirit to rest, or at least come
to terms with it, abating the drawbacks of the weapon while
keeping its advantages.
When you first fire arboreal’s revenge, the blunderbuss
fuses with you, after which it’s almost impossible to remove it
from your possession with a remove curse or similar effect, like
many cursed items. You gain weakness 5 to fire and the flat
check for you to recover from persistent fire damage increases
from 15 to 17, or from 10 to 12 if you receive appropriate help.
Whenever you wield arboreal’s revenge, the arboreal
spirit bound to the blunderbuss attempts to overtake you.
The wood handgrip sprouts roots which grow around your
hand, binding both of your hands to the firearm. You gain a
+4 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending
against checks to Disarm you. However, you can’t Release
your grip on the blunderbuss until you forcibly tear off the
roots, though they do allow you to move your hands enough
(and only enough) to reload and fire the blunderbuss. Tearing
off the roots takes 1 minute.
The arboreal haunting the firearm can use the following
two effects whenever it wants, often using them at random.
You can coax it into performing them each intentionally once
per day, with the following activations.
Activate [free-action] command; Frequency once per day; Effect The
arboreal haunting the blunderbuss attempts to regrow
itself into a new physical body by sprouting from the
bodies of all the creatures that the firearm recently
harmed. You and all creatures within 60 feet damaged by
arboreal’s revenge within the last minute must attempt
a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. On a failure, they take
a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds as roots
rapidly sprout from their wounds, which lasts until they
Escape (DC 20).
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect You cast barkskin from the blunderbuss as a 2nd-
level primal spell. However,
the weakness to fire imposed
by barkskin is cumulative
with the weakness to fire
imposed by this weapon’s curse,
for a total of weakness 8 to fire.
IMMOLATION CLAN PISTOL

FIRE
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This charred and blackened +2 striking clan pistol is coated
in a thick layer of soot and grease and its retort sounds
uncomfortably like a scream. Clearly at dangerous risk of
misfire, this weapon claimed the life of its dwarven crafter
shortly after completion and is haunted by that pained spirit.
This ever-burning spirit keeps the firearm warm to the touch,
regardless of surrounding environment.
No matter how much you clean and maintain it, an
immolation clan pistol is always at risk of a misfire, and
the flat check to avoid a misfire is DC 7 rather than DC 5.
On a misfire, an immolation hand cannon releases a blast
of concentrated fire, dealing you 2d6 fire damage and 2d6
persistent fire damage.
An immolation clan pistol fuses with you when you first
fire it. While you’re fused with the immolation clan pistol, the
pained spirit haunts your dreams, forcing you to relive its
death each night. If you fired the immolation clan pistol that
day, you are unharmed by these dreams. If you didn’t fire
the immolation clan pistol that day, but still possess it, you
awaken fatigued. If you no longer possess the immolation
clan pistol, the spirit of its dwarven smith is enraged by
your neglect; you awaken fatigued and aflame, taking 2d6
persistent fire damage.

Regardless, these nightmares possess clues to the spirit’s

creation and repair it with tools belonging to the tormented
spirit, you might be able to break the curse. If the spirit is set
free, this weapon becomes a +2 greater striking flaming hand
cannon with no other abilities or curses.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect You allow yourself to become partially possessed by
the immolated spirit bound to the hand cannon. For 1 minute,
you look like a flaming corpse. During this time, you gain a +2

cannon becomes a +2 striking flaming hand cannon.
PACT-BOUND PISTOL
ITEM 10
RARE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
EVIL
FIRE
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Wielded in over a hundred duels by the
famed Ustalavic noblewoman Countess
Tasya
Iserav,
this
+1 striking
fearsome dueling pistol (Advanced
Player’s Guide 260) is a work of
master
craftsmanship,
almost
eerie in the axiomatic perfection
present in each dimension and detail.
Commissioned at great expense and
artfully designed by a team of the finest
gunsmiths, this exquisite mahogany pistol
has adamantine detailing. The ruby-eyed,
leering devil’s face that surrounds the barrel
was intended to strike fear into the Countess’s
opponents—of which there were many. Countess
Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional
success in dueling circles and refused to name the
weapon’s creators for fear their works would fall
into an opponent’s hands. In the past decade, seven
replicas of the Countess’s famed pistol have arisen, each
said to be crafted by the Countess’s anonymous gunsmiths.
That each of these weapon’s wielders have quickly risen to
become exceptional duelists in their own right has
lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure,
wielders of these replicas have refused to square off
against the Countess.
Despite the weapon’s beauty and utility, a pact-bound
pistol is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation
of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the
weapon and the Archdevil Mephistopheles. Each pact-bound
pistol was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by
Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted
priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the
weapon is an acceptance of the contract’s terms and causes
the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears
in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and
can’t be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the
curse is removed.
Whenever you attack a living creature with the pact‑bound
pistol, text from the infernal contract is seared into your
flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the
attack was a critical success. The text appears one sentence
at a time, from the beginning to the end and is written in
Infernal. When the contract is fully scribed (see below), you
no longer lose Hit Points when you attack a living creature.
These burned phrases heal over as scars which can’t be
removed while you are fused to the weapon, although they
can be covered and disguised.
Each time a creature dies within 1 hour of being damaged
by a pact-bound pistol, that creature must attempt a DC 25
Will saving throw. On a failure, their soul is consigned to the
Archdevil Mephistopheles; their soul immediately goes to Hell
and they can’t be returned to life through any means short
of divine intervention, a heist, or a successful appeal in the
courts of Hell; even powerful magic such as wish is insufficient.
After you have consigned 9 souls to Mephistopheles in this
way, the contract is fully scribed upon your flesh. You become
immune to fire damage and the pact-bound pistol becomes a
+2 striking greater fearsome dueling pistol. Your soul belongs
to Mephistopheles and immediately goes to Hell when you
die. You can’t be returned to life through any means, even
through the divine intervention of a deity.
Failing to wield a pact-bound pistol is a breach of
contract. Each day you go without firing the pact‑bound
pistol at a living creature, you must attempt a Will
saving throw. On a failure, you become stupefied
1. If you are already stupefied, the value of
your stupefied condition increases by 1, to
a maximum of stupefied 4. While you’re
fused with the pact-bound pistol, you
can’t reduce the value of your stupefied
condition except by damaging a living
creature with it. Whenever you damage
a living creature with it, if you are
suffering from the stupefied condition
due to the pact-bound pistol, your
stupefied condition is removed.

The gunsmith that created this marvelous +2 greater
striking spell-storing scattergun poured so much love and

within the weapon, as it yearned desperately to respond to

Animate Dreamer

================================================================================

the same love and affection that created it. Through decades
of effort, it gained the ability to communicate empathically,
then telepathically. Now, the weapon is capable of exerting
its influence over other inanimate objects. Despite the
weapon’s progress, years of feeling helpless have given the
animate dreamer a singular goal: to obtain and occupy a
body of its own.
An animate dreamer is cunning, intelligent, and patient. It
urges you to create a body for it and is willing to go to any
lengths to see its goals come to fruition, including coercion,
deception, and violence. An animate dreamer desires a
permanent body but isn’t picky about the body’s form or
the methods it has to use in order to gain it. Therefore, an
animate dreamer is just as happy in a living body stolen from
an innocent as it would be in an artificially constructed body,
or even an undead corpse. If you refuse to work towards
creating or obtaining a body for the animate dreamer, it will
likely use its possession ability to try and take control of you
and use your body to find a permanent replacement for itself.
Activate [two-actions] command; Requirements The animate dreamer
has a stored spell. It can see a creature it hit and damaged
within the last minute, and that creature’s within 120 feet
of animate dreamer; Effect The animate dreamer casts its
stored spell at a target that meets the requirements. This
empties the spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be
cast into it again. The animate dreamer has a spell attack
roll of +25 and a spell DC of 33 with the stored spell.
Activate [three-actions] command; Effect The animate dreamer
focuses on a single unattended inanimate object in an area
it can see and exerts its will over the object, temporarily
levitating it around. The animate dreamer casts mage
hand as a 5th-level occult spell.
Activate [three-actions] command; Frequency once per day; Effect The
animate dreamer attempts to achieve its goal of occupying
a body of its own and casts possession as a 7th-level spell
with a spell DC of 33. The weapon still functions as a +2
greater striking spell-storing scattergun while this effect
is active but loses all other special abilities until the spell
expires and the animate dreamer’s intellect returns to it.

Possessing a boisterous, proud demeanor, this +1 jezail is
an aspiring big game hunter, always quick to share a tale
of its bold adventures and predatory conquests—although
the veracity of such tales is often questionable. A boastful
hunter enjoys tracking and hunting animals of all kinds but
takes particular pleasure in taking down large, dangerous,
or rare animals. Against an animal, the boastful hunter deals
1d6 additional damage. On a critical hit against an animal,
the boastful hunter also deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
A boastful hunter urges you to face off against tougher and
tougher creatures—a challenge the ambitious rifle may not be
adequate to deal with. If the boastful hunter goes one week
without participating in a hunt against an animal of at least
your level, it becomes bored. A bored boastful hunter complains
incessantly and imposes a –1 item penalty to attack rolls against
non-animal targets. A bored boastful hunter can be appeased by
using it in combat against an animal of at least your level.
Unable to accept its own weaknesses, a boastful hunter
blames any failed hunts on you, and considers remarks about
its strength or quality a terrible insult. An insulted boastful
hunter badmouths you to sentient creatures you interact
with, imposing a –1 item penalty to Deception, Diplomacy,
and Intimidation skill checks, and all attacks with it incur
a misfire chance until the weapon is appeased. An insulted
boastful hunter can be appeased by complimenting it and
succeeding at a Diplomacy check against its Will DC two

appease the boastful hunter once each day.

INTEGRATED FIREARMS
In addition to the many rare and unique weapons
presented here, there exists a special type of rare firearm
known as an integrated firearm that anyone who knows
the proper techniques can craft. An integrated firearm
replaces a creature’s forelimb, usually in place of a
prosthesis or one of an automaton’s (page 36) arms. An
integrated weapon can be a one or two-handed firearm
or combination weapon, though weapons with the reach
property are typically too ungainly for this treatment
and one-handed weapons are usually preferred since
two-handed weapons still require the use of a second
arm for proper wielding. Opponents can’t disarm an
integrated firearm and they take 10 minutes to attach
or remove. Integrated firearms can be fired using the
same arm they are attached to, with careful and complex
mechanics that use the wearer’s posture or even directly
attach to the muscles or other infrastructure that used
to control the severed or detached limb. A creature with
an integrated firearm can’t use the arm replaced by the
firearm for any actions or tasks other than wielding
and firing the firearm.

Patriotic to the extreme, this +2 flaming greater striking
flintlock musket was among the first firearms forged in the
Gunworks and was wielded by Ancil Alkenstar, founder of
the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. In Alkenstar’s hands, the
musket was used to defend the burgeoning Grand Duchy
from outside threats, including mutants of the Mana Wastes,
Nexian constructs, and undead from Geb. After Ancil’s
death, the weapon was passed down, per his own decree,
not to his heirs but to the greatest defender of Alkenstar,
as determined by the weapon’s previous owner. Over time,
the devotion and heroism of each successive wielder left a
psychic imprint on the weapon, until it developed an intellect
and drive of its own.
A duchy defender is a powerful weapon with a rigid
personality. It follows the laws of Alkenstar to the letter,
and fights in defense of its nation. If these two priorities
ever clash, a duchy defender prioritizes the protection
of Alkenstar and its citizens over following the laws
themselves, since laws can change, but the people will
always need protecting.
 If you break the laws of Alkenstar, a duchy
defender goes out of its way to call attention to you
at inopportune times, such as when you’re engaged
in an illegal activity, and attempts to see you pay
for your crimes, up to and including outing you
to law enforcement and providing testimony
against you in court. If a duchy defender is used
unjustly against a citizen of Alkenstar, the weapon
automatically misfires.
If the weapon is removed from the Grand
Duchy of Alkenstar without a reason that directly
benefits the duchy, the duchy defender transports itself
away, reappearing in the hands of a previous worthy owner,
or elsewhere in Alkenstar if no such previous owner lives.
In the hands of a worthy owner, a duchy defender is
nearly impossible to steal, since it transports
itself back to you at the first opportunity
after someone takes it, and it grants you a
+2 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC
to resist being disarmed of it.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency
once per round; Effect The duchy
defender focuses its will on a single
target it can see and who it knows is guilty of committing
a crime within Alkenstar’s borders. The next time the
duchy defender damages this target, it deals an additional
2d8 precision damage.
Activate

command
(conjuration,

worthy. If the owner’s hands are full, the duchy defender
instead appears on the ground in their space. If there
is no previous owner the duchy defender deems worthy
that lives, it instead travels to a random public location
within Alkenstar. Traveling to an unknown location
is draining; after doing so, the duchy defender can’t
transport itself anywhere for 1d4 days.

A sunken pistol is imbued with the unfulfilled desires and
insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious pirate
drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought
weapon, a sunken pistol is coated in a fine layer of dried salt
and encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this +1
striking dragon mouth pistol is now coated in a layer of salty
ectoplasm and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can
shoot the sunken pistol underwater, even when using black
powder ammunition.
A sunken pistol urges you to amass a horde of treasure
even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to
acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol,
so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all
else, a sunken pistol desires the return of its own treasure,
which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship’s hold or be
hidden on a dangerous island.
In pursuit of treasure, a sunken pistol offers nautical and
navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during
less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner,
the sunken pistol aids you in combat by Demoralizing your
opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove
charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the sunken
pistol turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat
until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the sunken pistol,
it would be wise to not accept water breathing from it, as it
might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder
to acquire it from your corpse. The sunken pistol can use the
following activations.
Activate [one-action] command; Frequency once per minute; Effect
The sunken pistol curses and insults a creature it can
see, attempting an Intimidation check to Demoralize that
creature.

from Tian Xia who sought the title of linnorm king. Though
the smith failed to slay the linnorm, he did claim the mighty
dragon’s tooth and fashion it into a magic firearm that still
drips warm venom. Hyldarf survived the encounter with
her attacker and slew the gunsmith years later, though by
then the smith had already bequeathed the weapon to his
chosen heir and it was far out of her grasp. The linnorm still
searches for her missing tooth, portending potential doom
for the weapon’s owner.
The weapon deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on a
successful Strike, plus 3d10 persistent fire damage on a
critical hit. Fire damage dealt by this weapon (including
persistent fire damage and damage from Hyldarf’s Venom)
ignores the target’s fire resistance.

The first firearm of this type came as the result of a
gunslinger who entreated an efreeti, wishing for the might of
the desert sun. The weapon constantly glows and burns with
a brilliant intensity. The firearm has since belonged to an
extensive string of users and been replicated several times,
though each wielder of the weapon, whether the original or
one of its copies, has eventually ended up as a charred husk,
slain by fire in battle or unusual accidents that no one could
quite explain except, perhaps, the efreet.
Activate [one-action] envision; Frequency once per minute; Effect You

moves through the white portal comes out through the
mountebank’s passage’s black portal, if one exists on the

This +2 striking arquebus has an ashwood stock plated with

into the metal. The mere mention of Galt’s infamous final
blades is enough to make any mortal creature shudder. Used
to execute political opponents in the nation’s constant civil
war, these guillotines hold the souls of those they execute,
preventing them from reaching a natural afterlife. When
one of the final blades was destroyed in 4710, some of the
metal from its remains made its way to Alkenstar and was
reforged into a deadly firearm that retained the guillotine’s
soul-stealing properties.
Whenever the reaper’s grasp kills a sapient living or
undead creature, a portion of that creature’s soul is drawn
inexorably into the weapon, and another skull is added to
the mosaic as if scrawled by an invisible hand, to a maximum
of 10 souls. Creatures whose souls are protected by outside
forces, such as a lich’s soul cage, are immune to this
effect, though the process, while painful, does not prevent
the soul from going to the afterlife or being resurrected.

Usage held in two hands; Bulk 2
In a dense forest within Arcadia, djezet fell from the sky
millennia ago, even before Earthfall. While this metal
was poisonous to most of the plant life growing nearby,
one stubborn rowan tree refused to die, its roots slowly
absorbing djezet in small particles from the ground until the
entire plant was suffused with it. Fey bowyers discovered
the remarkable plant and coaxed it into growing into a very
particular shape, its branching trunks woven together into a
tightly twisted and naturally rifled barrel.
One of the legendary star guns, Arcadia’s greatest
treasures, the Rowan Rifle is a +2 greater fearsome speed
greater striking (Advanced Player’s Guide 260) advanced
firearm with a range of increment of 300 feet. It deals 1d8
fire damage and has the backstabber, concussive, and fatal
d12 traits.
As a star gun, the Rowan Rifle runs on magic, and
doesn’t use ammunition or black powder. As a weapon
forged to protect the fey peoples of Arcadia, the Rowan
Rifle’s enchantments prevent it from ever causing harm to
a creature with the fey trait; any attempt to shoot a fey
with it results in an automatic misfire. This legendary star
gun is as much a badge of office as a weapon, as it denotes
dominion over all Briarbough. If the Rowan Rifle’s wielder is
fey, or if they were specifically given the Rowan Rifle by a
fey creature who recognized them as a worthy champion,
they can use the following activations.
Activate [one-action] envision; Effect You will the Rowan Rifle to
change the energy it fires from the white-hot energy of
summer that glows like a star to the shivering chill of
winter, the crackling electricity of the storm, or even the
sonic vibrations of a roar. The Rowan Rifle’s damage type
changes from its current damage type to cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic. On the next sunrise, the Rowan Rifle returns
to dealing fire damage.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect The Rowan Rifle
fires a 60-foot line of liquid djezet that wraps around all
creatures in the affected area before
hardening, which impedes them
with metallic vines unless the
affected creature succeeds
at a DC 35 Reflex save. A
creature who fails the save
takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds,
and a creature who critically fails is immobilized. A
creature who succeeds at a DC 35 Escape check ends this
effect. Otherwise, the djezet vines last for 10 minutes
before crumbling away.

down to those who have done brave acts in service to the
Zenj people. The flintlock sparks thrown by this weapon
take the shape of pouncing tigers and the firearm’s report
sounds like a tiger’s growl. Clever wielders use the firearm’s
report to panic their prey into mistakes and then pounce
for the kill.
This firearm’s bullets deal slashing damage instead of
piercing and add an additional 1d6 persistent bleed damage
on a critical hit. This persistent bleed damage causes
tiger‑claw-shaped wounds to appear on the target.
Activate [two-actions] envision; Frequency once per day; Effect You
capitalize on the fears your firearm engenders, terrifying
your foes. Make a ranged Strike with this firearm against
a target. If you successfully deal damage to your target,
the target is also affected by a 4th-level phantasmal killer
with a spell DC of 28. While phantasmal killer typically
takes the shape of the target’s worst fear, this effect
always appears to the target in the form of a majestic and
ferocious tiger.

RARE
CHAOTIC
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Price 3,000 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This +2 greater striking flintlock pistol bears strange, jagged
markings of erratic design and has an oddly squishy grip. It
can be activated to produce a variety of unusual effects.
Activation [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect Choose a creature
within 60 feet and roll a percentile die on the table below
to determine the pistol’s effect. If an entry lists a spell,
the pistol Casts that Spell at the indicated level (or at its
lowest level, if no level is listed). You make any decisions
for a spell cast by the pistol unless otherwise indicated,
except that it must only target the creature you chose, or
the creature you chose must be the center of the spell’s
area, if it has an area but no targets. The only exception
to the limitation on targeting is if the effect specifically
states it targets you. If the spell’s range is less than 60
feet, increase the range to 60 feet.
Any spell DC required is DC 29, and any spell attack roll
required is +21. If the pistol casts a spell on you, you don’t
get a saving throw or any other defense against it. Once
activated, the pistol can’t be activated again for 1d4 hours.
d%
Wondrous Effect
1–2
The pistol casts phantom steed (4th level) to
produce a pale horse adjacent to you; only you
can ride it.
3
The target becomes a shiny metal color (bronze,
copper, or iron) and any sound or speech becomes
tinny and robotic in nature; this effect lasts 1
month.
4–5
The pistol casts dimensional anchor.
6
Modify memory (6th level) causes the target to
forget you ever existed; you can’t Sustain the
Spell.
7–13
A short rod protrudes from the pistol and unfurls
a small flag that reads “Bang!”. The pistol can’t be
fired until the flag is removed, which requires a
single Interact action.
14–16
You are pushed 30 feet directly away from the
target; if you hit an object or creature, you stop,
but take falling damage equal to the distance you
moved (if you hit a creature, it takes the same
amount of falling damage).
17–19
The target is pushed 30 feet directly away from
you; if it hits an object or creature, it stops,
but takes falling damage equal to the distance
it moved (if it hits another creature, the other
creature takes the same amount of falling
damage).
20
You don’t need to eat or drink for 1 week.
21–25
The pistol casts cloudkill.
26–30	 The pistol casts heroism on you.
31
The pistol casts tree shape on you, except you
appear as a Medium wooden grave marker
bearing your name and the current date; you can’t
Dismiss the spell for 1 round.
32
The pistol casts mask of terror, except the target
appears as a more fearsome and violent version of
itself to all observers.
33–35
The target knows you have a bullet with its name
on it; the first time you Strike the target with the
pistol before the end of your next turn, roll the
attack roll twice and take the highest result (this
is a fortune effect).
36–37
The pistol casts cloak of colors on you with a
duration of 1d10 rounds.
38–47
The pistol casts hydraulic push (4th level) as water
streams from the pistol.
48–50	 The pistol casts dimension door on you,
teleporting you to the space adjacent to the target
opposite your current position; if that space isn’t
clear, you instead teleport to the nearest open
space.
51
The pistol casts disintegrate.
52
Dozens of tattered, nonmagical playing cards
burst from the pistol’s barrel.
53–54	 Shadows crowd around the target, making all
creatures concealed to the target while not in
bright light; this effect lasts for 1 hour.
55–57
Normal vegetation within 30 feet of the target
immediately dies and turns to ash.
58
The pistol casts dinosaur form on you to
transform you into a triceratops; the pistol
protrudes from the base of your front horn, and
you can fire (but not reload) the pistol while in
this form.
59
All non-artifact ammunition in your possession
crumbles to dust.
60–69	 You are quickened for 1 minute. You can use the
extra action only to reload or fire the pistol.

86
The pistol vanishes, reappearing among your
possessions once it can be activated again.
87–91
The pistol casts solid fog, but with swirling dust
and sand instead of fog.
92–96	 The pistol casts stoneskin on you, making your
skin rough and leathery; the target ignores the
resistance you gain from this spell, and the
target’s attacks don’t reduce the spell’s duration.
97–99	 The pistol casts uncontrollable dance with
a duration of 3 rounds, even on a failure or
critical failure.
100
Reroll two results and apply both in the order
rolled; further results of 100 on these rerolls have
no effect.

No gunslinger’s or arbalist’s repertoire is complete
without a selection of magical ammunition to amplify the
effectiveness and impact of their shots. While many of the
following options are limited to firearm rounds, others
work for a variety of ammunition.
AROMATIC AMMUNITION
ITEM 2
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 5 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
The components of this ammunition emit a strong smell when
combined during its activation. A creature hit by an activated
aromatic ammunition gains a distinct odor for up to 1 hour or
until the scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water
and 10 minutes of scrubbing). Any creatures within 30 feet
smell the target, allowing even those with a weak sense of smell
to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus
to Track the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A
creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range
at which they can detect the target using their scent compared
to the normal range of their scent.

UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious
metal and enchanted to unlock that metal’s true potential. Each
version has a different special effect.
Type awakened adamantine shot; Level 18; Price 3,500 gp
The shot is a high-grade adamantine bullet. The awakened
adamantine breaks through any resistance. The shot ignores
the first 20 resistance a creature has to physical damage,
all damage, or piercing or bludgeoning damage. Against a
golem or creature who already has a resistance bypassed by
adamantine, or a weakness to adamantine, the shot shatters
the target’s defenses, causing them to become flat-footed for 1
minute instead. Because adamantine is uncommon, this version
of awakened metal shot is uncommon even for gunslingers or
other characters with access to uncommon guns and bullets
from this book.
Type awakened cold iron shot; Level 17; Price 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron

minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted
by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted
creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the
enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature’s
mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is
+27. If you fail (but don’t critically fail) the counteract check
against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit
a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other
creatures, the target is stupefied 1 for 1 minute instead.
Type awakened silver shot; Level 17; Price 2,300 gp
The shot is a high-grade silver bullet. The awakened silver
gleams with altered celestial moonlight designed to weaken
and expose devils and werecreatures. On a hit, it attempts
to counteract any polymorph effect on the target. The
counteract level is 9, and the counteract
modifier is +27. If you fail (but don’t
critically fail) the counteract
check against a devil or a
werecreature, you get a success
instead. If you counteracted the
Change Shape ability, the creature
can’t use that ability again
for 1 round, or 1 minute on
a critical success. If you
hit a devil or werecreature
not under a polymorph effect, the
target is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute instead.
BLACK POWDER
ITEM 0+
UNCOMMON
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance
commonly used in the production of firearm munitions.
Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet
and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight
container.
Type dose or round; Level 0;
Price 1 cp
The smallest unit of black
powder that still has a simple use,
a dose can be a simple package paper parcel
around black powder or it can be packaged with
a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited
with a fuse or exposed to direct flame, a dose of black powder
explodes. This isn’t powerful enough to deal damage but makes
a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a
dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the
dose to explode the round after it’s lit.
Type horn; Level 2; Price 5 gp
A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn
can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and
then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black
powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly
full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal
1d6 fire damage in a 5-foot burst (DC 16 basic Reflex save). It
takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn
to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate
simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but
the damage in overlapping areas doesn’t increase.
Type keg; Level 6; Price 50 gp
A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be
detonated in the same way as a horn. As long as the keg is
mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals 3d6 fire
damage in a 20-foot burst (DC 20 basic Reflex save). Detonating
multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this
effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an
overlapping area also doesn’t increase the damage.
DREAMING ROUND
ITEM 14
UNCOMMON CONSUMABLE ENCHANTMENT INCAPACITATION MAGICAL MENTAL SLEEP
Price 900 gp
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] command
The night sky seems contained in this glass projectile.
When an activated dreaming round damages a
creature, it induces drowsiness. The creature must
attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected
and becomes temporarily immune for 1
minute.
Success The creature becomes slowed 1
and fatigued for 1 round.
Failure The creature becomes fatigued and
slowed 1, and must attempt another Fortitude
save at the end of each of its turns. If it fails, its
slowed condition increases by 1. A successful save reduces
the slowed condition by 1. If the slowed
condition is removed or reduced to 0,
the effect and the fatigued condition
end. If the target’s actions are reduced
to 0 by this effect, it immediately falls
into a deep sleep and is unconscious,
during which it no longer attempts a
save at the end of its turn. It wakes up
automatically after 1 hour or if it takes
damage, but not due to non-painful stimuli
(such as noise or being nudged). When it
wakes up, its slowed condition decreases by
1, though it must once again save at the end of each of its
turns and might risk falling asleep again.
Critical Failure As failure, except the target is initially slowed 2.
ERODING BULLET

UNCOMMON
ACID
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Price 22 gp
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
Eroding bullets cast a faint green glow, and smell like the sickly-
sweet organic gases that rise from corpses. Handling an eroding
bullet without gloves deals 1 point of acid damage and leaves
the putrid scent coated on your fingers. Upon Striking an enemy,

the glass casing inside the bullet bursts, releasing a splattering
of bubbling green acid that coats the target. The target takes
2d6 persistent acid damage in addition to the damage normally
dealt by the attack.
EXSANGUINATING AMMUNITION
ITEM 4+
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This ammunition includes a small reservoir of a tacky red
substance that coats the ammunition when you activate
it. The substance makes a creature bleed more freely. For 1
minute after you deal damage to a creature with an activated
exsanguinating ammunition that creature gains the listed
weakness to persistent bleed damage. In addition, the DC of
any flat checks to end persistent bleed damage increases from
15 to 17 (from 10 to 12 when receiving particularly effective
assistance) for the duration.
Type exsanguinating ammunition; Level 4; Price 15 gp
The target gains weakness 1 to persistent bleed damage.
Type greater exsanguinating ammunition; Level 8; Price 80 gp
The target gains weakness 3 to persistent bleed damage.
Type major exsanguinating ammunition; Level 12; Price 360 gp
The target gains weakness 5 persistent bleed damage.
FAIRY BULLET
ITEM 7
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
CONSUMABLE
FEY
MAGICAL
Price 65 gp
Ammunition round
Activate [two-actions] command, envision
These bullets are seaweed-green, refract light like an emerald,
and are covered in a thin film of gray-green powder. When
fired, a fairy bullet creates an effect that functions as the
glitterdust spell in a line between you and your target. This
line can be no more than 60 feet long, so if the target is
more than 60 feet away from you, the line simply ends after
reaching its maximum distance. Since the fairy bullet is fired
before the glitterdust can reveal the target, the effects don’t
affect the flat check for the attack roll with the fairy bullet.
GLUE BULLET
ITEM 4
UNCOMMON

SPLASH
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] Interact
This craggy stone ammunition is warm to the touch. When you
fire an activated meteor shot, it explodes into a small swarm
of meteors as it reaches its target, scorching nearby creatures
and littering the ground with rubble. In addition to the weapon’s
normal damage, the meteor shot deals fire damage and the
ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
In addition, the Strike gains the following critical failure effect.
Critical Failure The weapon misfires.
Type meteor shot; Level 7; Price 70 gp
The ammunition deals 3d6 fire damage in a 5-foot emanation
around the target (DC 23 basic Reflex save).
Type greater meteor shot; Level 12; Price 400 gp
The ammunition deals 6d6 fire damage in a 10-foot emanation
around the target (DC 29 basic Reflex save).
Type major meteor shot; Level 17; Price 3,000 gp
The ammunition deals 9d6 fire damage in a 20-foot emanation

ITEM 7+
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Ammunition round
Activate [one-action] envision, Interact
A series of small stone discs pressed into a single round
make up this ammunition. When you fire an activated
stepping stone shot, whether you hit or miss your target,
the shot creates a series of supports in a line that creatures
can walk on as if solid ground. The line can ascend or
descend at a 45-degree angle. The discs support any
amount of weight, but don’t otherwise pose any sort of
obstacle; creatures and attacks can move through them if
they wish. They crumble to dust if anything attempts to
move or otherwise manipulate them. A creature can use
a two-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to
Stride up to its speed on the stones while causing them
to crumble behind it. This ammunition does not work in
firearms with the scatter trait. The maximum length of
the line depends on the type of ammunition. However, the
line also can’t extend beyond the maximum distance for
a Strike from your firearm (usually six times the firearm’s
range increment).
Type stepping stone shot; Level 7; Price 65 gp
The stones reach up to 100 feet, and they last
up to the end of your next turn if no one
collapses them.
Type greater stepping stone shot;
Level 10; Price 185 gp
The stones reach up to 250 feet, and
they last up to 1 minute if no one
collapses them.
TRUSTWORTHY ROUND
ITEM 3
CONSUMABLE
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 9 gp
Ammunition any
Activate [free-action] command
This ammunition was developed in Dongun Hold to
minimize casualties to friendly fire, and is always
marked by a burnished copper head or tip so it can be
easily identified. Before you can fire a trustworthy round,
you must call out a target. You don’t need to specify a
name; the target could be “The angry tiger attacking our
group on the left.” The round will only hit the specified
target and will turn to gossamer dust midair if it misses
the intended target or comes into contact with anything
else; this also prevents abilities that redirect attacks. The
round doesn’t have any capabilities beyond your own to
determine whether someone is who you think they are, so
you can’t use it to determine a disguised creature’s identity.
If you specify a target of “Seltyiel” and shoot someone
disguised as Seltyiel who you thought was Seltyiel, the
attack will still hit, whereas if you were about to hit a
disguised Seltyiel who you didn’t recognize to be Seltyiel,
the round would dissolve.
FEATHER TOKEN AMMUNITION
One of the more popular and commonly used tools of
adventurers across Golarion are feather tokens (Core
Rulebook 570). Several forms of feather token can be
purchased as ammunition by raising their item level by 2
and doubling the Price, replacing their normal activation
requirement with a Strike from a ranged weapon and
appearing in a space within that weapon’s range. While
not all feather tokens are suitable for use in this way,
the chest, holly bush, ladder, swan boat, and tree tokens
have all been converted into ammunition at one time or
another. While these utilitarian devices are not suitable
for direct offense in combat (a feather token fired into an
occupied space fails to deploy and is wasted), they are
incredibly useful for providing cover where none existed
previously, making a quick escape, or coordinating an
innovative heist.

Meteor Shot

PAGE 173
================================================================================

The advent of black powder is beginning to offer
a new sort of weapon to warriors in Golarion, one
that isn’t dependent on the physical strength of the
wielder. Siege weapons like ballistae and trebuchets
create tremendous force at a distance with the efforts
of multiple operators, allowing for destructive power
to rival even mighty spellcasters. Black powder siege
weapons take the potential of such machines of war
and amplify it to the next level, adding explosive power
to the cooperative efforts of the crew. In addition to the
force of the black powder ignition itself, black powder
siege weapons are able to funnel and direct the energy
through a reinforced barrel or muzzle in ways torsion
and counterweights cannot, increasing the accuracy,
range, and impact of the weapon.
Siege weapons of all kinds operate largely the same
way whether they incorporate black powder in their
design or not. The Aiming, Loading, Launching, and
Move Siege Weapon actions are all identical to the
rules found on page 72. The most notable change is
the chance of misfire; just like a firearm, improper use,
inadequate cleaning, and a number of other factors
BLACK POWDER SIEGE WEAPONS
can lead to deficiencies in a piece of artillery. The
construction of the weapons and ammunition are also
more expensive and harder to find due to the more
advanced makeup.
SIEGE WEAPON MISFIRE
Just as personal firearms require a meticulous regimen
of proper care and cleaning to operate at peak
performance, black powder siege weapons must be
properly maintained on a regular basis to avoid the risk
of terrible consequences that might otherwise befall
those who use them. If you attempt to fire a black
powder siege weapon that was used or assembled prior
to the current day and hasn’t been properly cleaned and
maintained since the last time it was used or assembled,
you must attempt a DC 5 flat check before making your
attack roll, risking misfire on a failure. A black powder
siege weapon can also potentially misfire as a result of
using a specific ability or due to using an unreliable
black powder siege weapon with the cobbled trait, such
as a siege weapon created at the risky pirate volcano
foundry known as the Motaku Ironworks.

HISTORY OF BLACK POWDER
ARTILLERY ON GOLARION
As with any other realm of scientific advancement, siege
weapon designs have evolved through time and across
the world. The earliest black powder siege weapons were
created by Tian alchemists experimenting with fireworks
and large-scale explosions. Many of these weapons were
simple devices made of bamboo or bound iron tubes
that fired stones or iron balls with many similarities to
firework launching instruments. While limited in range
and accuracy, the force was markedly more powerful
than typical weaponry of the time. Larger, clumsier
weapons like the hwacha increased their lethality and
range at the cost of mobility. It hasn’t been until recently,
however, with the advent of black powder weapons from
Dongun Hold and Alkenstar, that a new generation of
black powder artillery has begun to spread slowly across
the world.
If you fail this misfire flat check, the siege weapon
misfires and jams, and the attack also becomes a critical
failure. To clear the jam, the crew must collectively use
a number of Interact actions equal to the number of
actions required to complete a single Load activity for
the siege weapon. The weapon can then be reloaded and
fired again. Once the crew has spent at least an hour
cleaning and maintaining the weapon, they don’t need
to roll for a misfire until the next day unless an effect
says otherwise.
If you critically fail a misfire check when attempting to
fire a siege weapon, the siege weapon explodes, dealing
the damage listed in its Launch entry to all creatures in
a 30-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save. The DC of
the save is the standard DC of the siege weapon’s level
(Core Rulebook 503). When it explodes in this way, the
siege weapon is destroyed.
SIEGE WEAPON STATISTICS
A siege weapon uses the following stat block format. An
individual siege weapon might omit some of these sections,
especially a portable siege weapon. Since all these siege
weapon use black powder, they have (black powder) in their
usage entry.
ALCHEMICAL SPRINGALD
ITEM 13
UNCOMMON
HUGE
Price 6,000 gp; Ammunition bomb arrows (100 gp, 2 Bulk)
Usage mounted (black powder); Space 15 feet long, 12 feet
wide, 15 feet high
Crew 3 to 5; Proficiency martial
AC 29; Fort +23, Reflex +16
Hardness 15; HP 200 (BT 100); Immunities object immunities
Speed 10 feet (pulled or pushed)
Like the standard springald, an alchemical springald can
launch three arrows simultaneously when its paddle is
released. It fires specially crafted and balanced bomb arrows
that carry black powder enhanced alchemical payloads that
explode on impact.
Aim [two-actions] 30 feet, minimum distance 50 feet
Load [two-actions] (manipulate) 3 times
Launch [one-action] (manipulate, range increment 100 feet) 10d6
damage and 3 splash damage, three different targets
within a 15-foot burst, DC 30 Reflex. The damage type
depends on the alchemical ammunition used: acid, cold,
electricity, or fire. Creatures take the splash damage only
once from the launch, even if they’re in the area of more
than one of the three splashes.
BLASTING RAM
ITEM 7
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 360 gp; Ammunition ram powder charge (2 gp, 1 Bulk)
Usage portable (black powder), held in 8 hands; Bulk 14
Crew 4; Proficiency martial
A blasting ram is a smaller battering ram that supplements
the crew’s size with explosive force. A steel reservoir holds
a charge of black powder that ignites on impact. The body
of the ram is reinforced to absorb the force of the explosion,
while the head itself has a blast shield to protect the crew.
Despite being a portable siege weapon, a blast ram has the
Load action, which the crew uses to load the powder charge
in the ram’s head.
Load [two-actions] (manipulate) 2 times
Ram [two-actions] Requirements The other members of the crew have
Readied to Stride on your order; Effect You and the crew
Stride, with a maximum distance equal to the slowest crew
member’s Speed. Then, make a melee Strike with the ram
against a structure or unattended stationary object. As
you do, the black powder in the steel reservoir explodes,
significantly increasing the damage of your attack. Due
to the black powder’s additional force, the damage of
this Strike is 7d8 + the highest Strength modifier among
members of the crew.
BOMBARD
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
LARGE
Price 300 gp; Ammunition stone spheres (4 gp, 4 Bulk)
Usage mounted (black powder); Space 10 feet long, 4 feet
wide, 5 feet high
Crew 2 to 4; Proficiency martial
AC 17; Fort +12, Reflex +5
Hardness 10; HP 40 (BT 20); Immunities object immunities
Speed 10 feet (pulled or pushed)
Bombards are some of the oldest and simplest of black
powder siege weapons, devised based on many of the same
principles as a hand cannon, but deploying them on a larger
scale and scope. A bombard’s body is usually made of brass
or iron, which causes the bombard to resemble the shape of
a large bell. While they are capable of moving very slowly,
their clumsy and weighty design means bombards usually
remain stationary. This in turn means they’re often used
more defensively than offensively.

Cannons are perhaps the most well known of all black powder
siege weapons, and that’s because they represent a good
midpoint between power and expense. Keeps and fortresses
in Alkenstar prefer to fortify their forces with cannons, as
they’re relatively easy to construct and their ammunition is
cheap enough to build up great supplies.

Fiend’s mouth cannons are large-scale cannons designed to
blast a target at great distance, from a stationary location.
They get their name from the fiendish features usually
adorning their barrels and frames. Compared to a standard
field cannon, a fiend’s mouth cannon can be aimed more
easily, but flexibility comes at the cost of mobility. The barrel
rests on a platform which can be rotated 360 degrees to
allow for precise aiming.

This alchemical black powder
hybrid siege weapon uses
a blast of black powder
to spray alchemical fire
from a long metal nozzle, often
sculpted or painted with designs resembling a
dragon’s neck and head. The nozzle turns on a
ratcheted, rotating disc with a reservoir in the
center to hold a barrel full of combustible alchemical liquid,
using black powder to propel the fire. This main structure is
atop a wheeled cart to allow it to be easily moved. Unlike
most mounted siege weapons, a firedrake is intended to be
wheeled out into the thick of a skirmish rather than shooting
from a distance.

Named for Brondar Steelheart, one of the most important
historical dwarven pioneers in the use of black powder, this
remarkable piece of new Dongun artillery uses metallurgy
and alchemy to negate nearly all of the immense amount
of recoil a shot from a siege weapon usually produces.
The barrel of the Steelheart 21 is suspended in a mix of
alchemical fluids that first compress to dampen the recoil
when fired, then expand to push the barrel back into place
afterwards. The result reduces the amount of time needed
to reset the aim of the siege weapon. The crew member who
launches the Steelheart 21 can use the Quick Aim reaction
(below), allowing them to adjust the weapon’s aim on the
fly as they fire to adapt to a faulty initial target, changing
battlefield conditions, the use of illusions by the enemy, or
any of a variety of other factors that lead to the need to alter
the siege weapon’s course.

A mortar fires its shells at a high angle, allowing it to bypass
obstacles and strike from above. A crew typically sets up
such a weapon behind a wall or in another hard-to-access

Due to the steep angle of its arc, such mortars are especially
useful when opposing barricaded targets.

CHAIN SHOT
A special type of ammunition for siege weapons,
chain shot is built to demolish masts, sails, and airship
gasbags. Each chain shot costs 2 gp. It resembles a
cannonball in shape and can be loaded only into a siege
weapon that hurls stones or similar ammunition. When
launched, the ball divides into its two halves, connected
by a sturdy chain.
When a siege weapon launches chain shot, it targets
one object instead of using its normal targets or area.
The target takes no damage, but on a failed Reflex save,
the object’s mast, sail, or gasbag becomes broken. The
pilot can attempt a piloting check in place of this Reflex
save. A broken mast, sail, or gasbag prevents a wind-
propelled vessel from moving, except by other means of
propulsion if available. For instance, a galley could still be
rowed if it had enough rowers. An airship with a broken
gasbag instead begins to slowly descend as it leaks gas,
automatically descending 20 feet at the start of each of
the pilot’s turns.
Named for Ancil Alkenstar, this bronze cannon is one of the
largest pieces of mobile artillery ever deployed, though its
immense weight limits just how mobile it actually is. The
barrel of an Alkenstar cannon is nearly 3 feet in diameter,
making it impractical to manufacture and handle cannonballs
of sufficient size. Instead, Alkenstar cannons spray buckshot
in a similar way to blunderbusses, firing large barrels that
break apart mid-flight and release a rain of scattershot over a
massive area. The slow movement and short range make this
siege weapon fit fewer situations than most, but when used
effectively, such as to stop a charge of Mana Waste mutants
against the walls of Alkenstar, the results are devastating.

and on vehicles with “pushed” propulsion, in the Siege
Towers section on page 76.

Tiered A battery tower has five levels. The crew operate at
the bottom tier, turning a giant capstan, and up to four
passengers can fit on that floor, enough for a full crew for a
bombard. The remaining levels carry 50 passengers each.
The tiers are specifically meant to be protective, and give
those within the battery tower greater cover (or standard
cover if the battery tower is broken). A massive ladder
runs diagonally through the center of the battery tower,
from the front of the top tier to the rear of the bottom tier.
The ladder is wide enough for two crew or passengers to
climb simultaneously.
Weaponry A battery tower is usually loaded with black
powder siege weapons for heavy assaults, with bombards
on the bottom two floors and cannons on the other floors.
Their Price is included in that of the battery tower. When
building a battery tower, you can choose to replace any
of these with other siege weapons of a lower Price. If you
want a more expensive siege weapon, you must Craft it
separately. Passengers of the battery tower can crew
these siege weapons.
Naval Siege Tools
Black powder has begun to revolutionize naval combat,
and the following siege tool, and the special chain shot
ammunition listed above, assist combat by sea, allowing
an attacking ship to disable enemy vessels and make
amphibious landings safely.
SAMBUCA
Using this device requires a complicated setup but
allows troops to siege a location on land from the sea.
SAMBUCA
ITEM 3
RARE
Price 120 gp
A sambuca is a long, covered troop bridge designed to help
troops move from sea to land. Preparing it for use requires
lashing together two galleys (Gamemastery Guide 178) or
other ships of similar size. The sambuca is then mounted
across the ships on one end with its length suspended
upward, and attached to pulleys fastened to the tops of the
ships’ masts. Once the ships are moved into position, the
sambuca can be lowered to rest on a battlement or other
surface, allowing troops to rush from the ships onto their
intended destination.
The sambuca has AC 17, Fort +11, Ref +5, Hardness 8, HP
32 (BT 16), and object immunities. It’s covered on all sides to
protect those who cross, granting them greater cover. The
end of the sambuca can be lowered by teams operating the
pulleys in concert. This requires three crew members on each
ship, and they can lower the far end of the sambuca by 15
feet each round they work.

A hero lives and dies by the tools of their trade. While
weapons, armor, staves, and other fancy items get a lot
of the spotlight, the ability to get the drop on the enemy
can make the difference between a glorious victory and
a humiliating defeat, so experienced combatants know
the value of a protective poncho that gives them an
advantage in a fight. Wise adventurers stock up on tools
and accessories to improve their chances of survival.
Foolish adventurers are lucky if they get a second chance
to learn from their mistakes.

Camouflage Suit: This lightweight mesh fits easily over
light armor. The suit is designed to incorporate local
flora and ground clutter into the mesh to help you blend
in seamlessly with the environment. Due to the abrasive
nature of the materials used, this item is unsuitable for
use by unarmored characters. You can prepare the suit
for use within your current environment by using an
exploration activity that takes at least 10 minutes, but
sometimes longer if the materials are hard to find or the
environment is unusual enough to warrant additional
difficulty in preparing camouflage that can blend with
it consistently.
A suit prepared in this manner grants you a +1 item
bonus to Stealth checks while you attempt to Hide or
Sneak in the specific environment it has been prepared for.

ATTACHED CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
This section introduces two new types of item that can
be attached to a firearm: scopes and firing mechanisms.
A given firearm can only have one of each type of item
attached. For instance, a firearm couldn’t have more than
one scope attached at the same time. To indicate this,
in much the same way that a magic item’s usage entry
might say “worn shoes” to indicate it can’t be worn with
other shoes, the usage entry for these attached options
lists “attached (scope)” or “attached (firing mechanism).”
The suit remains usable in this manner until you rest for
the night, though it doesn’t grant the benefit whenever you
aren’t in the appropriate environment. The GM might rule
that some environments are unusual enough that you can’t
create a camouflage suit appropriate for the environment.
A superb camouflage suit is fashioned from especially
well-blended materials and gives you a +2 item bonus to
the check instead of a +1 item bonus.
Concealed Holster: This leather holster is crafted
to better hide small firearms from view. Only firearms
designed for use in one hand are small enough to
disguise with this holster. You gain a +1 item bonus to
Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a firearm or
hand crossbow in this holster.
Earplugs: These small pieces of cloth and stuffing
have been crafted to dramatically muffle sound and
easily slide into and out of the ear canals of humanoid
creatures. You can insert or remove earplugs from your
ears or a willing creature’s ears with a single Interact
action using one hand. They take a –2 circumstance
penalty to all auditory Perception checks but also gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against
auditory effects.
Firearm Cleaning Kit: This kit contains cleaning cloth,
oil, small steel brushes, and other minor tools necessary
for proper cleaning and maintenance of a firearm.
Without a firearm cleaning kit, you can’t perform the
necessary tasks during your daily preparations to ensure
that your firearm isn’t at risk of misfiring under normal
use conditions.
Practice Targets: While gunslingers have many
methods for practicing their aim, these sturdy paper
targets are excellent for tracking a gunslinger’s progress
over time, keeping score of how close they came to
hitting the most vital spots. These targets are also used
in situations where more detailed accuracy must be
recorded, such as firearm competitions. Practice targets
can appear in many shapes and sizes and usually come
in packs of 10 held in protective cases made of heavy
cloth or light leather.
Silencer: One of the more prolifically used devices
developed in the infamous Alkenstar Gunworks, these
small firearm components are capable of muffling most
of the weapons’ explosive sound when fired. Without a
silencer, a firearm’s shot makes a loud and distinctive
bang, which can easily be heard through doors and thin
walls, but firearms equipped with silencers only make a
quiet noise when fired. Due to engineering constraints, a
silencer can’t be attached to any firearm with the scatter
trait. Attaching a silencer to a firearm takes 1 minute,
and the silencer is consumed the first time a shot is fired
through it.
Tripod: Tripods are designed for use with kickback
weapons, as a way for gunslingers with lower strength
to accurately use these more powerful weapons by
sacrificing mobility instead. They can be set up and
attached to a firearm with a single Interact action using
one hand, setting the tripod in your square. While this
sturdy piece of engineering is in use, you don’t take
the –2 penalty for firing a kickback weapon, even if
your Strength isn’t high enough to avoid the penalty.
However, you must retrieve the tripod with a single
Interact action before you can move the firearm to a
different position. Normally, when you’re hidden or
undetected, you become observed if you do anything
except Hide, Sneak, or Step. However, deploying or
retrieving a tripod with an Interact action doesn’t
automatically make you observed, so long as you don’t
set up or remove the tripod when it’s in a spot where
creatures can see the tripod itself.
Waterproof Firearm Carrying Case: This buttoned,
leather case protects a firearm and up to 6 rounds of
ammunition from being damaged by water or other
environmental effects.
Customization Options
The potent stopping power, solid range, and relative
ease of use of firearms make them attractive options
for almost any warrior who can both obtain one and
maintain a healthy supply of ammunition, but these
benefits are only the most basic offered by the firearms
being produced in Golarion today. Everything from
bandoliers for the discerning pirate to specialized scopes
for snipers can be obtained from the talented gunsmiths
who ply their trades in Dongun Hold, Alkenstar, or
Arcadia for the right price.
HOLSTERS
Firearms and crossbows are generally efficient weapons
designed with an eye towards ease of use. However, the
act of managing ammunition, reloading, and keeping
a grip on a weapon can become cumbersome without
a good bandolier or holster to hold your weapons and
ammunition in a convenient position until they become
necessary in combat.

SCOPES
Scopes for firearms and crossbows
have existed, in one form or another,
for many years, though they’ve
recently become one of the most sought-
after luxury items for gun enthusiasts in
Alkenstar and in various regions that have
gotten their hands on Alkenstar firearms
(whether through legal means or otherwise).
Leatherworkers, metalsmiths, crystal cutters,
and spellcasters specializing in the creation and
development of magical items all have a part to
play in the burgeoning industry. The finest crafters
often incorporate signature techniques or styles into the
scopes they produce, such as crystal cutters espousing

SCOPE OF LIMNING
ITEM 10
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 900 gp
Usage attached to firearm (scope); Bulk L
The dwarven gunsmiths of Dongun Hold originally created
these scopes to help them clear out vermin in underground
areas. This scope captures the sound that echoes off a
creature hit by the firearm and transforms it into light,
illuminating the target for all to see.
Activate [one-action] Interact (auditory, light, transmutation); Effect
If your next Strike from the weapon to which the scope
is attached hits a creature, the sound of the impact
transforms into light, causing the creature to glow
until the end of your next turn. A visible creature can’t
be concealed while they glow. If a creature is invisible,
they’re concealed while glowing, rather than being
undetected. Because the effect requires a solid impact,
incorporeal creatures are unaffected unless the bullet can
deal force damage or has the effects of the ghost
touch property rune.
SCOPE OF TRUTH
ITEM 13
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 3,000 gp
Usage attached to firearm or crossbow (scope); Bulk L
The scope of truth is a bit bigger than most to
accommodate larger lenses, which have been magically
prepared with tiny shards from crystal balls to reveal the
truth. The scope grants you a +2 item bonus to Perception
checks made to Seek in areas you can see through the
scope.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Frequency Once per day; Effect
For the next 10 minutes, you can see things through
the scope as they actually are. The GM rolls a secret
counteract check with a +20 counteract modifier and a
counteract level of 7 against any illusion or
transmutation in the area, but only for the
purpose of determining whether you see
through it, not to end the spell or effect. For instance, if
the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can
see the creature’s true form, but you don’t end the spell.
STABILIZERS
The ferocious kickback of firearms is part of the
functionality that makes them so appealing as weapons,
but it can also present a barrier in wielding them
effectively. To increase the functionality of firearms
and make them more accessible to a wider audience,
gunsmiths and engineers have created a large array
of supporting stabilization over the years. From the
humble tripod (page 179) to more elaborate arrays like
the gunner’s saddle, these tools can be an invaluable
part of any gunner’s loadout.
GUNNER’S SADDLE
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
Price 20 gp
Usage worn saddle; Bulk 2
Developed by marauders from the Mana Wastes, this
clockwork saddle comes with a retractable weapon mount
that can be used as a tripod to stabilize a weapon with the
kickback trait. Just like a normal tripod, you Interact to
deploy the tripod to stabilize the firearm, and then again
to retract the tripod to move it. The saddle uses complex
hydraulics to protect the steed from the firearm’s recoil.
IMMOVABLE TRIPOD
ITEM 10
UNCOMMON
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 700 gp
Bulk 1
This copper tripod with an immovable rod at its core is a
perfect example of engineering ingenuity applied to magic
items, adapting the eccentric power of an immovable rod
for the pragmatic use of stabilizing weapons without the
need for solid ground on which to stabilize them. In
addition to extraplanar and aquatic environments,
these devices have seen use by flying and climbing
snipers who would otherwise have no way to
mitigate their weapons’ fierce kickback.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You deploy the tripod
and press a button to lock it into place via the
immovable rod, allowing you to deploy the tripod in
midair, underwater, or anywhere else where you don’t
have a solid horizontal surface available. If you Activate
the tripod by pushing the button again, you release and
retrieve the tripod. While anchored, the tripod can be
moved only if 8,000 pounds of pressure are applied to
it or if a creature uses Athletics to Force Open the tripod
with a DC of 40 (though most intelligent creatures can
just push the button to release the tripod).
PORTABLE WEAPON MOUNT
ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
Bulk 1
Powerful firearms like the arquebus were originally used
to defend fortifications or ships, mounted on casements
or pintles to steady their aim and offset their recoil. More
mobile means of stabilizing weapons with kickback were
developed as firearms began to spread across the Inner Sea.
The standard tripod takes an Interact action to deploy using
one hand.
Type monopod; Level 1; Price 2 sp
Monopods are lighter and can be deployed with a single
hand using the same action as drawing the firearm. They
still require an Interact action to retrieve. Monopods are

less stable than a tripod, and firing a kickback weapon from
a monopod without the necessary Strength reduces the
penalty to a –1 circumstance penalty instead of removing
it entirely.
Type tripod, shielded; Level 3; Bulk 5; Price 50 gp
A shielded tripod resembles a squat shield on a tripod. You
can deploy and retrieve a shielded tripod with an Interact
action, as normal, but while a shielded tripod is in your
square, you can use the Take Cover action to gain standard
cover behind the tripod’s shield. You can’t use this cover to
Hide or Sneak, as normal for times when your cover still
leaves your position obvious.
OTHER MODIFICATIONS
While holsters, scopes, and stabilizers are some of the
more common accessories associated with firearms and
crossbows, they’re far from the only innovations that
support such weapons. The variety of accessories is
matched only by the inventors’ creativity. Blazons and
emblems for paired weapons are popular purchases for
fashion-oriented aristocrats who like their weapons to
match aesthetically and magically. Talented gunsmiths
produce replaceable barrels, high-end firing mechanisms,
and other commodities for firearm enthusiasts to further
customize their weapons to their preferences.
AIR CARTRIDGE FIRING SYSTEM
ITEM 4
UNCOMMON
Price 75 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
Air cartridge firing mechanisms use a container of
compressed air affixed to a sealed
system that releases the air
in a small burst to propel
ammunition, and they’re the
default used in Arcadian air
repeaters. Any firearm can
be modified to replace its
normal firing mechanism
with an air cartridge firing
system, allowing the weapon
to be fired underwater or in
other conditions that would normally
prevent the ignition of black powder. The air cartridges lack
much of the propulsive power of black powder, however,
imposing a –10-foot penalty to the attached firearm’s range
increment. Weapons with the kickback trait don’t gain that
trait’s benefits when using an air cartridge firing system.
Attaching an air cartridge firing system takes one hour,
though this time can overlap with the standard time required
to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.
BLAZONS OF SHARED POWER
ITEM 3+
EVOCATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn and attached to two weapons (see below);
Bulk –
These brass emblems come in a variety of designs, usually
customized to the purchaser to reflect the heraldry of a
family or guild. Blazons of shared power come in sets of
three. When you invest the blazons, you wear one of the
three on your chest, and you attach the others to a pair of
one-handed weapons, choosing one as the primary weapon
and one as the secondary weapon. These weapons can be
either melee weapons or ranged weapons. As long as you’re
wielding both the primary weapon and the secondary
weapon, the secondary weapon gains the benefit of the
fundamental runes on the primary weapon. A weapon can
only have a single blazon of shared power attached to it at
a time.
Type blazons of shared power; Level 3; Price 52 gp
Type greater blazons of shared power; Level 11; Price 1,350 gp
A set of greater blazons of shared power also replicates
property runes from the primary weapon, so long as the
secondary weapon meets all the prerequisites for a given
rune and isn’t a specific weapon. The secondary weapon
gains the benefits of those runes. All of its own runes are
suppressed. When you invest the blazons, you can elect for
them to transfer only fundamental runes, in which case they
function as standard blazons of shared power.
BREECH EJECTORS
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
CONSUMABLE
Price 10 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
These spring-loaded inserts can be fitted into the breech of
a double-barreled firearm over the course of 10 minutes or
during the firearm’s daily maintenance. After the weapon is
fired, the ejectors hasten the reloading
process by ejecting the spent
detritus from the fired rounds.
This allows you to reload
both barrels of the double-
barreled weapon as a single
Interact action the next time
you reload the weapon as
long as you do so before the
end of your next turn. However,
the ejectors are consumed in the
process, and you must spend the time to
insert a new set to gain the benefit again.
LARGE BORE MODIFICATIONS
ITEM 5
UNCOMMON
Price 120 gp
Usage attached to firearm; Bulk 1
These modifications include a heavier stock and larger
replacement barrel designed to increase the stopping power
of firearms. Large bore modifications can only be applied to
firearms with the kickback or scatter traits, and attaching
large bore modifications takes 1 hour, though this time can
overlap with the standard time required to maintain and
clean your firearm to prevent misfires.

Blazons of shared power

PAGE 185
================================================================================

When you attach large bore modifications to a kickback
weapon, the circumstance bonus to damage granted by the
kickback trait increases from 1 to 2 additional damage and
the Strength requirement to fire the weapon without penalty
increases to 18.
When you attach large bore modifications to a weapon
with the scatter trait, the radius of the scatter effect
increases by 5 feet, but the weapon imposes a –2 penalty on
attack rolls if the wielder’s Strength score is less than 14. If
the weapon has both the kickback and scatter traits, apply
both sets of modifications with the Strength requirement
raised to 18 to avoid penalties when firing.
UNDERWATER FIRING MECHANISM
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
MAGICAL
Price 600 gp
Usage attached to firearm (firing mechanism); Bulk —
This device replaces the attached firearm’s normal firing
mechanism (normally, most of the guns in this chapter use a
flintlock or matchlock firing mechanism). When the firearm’s
wielder fires the weapon, a small rune etched on a piece of
stone affixed inside the mechanism releases a magical spark
that’s propelled through the firing mechanism and into the
firearm, launching its bullet. An underwater firing mechanism
allows the attached firearm to be fired underwater or in
other conditions that would normally prevent the ignition of
black powder. Attaching an underwater firing mechanism to
a firearm takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the
standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to
prevent misfires.
Talismans
A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield,
or a weapon (which is called the affixed item). You must
be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman
attached to that item. Once activated, a talisman burns
out permanently. The talismans included in this section
are particularly useful for characters who wield firearms
or crossbows.

This tiny copper gear is attached to the side of a firearm
with a matching bolt or pin. When you activate it, the
affixed weapon magically transfigures itself into the form
of any simple or martial firearm to which you have access,
harmlessly ejecting any contained ammunition in the
process. Any runes or attached items present on the affixed
weapon remain active unless incompatible with its new
form, in which case they’re suppressed for the duration of
the transformation. The effect lasts until the beginning of
your next turn.

This wide strip of treated lizard hide is wrapped around the
grip or stock of the affixed weapon, augmenting the unease
that your gunshot creates. When you activate it, you fire
your gun into the air with the effects of Warning Shot (page
112). If you already have the Warning Shot feat, the target
doesn’t become temporarily immune to your Demoralize,
potentially allowing you to Demoralize them again.

This simple brass shell casing contains trace amounts
of alchemical ingredients and is usually attached to the
underside of the affixed weapon’s barrel. When activated,
it causes the ammunition fired from the affixed weapon to
transform into your choice of acid, cold, electricity, or fire,
dealing damage of the appropriate energy type instead of its
usual damage as well as 1d6 persistent damage of the same
type on a critical hit.

This long strip of linen is tightly wound around the barrel
of the affixed firearm or the grip of a bow. When activated,
the talisman’s magic dampens the sound of the triggering
shot, rendering it completely silent, and additionally skews
the angle of the shot, so it appears to come from a different
location and direction than your actual position. You don’t
become automatically observed to any creatures due to
making the triggering Strike.
