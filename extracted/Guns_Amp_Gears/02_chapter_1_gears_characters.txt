Any tinkerer can follow a diagram
to make a device, but the inventor
creates the impossible and challenges
the boundaries of reality. An inventor
remains on the verge of the next
great breakthrough, and every trial and
tribulation presents another opportunity to
test and tune their contraptions.
DROVEN
Droven is a Pathfinder agent who
undertook many missions as both
traveling hero and recruiter. After an
accident took the lives of his crewmates,
he washed up on the shore of Arcadia.
There he studied the residents’ technology
and rebuilt his arm, lost in the wreck, as well
as crafting a mechanical companion he calls Whirp.
absence from Golarion, blending clockwork knowledge
from multiple eras.
In Garund’s Mana Wastes, magic remains unreliable
at best, and so the grand duchy of Alkenstar founded
there has begun a period of technological innovation,
bolstered by the brilliant discoveries of their allies, the
dwarves of Dongun Hold (page 191).
The continent of Arcadia (page 206) is rife with
inventors and inventions, especially in certain regions
where the culture and ruling bodies push ever further
toward innovation.
Characters from Absalom, New Thassilon, Alkenstar,
Dongun Hold, or especially technological regions of
Arcadia like the Deadshot Lands have access to the
inventor class, as well as uncommon options involving
clockworks from the first two chapters. At the GM’s
discretion, some uncommon options might be more or
less available in certain regions.
MAGITECHNOLOGY
In the continent of Garund, near the border between the
pyramid-studded deserts of Osirion and the lush jungles
of the Mwangi Expanse, the Uomoto people scavenge rare
wonders from the ruins of the Shory Empire, famed for
its flying cities that combined air magic with technology.
The nation of Eihlona in southern Garund has taken its
studies of the Shory and other magitechnology further,
placing its members among the finest experts of the craft.
Such hybrid magitechnology isn’t the domain of the Shory
alone. The ancient fallen empire known as the Jistka
Imperium (page 212) in northern Garund, near modern-
day Rahadoum, developed myriad magitechnological
constructs. The most notable were the famed automatons,
which were designed to house the souls and life forces of
Jistka’s finest residents, before Osirion’s distant ancestors
shattered the Jistkan empire.
Arcadia’s innovations, as well, bring with them
several unique blends of magitechnology, combining
gears, magical sources, and even monster parts to create
fantastic new devices.
Uomoto
characters,
characters
from
Eihlona,
automatons with memories of Jistka, and Arcadians
all have access to the inventor class (page 15), as well
as uncommon magitechnological options from the first
two chapters of this book. At the GM’s discretion, some
uncommon options might be more or less available in
certain regions.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
In Avistan, the nation of Ustalav (page 225) is
experiencing a technological renaissance championed
by reckless scientists and innovative undead hunters.
Stasian technology (page 82) is still rare, and even in
Ustalav, it’s hard to get your hands on the Stasian coils
necessary to power such equipment unless you have been
a direct participant in the new renaissance. Characters
from Ustalav have access to the inventor class. While
no characters automatically have access to Stasian
technology, players and GMs interested in exploring these
themes can work together to tie a character to one of the
factions, workshops, or places of learning dedicated to
understanding and developing Stasian tech, granting it as
part of that character’s story and journey.
LANDS BEYOND
The regions listed in this introduction are just a few of
the regions on Golarion where characters might be able
to access various gears options from this chapter and
the next, though they are the most prominent and well-
known. If you’re playing a campaign focused around
the spread and evolution of technology, the locations
where various technological wonders can be found
might shift as your campaign progresses. Furthermore,
you and your group might add your own technologically
advanced nations to the world, and future Pathfinder
books might reveal them as well. In all of these cases,
expand characters’ access to various uncommon options
as appropriate to the new locations.

INVENTOR
Any tinkerer can follow a diagram to make a device, but you invent
the impossible! Every strange contraption you dream up is a unique
experiment pushing the edge of possibility, a mysterious machine that
seems to work for only you. You’re always on the verge of the next great
breakthrough, and every trial and tribulation is another opportunity to test and tune. If
you can dream it, you can build it.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You rely on your inventions as much as possible, testing their functionalities
under a variety of conditions. You don’t set out to achieve anything as banal
as simply winning a fight; you seek to collect valuable data that can be used
to improve your creations!
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You provide useful context when discussing a variety of academic topics,
particularly when speaking about those subjects related to crafting and
invention. You might often look for opportunities to acquire patronage to
fund some of your more expensive or unorthodox experiments. After all, the
materials needed to assemble your inventions don’t pay for themselves!
WHILE EXPLORING...
You study the design and construction of the environments you explore
ardently, making note of clever traps, ingenious mechanisms, or especially
keen architecture you come across for later.
IN DOWNTIME...
You brainstorm new designs, bringing them to fruition through careful crafting
and meticulous attention to detail. You might also modify previous inventions to
adjust for data you’ve collected in the field. You might work as a local smith or
tinker where your skills are needed, or you might keep a workshop on the edge
of town where the clank and clatter of your experiments attracts less attention.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Enjoy creating new things the world has never seen before.
•	 Be willing to take a chance on a theory, testing to see if your hypothesis
proves accurate. If not, you probably record the results to try again later.
•	 Wear clothes spattered with oil and grime, or venture off on excited and
technical tangents when asked simple questions.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Marvel at your inventions and the variety of unbelievable wonder they
can bring.
•	 Believe that you’re a genius whose work is beyond understanding.
•	 Worry that your inventions might backfire or explode.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as an inventor. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you gain from your chosen class at
1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
OVERDRIVE
You have a bevy of smaller devices of your own invention,
from muscle stimulants to concussive pistons. When it’s
necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you
in combat.
OVERDRIVE [one-action]
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Frequency once per round
Temporarily cranking the gizmos on your body into overdrive,
you try to add greater power to your attacks. Attempt a
Crafting check that has a standard DC for your level.
Critical Success Your gizmos go into a state of incredible
efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to
your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to
your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive
ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or
reset, and you can’t use Overdrive for 1 minute.
Success Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your
attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is
equal to half your Intelligence modifier.
Failure You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.
Critical Failure Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire
damage equal to your level, and you can’t use Overdrive
again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset.
Special When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still
use the Overdrive action. You can’t extend your Overdrive’s
duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a
critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has
no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your
Overdrive on a critical failure.
INNOVATION
While you’re always creating inventions, there’s one that
represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope—
with refinement—might change the world. Choose one of
the below innovations. Your innovation’s level is equal to
your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend
1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a
high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An
innovation only works due to your constant maintenance
and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.
The innovations you can choose from in this book are
as follows.
Armor
Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor
with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one
of the sets of statistics on Table 2–2: Innovation Armor
Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set
of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).

Your innovation armor can have fundamental and
property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary
armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation,
everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would
normally be trained (or better) in medium armor.
Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your
innovation, either from the following or from other initial
armor modifications to which you have access.
•	 Harmonic Oscillator: You designed your armor to
inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create
interference against force and sound waves. You gain
resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and
sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive,
the resistance increases by 2.
•	 Metallic Reactance: The metals in your armor are
carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect
from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance
equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity
damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the
resistance increases by 2.
•	 Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only): Your
armor supports your muscles with a carefully
crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor
into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your
feats of athletics as well. When under the effects
of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Athletics checks; if you’re a master in Crafting, this
increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
•	 Otherworldly Protection: Just because you use
science doesn’t mean you can’t build your armor
with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed
to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain
resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative
damage, or to positive damage if you have negative
healing (such as if you’re a dhampir). You gain the
same amount of resistance to any types of alignment
damage—good, evil, chaotic, lawful—that can
damage you (note that creatures don’t take a given
type of alignment damage unless they are of the
opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil
damage only if you are good in alignment).
•	 Phlogistonic Regulator: A layer of insulation within
your armor protects you from rapid temperature
fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your
level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects
of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.
•	 Speed Boosters: You have boosters in your armor that
increase your Speed. You gain a +5‑foot status bonus to
your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus
when under the effects of Overdrive.
•	 Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only): You’ve
designed your armor to help you blend in and
dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor
into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect,
improving your Stealth. When under the effects of
Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
KEY TERMS
Gadget: Gadgets (starting on page 66) are consumable
technological inventions with innovative uses.
Modification: An ability with this trait alters your
innovation’s construction. If you have the reconfigure class
feature (page 20), you can retrain these feats more easily.
Unstable: Unstable actions use experimental applications
of your innovation that even you can’t fully predict, and
that are hazardous to your innovation (and potentially you).
When you take an unstable action, attempt a DC 17 flat
check immediately after applying its effects. On a failure, the
innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless)
fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and
it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable
actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire
damage equal to your level. As the innovation’s creator, you
can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making
adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you
can use unstable actions with that innovation again.
To take an unstable action, you must be using your
innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation
or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion
innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion
instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that
action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded
that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat
check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.
Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which
you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit.
If you’re unable to use unstable actions, you can still use
the action normally, but you can’t use the unstable function.
EQUIPMENT TRAITS
Your inventor abilities might grant your equipment the
following traits, which are reprinted here for convenience.
Climbing: The hand wielding the weapon is available
to Climb.
Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait
includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an
Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within
the weapon’s reach. That square becomes difficult terrain
until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise
stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.
Ranged Trip: The weapon can be used to Trip with
Athletics up to the weapon’s first range increment. The
skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add
the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the
check. As with using a melee weapon to Trip, a ranged
trip weapon doesn’t deal any damage when used to Trip.
This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.
Tethered: If you have a free hand while wielding this
weapon, you can Interact to pull the weapon back to
your grasp after you throw or shoot it as a ranged attack,
or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by
another creature).

================================================================================

Stealth checks. If you’re a master in Crafting, this
increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
Construct
Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a
clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It’s a
prototype construct companion (page 32), and you
can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at
higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use
the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same
Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same
amount of fire damage on a critical failure.
You know how to spend additional time directing,
controlling, or programming your construct innovation
for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2
actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding
your construct companion; your construct companion
can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions,
rather than 2).
Choose one initial construct modification to apply to
your innovation, either from the following or from other
initial construct modifications to which you have access.
These modifications alter the construct’s abilities or form.
•	 Accelerated Mobility: Actuated legs, efficient gears in
the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your
construct faster. Your innovation’s Speed increases to
40 feet.
•	 Amphibious Construction:
Increased
buoyancy,
rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail
or powerful propeller make your construct able to
travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed
of 25 feet.
•	 Increased Size: You built your construct innovation
bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you
have this modification and your construct innovation
becomes an advanced construct companion or
otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can
immediately change increased size to a different initial
construct modification.
•	 Manual Dexterity:
Your
construct
innovation
has articulated hands or similar appendages
with significant manual dexterity. It can perform
manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As
normal for a companion, it still can’t wield weapons
or held items that don’t have the companion trait, and
it can’t activate items.
•	 Projectile Launcher: Your construct has a mounted
dart
launcher,
embedded
cannon,
or
similar
armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed
attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage
(you choose when you pick this modification). The
attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment
of 30 feet.
•	 Sensory Array: Additional sensory devices give your
innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well
as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.
•	 Wonder Gears: You map specialized skills into
your construct’s crude intelligence. Your innovation
becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.
Weapon
Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon
augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins
with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or
martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple
or martial weapon to which you have access. You can
instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or
martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple
or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must
pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation
weapon can have fundamental and property runes added
to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of
the unique features of your innovation, everyone except
you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be
trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you
use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the
additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage.
Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to
your innovation, either from the following or from other
initial weapon modifications to which you have access.
These modifications grant additional weapon traits,
sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give
your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the
weapon could already deal, either from its base damage
type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you
select that modification, you can instead choose to give
the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type:
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
•	 Blunt Shot (Ranged Only): Your weapon innovation
can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust
the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning
attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking
a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your
innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits.
You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait
on each attack with your innovation.
•	 Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only): Increase
your innovation’s weapon damage die by one step
(d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In
addition, it gains one of the following traits of your
choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.
•	 Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon
Only; Can’t Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand
Trait): Your weapon’s modified weight distribution
can increase power in exchange for taking more hands
to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait,
with a damage die one size higher than the weapon’s
normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a
longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your
innovation also gains the versatile B trait.
•	 Entangling Form (Melee Only): You’ve altered your
weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to

have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains
the grapple and trip traits.
•	 Hampering Spikes (Melee Only): You’ve added long,
snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use
to impede your foes’ movement. Your innovation
gains the hampering and versatile P traits.
•	 Hefty Composition (Melee Only): Blunt surfaces
and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty
and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and
versatile B traits.
•	 Modular Head: You’ve constructed a multi-purpose,
adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or
you’ve made special ammunition you can swiftly
alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing (page 234).
When you Interact to use the modular trait, you
can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal
trait if it doesn’t currently have it, or to remove that
trait if it’s currently nonlethal.
• Pacification Tools (Melee Only): Softer materials
make your weapon suited to knock out
instead of kill, and special protrusions
let you catch weapons and disarm your
foes. Your innovation gains the disarm
and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to
apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with
your innovation.
•	 Razor Prongs (Melee Only): You can knock
down and slash your foes with sharp,
curved blades added to your weapon. Your
innovation gains the trip and versatile
S traits.
•	 Segmented
Frame:
Hinges,
clamps,
and telescoping parts make your
innovation
collapsible
and
adjustable. It gains the modular
trait for bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing (page 234). You
can Interact to collapse the
item down to light Bulk or to
return it to your normal form. When it’s collapsed to
light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants
you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and
DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.
EXPLODE
Your innovation is a creation barely held together by
your own engineering, always on the edge of completely
falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you
can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications
using special unstable actions. See the sidebar on page 17
for the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects
your innovation.
While inventors can learn various unstable actions
over their career, all at least know how to make their
innovation Explode.
EXPLODE [two-actions]
FIRE
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety
limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures
without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion
deals 2d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save to all creatures
in a 5-foot emanation around you (if you’re wearing or holding
the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation
is a minion).
At 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your
explosion’s damage by 1d6.
1919

PAGE 21
================================================================================

If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can
choose either a 5-foot or 10-foot emanation for the area when
you use Explode; if you have the revolutionary innovation class
feature, you can choose a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 15-foot emanation.
PEERLESS INVENTOR
You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is
unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if
you don’t meet its prerequisites.
SHIELD BLOCK
You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets
you reduce damage with your shield.
INVENTOR FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain
an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an
assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For
simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of
your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many
feats and features, subject to GM discretion.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
EXPERT OVERDRIVE
3RD
You’ve increased your skill in crafting, and you can put
your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You
become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of
Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
RECONFIGURE
3RD
You’ve become an expert in all crafts and are always
adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change
the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day
of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting
check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you
can change one modification you’ve chosen for your
innovation to a different modification of the same kind
(initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).
If you have any modification feats, on a successful
check you can choose to instead retrain a modification
feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to
meet the standard restrictions for retraining.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if
it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
INVENTOR WEAPON EXPERTISE
5TH
You develop tricks for using your weapons more
effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial
weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to
the critical specialization effect with your innovation.
BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION
7TH
You’ve made a breakthrough in your field of study
and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your
innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your
innovation’s type to apply to your innovation. You can
choose an initial modification of your innovation’s type
instead if you prefer.
Breakthrough Armor Modifications
•	 Antimagic Plating: Whether you used some clever
adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known
as noqual or created magical protections of your
own design, you’ve strengthened your armor against
magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells
and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the
armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4
circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.
• Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only):
You’ve modified your armor’s exterior to let you
blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as
you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can
Hide even without cover or concealment, as the
pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.
•	 Dense Plating: You have encased your armor in
robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain
resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.
•	 Enhanced Resistance: You’ve improved upon your
initial modification’s ability to resist damage. The
resistance from your initial armor modification
adds your full level, instead of half your level (for
instance, phlogistonic regulator’s resistance would
increase to your level). If you have more than one

initial modification that gives resistance, choose
which one this applies to.
•	 Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only): You’ve
expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark,
and your groundbreaking design ensures you don’t
take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses.
Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your
proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other
heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency
in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least
16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of
reducing it to –5 feet. The armor’s adjusted statistics
are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty –2;
Speed Penalty –10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group
composite; Armor Traits bulwark.
•	 Hyper Boosters: You’ve improved your speed boosters’
power through a breakthrough that significantly
increases the energy flow without risking exploding.
You gain a +10‑foot status bonus to your Speed,
which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when
you’re in Overdrive. If you’re legendary in Crafting,
it instead increases to a +30‑foot status bonus when
you’re in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters
modification to select this modification.
•	 Layered Mesh: You’ve woven an incredibly powerful
network of interlocking mesh around your armor,
which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them.
While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to
piercing damage equal to half your level.
•	 Tensile Absorption: You’ve enhanced the tensile
capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with
bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you
gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half
your level.
Breakthrough Construct Modifications
•	 Advanced Weaponry: You’ve powered up your
construct’s weaponry. Choose one of your construct’s
unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial
weapon modification, chosen from the list on page
18 or from other initial weapon modifications to
which you have access. The unarmed attack must
meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as
being a melee attack for entangling form), and since
it’s an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain
requirements, such as being a simple weapon for
complex simplicity.
•	 Antimagic Construction: Whether you used some
clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal
known as noqual or created magical protections
entirely of your own devising, you’ve made your
innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct
innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all
saving throws and AC against spells.
•	 Climbing Limbs: With appendages that can claw
or create suction, your construct becomes a capable
climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal
to half its land Speed.
•	 Durable Construction: Your innovation is solidly
built; it can take significant punishment before being
destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.
•	 Marvelous Gears: Your innovation gains expert
proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For
any of these skills in which it was already an expert
(because of being an advanced construct companion,
for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If
you have the revolutionary innovation class feature,
these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary
if your construct innovation was already an expert.
You must have the wonder gears modification to
select this modification.
• Turret
Configuration:
Your
innovation
can
transform from a mobile construct to a stationary
turret. Your construct companion can transform as a
single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning
into a turret in its space (or transforming back from
a turret into its normal configuration). While it’s
a turret, your innovation is immobilized, but the
damage die from its projectile launcher increases to
1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet.
You must have the projectile launcher modification
to select this modification.
Breakthrough Weapon Modifications
• Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only): A carefully
tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon
especially good at hitting weak points. Your
innovation gains the backstabber trait (page 230)
and increases its range increment by 10 feet.
•	 Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only): You
carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to
maintain its momentum in attacks against successive
targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the
versatile S trait.
•	 Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only): Your
innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise
attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P
traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the
concealable trait.
•	 Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only;
Can’t Have the Two-Hand Trait): Combining your
weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can
quickly switch between attacking with your weapon
and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation
gains the free-hand trait.
•	 Manifold Alloy: You’ve devised several alloys that
contain useful properties of various metals, and
you replace a number of parts of your weapon or
its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your
weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means
you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural
creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.

================================================================================

•	 Rope Shot (Ranged Only): Your weapon can shoot
projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets
around your foes’ legs to trip your targets, and
you can climb using the grappling hooks built into
the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the
climbing and ranged trip traits (see the sidebar on
page 17).
•	 Tangle Line (Thrown Only): Your weapon has an
extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies
over and quickly recall the weapon back to your
hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and
the tethered trait (see the sidebar on page 17).

your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes
with one weapon you choose during daily preparations;
if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies
to your construct companion’s Strikes; and if your
innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes
with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch
to a different boost in the same way as switching your
modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with

REVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION
15TH
You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a
technique that will revolutionize your chosen field—or
at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a
revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation.
You can also choose an initial or breakthrough
modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.
Revolutionary Armor Modifications
•	 Automated
Impediments:
Your
armor
uses
electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or
other techniques to make it difficult for those close
to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing
your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult
terrain for your enemies.
•	 Energy Barrier: Your armor’s defenses ablate any
kind of energy coming your way. While wearing
your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage
(acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive,
and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level.
You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic
reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to
select this modification.
•	 Incredible Resistance: You’ve improved upon
your breakthrough modification’s ability to resist
damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough
modifications your innovation has: dense plating,
layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the
resistance you gain from that modification to be
equal to your level, instead of half your level.
•	 Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only): You’ve
built a multisensory mask over your armor that
protects you by distorting your figure from all
senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled
sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you
gain concealment against all creatures, even if they
are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat’s
echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your
location obvious, you can’t use this concealment
to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the
concealment ends until you restore the mask as a
single action, which has the manipulate trait.
• Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only): You’ve
outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications
that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each
time you’re critically hit while wearing the armor,
attempt a DC 13 flat check. On a success, it becomes
a normal hit. This isn’t cumulative with fortification
runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with
a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half
your level against precision damage.
•	 Physical Protections: Your armor has so many
adjustments and precautions that it can guard
against all physical damage. While wearing your
armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage
(bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well
as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level.
You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or
tensile absorption breakthrough modification to
select this modification.
•	 Rune Capacity: Whether you’ve done some dabbling
in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering
solution, you’ve built your innovation in such a way
that it can hold an additional property rune. Your
innovation can have one more property rune than
a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four
property runes with a +3 potency armor).
Revolutionary Construct Modifications
•	 Flight Chassis: You fit your construct with a means
of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it
with wings and a lightweight construction. Your
innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
•	 Miracle Gears: As you perfect your innovation’s
cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its
Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a
language of your choice from among the languages
you know. Your construct gains the ability to use
actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce
and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes
legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based
skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous
gears modification to select this modification.
•	 Resistant Coating: Your innovation is hard to
damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all
damage (except adamantine).
•	 Runic Keystone: You’ve incorporated a device similar
to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to
hold a property rune, even though it isn’t a weapon
or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects
your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of
the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever
properties it would normally grant to a weapon to
your innovation’s unarmed attacks, following all
the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal
rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed
attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it
has no effect unless your innovation has a built‑in
ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial
modification, for example). If the rune would affect
the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or
armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect
when etched into your construct.
• Wall Configuration: Your innovation can transform
from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield
emplacement. It can unfold as a 2‑action activity
that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual
form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up
to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend
through your innovation’s original space. While your
construct is a wall, it can’t take any actions except to
use the same activity to transform back, and it can’t
23
23

PAGE 25
================================================================================

defend itself easily, making it flat-footed and giving
it an additional –2 status penalty to its AC. The wall
blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation
has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point
holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and
attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.
Revolutionary Weapon Modifications
• Attack Refiner: Your weapon makes minute
recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure
the next lands true. Your innovation gains the
backswing and shove traits.
•	 Deadly
Strike:
Through
precise
calculation,
you’ve found the perfect shape for your weapon
to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike.
Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your
innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly
die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.
•	 Enhanced Damage: You’ve made your innovation
more powerful than other weapons of its kind.
Increase your innovation’s weapon damage die by
one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
As normal, you can’t increase your die by more than
one size, so this modification isn’t cumulative with
complex simplicity.
•	 Extensible Weapon (Melee only): You’ve found a way
to construct your weapon so that it can extend while
leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation
gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the
reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional
10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.
•	 Impossible Alloy: Other inventors claim it’s not even
technically possible, but you’ve managed to create
several metal alloys that seem to work for only you.
These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to
any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is
treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine,
djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite).
This means you deal more damage to a variety of
creatures, though you don’t apply any of the other
special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.
•	 Momentum Retainer (Melee only): A special
weighted device lets your weapon retain more of
its momentum when you attack. Your innovation
gains the forceful and versatile B traits.
•	 Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only): You’ve
modified your innovation to be dangerous and
effective at any range. If your innovation had the
volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise,
increase your innovation’s range increment by 50
feet or an amount equal to the weapon’s base range
increment, whichever is more.
•	 Rune Capacity: Whether you’ve dabbled with
orichalcum or found another engineering solution,
you’ve built your innovation in such a way that it can
hold an additional property rune. Your innovation
can have one more property rune than a normal item
of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes
with a +3 potency weapon).
INVENTIVE MASTERY
17TH
Your inventions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency
rank for your inventor class DC increases to master.
JUGGERNAUT
17TH
Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a
Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
INFINITE INVENTION
19TH
Your ability to adjust your innovation has reached
impossible heights, and you can use these skills to make
major adjustments in your spare time. During your daily
preparations, you automatically fix your innovation if it’s
destroyed or broken, and you can change to a different
innovation (armor, construct, weapon, or other type
you have access to) and change your modifications and
offensive boost.
If you have any feats that had your previous innovation
as a prerequisite, you can’t use them until you retrain
the feats as normal. However, it takes you only 1 day of
downtime to retrain such a feat into a feat that has your
new innovation as a prerequisite, instead of 1 week.
MEDIUM ARMOR MASTERY
19TH
Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more
blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor,
as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.
Inventor Feats
At every level that you gain an inventor feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
BUILT-IN TOOLS
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
You’ve built tools into your innovation so you can access and
use them easily. When you take this feat, choose up to two
sets of tools you own, such as thieves’ tools or healer’s tools,
that weigh a total of 2 Bulk or less. These tools become part
of your innovation. The innovation’s Bulk doesn’t increase
from this addition. As long as you are wielding, wearing, or
adjacent to your innovation, you have the same quick access
to these tools as the tools you are wearing, and they don’t
count against the usual limit of tools you can wear.
EXPLOSIVE LEAP [one-action]
FEAT 1

launch yourself into the air. You jump up to 30 feet in any
direction without touching the ground. You must land on a
space of solid ground, or else you fall after using your next
action. As normal for effects where you fall after using your
next action, you still fall at the end of your turn, even if you
don’t use any further actions that turn.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
HAPHAZARD REPAIR [one-action]
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
UNSTABLE
You quickly fix your innovation, at the cost of its stability. You
Repair your innovation almost immediately. You don’t have
to place the innovation on a flat surface, but you do need to
be adjacent to it (including holding or wearing it), as well as
having a repair kit as normal.
NO! NO! I CREATED YOU! [reaction]
FEAT 1
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct companion
Frequency once per minute
Trigger Your construct companion would become confused or
controlled.
You appeal to your construct companion’s bond with its
creator to have it break free of a controlling effect. Attempt
to counteract the effect that confused or controlled your
construct companion, using your Crafting modifier for the
counteract check and half your level rounded up for the
counteract level.
PROTOTYPE COMPANION
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
You have created a construct companion, and while it might
not be an innovation, it serves as a trustworthy minion. You
gain a prototype construct companion (page 32).
TAMPER [one-action]
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You tamper with a foe’s weapon or armor, using a free hand.
Choose either a weapon held by an enemy in your reach or
a suit of armor worn by an enemy in your reach. Attempt a
Crafting check against the enemy’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success Your tampering is incredibly effective.
If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls
with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor
hampers the enemy’s movement, making the enemy
flat‑footed and inflicting a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds.
The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it,
regardless of which one you used.
Success Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical
success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn,
even if the enemy doesn’t Interact to end it.
Critical Failure Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating
a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take fire
damage equal to your level.
VARIABLE CORE
FEAT 1
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
You adjust your innovation’s core, changing the way it
explodes. When you choose this feat, select acid, cold, or
electricity. Your innovation’s core runs on that power source.
When using the Explode action, or any time your innovation
explodes on a critical failure and damages you, change the
damage type from fire damage to the type you chose.
If you have the offensive boost class feature and retrain
Variable Core to a different damage type, you can also switch
to a different offensive boost that deals the same damage type
if you wish.
2ND LEVEL
COLLAPSE ARMOR [one-action]
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites armor innovation
Requirements You are wearing your armor innovation, or
holding it in both hands in its compact form (see text).
You’ve modified your armor innovation to collapse into a more
compact form so you can don or remove it in an instant. If
you’re wearing your innovation when you Collapse your
Armor, you remove it instantly, and it compresses into its
compact form, which is held in both of your hands (if you don’t
have both hands available, it falls to the ground in an adjacent
space). If you’re holding your armor in compact form when
you take this action, it unfolds back into its armor form onto
your body.
In compact form, your armor innovation is easier to carry,
with a Bulk 1 lower than the Bulk listed for it, to a minimum
of light Bulk (carried armor normally has a Bulk 1 higher than
listed in the armor entry).
COLLAPSE CONSTRUCT [one-action]
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites construct innovation
You’ve modified your construct companion and built it out
of light materials, enabling you to collapse it into a carrying
case or other compact and innocuous form. Either your
construct or you (if you’re adjacent to it) can Collapse your
Construct to turn it into its compact form or back into its
normal form.
In compact form, your construct can’t act but is easily
carried, with a Bulk of 2 if it’s Small, 4 if it’s Medium, or 8 if it’s
Large. The compact form has wheels, so you can easily drag
it behind you at half your Speed (rather than the usual slower
Speed for dragging).
REVERSE ENGINEER
FEAT 2
INVENTOR
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
You are incredibly skilled at reverse engineering items to
learn their formulas, or disassembling them just to disable
them. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks
to reverse engineer a formula from an item. If you get a

reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and
the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item’s value.
Furthermore, you can use Crafting instead of Thievery to Disable a Device or Pick
a Lock.
SEARING RESTORATION [one-action]
FEAT 2
FIRE
HEALING
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were fools…
Fools who didn’t understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your
innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal
herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains 1d10 Hit Points. In addition, the
creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source
of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you,
though because it’s not a living creature, it can’t use the ability on itself.
4TH LEVEL
ADVANCED CONSTRUCT COMPANION
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct companion
You’ve upgraded your construct companion’s power and decision-making ability. It
becomes an advanced construct companion (page 33). During an encounter, even if
you don’t use the Command a Minion action, your construct companion can still use
1 action on your turn that round to Stride or Strike.
DIVING ARMOR
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites armor innovation
You’ve modified your armor with fins, rotors, and other devices to make it easy
for you to move through the water, plus mechanical gills that can help you
extract breathable air from water. While wearing your armor innovation, you can
breathe underwater and gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed.
DUAL-FORM WEAPON
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites weapon innovation
You’ve built your innovation with replaceable interlocking pieces that you can use to
transform it into another type of weapon entirely. When you select this feat, choose
a level 0 or 1st-level simple or martial weapon. It must be either a common weapon
or another to which you have access. This weapon becomes your innovation’s second
configuration.
Select a new set of weapon modifications for this new configuration. You can
spend two Interact actions to switch your weapon innovation between the two
configurations. These actions don’t need to be taken consecutively, but if you’ve
provided the first and not the second, the weapon is non-functional as it is
stranded between states. Your weapon’s Bulk is always the greater Bulk of the two
configurations, regardless of which configuration it’s in—if one weapon is smaller
than the other, you still need to keep any weapon parts on hand. Any runes on your
weapon innovation don’t affect the second weapon configuration.

Rather than just using your gadgets for various boosts and
tweaks, you also craft a few specific temporary consumable
gadgets each day. You gain the formulas for three common
or uncommon gadgets (page 66). Each day during your daily
preparations, you can create two temporary gadgets from
your formula book. Gadgets prepared in this way don’t cost
you any resources to Craft and don’t have any sale value. They
are temporary items and fall apart the next time you make
your daily preparations if you haven’t already used them.
If you’re a master in Crafting, you can create three gadgets
per day, and you gain three additional common or uncommon
gadget formulas. If you’re legendary in Crafting, you can create
four gadgets per day, and you gain another additional three
common or uncommon gadget formulas, for a total of nine.
MEGATON STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
You activate gears, explosives, and other hidden mechanisms
in your innovation to make a powerful attack. You make a
Strike, dealing an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at
least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re
at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice. The type of
Strike you can make depends on your innovation.
•	 Armor You Strike with a melee unarmed attack or a
melee weapon. To use a melee weapon for this, you must
have prepared it in advance with special contraptions
when you make your daily preparations.
•	 Construct Your minion innovation Strikes.
•	 Weapon You Strike with your weapon innovation.
Unstable Function You put even more force into the Strike,
though you risk stress fractures to your innovation. Add the
unstable trait to Megaton Strike. The Strike deals another
extra damage die, for a total of two extra dice at 4th level,
three at 10th level, and four at 18th level.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
6TH LEVEL
CLOCKWORK CELERITY [free-action]
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
UNSTABLE
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
Trigger Your turn begins.
You can use unstable clockwork devices in your innovation to
push your invention to act more quickly. You are quickened
for this turn. How you can use the extra action depends on
your innovation.
•	 Armor You can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or use
another movement action granted by your innovation
(such as Swim if you have the Diving Armor feat).
•	 Construct You can use the extra action to Command your
construct innovation (or to provide 1 of the actions if you
spend 2 actions to Command your construct).
•	 Weapon You can use the extra action to Strike with your
innovation or Reload your innovation.
CONSTRUCT SHELL
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
You’ve adjusted your construct innovation so that when you
ride it, special plates, hollows, or similar form partial barriers
around you to add additional protection. You have lesser cover
from all attacks when mounted on your construct innovation,
not just from attacks where the construct would be in the way.
Additionally, if your construct uses an emanation while you’re
riding on it, such as Explode, you can choose not to be affected
by the emanation.
MEGAVOLT [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ELECTRICITY
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You bleed off some electric power from your innovation in the
shape of a damaging bolt. Creatures in a 20-foot line from your
innovation take 3d4 electricity damage, with a basic Reflex
save against your class DC. The electricity damage increases
by 1d4 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.
Unstable Function You overload and supercharge the
voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The
area increases to a 60-foot line and the damage increases from
d4s to d12s.
If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you
can choose a 60-foot or 90-foot line for the area when you
use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary
innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or
120-foot line.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action
rather than you.
VISUAL FIDELITY
FEAT 6
INVENTOR
You’ve found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of
devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You
gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see invisible
creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these
shapes are indistinct enough to be concealed to you.
If an effect would give you the blinded condition, the effect
must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with
your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On
a failed counteract check, you aren’t blinded—your various
devices are able to compensate.
8TH LEVEL
GIGATON STRIKE
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Megaton Strike
When you use a full-power Megaton Strike, you can knock
your foe back. When you succeed at your Strike while using
an unstable Megaton Strike, your target must attempt a
Fortitude save against your class DC.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is pushed back 5 feet.
Failure The creature is pushed back 10 feet.

Critical Failure The creature is pushed back 20 feet.
Special If your innovation is a minion, this benefit applies
on its unstable Megaton Strikes.
INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCT COMPANION
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Advanced Construct Companion
Thanks to your continual tinkering, your construct companion
has advanced to an astounding new stage of engineering,
enhancing all its attributes. Your construct companion
becomes an incredible construct companion.
MANIFOLD MODIFICATIONS
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
MODIFICATION
Prerequisites initial modification
You’ve modified your innovation using clever workarounds, so you
can include another initial modification without compromising its
structure. Your innovation gains an additional initial modification
from the list for innovations of its type (page 16).
OVERDRIVE ALLY [one-action]
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites Overdrive
Requirements You are currently in overdrive.
You quickly fling some of your powered-up mechanisms to an
ally, sharing your benefits with them briefly. Choose an ally
within 30 feet. Until the end of their next turn, that ally’s
Strikes deal additional damage equal to half your Intelligence
modifier, or your full Intelligence modifier if you were in
critical overdrive. The ally doesn’t gain the increased damage
from expert, master, or legendary overdrive.
UBIQUITOUS GADGETS
FEAT 8
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Gadget Specialist
They thought you had used up all your devices, but they
thought wrong! You have a few more gadgets up your sleeve
than others expect. Increase the number of temporary gadgets
you can create each day by 2.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th
level or higher.
10TH LEVEL
DISTRACTING EXPLOSION [reaction]

Your enemies think they can concentrate on something else
while you’re nearby? Oh, you’ll give them a distraction, all
right! Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature
with a weapon or unarmed attack that is benefiting from your
offensive boost. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple
attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply
to this Strike.
Unstable Function You pull out all the stops to create an
explosive distraction. Add the unstable trait to Distracting
Explosion. If the attack hits, you disrupt the triggering
concentrate action.
Special If your innovation is a minion, it can take this
reaction instead of you, even though minions can’t normally
take reactions or act when it’s not their turn. It uses your
reaction for the turn to do so.
ELECTRIFY ARMOR [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites armor innovation
Requirements You are wearing your armor innovation.
You electrify your armor to punish foes who dare to attack
you. For 1 round, any creature that touches you, or that
hits you with a melee unarmed attack or a non-reach melee
weapon attack, takes 1d4 electricity damage. The effect ends
if you cease wearing your armor innovation.
If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, the
damage increases to 2d4.
Unstable Function You create an unstable chain reaction,
sending countless sparks dancing across your armor. Add
the unstable trait to Electrify Armor. The effects last for 1
minute instead of 1 round, and the damage dice increase
from d4s to d12s.
HELPFUL TINKERING [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites offensive boost
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You don’t just tinker with your own innovation, you
fiddle with your allies’ weapons as well (for their benefit,
of course). Choose an ally in your reach and one of their
weapons. Attempt a Crafting check against a high DC for
your level.
Success For 1 minute, the chosen ally’s Strikes with the
chosen weapon gain the same offensive boost your
innovation has.
Critical Failure Your ally takes damage of the type and
amount that your offensive boost normally deals on a
successful Strike.
LOCK ON [one-action]
FEAT 10
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
Aha! You lock on to your enemy’s weak point to assist
your construct companion in destroying it. When you Lock
On, designate an enemy you can see. If your next action
is to Command your construct, the construct gains a +2
circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the designated
enemy until the end of the turn. If you use 2 actions for the
Command, the bonus is instead a +3 circumstance bonus, or a
+4 circumstance bonus if you’re legendary in Crafting.
12TH LEVEL
BOOST MODULATION
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
Prerequisites offensive boost
You aren’t satisfied with keeping to just one kind of boost
from your constant tinkering, so you’ve learned to modulate
between several possibilities at once. Choose two additional
offensive boosts (page 22). You can use an Interact action to
change the offensive boost currently affecting your weapon,
choosing between the one you chose for the class feature and
the two you chose for this modification. If your weapon has
the modular trait, you can swap the offensive boost as part of
the Interact action you take to use that trait.
CONTINGENCY GADGETS
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Gadget Specialist
You are too brilliant to be caught off guard, and you always
have just the right gadget for the situation. When you
prepare your gadgets during your daily preparations, you
can choose to leave one of them as a contingency gadget
that you keep ready for just this situation, rather than
declaring which gadget you’re making. You can pull the
contingency gadget out using an Interact action, at which
point you must choose which gadget you had prepared as
a contingency.
If you’re legendary in Crafting, you can leave two
contingency gadgets during your daily preparations, instead
of just one.
DEEP FREEZE [two-actions]
FEAT 12
COLD
INVENTOR
MANIPULATE
You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation,
damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature
within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your
level, with effects depending on its Reflex save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage and takes a –5-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
Failure The target takes full damage and takes a –10-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage, is slowed 1
for 1 round, and takes a –15-foot status penalty to its Speeds
for 1 round.
Unstable Function Your innovation discharges an enormous
cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading
failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability
affects all creatures within a 60-foot cone instead of a single
target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level
instead of equal to your level.

GIGAVOLT
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Megavolt
When you unleash electricity from your innovation, you can bounce it off obstacles,
creating a field of electric death. When you use Megavolt, each time your line of
electricity hits a solid barrier, such as a wall, it bounces off at an angle of your choice
and continues until you have reached the full length of the line. Even if a creature is
in the area from multiple bounces, it takes the damage only once.
SHARED OVERDRIVE
FEAT 12
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Overdrive Ally
You’ve experimented enough on your teammates to transfer a substantial number
of powered-up gizmos to them, enabling one of your allies to benefit from the full
effects and duration of your Overdrive. The first time you use Overdrive Ally during a
given Overdrive, the effect lasts for the remainder of the duration of your Overdrive,
instead of just until the end of the target’s next turn. Any further uses of Overdrive
Ally during the same Overdrive have their normal duration, per Overdrive Ally.
14TH LEVEL
EXPLOSIVE MANEUVER [one-action]
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Prerequisites weapon innovation
Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike against a
foe using your weapon innovation.
Thanks to a hidden experimental feature you built into your
weapon, your weapon explosively deploys levers, tangling
hooks, or similar mechanisms to provide significant assistance
when you perform a combat maneuver. When you use
Explosive Maneuver, choose Grapple, Shove, or Trip. Your
weapon innovation must have a weapon trait that matches
the action you chose (for instance, to choose Grapple, your
weapon must have the grapple trait). You take the chosen
action against the same foe as your previous successful
Strike, using the same multiple attack penalty as your
previous successful Strike. You still increase your multiple
attack penalty after the Grapple, Shove, or Trip, as normal.
PARAGON COMPANION
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Incredible Companion
Your construct companion has reached the pinnacle of form and function. Your
construct companion becomes a paragon construct companion.
SOARING ARMOR

Prerequisites armor innovation
Whether through a release of jets of flame, propeller blades, sonic bursts, streamlined
aerodynamic structure, electromagnetic fields, or some combination of the above,
you’ve managed to free your innovation from the bonds of gravity! While wearing
your innovation, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.

UNSTABLE REDUNDANCIES [free-action]
FEAT 14
INVENTOR
Trigger You would attempt the flat check for an unstable
action, but you haven’t rolled the flat check yet.
You’ve built triple redundancies into your innovation and
added all sorts of buffers to protect it from the harm of your
unstable experiments. You automatically succeed at the
triggering flat check.
You can’t rely on your Unstable Redundancies again until
you spend 10 minutes setting them back up. If you spend 10
minutes retuning your innovation so you can use unstable
actions again, you can set up your Unstable Redundancies
during the same time.
16TH LEVEL
JUST THE THING!
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Frequency once per hour
Need to balance on a razor’s edge, force open an iron door, or
persuade a dragon to negotiate? Never fear! No matter the
situation, you always have just the thing. You attempt a skill
action that takes 1 minute or less to complete, using the same
number of actions or amount of time as normal. However, as
you take the action, describe a device you pull out and use
to accomplish the skill. The specifics of how you accomplish
this are up to you, but they should fit the challenge at hand.
For instance, you might use gravitic stabilizers to balance on
the razor’s edge, a force battering ram gizmo to open the iron
door, or a device that produces an aroma with the ability to
pacify wyrms to persuade the dragon. Using an invention in
this way lets you alter how you calculate the skill check used
in the action. Instead of the normal skill modifier associated
with that skill action, you use your Crafting modifier.
PERSISTENT BOOST
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Prerequisites offensive boost
Your innovation sets foes on fire, covers them in acid, leaves
barbed thorns behind, or otherwise deals persistent damage
to your foes that sticks around long after you deliver your
boosted attack. When you or your construct innovation
damage a foe with offensive boost, that foe also takes 1d8
persistent damage of the same damage type as the offensive
boost damage.
YOU FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR... THIS! [reaction]
FEAT 16
INVENTOR
Trigger A creature you can see targets you with an attack
against your AC.
When your foes try to attack you, you always seem to
have some outlandish invention you can pull out at the last
second to protect you from whatever attack they throw at
you. Describe a device you’re attempting to use to protect
yourself from the foe’s attack—for instance, when attacked
by a shocker lizard’s shock Strike, you might pull out a
specially grounded lightning rod from that time you tried to
power an invention by harnessing a thunderstorm! Using an
invention to defend in this way means that the attack roll
for the triggering attack targets your Crafting DC instead of
your AC.
Since you’re using your Crafting DC instead of your AC,
any penalties to your AC don’t apply, but this doesn’t remove
any conditions or other effects that are causing you such
penalties. For instance, if you were flat-footed and used an
invention to defend against a sneak attack, you’d still take
the extra precision damage if you were hit, even though the
–2 penalty to AC from being flat-footed wouldn’t apply to
your Crafting DC.
18TH LEVEL
DEVASTATING WEAPONRY [three-actions]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites weapon innovation
You release a volley of projectiles from your weapon, or
power it to fly in every direction across the battlefield and
Strike multiple creatures. Make a Strike with your weapon
innovation against each foe within 30 feet of you. Don’t
increase your multiple attack penalty until after making all
the attacks. If your innovation is a melee weapon and any of
the attacks are outside your reach, you Release the weapon
before the Strikes, and it returns to your grasp after all of
them. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it
falls to the ground in your space. As normal, if your weapon
innovation requires one or more actions to reload between
Strikes, you can’t use it to make multiple attacks with
Devastating Weaponry.
ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION [three-actions]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites construct innovation
Your construct unleashes a broad swath of devastation by
separating its limbs, deploying hidden armaments, or using
a similar technique to wreak havoc. You Command your
innovation. Instead of its normal actions, it Strides once,
then makes a Strike against each foe within 30 feet of it
with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until after the construct
makes all the attacks.
NEGATE DAMAGE [reaction]
FEAT 18
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor innovation
Trigger You would take damage.
Your armor innovation activates various devices you
prepared ahead of time, and you use one of them to reduce
the damage you would take by 15.
Unstable Function You activate all the precautions at
once, violently repelling the incoming attack to blunt its
force. Add the unstable trait to Negate Damage and reduce
the damage you would take by 50.

FULL AUTOMATION
FEAT 20
INVENTOR
Prerequisites armor, construct, or weapon innovation
You become so entwined with your innovations that you
can use them without a second thought. You’re permanently
quickened. How you can use the extra action depends on
your innovation.
•	 Armor Your armor responds to the most subtle stimuli
to move you in the right direction as long as you are
wearing it. You can use the extra action to Stride, Step,
or use a form of movement provided by your innovation
(such as Fly or Swim).
•	 Construct Your ability to command your construct
becomes instinctive. You can use the extra action to
Command your construct innovation (or to provide
1 of the actions if you choose to spend 2 actions to
Command your construct).
•	 Weapon Your weapon becomes easier to wield with
deadly efficacy, almost as if it is an extension of your
body. It speeds effortlessly toward whatever target
you choose as long as you are holding it. You can use
the extra action to Strike with your innovation.
UBIQUITOUS OVERDRIVE
FEAT 20
INVENTOR
Prerequisites Shared Overdrive
You prepare a variety of incredible gizmos on each of your
allies, linking them together through careful modification to
enable you to power them up all at once. During your daily
preparations, select up to six willing allies. Whenever you
Overdrive, you grant the benefits of your overdrive to any of
these allies you choose who are within 30 feet of you. The
allies don’t gain the increased damage from expert, master, or
legendary overdrive.
Construct Companions
A construct companion is a loyal semi-sentient
construct who follows your orders obediently and is
roughly as intelligent as an animal. Your construct
companion has the minion trait, and it gains 2 actions
during your turn if you use the Command a Minion
action to command it.
If your companion is destroyed, you can spend 1
day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with
a high DC for your level. On a success, you rebuild
your companion. You can have only one construct
companion at a time, and you can have either a
construct companion or an animal companion, but not
both.
RIDING CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
You or an ally can ride your construct companion as long
as your construct companion is at least one size larger
than the rider.
PROTOTYPE CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
The following are the base statistics for a prototype
construct companion, the first construct companion most
characters get. A companion has the same level you do.
As you gain levels, you might make further adjustments
as your companion grows more powerful. Construct
companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you
do, with one difference: the only item bonuses they can
benefit from are to Speed.
Construct Trait
A construct companion has the construct trait. It’s not a
living creature, nor is it undead.
Proficiencies
Your construct companion is trained in its unarmed
attacks,
unarmored
defense,
all
saving
throws,
Perception,
Acrobatics,
and
Athletics.
Construct
companions can’t use abilities that require greater
Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even
if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have an
ability that allows it.
Size
Your construct companion is either Small or Medium,
chosen by you when you first gain the companion.
Strikes
Your construct companion has two kinds of melee
unarmed attacks. Its first unarmed attack deals 1d8
bludgeoning damage. Depending on the shape of your
construct this could be a fist, tendril, or other similar
unarmed attack. Its other unarmed attack deals 1d6
slashing or piercing damage (choose when you first
gain the companion) and has the agile and finesse traits.
Depending on the shape of your construct, this could be a
spine or spike, jaws or fangs, a retractable blade, or other
similar unarmed attack.
Ability Modifiers
A construct companion begins with base ability
modifiers of Str +3, Dex +3, Con +2, Int –4, Wis +1,
Cha +0.
Hit Points
Your construct companion has 10 Hit Points, plus a
number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution
modifier for each level you have.
While constructs are usually immediately destroyed
at 0 Hit Points, your construct companion is a little
harder to destroy than other constructs are. When your
construct reaches 0 Hit Points, it becomes broken and
begins sparking and might be destroyed if you don’t
Repair it. This works the same as the normal dying
rules and determines if your construct is destroyed,
with the following two changes. First, most effects that

end the dying condition don’t work to save a construct
companion, but a construct can be stabilized using the
Administer First Aid action, using the Crafting skill
instead of Medicine. Second, instead of gaining and
tracking the wounded condition, if your construct
becomes broken in this way more than twice within
a 10-minute period, it’s destroyed, and you’ll need to
reconstruct it by spending a day of downtime.
Immunities
Because it’s a construct, your construct companion
is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed,
drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal
attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious.
Because the construct isn’t a living creature, effects that
heal living creatures can’t help it recover Hit Points.
Restoring Hit Points to it requires using the Repair
action or other means that can restore Hit Points to
objects and nonliving creatures.
Senses
Your construct companion has precise vision, imprecise
hearing, and vague touch senses, but no sense of smell
or taste.
Speed
Your construct companion has a Speed of 25 feet.
ADVANCED CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To advance a prototype construct companion
to an advanced construct companion (usually a
result of one of your class feat choices), make
the following adjustments.
•	 Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase its unarmed attack damage
from one die to two dice (for instance,
1d8 to 2d8).
•	 Increase its proficiency rank for
Perception and all saving throws
to expert.
•	 Increase its proficiency ranks
in Intimidation, Stealth, and
Survival to trained. If the
construct is your innovation
and it was already trained
in those skills from a
modification, increase its
proficiency rank in those
skills to expert.
•	 You can change your
companion’s Size, if you
want, to either Small, Medium, or Large.
INCREDIBLE CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To improve an advanced construct companion to an
incredible construct companion, make the following
adjustments.
•	 Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and
Wisdom modifiers by 2.
•	 It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed
attacks. Its attacks become magical, allowing it to
bypass resistances to non-magical attacks.
•	 Increase its proficiency ranks in Athletics and
Acrobatics to expert.
PARAGON CONSTRUCT COMPANIONS
To improve an incredible construct companion to a paragon
construct companion, make the following adjustments.
•	 Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and
Wisdom modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks
and unarmored defense to expert.
•	 Increase
its
proficiency
ranks
for
Athletics,
Acrobatics, saving throws, and Perception to master.
•	 Increase its unarmed attack damage from two
dice to three dice, and its additional damage with
unarmed attacks from 2 to 4.

Examining the knuckles on my gauntlets, I despaired. While they had done as I had hoped
and battered through the dragon’s adamantine scales, their once pristine surfaces were
now heavily dented. Worse, I’d blown out a capacitator when I activated them a second
time for that final attack. As the paladin made her rounds, applying bandages and laying
on hands, I pulled my tools out of my pack and set about repairing the damage.
My diligence was well rewarded, as a strange metal door hidden by the dragon’s body
slowly spiraled open from the floor. A metallic lift rose up. Upon it stood a pair of statues,
their bodies made of a bright, gleaming silver. First adamantine, now mithral as well?
As soon as I realized that, I called for our wizard to ready his spells of cold and water.
Whoever once called this place home possessed unimaginable resources! Not one, but
three guardians, each forged from enough precious metal to beggar a kingdom’s treasury.
Fortunately, I had more at my disposal than electrified gauntlets and heat-resistant
armor. As the wizard’s cold washed over the first golem, I opened the release valve for the
nozzle attached to my right gauntlet. A stream of pressurized, cold fluid surged forth and
engulfed our foes. As the golems’ bodies congealed and cracked, I couldn’t help but smile.
These constructs proved that even more lay hidden beneath our feet. I remained all too
eager to discover the truth, but little did I realize the magnitude of what was next in store.

Golarion is a world of fantasy, one that is incredibly
vast and diverse. This means that numerous reflections
of the genre, in all its permutations, can be found
somewhere the world, as long as you know where to
look. The Shining Kingdoms are a land of knights and
chivalry similar to those imagined in the legends of King
Arthur, the Saga Lands remain home to fierce vikings and
time-displaced wizards, and the High Seas embody the
spirit of exploration and the fearsome naval combat of
the age of piracy.
Fantasy has more to offer than just knights in shining
armor and wizards in tall towers. Ingenious goblins and
ratfolk cobbling together technology from half a dozen
different disciplines and schematics, industrious dwarves
smithing intricate technological marvels, and humans
meticulously assembling clockwork creatures and
weapons piece by painstaking piece all have their places
within the genre of fantasy and in the world of Golarion.
For the automatons of the Jistka Imperium, their place
in the world remains complicated. They represent the last
remnants of an ancient society that mastered magic and
machines in equal measure, then left them behind after
the society fell as a relic of their lost nation’s greatest
achievement. For trick drivers and their trusty vehicle
mechanics, their place might be almost anywhere, though
they’re unlikely to learn their craft outside of port cities
like Absalom, or countries where technology grew at a
steady pace alongside magic, like the continent of Arcadia
or the nation of New Thassilon. Meanwhile, trapsmiths
and their cogwheel snares find a home in Absalom, with
its Clockwork Cathedral; in the gritty Grand Duchy of
Alkenstar or their dwarven allies in Dongun Hold; or in
Arcadia or New Thassilon as well.
Even characters whose classes typically represent the
embodiments of classic fantasy and high magic might
have a spark of technology hidden away somewhere,
perhaps waiting for just the right moment to reveal the
ace up their sleeves. The old wizard, his body failing
but his magic strong, might choose to replace a failing
heart with a clockwork organ rather than succumb
to the temptation of undeath. A construct might
successfully seek out a soul and life as a living
creature to start anew and attain a different
perspective about the world. Even an elven archer
in a forest far away from any center of technology
might create devices that are entirely new to their
culture, such as scopes and eyewear that use the
scientific power of crystals and lenses to see hidden
targets and enable otherwise impossible shots. In all
these cases, players should work together with their
GMs to build context and story behind these ideas and
ground the character in the world.

VARIATIONS ON A THEME
The
inventor
class,
automaton
ancestry,
new
backgrounds, and other elements located in this book
give players ways to embody different aesthetics
that infuse mechanical concepts or fantastic science
into their character designs. The degree to which you
combine these elements is something that can help you
impact the development of your character and the tone
and feel of your game in a variety of ways.
An automaton character with a Pathfinder Core
Rulebook class like fighter or monk can be an interesting
twist on a classic idea. An automaton inventor with the
Disciple of the Gear background who multiclasses as a
cleric of Brigh, goddess of invention, can be the focal
point of an entire campaign arc themed around the spread
of technology and the search to understand the mortal
soul. A gnome vehicle mechanic who maintains and
makes improvements upon a single vehicle can serve as
an unusual character whose existence begs the question
of the prevalence of technology throughout the world, or
as an established member of a robust mechanics’ guild
that creates and maintains a small fleet of vehicles used
for a particular purpose by a city or civilization.
The way that you combine the elements presented in
this section can enable you to tell a vast array of different
stories. The extent to which magic and technology coexist
in your fantasy setting is up to you. Players and GMs
should work together to discover how their respective
ideas can influence each other as they explore how much
influence technology has on the world, as well as discuss
methods they might employ as the campaign unfolds to
demonstrate its importance, or lack thereof.

================================================================================

The Jistka Imperium was the first major human
civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the
area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring
for seven centuries thanks to great advancements
in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka’s leaders
often favored aggressive uses of technology, and
early advances paved the way for arrogance,
petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka
Imperium’s expansionist tendencies and lack of
diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies
over the course of its existence. The most
notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion.
Osirion’s enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium’s fate,
as they employed clever and depraved magic that
proved more than a match for Jistka’s legendary
golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut
corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a
desperate attempt to fight back
against internal corruption and
external pressures, a cabal of
concerned Jistkans formed the
Artificer Conclave to develop new
technologies to stave off
the Imperium’s collapse
and return Jistka to
its former glory. The
most
successful
of
these developments were
automatons, which the Conclave
believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan
constructs—or at least, the last hope for Jistka’s
salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind,
life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these
constructs, creating magical and technological marvels
powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and
scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately,
despite the Conclave’s best efforts, the automatons’
arrival happened too late to save the already doomed
Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to
fend for themselves.
The exceptional and forward-thinking construction
of automatons means that a fair number remain today,
millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the
passage of time has revealed one of automatons’
greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only
the strongest willed have managed to retain
their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after
all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as
any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has
their own personality, shaped by countless experiences.
Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid
others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding.
Even automatons who are more willing to live in the
open understand that their unique nature makes them a
prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the
automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of
distrust or worry.
If you want to play a character who is a living
construct with powerful potential and ties to ancient
magic, you should play an automaton.
AUTOMATON
These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying
empire’s last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with
magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.

YOU MIGHT...
•	 Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.
•	 Be hesitant to trust others until they’ve earned it.
•	 Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.
•	 Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.
•	 Look upon you with awe.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Automatons share a common construction—a blend of magically treated
metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of
direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can
move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating
foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role.
Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have
shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a
single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful
artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life
and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical
engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.
As constructs, automatons typically don’t need to breathe, eat, or sleep;
however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical
exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air
to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton’s systems,
sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like
living creatures. Though they don’t sleep, automatons require a period of
magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within
their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully
powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a
humanoid who doesn’t get 8 hours of sleep).
Automatons don’t age and the design of their cores grants them a
seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are
thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation,
even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages.
Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton’s body
is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying
an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton’s soul might
remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body.
This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional
immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads
to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic
to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core’s destruction, or
if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul,
the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.
In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously
influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their
souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they
have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless
construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless
wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.
SOCIETY
Due to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives.
There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such

TRAITS

Construct
AUTOMATON CORE
Your body contains an automaton core
infused with planar quintessence that
grants you power to perform various
tasks and houses your soul and life
energy. This life energy flows through
you much like the blood of humanoids.
As a result, you are a living creature.
You don’t have the typical construct
immunities, can be affected by effects
that target a living creature, and
can recover Hit Points normally via
positive energy. Additionally, you are
not destroyed when reduced to 0
Hit Points. Instead, your life energy
attempts to keep you active even in
dire straits; you are knocked out and
begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit
Points (Core Rulebook 459).

as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or
travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however,
and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons
that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka.
These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or
visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the
resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.
Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending
on the automaton’s personality, this encounter could go a number of ways,
ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton’s unique
appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they’re found, but
most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical
constructs aren’t an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are
mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct,
it’s often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton.
However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday
life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they
go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt
to take their body for study or to access their core.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
The people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose
behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral.
Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful
neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a
fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their
outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to
cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh
and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma
are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons
likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do
so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee,
a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as
a kindred spirit.
NAMES
An automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation
into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade,
memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have
names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had
to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one
at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of
the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave’s
members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some
automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting
a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent
a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a
particularly cherished title in place of any other name.
Sample Names
Alnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred,
Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian
Automaton Heritages
Every automaton has a unique body based on the original roles intended to aid
the people of Jistka. Choose one of the following automaton heritages at 1st level.
CONSTRUCTED BODY
Your physiological needs are
different than those of living
creatures. You don’t need to eat
or drink. You don’t need to sleep,
but you still need a daily period of
rest. During this period of rest, you
must enter a recuperating standby
state for 2 hours, which is similar
to sleeping except you are aware of
your surroundings and don’t take
penalties for being unconscious.
Much like with sleeping, if you go too
long without entering your standby
state, you become fatigued and can’t
recover until you enter standby for
2 hours.
LOW-LIGHT VISION
You can see in dim light as though it
were bright light, so you ignore the
concealed condition due to dim light.

HUNTER AUTOMATON
You were designed to serve as a scout or assassin and
have a body resembling a pack hunter like a large cat
or wolf. Though you typically move like a quadruped,
you can still stand and fight like a biped,
allowing you to use all equipment
normally. Your quadruped design allows
you to move quickly; if you have both
hands free, you can increase your Speed to
30 feet as you run on all fours.
MAGE AUTOMATON
The chamber housing your core has a more
direct connection to the rest of your humanoid
shape, allowing you to tap into your core’s magical
energy. You gain one cantrip from the arcane spell
list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell
at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to
half your level rounded up.
SHARPSHOOTER AUTOMATON
Your lithe, humanoid shape is designed for speed and
accuracy suitable for ranged combat. You gain the
Automaton Aim action.
AUTOMATON AIM [one-action]
You steady your body and observe the events of the
battlefield to maximize the range of your next shot. You
reduce the penalty for firing into your weapon’s second
range increment from –2 to 0 for the next ranged attack
you make this turn. You can use this action a second
time in the same turn to reduce the penalty from firing
into your weapon’s third range increment from –4 to 0
for the next ranged attack you make this turn.
WARRIOR AUTOMATON
Sporting a bulkier, powerful design, your body has
been designed for combat. You have a bulky, humanoid
shape. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6
instead of 1d4. You don’t take a penalty when making a
lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attack.
Ancestry Feats
The following feats are available to automaton
characters.
1ST LEVEL
AUTOMATON ARMAMENT
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You’ve been provided a body part designed for combat.
You gain either a claw or pincer unarmed attack. The claw
deals 1d4 slashing damage, is in the brawling group, and
has the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits. The pincer deals
1d6 piercing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the
grapple and unarmed traits.
ENHANCEMENTS
Automatons are built to receive enhancements and
modifications to their bodies. Many automaton ancestry
feats have an “Enhancement” line that represents a
possible augmentation you can acquire. You don’t gain the
benefits of the enhancement unless you take a feat that
grants you those benefits, such as Lesser Augmentation.
You can only gain the enhancements of a given feat once.

You have come to better understand the process that
made your body and the magic that powers it. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Arcana and Crafting. If you would
automatically become trained in one of those skills (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in
Automaton Lore.
Enhancement Your gain greater understanding. Increase
your proficiency rank in either Arcana or Crafting, as well as
Automaton Lore, to expert. If you were already an expert in
the chosen skill, increase your rank to master instead.
ENERGY BEAM
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
You can channel your core’s power through the magical gem
that serves as your eye. You gain an energy beam ranged
unarmed attack that deals 1d4 fire damage. The energy
beam has a range increment of 20 feet. On a critical hit, the
target takes persistent fire damage equal to the number
of weapon damage dice. Your eye beam does not add
critical specialization effects.
Enhancement You channel greater power. Increase
the damage die of your energy beam by one step, from
1d4 to 1d6.
REINFORCED CHASSIS
FEAT 1
AUTOMATON
Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis
is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4
item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a
speed penalty of –5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can
never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you

to affect you. You gain the Resist Magic reaction.
Enhancement Your safeguards improve. When you Resist
Magic, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to
the spell level of the triggering effect.
RESIST MAGIC [reaction]
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a harmful
magical effect but haven’t rolled yet.
Your innate magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to the triggering saving throw. Additionally, if the
triggering effect is arcane, if you roll a success, you get a
critical success instead.
INTEGRATED ARMAMENT
FEAT 5
AUTOMATON
Your mechanical body houses a weapon or shield that you
can quickly draw and stow, leaving you prepared for combat
at all times.
You can use a 1-minute activity, which has the manipulate
trait, to integrate a single, one-handed weapon or shield into
one of your arms. You can draw or stow this item as an Interact
action. Creatures don’t automatically see this integrated item
when it’s stowed and must actively Seek in order to find it. They
take a –2 circumstance penalty to any checks to do so. While
you are wielding the item, it can’t be Disarmed and you can’t
drop or Release it; you must Interact to store the weapon and
free that hand. A creature determined to retrieve the item can
do so, but it requires either 1 minute to remove it or extreme
violence to your arm—such as physically removing portions
of the limb. You can only have one integrated armament at a
time, though you can use the 1-minute activity to replace the
item or swap the arm in which it’s stored.
Enhancement Your body has more space for integration.
You can now either integrate two one-handed weapons, a
one-handed weapon and a shield, or a single two-handed
weapon which is split across both arms. You can use a single
Interact action to draw or store both integrated armaments.
When you draw a single weapon, you can choose to hold it
with either one hand or both hands.
MAGICAL RESISTANCE
FEAT 5
AUTOMATON
Your animating magic provides some defense. Choose one of
the following energy damage types: cold, electricity, or sonic.
You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.
Enhancement You tap deeper into your animating magic,
and your resistances improve. Choose one of the following
benefits: you gain resistance 5 to the remaining two damage
types from the above list, or your chosen resistance increases
to a value equal to 1 + half your level.
9TH LEVEL
ARCANE CAMOUFLAGE
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites hunter automaton
You have developed magical techniques to aid you with
stalking your prey. You can cast blur and invisibility each
once per day as 2nd-level arcane innate spells.
Enhancement Your camouflage is more potent. Your blur
spell now lasts 10 minutes and when you cast invisibility,
you can choose to gain the effects of the 4th-level version of
the spell. In addition, you can now cast blur and invisibility
each twice per day.
ARCANE PROPULSION [two-actions]
FEAT 9
ARCANE
AUTOMATON
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
You redirect energy from your core to ports on your back or
feet, allowing you to fly for a short time. You can maintain
this redirected energy for 5 minutes. You gain a fly Speed
equal to your Speed while redirecting the energy.
Enhancement You can maintain your flight for longer.
You can redirect your energy at all times, allowing you to
fly whenever you want, rather than just once per day for
5 minutes.
ARCANE SLAM [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites warrior automaton
Requirements You have a creature grabbed or restrained.
You channel magical power from your core into your arm,
empowering your attack as you attempt to slam your foe
into the ground. Attempt an Athletics check against the
foe’s Fortitude DC. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to
your check if the target is one size larger than you and a –4
circumstance penalty if it’s larger than that. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size
smaller than you and a +4 circumstance bonus if it’s smaller
than that.
AUTOMATON ADVENTURERS
Many who became automatons had some role in society
prior to their transformation and often gravitate toward
classes that best represent these roles, even if they
no longer remember their former life as more than
subconscious flashes. Hunter, sharpshooter, and warrior
automatons usually become fighters, rangers, and
rogues. Spell casting classes, such as bards, witches, and
wizards are common among mage automatons. While
an automaton can have any background, the pool of
individuals chosen to become automatons were typically
of the acolyte, bounty hunter, emissary, gladiator, guard,
herbalist, hunter, martial disciple, scholar, scout, or
warrior background.

Your core allows you to draw more power from it. Select one
1st-level arcane spell and one 2nd-level or lower arcane spell,
to which you have access. You can cast your chosen spells as
arcane innate spells each once per day.
Enhancement Your attunement grows stronger. Select one
5th-level or lower arcane spell and one 6th-level or lower
arcane spell, to which you have access. You can cast them
as arcane innate spells each once per day, in addition to the
original spells.
LESSER AUGMENTATION
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
You’ve focused on enhancing yourself and have received
an improvement to one of your existing abilities. You gain
the enhancement benefits of one of your 1st- or 5th-level
automaton ancestry feats.
You are also capable of reconfiguring your augmentations
to meet your needs. You can spend one week of downtime to
change the enhancement you gain with this feat.
Enhancement You gain the enhancement benefits of
another 1st- or 5th-level automaton ancestry feat. Also, your
reconfigurations take less time. You only need to spend 1 day
of downtime to change any of your enhancements. If you
have multiple enhancements, changing each one requires a
separate day.
RAIN OF BOLTS [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites sharpshooter automaton
Frequency once per day
Throughout the day, your body produces powerful projectiles
within your chassis. You fire them all at once in either a
30-foot cone or a 10-foot emanation. Foes in the area take
6d6 piercing damage. This increases to 7d6 at 12th level, 8d6
at 15th level, and 9d6 at 18th level.
Enhancement The projectiles regenerate quicker, they are
much more powerful, and you can refine the metallic content
to harm certain creatures. You can use Rain of Bolts once
per hour instead of once per day. The damage increases
to 12d6 and each time you use the action, you can choose
adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The damage from Rain of
Bolts is treated as the metal you chose. At 20th level, the
damage increases to 13d6.
13TH LEVEL

Enhancement Your body allows for even further forms of
movement. You can either select the option from this feat
you haven’t chosen yet (climb Speed or swim Speed), or you
can increase your land Speed by 5 feet and increase the
Speed you chose from this feat increase to be equal to your
adjusted land Speed.

AUTOMATON ORIGINS
The method of creating automatons as the Artificer
Conclave did millennia ago has been lost to time. As
such, most automatons who remain on Golarion were
created during Jistka’s existence. However, there are a
few rare automatons that have different origins. Anquira,
herself an automaton and a high-ranking member of
the Artificer Conclave, resides in Axis and seems to be
nearing the point of recreating the Jistkan process. She’s
created a few promising prototype automatons with her
techniques. There are also rumors of another automaton
doing similar research somewhere in the deserts of the
Golden Road, though the new automatons emerging from
the desert appear somewhat incomplete.
Of significant note are the increased reports of
automatons in southern Garund, originating from the nation
of Eihlona. The nation is famous for its inhabitants’ skill in
mixing magic with technology, particularly the remnants of
Shory technology that crashed within the nation’s borders
in ages past. Eihlonan mage crafters have managed to
recreate automatons using their vast knowledge, magical
prowess, and access to ancient technology, alongside
insights from a few friendly automaton immigrants who
found a respectful and welcoming home there. Though the
process is long and arduous, Eihlona seems to be on the
verge of recreating the success of the Artificer Conclave.
If they do, they could someday produce hundreds, if not
thousands of automatons.

the Astral Plane, allowing you to teleport periodically. You
can cast dimension door once per hour as a 4th-level innate
arcane spell.
Enhancement Your attunement allows you to teleport
in a series of quick jumps rather than in one big leap. You
can expend your hourly use of dimension door as a free
action when you begin your turn. If you do, your Strides
are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you
to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with
your Speed instead of traversing normally to the location.
While augmented, your Strides gain the conjuration and
teleportation traits. Your augmented Strides don’t trigger
reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon
leaving or entering a square, unless those reactions trigger
on teleportation.
CORE REJUVENATION [free-action]
FEAT 13
AUTOMATON
Frequency once per day
Trigger You have the dying condition and are about to
attempt a recovery check.
Your soul taps into your core’s power to push against the
grasp of death and allow you to recover consciousness.
You’re restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and unconscious
conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or
increase the wounded condition as normal when losing the
dying condition in this way.
Enhancement Your soul can draw even more power from
your core, granting you additional benefits. When you use
Core Rejuvenation, you also gain a number of temporary
Hit Points equal to three times your level. These Hit Points
remain for 1 minute.
ENLARGED CHASSIS
FEAT 13
AUTOMATON
Prerequisites Medium or Small size
You’ve empowered your core to support a larger body,
granting you size and additional reach. You gain the effects
of enlarge constantly.
Enhancement Your core’s empowerment has stabilized,
allowing for greater support. You are no longer clumsy due
to the effects of enlarge.
17TH LEVEL
AXIAL RECALL
FEAT 17
UNCOMMON
AUTOMATON
You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to
attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast plane shift
twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target
yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane,
and your body serves as the focus component.
CORE CANNON [two-actions]
FEAT 17
ARCANE
AUTOMATON
CONCENTRATE
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
Your body transforms into a powerful magical cannon.
While immobile as a cannon, you can fire blasts of energy
directly from your core, devastating your foes. You become
immobilized until you use an Interact action to revert back
to your standard form. While in your cannon form, the
only actions you can use are to Strike with an energy blast
unarmed attack or to Interact to revert back to your standard
form. You can remain in your cannon form for up to 1 minute
or until you take the action to revert back to your standard
form, whichever comes first.
Energy blasts are a special ranged unarmed attack. You
can only make energy blast Strikes while you’re in your
cannon form. Your energy blasts deal 3d8 fire damage and
3d6 force damage, which increases to 4d8 fire damage and
3d6 force damage at level 20. You gain the item bonus to
attack rolls with your energy blasts from the highest potency
rune on any handwraps of mighty blows you are wearing
or any weapon you are wielding, but striking and property
runes have no effect on your energy blasts. Energy blasts
have a range increment of 120 feet. On a critical hit with
an energy blast, the target takes 10 persistent fire damage.
Your energy blast doesn’t add critical specialization effects.
If it matters for an effect dependent on weapon damage dice,
an energy blast’s number of weapon damage dice is three, or
four at level 20.
GREATER AUGMENTATION
FEAT 17
AUTOMATON
You’ve greatly improved your abilities and your core can
support further augmentations. You gain the enhancement
benefits of one of your 1st-, 5th-, 9th-, or 13th-level automaton
ancestry feats.
You are also capable of reconfiguring your augmentations
to meet your needs. You can spend one week of downtime to
change the enhancement you gain with this feat.
VERSATILE HERITAGES
Since automatons have artificial bodies, they don’t
manifest the features of versatile heritages, even if
the soul within their core did so in life. As a result,
most automatons don’t have a versatile heritage.
However, players who are interested in taking a
versatile heritage are encouraged to speak with their
GM to best determine an explanation for the versatile
heritage. Since an automaton core draws on planar
energy, there is a chance that said energy manifests in
a versatile heritage, such as a tiefling automaton with
an overabundance of Hell’s planar energy. Alternatively,
a powerful soul might still be able to manifest the
features of their heritage they had prior to transfer
to an automaton body. An automaton with a versatile
heritage will have minimal physical changes if any,
though the color of energy that courses through their
core and the rest of their body might change to properly
represent the versatile heritage.

The following common backgrounds are particularly
appropriate for a character that interacts with
technology in a changing world. While the backgrounds
are listed as common for an area with themes of gears
and technology, and their mechanics and story impact
are not likely to require a discussion with your GM
or the other players, many of them still might not be
thematically appropriate for regions and campaigns that
lack these themes.
ANTI-TECH ACTIVIST
BACKGROUND
You’ve seen the sorts of things that technology brings—
polluted environments, workers put out of their jobs or
horribly injured, and the slow erosion of society—and you’ve
vowed to inform the larger world of these ills. You do so with
long, impassioned speeches on street corners and village
squares and by talking personally with the heads of various
guilds. Adventuring into the wider world could help spread
your message even farther.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Guild Lore
skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat.
CLOCKFIGHTER
While others choose to use their engineering ability to heal
the injured or make brilliant innovations, you’ve used your
skill to repair and modify clockwork constructs that battle in
gladiatorial combat. You know how to get a crowd electrified
for your clockwork gladiator, win or lose, and you know how
to repair it when it gets damaged. These skills serve you well
as an adventurer.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Gladiatorial
Lore skill. You gain the Experienced Professional skill feat.
CLOCKWORK RESEARCHER
BACKGROUND
New forms of clockwork technology are incredibly
interesting to you, and you’ve been studying examples
of them to see where else they might be best put to use.
You might eventually develop a new prototype machine or
find a way to make related technologies practical enough
for everyone to benefit. Though before you do, you must
continue your research!
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Engineering Lore
skill. You gain the Eye for Numbers (Advanced Player’s Guide
206) skill feat.
CODEBREAKER
BACKGROUND
Whether you’re employed by a military organization to
decipher coded messages sent by enemy
factions or work independently to crack an
enigma created by a past civilization, you
have a head for patterns and linguistics.
You might even use new clockwork
devices to aid you in your efforts.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be
to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Cryptography
Lore skill. You gain the Glean Contents (Advanced Player’s
Guide 206) skill feat.

DISCIPLE OF THE GEAR
BACKGROUND
While many regard science and faith as incompatible, you
believe scientific advancement is your deity’s will. Perhaps
you’re a follower of Brigh, Casandalee, or some other god of
technology, or perhaps you see the furnaces and sparks of
modernity as the latest manifestation of Sarenrae’s flame or
Gozreh’s lightning—whatever the case, you’re always willing
to spread the word of your deity, and you’ve learned some
basic tinkering to show how your deity’s focus can increase
the common standard of living.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Lore skill for
the deity you worship. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.
DRIVER
BACKGROUND
You practically live behind the controls of a vehicle, and
can handle just about anything the road, waves, and sky
can throw at you. You likely adventure to test your skills
in unusual environments and new and interesting vehicles.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill and the Piloting Lore
skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Piloting Lore.
HOUNDED THIEF
BACKGROUND
Some time ago, you stole a unique item from a strange
individual. It might have been a piece of clockwork from
a far-off land or some other bit of strange technology. You
might still have it or you might have sold it, but either way,
you can’t shake the feeling that you’re being followed and
watched, likely by forces who want to retrieve what you
took. Luckily, a life of adventure keeps you on the move.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Thievery skill and the Underworld
Lore skill. You gain the Pickpocket skill feat.
JUNKER
BACKGROUND
You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the
detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in
your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to
search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where
people make greater use of technology.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Lore skill of the
terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the Hefty Hauler skill feat.
MECHANIC
BACKGROUND
The intricate inner workings of machines are no stranger
to you. Whether they are mundane devices or complex
clockworks, you know what makes them tick and how to
maintain them. An adventuring group might keep you around
to repair their equipment, or you might travel around to offer
your rare services to those in need—for a price, of course!
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.
MEDICINAL CLOCKSMITH
BACKGROUND
While others might have looked to clockwork as a
mechanical innovation, you see the potential in the
technology to improve the health of patients. You might
be an experienced field medic who reached for a scrapped
construct to help a wounded soldier, or a vanguard surgeon
who’s found replacing organs with clockwork more
effective than repairing them. Perhaps you’ve also worked
to “optimize” organic bodies with fine machinery, with or
without the permission of your patients.
 Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Risky Surgery skill feat.
PRINTER
BACKGROUND
Keeping your finger on the pulse of the city, you write a small
news broadsheet to sell on street corners. You rent the use of
a printing press to achieve this goal, so you’re familiar with
such machines. However, people and their stories are your
main focus, and you adventure to chase the latest scoop.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Scribing Lore
skill. You gain the Multilingual skill feat.
SABOTEUR
BACKGROUND
Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest
of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a
knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or
structure’s weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer
strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills
or complete a particular mission.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Thievery skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Concealing Legerdemain (Advanced
Player’s Guide 204) skill feat.
TOYMAKER
BACKGROUND
You delight in making little trinkets for children of all ages,
and seeing their faces light up thanks to one of your creations
brings joy to your heart. Perhaps you sell your wares from
a particular shop or from the back of a wagon as you travel
from town to town.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Mercantile
Lore skill. You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat, choosing
artistry, blacksmithing, glassmaking, leatherworking, tailoring,
or woodworking as your specialty.

While most backgrounds are available to any character,
some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them
makes a character rare and extraordinary.
These rare backgrounds can give a player a
significantly different roleplaying experience by setting
their character up with a history or legacy beyond
the norm. For example, when a character with the
discarded duplicate background is the duplicate of a
world-shaking or plot-essential NPC, the character is
situated in a special position within the narrative. Your
character’s background is an intrinsic part of where
they come from and not something they earn during
the game. Rare backgrounds should be chosen only
after a discussion between the GM and other players as
to whether one would apply for a particular character
in your group’s game.
DISCARDED DUPLICATE
RARE
Someone created you for a specific purpose. Some important
person, be they a storied royal, a contentious politician, or
a stark military leader, needed a body double for their most
dangerous appearances. Using a mixture of fringe science and
magic, you were commissioned and trained to emulate this
person in every way, and have stood in for them in countless
deadly circumstances. You may or may not know the reason
behind your decommissioning, but whoever discarded you
didn’t finish you off. Now, the world is yours to explore—but
“you” may have a bold or brutish reputation, or the individual
you were duplicating may be long dead. Regardless of the fate
of this individual, your way of life has changed drastically.
You and the GM can work out how to incorporate your
previous life into your story. The GM can keep this knowledge
hidden even from you, or you or another character know what
happened. You and the GM can also leave the information
unspecified and fill it in later.
You gain three free ability boosts. You choose two, and the
GM chooses one based on the attributes of the character you
were built to duplicate.

you, a bronze, clockwork object latched onto some part of

your body. It may have sunk its needles into you or locked
its spidery legs around your neck, torso, or upper arm.
Some entity or spirit lives in this collection of gears and
wires—whether or not other people hear its whispers is up
to you. The entity may be an ancient, terrible being that
has razed villages with its hosts, or it may be a brilliant,
starry-eyed child who barely understands you’re not part
of its own body.
You have studied and searched for information on these
rare, crab-like machines, leaving you an expert in the binding
of elemental spirits or mortal souls to mechanical objects.
Though you have several theories on what the symbiotic
entity might be, you have no definitive answers—this may
be why you’re adventuring in the first place, or perhaps
you’ve made a deal with someone to get it removed.
The entity might talk to you periodically, or it might
only speak when it wants you to do something in
particular or finds the two of you in danger. You and
the GM should decide on the entity’s motivations,
or if the motivations should be a secret known only
to the GM.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be
to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a
free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Arcana skill
and an additional skill in which
the clockwork entity is well-versed,
determined by the GM. Any time you
attempt a skill check for the entity’s
skill, the GM can offer you a +1
circumstance bonus to the check, as
though the entity were Aiding you.
If you accept but fail the check,
the entity clenches up and you are
stunned 1 (stunned 2 on a critical
failure).
SAVED BY CLOCKWORK
RARE
Through bloody combat, a terrible
accident, or purposeful sacrifice,
you’ve lost some piece of your
body that has been replaced
with a clockwork mechanism.
Whether your arm is now a
whirring series of pumps, steel
coils, and iron gears; your heart
a intricate crystal clock that requires winding every
day; or your lower leg a sculpted metal tube powered
by adamantine springs and steam, part of you needs
regular maintenance and repair. You might have
received instructions from the brilliant inventor
who saved you, or you might have woken up on a
battlefield with no memory of the procedure or
the individuals involved. Regardless, you possess
the knowledge to take care of yourself—even if it’s
how to wind a key in your own heart or reconstruct a
mechanical foot.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill. Every day you must
perform 10 minutes of maintenance and wind up your
clockwork parts, or you risk failure of the components, with
consequences depending on what you replaced (determined
by you and the GM). Your clockwork components allow you
to react to danger with alacrity. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to initiative rolls.
TECH-RELIANT
RARE
Some event, be it an accident, attack, or disaster,
has left you horribly scarred by magic. Your body
no longer tolerates magical healing, and you can’t
use magic, forcing you to rely on gadgets and
ingenuity where others trust in spells and magical
items. You might have been well-versed in
magic before, or barely familiar with its
use. This event may have injured your
body in visible ways, but no matter
the extent of your injuries, your
body no longer interacts with
healing magic in any capacity.
Choose two ability boosts.
One must be to Constitution
or Intelligence, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill
and the Medicine skill. You gain the
Battle Medicine skill feat, and a +1
circumstance bonus to saving throws
against
spells.
Healing
spells,
healing magic items, and magical
effects with the healing trait have
no effect on you.
WISHED ALIVE
RARE
Once you were a simple
construct or inanimate doll, but
due to a deeply felt wish, either
yours or another’s, you came
to life, and so you’re now a living,
breathing creature.
Choose two ability boosts. One
must be to Constitution or Charisma,
and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill. Once
per day, you can fervently wish for something
you could work towards achieving as a single action
which has the concentrate trait. If you do, you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus on the first skill check you
attempt before the end of your turn to fulfill that wish.

================================================================================

While an infinite number of character concepts exist,
you might find that the feats and skill choices from
a single class aren’t sufficient to fully realize your
character. If you’re hoping to add a splash of technology
and invention to your character’s abilities while playing
a class other than inventor, these archetypes will allow
you to expand the scope of your character’s class.
Applying an archetype requires you to select
archetype feats instead of choosing class feats from your
class. Start by finding the archetype that best fits your
character concept, and select the archetype’s dedication
feat using one of your class feat choices. Once you have
the dedication feat, you can select any feat from that
archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet
its prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still
subject to any selection restrictions on the class feat it
replaces. For example, if you gained an ability at 6th
level that granted you a 4th-level class feat with the
dwarf trait, you could swap out that class feat only for
an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with the dwarf
trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a class feat are
called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once
you select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must
satisfy the requirements listed in its “Special” entry
before you can gain another dedication feat. Typically,
you satisfy an archetype dedication feat by gaining a
certain number of feats from the archetype’s list. You
cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any
other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another
feat, such as the alchemist’s Basic Concoction feat. You
must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those with
full write-ups in their archetype entry. These are typically
class feats, such as fighter feats that represent certain
combat styles. The list of additional feats includes
the feat’s name, its level, and the page number where
it appears. You can take the feat as an archetype feat
of that level, meaning it counts toward the number of
feats required by the archetype’s dedication feat. When
selected this way, a feat that normally has a class trait
doesn’t have that class trait.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your character’s training into another class’s specialties.
You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat
if you are already a member of the class of the same
name (for instance, a fighter can’t select the Fighter
Dedication feat).
Gears Archetype List
The following archetypes each allow you to build a
character with strong ties to gears and gadgets in a
variety of different ways.
•	 The inventor multiclass archetype (page 49) adds
some inventor abilities to a character of any class.
This allows all sorts of characters to flex their
ingenuity in order to solve problems through
brilliant invention.
•	 The overwatch archetype (page 50) uses enhanced
visual gear to watch the battlefield, taking
advantage of enemies’ openings and assisting allies
in a bind.
•	 The sterling dynamo archetype (page 52) gains
powerful uses out of their clockwork prosthetic.
While the prosthetic is usually an arm, the archetype
covers characters replacing or augmenting any limb
with a clockwork prosthetic.
•	 The trapsmith archetype (page 54) expands the
snarecrafter archetype with special options for
creating snares with cogwheels and gears, granting
a variety of special benefits impossible with an
ordinary snare.
•	 The trick driver archetype (page 55) drives a vehicle
into battle, crushing opponents who stand in their
way. A great choice for a character who wishes to
pilot a vehicle and join in the fight, whether it’s a
personal vehicle or one shared by the group.
•	 The vehicle mechanic archetype (page 56) gets the
most out of a specific vehicle, granting that vehicle
special benefits. This makes a vehicle mechanic a
natural combination with a trick driver to pilot
the vehicle.
GEARS ARCHETYPES
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in several archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Reckless: Actions with the reckless trait run the risk
of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing
a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an
appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.

MULTICLASS INVENTOR CHARACTERS
Inventor is a great fit for intelligent characters
looking to branch out and learn new tricks, especially
alchemists, who are already good at Crafting and may
appreciate unstable options as an alternative to daily
alchemical resources. If they meet the Intelligence
requirements, clerics of deities who encourage invention

Overwatch
With a stalwart mind and sharp eyes, you observe the
battlefield as though you and your allies are pieces on
a chessboard. By predicting dangers and hazards and
offering your insights to your comrades, you win battles
through keen observation and teamwork. Whenever
there’s a threat or opening, you’re the first to point it
out, and you’re ready to help your allies directly when
necessary.
As a group’s overwatch, you might let the position go
to your head. In such cases, you might think of yourself as
the mastermind behind the chessboard and feel detached
from your allies, thinking of them as little more than
pawns on the field.
But more likely your role allows you to feel a deeper
connection to your allies, and your coordination and
heroics stand out most when you subsume your individual
ego to serve the group’s needs. In that case, you might
think of yourself as a part of a functional whole—if your
party was a single living body, you serve as the eyes, but
that doesn’t mean you’re the brain, the heart, or other
vital organs. Everyone has a crucial role to play.
OVERWATCH DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites expert in Perception
You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you’ve
innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that
allow you to assist your allies. With the help of enhanced
visual gear (such as a specially modified telescope, goggled
visor, or binoculars), you’re keenly aware of the movement
of combatants on the battlefield. You quickly and efficiently
disperse that information to your nearby allies so they can use
it to direct their own observations and reactions to danger.
You’re surrounded by an overwatch field aura in a 30-foot
emanation. Your overwatch field aura grants you increased
perception and allows you to call out warnings to your allies
within the aura to point out threats. This aura has the auditory
and visual traits. You and allies within your overwatch field
receive a +2 circumstance bonus when using Perception for
Initiative checks.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
after you have gained at least two other feats from the
overwatch archetype.
SPYGLASS MODIFICATION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication
Your enhanced visual gear includes a regulating scope and
reflectors, combined in an ingenuous setup that allows you
to see around corners within the area of your overwatch
field. This permits your overwatch field to extend around
a single corner or turn and allows you to see around that
corner as well. This ability doesn’t let you see through
walls or other barriers. You can’t use it to see around
a second or further corner, and it doesn’t allow you
to make ranged attacks or perform other actions that
require line of effect with your target.
SWIFT INTERVENTION [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication
Trigger An ally within your overwatch field fails in their
attempt to Arrest a Fall, Balance, Grab a Ledge, or
Maneuver in Flight.
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.
You’re burdened with noticing potential threats at all times.
Because of this, you’ve learned that a well-placed shot can
prevent disaster. You make a shot to either pin an ally’s
clothing to stop a fall or secure them against a ledge, or you
bounce an attack off their armor to correct their course as
they stumble while attempting to balance or fly.
Make a single ranged attack roll against the DC of the
triggering check; your ally uses the result of your ranged
attack roll in place of their original roll. You must have line of
effect to your ally, and your attack roll includes any normal
bonuses or penalties for a ranged attack with that weapon
(such as the penalty for making a ranged attack beyond your
first range increment).

attack against an ally who is also within your overwatch
field.
Your foresight and planning are more valuable than armor
as you direct your ally away from danger, but there’s a
limit to how often you can guide your allies away from a
foe’s relentless assaults. The triggering attack roll targets
your Perception DC instead of your ally’s AC. Though this
allows your ally to avoid taking penalties to their AC, it
doesn’t remove any conditions or other effects causing such
penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would
still deal extra damage to your ally if they are flat-footed,
even though they wouldn’t take the –2 circumstance penalty
when defending against the attack.
MASTER SPOTTER
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, expert in Perception
Your incredible perception and trusty enhanced visual gear
allow you to see things others miss. Your proficiency rank in
Perception increases to master.
CONTROL TOWER
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Your keen senses and ability to process battlefield
information have dramatically improved, allowing you to
drastically reduce the advantage of unseen foes. You and
allies in your overwatch field gain a +2 circumstance bonus
when using the Seek action to find hidden or undetected
creatures within the overwatch field. You and your allies
don’t have to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed
creature within your overwatch field. When you or an ally
targets a hidden creature in your overwatch field, reduce the
DC of the flat check to 5.
CONVERGE [reaction]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Overwatch Dedication, master in Perception
Trigger You make a successful ranged attack against an
opponent who is within your overwatch field, and who
is within reach of one or more of your allies who is also
within your overwatch field.
Informing your ally of an opening created by your shot, you
coordinate to set them up to hit the target at the same time.
Your ally can make a melee Strike against the triggering foe as
a reaction. This Strike doesn’t count toward that ally’s multiple
attack penalty, and their multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply
to this Strike. If your ally’s Strike is successful, combine the
damage from your successful ranged attack with the damage
from your ally’s melee attack for the purpose of determining
resistances and weaknesses.
OVERWATCH TRAINING
Not just anyone can train to become their party’s
overwatch. A keen and incisive perception is necessary,
of course, but that alone won’t be sufficient. While
many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses
or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able
to apply information received from all five senses
(and any additional special senses they might have)
to make split-second decisions that work toward
achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially
be trained through hours of daily drills designed to
help a potential overwatch separate true threats and
situations requiring their skills from false positives,
and even situations where they would cause a problem
if they didn’t hold back. However, while training helps
ingrain good practice into one’s reflexes and muscle
memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks
an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such
training slow to produce results, or in the worst case,
even impossible.
Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch
requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear
to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others
miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your
team and nearby foes. While it isn’t explicitly necessary
for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to
maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many
successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better
understand how every piece works together to create
the whole.

Sterling Dynamo
While many people across Golarion use prosthetic devices,
you’ve acquired and outfitted yourself with a particularly
advanced combat model of clockwork prosthesis: a piece
of cutting edge technology called a sterling dynamo.
You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to
customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any
promising new technologies you encounter into its design.
There’s a significant distinction, however, between
someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis
and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With
their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun
Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt
sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice,
among the wide variety of amazing options
already available in both markets. However,
not everyone who chooses to use sterling
dynamo technology is a member of the
sterling dynamo archetype.
With
the
sterling
dynamo
archetype, you both use a sterling
dynamo
prosthesis
and
truly
understand
its
advantages,
limitations,
and
limitless
potential. You don’t have
to literally be your own
mechanic, as there’s
no
requirement
for
a sterling dynamo to
be
particularly
skilled
at crafting, but even if you
aren’t, you can still “feel” what’s
right when it comes to adjusting and
optimizing your dynamo. Whether you
implement these improvements yourself
or present your mechanic with ideas
and insights that allow them to achieve
something special on your behalf, your
strength and ingenuity are what make
you a sterling dynamo.
As you train to use your dynamo in
all sorts of adventures, you may become
capable of feats its original inventors
never dreamed possible. In fact, as you
progress in the archetype and explore
the possibilities, you might find that
these inventors want to interview you in
order to apply your insights and help them
create a new generation of the technology
with even greater capabilities. The sterling
dynamo’s adaptability grants it vast
potential, so the sky’s the limit!
STERLING DYNAMO DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which
allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a
simple new non‑prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your
sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile
limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never
increases your character’s number of hands or prehensile
limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities
or effects.
Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for
combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that
is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which
makes it more effective against certain types of creatures,
such as devils and werewolves).
 You have several options to customize your sterling
dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver
dynamo, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has
the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which
deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and has the agile and
finesse traits.
Most dynamos are automated, so they don’t require
a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks.
However, you can instead choose to make your
dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld
switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack
with a manually controlled dynamo, you must
have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is
great control and a more devastating strike. This
increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for
a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive
striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always
manual, but they use the hand on that arm
to operate the dynamo when making strikes.
Manual control is required only in the heat of
combat, not for less strenuous adventuring
or everyday activities.
You need to keep your sterling dynamo
wound, but the process isn’t particularly
onerous, so in most situations, it won’t be
an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding
up your dynamo, it can remain active for
24 hours before needing additional winding.
However, enemies can attempt to Disable the
dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to
reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour,
or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other
abilities that adversely affect technology might
also reduce the dynamo’s remaining operational
time. When your dynamo is out of operational time,
you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you
cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any
other abilities from this archetype until you wind the
dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute
at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of
operational time.
Special You cannot select another dedication
feat until you have gained two other feats from
the sterling dynamo archetype.

MODULAR DYNAMO
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to
swap between various different possibilities with ease in
order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo
attack gains the modular trait (page 150), as well as one of
the following configurations of your choice: power driver
(1d6 bludgeoning damage; shove), percussive striker (1d4
bludgeoning damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle (1d6
slashing damage; trip), or entangling barbs (1d6 piercing
damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo,
these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can
also choose the extendable baton (1d4 bludgeoning damage;
finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already
factored in.
When you use an Interact action to switch configurations
using the modular trait, you switch between the initial
configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling
Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose
with Modular Dynamo.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
you choose another configuration and add it to the list of
options you can choose when you use an Interact action with
the modular trait.
PISTON PUNCH [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
You lash out with a powerful punch, extending your dynamo
to a greater length in order to attack two creatures in a row.
Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and
compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The
first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe
must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from
you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you
hit. A Piston Punch counts as two attacks for your multiple
attack penalty. Reduce the operational time of your sterling
dynamo by 1 hour.
STASIAN SMASH [two-actions]
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Access You are from Ustalav.
You’ve modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing
you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity.
Make a dynamo Strike. On a success, the Strike deals an
additional 1d12 electricity damage to the target, as well as
1d4 electricity damage to up to two other foes within 10
feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your
dynamo Strike, you take 1d12 electricity damage. This counts
as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target
increases to 2d12, and the additional electricity damage to
the other foes increases to 2d4. Reduce the operational time
of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.
BEAST DYNAMO HOWL [two-actions]
FEAT 10
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Access You are from Arcadia.
You’ve incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your
dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying
creatures to enhance your prosthesis’s capabilities. The beast
parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful
attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check
to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don’t take a
penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that
doesn’t understand your language. Then, make a dynamo
Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo
by 1 hour.
GOLEM DYNAMO
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
Access You are an automaton or are otherwise from the
ancient Jistka Imperium.
You’ve learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses,
allowing you to incorporate golem components into your
dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. You gain a +1 status
bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo
Strikes become magical.
SOARING DYNAMO
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sterling Dynamo Dedication
You’ve built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo,
allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly
Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces
the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour,
measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a
given minute.
PROSTHETICS IN GOLARION
Prosthetics in Golarion don’t require membership
in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A
character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye,
hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as
5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that
are decorated with unique customizations or designs
available for a corresponding mark-up. For more
information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder
Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo
prosthetic technology presented here was created
through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis
inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint
system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral
in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that
increased how customizable the model was and sent
it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That
iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the
market in late 4721 ar. It has been widely applauded for
its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.

Trapsmith
Wielding a wrench or blowtorch, you manufacture snares
that whir and tick with delicate precision. Your best work
requires the right materials—a glorious set of brass fittings
and cogwheels—with which you create snares that are as
elegantly lethal as they are subtle. As a trapsmith, you’re
always improving your snares: adjusting timing, tweaking
triggers, and finding new ways to hide them from foes.
You can select the dedication feat for the trapsmith
archetype even if you haven’t yet gained three feats from
the snarecrafter archetype.
TRAPSMITH DEDICATION
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication or Snare Specialist
ranger class feat
You use glimmering gears and gnashing mechanisms to
manufacture snares using specialized parts. Your snares
include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears,
and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If
you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature
fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are
concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam
obscures its vision.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or
trapsmith archetypes.
GEAR GNASH
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication, expert in Crafting
Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are
quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to Disable
your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional
Thievery check in order to disable the snare. On a failed
check, while the snare doesn’t fully trigger, the grinding
mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal
to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure,
as normal.
PROPELLER ATTACHMENT
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication, master in Crafting
You’ve mastered attaching clockwork propellers to your daily
quick-deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to place
your snares in the air or underwater, where they remain in place
for up to 10 minutes, after which the propeller runs out of power
and they fall or sink. Unless you use additional precautions to
hide it, a propeller snare’s location is usually obvious.
RECYCLED COGWHEELS
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You’re able to scavenge the cogwheels from your daily
quick‑deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to
deconstruct a snare that didn’t trigger in order to set the snare
up somewhere else. Doing so takes the same number of actions
as setting the snare did. When you do, you recover the snare
and can deploy it in another location.
REPURPOSED PARTS
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your
snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy
snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of
the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily
preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that
you know how to Craft, even if you didn’t prepare that snare
during your daily preparations.
FINESSED FEATURES
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trapsmith Dedication
You’ve learned how to build snares that trigger based on
visual stimuli. When you construct a snare using gears,
you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of
a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only
be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only
activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger
it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on
creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures
smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise
satisfy the snare’s trigger as normal.

You can optimize your vehicle’s performance, coaxing extra
speed and choosing paths to avoid slowdowns.
When calculating your travel speed for the day
while piloting a vehicle, you can attempt a
Driving Lore check to increase your vehicle’s
travel speed. The DC is determined by
the GM but is typically based on the
vehicle’s piloting DC or a difficulty
based
on
the
environment,
whichever is harder. On a success,
increase your vehicle’s travel speed
by half. This has no effect on your
vehicle’s movement in encounters.

of your turn. If you critically succeed, this bonus
increases to +10 feet.
ROADKILL
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Trick Driver Dedication
Requirements You are piloting a vehicle.
In your hands, any vehicle is a weapon.
When you use Run Over, you can use
your class DC in place of the vehicle’s
collision DC. Your vehicle can Run
Over any number of creatures up to
one Size smaller than the vehicle or
ram any one target creature or object
in your path up to the size of your
vehicle.
DRIVE-BY ATTACK [one-action] TO [three-actions]	FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
FLOURISH
Prerequisites Trick Driver Dedication
Requirements You are piloting a

You can smoothly line up an attack
without disrupting your control. You Drive,
gaining the effects of the Drive action for the
same number of actions you spent to Drive-
By Attack. At any point during your vehicle’s
movement, you Strike.
USING VEHICLES
While many of the options in this book are uncommon
to allow you to insert the thematic elements into your
game as you see fit, there are some options you should
consider very carefully before including. This archetype
is one of them. Vehicles are relatively complicated and
can move very fast, which can make mapping encounters
quite difficult. They can also move characters too far
from the fight for other participants to respond. Think
carefully before deciding whether to include the trick
driver archetype, and make sure that vehicle use is right
for your campaign’s style and encounter area size.

Vehicle Mechanic
You have always felt that vehicles are as much works
of art as they are means of transportation. It doesn’t
matter if it’s as common as a chariot or as complex as
an airship, there’s always some aspect of the vehicle you
can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value
your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their
vehicles. While you can make a great profit working
on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep
a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal
passion project.
You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union,
working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair
jobs and support each other’s labor. While some vehicle
mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits
of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so
they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused
gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such
as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the
goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular,
vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow
union members seriously. While this might mean your
character becomes obligated to help a fellow union
member who needs your help, it also means you have
steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of
need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its
weight in gold.
VEHICLE MECHANIC DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Intelligence 14, trained in Crafting
You are adept at designing and maintaining mechanical
vehicles, and you lavish your attention and ingenuity on
one vehicle in particular. You become an expert in Crafting,
and you choose one vehicle you own—or your party owns
collectively—to be your signature vehicle: the vehicle you
spend time customizing to grant it various advantages.
You can spend 1 week of downtime with a new vehicle to
designate it as your signature vehicle instead. Due to your
amazing customizations and adjustments, pilots gain a +1
circumstance bonus to any piloting checks they make to
control your signature vehicle. If you are a master in Crafting,
this bonus increases to +2.
Special You cannot select another dedication feat
until you have gained two other feats from the mechanic
archetype.
ENGINE BAY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication, expert in Crafting
You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and
can work on many machines at a time. When Repairing and
spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If
you are a master in Crafting, you can fix up to four targets. If
you’re legendary in Crafting, you can fix up to eight targets.
This feat has no effect when using Quick Repair or another
ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
PATCH JOB
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You
gain the Improvised Repair general feat. When you use
Improvised Repair, you can attempt a Crafting check with the
same DC as Repair. If you succeed, you can use the object as a
normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as
a shoddy object of its type.

SUPERIOR PROPULSION
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
By experimenting with the effects of momentum gained from
your signature vehicle’s movement, you have learned to get
more from propulsion than just speed when the pilot pushes
the vehicle to its limit. Each time the pilot Drives your signature
vehicle as a 2- or 3-action activity and succeeds at the Piloting
check, the vehicle produces an additional effect, depending on
its method of propulsion. If your signature vehicle has more
than one propulsion method, the pilot can select which benefit
to gain each time they succeed at the Piloting check to Drive
the vehicle as a 2- or 3-action activity.
Alchemical The caustic runoff from the alchemical engines
is now weaponized. Creatures adjacent to your signature
vehicle when it begins its movement take acid damage equal
to your level.
Clockwork More resilient gears allow the vehicle to remain
functional, even when damaged. If your signature vehicle is
broken, it does not need to make the flat check to avoid losing
operating time.
Magical The residual magic from your signature vehicle
interferes with hostile spells. Pilots, crew, and passengers of
the vehicle gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against spells until the start of the pilot’s next turn.
Pulled You have eased the amount of effort needed for
those pulling your signature vehicle to move it. The vehicle
gains a +10 circumstance bonus to its Speed.
Rowed Reinforced ports protect the rowers below decks
from harm. Rowers of your signature vehicle who are
below decks have greater cover from attacks from outside
the vehicle and are not damaged when the vehicle takes
collision damage.
Steam The outlet of steam forms a cloud around the vehicle
as it moves. For the duration of its movement, your signature
vehicle is concealed.
Wind The draft of the wind helps the vehicle turn. During
this movement, your signature vehicle can turn normally,
rather than needing to move in a straight line as normal for a
2- or 3-action Drive.
EFFICIENT CONTROLS
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication, master in Crafting
By reducing redundant systems and streamlining essential
functions, you have made it easier for the vehicle to operate
with fewer crew. Reduce the number of crew required to
operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you
would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew
to 1 pilot and 6 crew. This adjustment only affects the number
of crew needed to operate the vehicle; it doesn’t reduce the
vehicle’s need for a pilot.
IMPERVIOUS VEHICLE
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
From armor plating and flexible components, to reinforced
materials and backup redundant functionality, you have built
safeguards to protect your vehicle from the rigors of combat.
Your signature vehicle gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC
and Fortitude saves, and increases its Hit Points by an amount
equal to twice your level.
MIRACULOUS FLIGHT
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
MAGICAL
Prerequisites Vehicle Mechanic Dedication
With superior engineering and magical application, you
have freed your signature vehicle from the bonds of gravity,
allowing it to soar through the sky like a dragon. The vehicle
gains magical propulsion and a fly Speed equal to its fastest
current Speed. If your signature vehicle already had a fly
Speed, reduce the distance the vehicle needs to make a
90-degree turn to half the usual length (typically half the
length of the vehicle).
UNIONS
Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those
who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most
other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions
to keep business practices fair and to protect each other
from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright’s
Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in
Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and
engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone
(LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of
the union, having been a member for more than 60
years. It is said that you can count on one hand the
number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which
she has never worked. The Shipwright’s Union manages
shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil’s Own and the
Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members
to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.
USING VEHICLES
The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where
the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that
the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign
on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic
archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen
the trick driver archetype. As mentioned on page 55,
vehicles are an element you should consider carefully
before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears
campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can
move very fast, which may make mapping encounters
quite difficult. They can also move characters too
far from the fight for other participants to respond.
Think carefully before deciding whether to include
the vehicle mechanic archetype, and make sure that
vehicle use is right for your campaign’s style and
encounter area size.

Three Innovations
While many of the items here contain their own unique
blend of engineering, science, and, sometimes, magic, three
major types of technology appear in several sections.
CLOCKWORK TECHNOLOGY
Clockwork technology is the least rare technology in
this book, though it’s still quite uncommon. Clockwork
represents, if not a majority of the new inventions, then
at least a plurality, spurred by cutting-edge research at
the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom and the return
of New Thassilon, which surfaced some of the secrets
of clockwork discovered by the ancient empire’s first
emperor, Xin. Most clockwork items need to be wound in
order to work, but aside from a few extraordinary devices,
the time and effort needed to wind up a clockwork item
are far less than the duration and magnitude of its effects.
STASIAN TECHNOLOGY
Stasian technology is the rarest of the three types, channeling
electricity from a limited supply of Stasian coils smuggled
