While most people can fire a gun or
crossbow, a gunslinger knows such
weapons better than anyone. From
reloading to customization, a gunslinger
demands more from their weapons,
though demanding too much can result in
a misfire. Gunslingers remain unrivaled in their
skill and accuracy with weapons that strike hard from afar.
NHALMIKA IRONSIGHT
Born and raised in Dongun Hold,
Nhalmika served as a skilled
vanguard for many years. Upon
retiring after the death of her spouse,
Nhalmika took the scattergun that had
served her so well during her service
and started a new chapter as an adventurer,
cheered on by her children.
Several regions on Golarion have developed their own
versions of firearms, their cultural and intellectual
traditions each shaping how these weapons are
beginning to spread throughout the globe. While
multiple cultures having their own techniques and
signature styles, guns are still incredibly scarce
worldwide. Despite their rarity, rifles and pistols
loom large in tales told throughout the Inner Sea,
thanks to the chronicles of the Pathfinder Society and
stories spread by other adventurers who have come
into contact with guns in battle or traveled through a
region where they are used. The following regions have
access to firearms.
Perhaps the most famous home for black powder
firearms on Golarion is the grand duchy of Alkenstar
(page 195). Located on the continent of Garund, this
primarily human duchy, along with their neighbors, the
dwarven sky citadel of Dongun Hold (page 190) produce
black powder and high-quality firearms, continually
perfecting their craft and supplementing the art of
gunsmithing with ancillary technologies like scopes for
long-distance sniping. For many years, Alkenstar and
Dongun Hold were the only reliable sources of firearms
found in the Inner Sea, but the ingenuity of the pirates
of the Shackles (page 217) has introduced a competing
market for those looking to acquire a black powder
weapon. Buyers must beware however, as the weapons
produced in the Shackles lack the quality and reliability
of firearms produced on the opposite side of Garund.
Alkenstar is a good place to encounter adventurers who
wield high-quality equipment, such as sniping duos or
demolitionists, while the Shackles is known for being
home to many types of pistol phenoms, who remain
quick to draw and fire at a moment’s notice.
The continent Tian Xia and the subcontinent Vudra
(page 220), have also traded in black powder for centuries,
though in relatively small amounts, with a focus more on
explosives than firearms. Nonetheless, merchants making
the cross‑continent trek from the trade ports in Tian Xia
on the eastern side of the continent to the Qadiran ports
far to the west will occasionally hire guards armed with
jezails or Tian mercenaries bearing hand cannons and
fire lances from their homelands. The demolitionist and
fireworks technician archetypes are relatively popular in
Tian Xia and Vudra due to the continents’ extremely long
histories with those uses of black powder.
On the western continent of Arcadia (page 206),
firearm technology has become more common and
more diverse than anywhere else in the world. That said,
firearms that use black powder are a substantially new
development in this region, having only recently been
smuggled halfway across the world from Alkenstar.
Instead, Arcadia is home to several of its own
distinct traditions of firearms, from beast guns, created
through ritualized hunts against mighty monsters
using magical taxidermic techniques, to the legendary
magical star guns that predated the apocalypse of
Earthfall. Aside from beast guns and magical guns
constructed to imitate the legendary star guns, the core
of basic firearms in Arcadia has been based on air gun
technology for centuries.
The most notable region of Arcadia to produce firearms
and firearm wielders is the central basin known as the
Deadshot Lands, which is also home to the few regions in
Arcadia that are beginning to use black powder firearms
in tandem with the traditional Arcadian arsenal. The
beast gunner archetype is a perfect match for Arcadian
characters focused on connecting with the magic of
their beast gun, and the spellshot class archetype is an
excellent fit with the storied Arcadian tradition of using
magical firearms. In this way, Arcadia is home to some
of the most diverse and magical traditions of gunslingers
in the world.

Guns &
GEARS
GUNSLINGER
While some fear projectile weapons, you savor the searing flash, wild kick,
and cloying smoke that accompanies a gunshot, or snap of the cable and
telltale thunk of your crossbow just before your bolt finds purchase. Ready
to draw a bead on an enemy at every turn, you rely on your reflexes, steady
hand, and knowledge of your weapons to riddle your foes with holes.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You strike from range with your firearms, seeking to defeat your opponents
before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you
might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever
realize you’re there, dash through a frenzied melee with pistols blazing, or
glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end
the conflict with a single, well-placed shot.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You
might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention
when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something’s amiss.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You scout the group’s position for incoming threats and help search for secret
doors and hidden passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.
IN DOWNTIME...
You might craft ammunition or keep your complex weapons clean and
maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents,
such as working as a blacksmith, engineer, or part of the local watch. You
might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence
that lingers between gunfights.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can
help build your reputation.
•	 Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to
keep you safe.
•	 Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of guns and
ammunition, along with curiosity about the latest in gun technology.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Assume that since you know how your gun works, you must also understand
how to resolve other mechanical challenges.
•	 Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your gun because
you lack any other skills.
•	 Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a gunslinger. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to those from your class at 1st level, you have
the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
GUNSLINGER’S WAY
All gunslingers have a particular way they follow, a
combination of philosophy and combat style that defines
both how they fight and the weapons they excel with. At
1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique
reload action called a slinger’s reload, and proficiency
with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater
deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats.
The gunslinger ways are described in detail on page 108.
The following ways are presented in this book.
Way of the Drifter: You wander across the battlefield,
equally at home in and out of the fray.
Way of the Pistolero: You carefully maintain your
distance at a duelist’s 10 paces with pistol in hand.
Way of the Sniper: You practice a methodical style of
shooting, striking from far cover.
Way of the Vanguard: You rely on a brutal combat
style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.
GUNSLINGER FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
gunslinger class feat.
SINGULAR EXPERTISE
You have particular expertise with guns and crossbows
that grants you greater proficiency with them and the
ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to damage rolls with firearms and crossbows.
This intense focus on firearms and crossbows prevents
you from reaching the same heights with other weapons.
Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with
weapons other than firearms and crossbows can’t be
higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would
increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons
to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the
weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have
gunslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you
have gunslinging legend, the limit is master.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you
gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
STUBBORN
3RD
You don’t like being told what to do, and you don’t
give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases
to expert. When you fail, but don’t critically fail, a Will
save against an effect that would give you the controlled
condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect

at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save,
the controlled condition ends, though any other effects
remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn’t allow
you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
GUNSLINGER WEAPON MASTERY
5TH
You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique
weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master
with simple and martial firearms and crossbows. Your
proficiency rank for advanced firearms and crossbows,
simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks
increases to expert. You gain access to the critical
specialization effects for firearms and crossbows.
VIGILANT SENSES
7TH
Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
for Perception increases to master.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
7TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
ADVANCED DEED
9TH
You’ve learned a powerful new technique of your chosen
way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you
chose at 1st level.
GUNSLINGER EXPERTISE
9TH
Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict
or resist. Your proficiency rank for your gunslinger class
DC increases to expert.
EVASION
11TH
You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions,
dragon’s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
GUNSLINGING LEGEND
13TH
You’ve learned unique techniques for wielding firearms
and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in a number of
gunslinger abilities.
Flourish: Flourish actions are actions that require too
much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You
can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Misfire: Firearms that are improperly maintained or
subjected to unusual strain can misfire. If you attempt
to fire a firearm that was fired the previous day or
earlier and hasn’t been cleaned since, roll a DC 5 flat
check before making your attack roll. If you fail this
misfire check, the weapon misfires and jams. The attack
is an automatic critical failure, and you must use an
Interact action to clear the jam before the weapon can
be reloaded and fired again. Once you’ve spent at least
an hour cleaning a weapon, you don’t need to roll for a
misfire until the next day unless an effect says otherwise.
You can clean multiple firearms during this hour, up to a
reasonable limit as determined by the GM (typically no
more than five).
Some abilities cause a weapon to misfire as a part of
their effects. If such a misfire happens as a result of an
attack (due to an action that causes a misfire on a failed
attack, for example), it retroactively makes the attack a
critical failure.
Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple
and martial firearms and crossbows and to master with
advanced firearms and crossbows. Your proficiency rank
for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed
attacks increases to expert.
MEDIUM ARMOR EXPERTISE
13TH
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
GREATER DEED
15TH
You’ve mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen
way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you
chose at 1st level.
GREATER WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
15TH
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
JUGGERNAUT
17TH
Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a
Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
SHOOTIST’S EDGE
17TH
You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency
107

way grants a series of deeds, access to feats, proficiency
with a skill, and a special reload action, all of which help
shape and influence the way you affect the battlefield.
The ways available to all gunslingers are described below.
WAY OF THE DRIFTER
You’re a wanderer traveling from land to land with your
gun and a melee weapon as company. Maybe you learned
to fight with blade and pistol as a Shackles pirate, mastered
the hand cannon and katana in Minkai, or practiced with
a hatchet and clan pistol in Dongun Hold. You win battles
by relying on mobility and flexible use of your weapons.
Slinger’s Reload Reloading Strike
Deeds Initial Into the Fray; Advanced Finish the Job; Greater

Way Skill Acrobatics
Slinger’s Reload
RELOADING STRIKE [one-action]
GUNSLINGER

hand, and your other hand either wields a one-handed
melee weapon or is empty.
You make a melee attack and then reload your gun in one

don’t need a free hand to reload in this way.
Initial Deed
INTO THE FRAY [free-action]
GUNSLINGER
Trigger You roll initiative.
You know trouble can lurk around every corner, and your
hands never stray far from your holsters. You can Interact
to draw a one-handed ranged weapon and can then Interact
to draw a one-handed melee weapon. As your first action
on your first turn, you can Stride as a free action toward
an enemy you can perceive. If you can’t perceive any
enemies or can’t end your movement closer to one,
you can’t use this Stride.

15th
DRIFTER’S WAKE [three-actions]
GUNSLINGER
You drift across the battlefield, striking down foes as you
go. You Stride, and you can Strike up to three times at any
points during your movement. Each attack must target a
different enemy and must be made with a one-handed firearm,
crossbow, melee weapon, or unarmed attack. Each attack
counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple
attack penalty doesn’t increase until you’ve made all your
attacks. Your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
WAY OF THE PISTOLERO
Whether you’re a professional duelist or a pistol-twirling
entertainer, you have quick feet and quicker hands that
never seem to let you down, and an equally sharp wit and
tongue that jab your foes. You might leave a hand free or
cultivate the ambidexterity for twin weapons. Either way,
you stay close enough to your enemies to leverage your
superior reflexes while leaving enough space to safely fire.

GRIM SWAGGER [two-actions]
AUDITORY

GUNSLINGER
MENTAL
LINGUISTIC
Requirements You have a one-handed firearm or one-handed
crossbow visibly worn or wielded.
You attempt to clear the room by promising a grim fate to
anyone who doesn’t do what you say, and quickly. Attempt a
Deception or Intimidation check against the Will DCs of each
creature within 30 feet, except for your allies. Regardless
of whether you succeed or fail, each subject is temporarily
immune to your Grim Swagger for 10 minutes.
For example, if you attempt a Deception check, you lie
and boast about your prowess or the large group of friends
on their way to back you up. If you attempt an Intimidation
check, you promise everyone in the room that you’re going to
be the last thing they see.
Critical Success The creature becomes frightened 3. If it’s
lower level than you, it’s also fleeing for 1 round.
Success The creature becomes frightened 2.
WAY OF THE SNIPER
You practice a style of shooting that relies on unerring
accuracy and perfect placement of your first shot. You
keep hidden or at a distance, staying out of the fray and
bringing unseen death to your foes.
Slinger’s Reload Covered Reload
Deeds Initial One Shot, One Kill; Advanced Vital Shot; Greater
Ghost Shot
Way Skill Stealth
Slinger’s Reload
COVERED RELOAD [one-action]
GUNSLINGER
You duck into a safe position or minimize your profile while
reloading to make your next attack. Either Take Cover or
attempt to Hide, then Interact to reload. As normal, you must
meet the requirements to Take Cover or Hide; you must be
INTERACTING TO RELOAD
The slinger’s reload action from each gunslinger way, as
well as many feats, give the ability to Interact to reload
a weapon. This is enough to reload a weapon that takes
1 Interact action to reload, but only provides one of the
Interact actions needed to reload a weapon with reload
2 or greater. As normal, you can provide the remaining
Interact actions separately.

prone, benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you
to Take Cover, and you need to be benefiting from cover or
concealed to a creature to Hide from that creature.
Initial Deed
ONE SHOT, ONE KILL [free-action]
GUNSLINGER
Trigger You roll Stealth for initiative.
Your first shot is the deadliest. Interact to draw a firearm
or crossbow. On your first turn, your first Strike with that
weapon deals an additional 1d6 precision damage. This
precision damage increases to 2d6 at 9th level and 3d6 at
15th level.
Advanced Deed
9th
VITAL SHOT [two-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Your careful shot against an unsuspecting opponent pierces
a vital artery or organ. Make a ranged Strike. If the target is
flat‑footed, the Strike deals an extra die of weapon damage,
and the foe takes persistent bleed damage equal to the
amount of precision damage from your One Shot, One Kill.
Greater Deed
15th
GHOST SHOT [one-action]
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
Make a firearm or crossbow Strike. If you’re hidden from
or undetected by the target, the Strike adds the additional
precision damage from One Shot, One Kill; if you would
already receive that additional damage on the Strike, the
effects aren’t cumulative. If you were undetected or unnoticed
by any creatures, you’re now hidden from them instead, as the
origin of the attack is clear.
WAY OF THE VANGUARD
You practice a unique combat style originated by dwarven
siege engineers, using heavy weapons with wide attack
areas to blast holes through enemy lines, clear an opening
for your allies, and defend the conquered territory.
Slinger’s Reload Clear a Path
Deeds Initial Living Fortification; Advanced Spinning Crush;
Greater Siegebreaker
Way Skill Athletics
Slinger’s Reload
CLEAR A PATH [one-action]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a two-handed firearm or
two‑handed crossbow.
You push outward with your weapon to clear some space
before quickly reloading a fresh round. You make an Athletics
check to Shove an opponent within your reach using your
weapon, then Interact to reload. For this Shove, you don’t
need a free hand, and you add the weapon’s item bonus on
attack rolls (if any) to the Athletics check. If your last action
was a ranged Strike with the weapon, use the same multiple
attack penalty as that Strike for the Shove; the Shove still
counts toward your multiple attack penalty on further attacks
as normal.
Initial Deed
LIVING FORTIFICATION [free-action]
GUNSLINGER
Trigger You roll initiative.
You can posture defensively with firearms or crossbows, acting
like a walking tower. Interact to draw a firearm or crossbow. You
then position that weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC until the start of your first turn, or a +2 circumstance
bonus if the chosen weapon has the parry trait.
Advanced Deed
9th
SPINNING CRUSH [three-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or loaded
crossbow.
You go into a vicious spin, smashing your weapon into those
nearby and increasing your momentum by firing. All creatures
adjacent to you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus your
Strength modifier; this increases to 2d6 if your firearm has a
striking rune, 3d6 if it has a greater striking rune, and 4d6 if
it has a major striking rune. This ability does not apply other
effects that increase damage with your firearm Strikes such as
weapon specialization. Creatures affected by this attack must
attempt a basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save is
also pushed 5 feet directly away from you.
Greater Deed
15th
SIEGEBREAKER [two-actions]
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a firearm that has the kickback
or scatter trait, or a two-handed crossbow.
With unbelievable force, you charge and smash your weapon
into a target before digging in your heels and pulling the
trigger. Leap or Stride, then make a Strike with the required
firearm or crossbow against an adjacent target. This Strike
deals an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage and ignores 10
points of the target’s Hardness (if any), or of their shield’s
Hardness if the target uses Shield Block.
After the Strike, you become immobilized and position the
required weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus
to AC, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the chosen weapon has
the parry trait. Both effects last until the start of your next
turn. If a force would move you while you’re immobilized in
this way, it must succeed at an appropriate check against your
class DC.

wielding a crossbow and Interact to reload it, including
Interact actions as part of your slinger’s reload and similar
effects, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the damage roll
on your next Strike with that crossbow. As normal, this isn’t
cumulative with the +1 circumstance bonus from singular
expertise. If the crossbow is a simple crossbow, also increase

in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon.
You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to

FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Trigger A creature you can see attempts a ranged Strike
against you.
You fling yourself out of harm’s way. You Leap. Your movement

MUNITIONS CRAFTER
FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
Bullets and bombs can be scarce in some parts, so you’ve
learned to make your own. You become trained in Crafting
and gain the alchemist’s infused reagents class feature (Core
Rulebook 72), gaining a number of reagents each day equal to
your level. You also gain the Alchemical Crafting feat and four
additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items.
You gain infused reagents (a pool of reagents usable to make
alchemical items) and advanced alchemy (allowing you to make
alchemical items during your daily preparations without the
normal cost or time expenditure). You gain batches of infused
reagents per day equal to your level, which you can use to
create only bombs or alchemical ammunition. Your advanced
alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn’t increase on
its own. If you use a batch of infused reagents to create basic
level-0 ammunition such as black powder cartridges or black
powder doses, you produce 10 rounds of ammunition.

FEAT 1
GUNSLINGER
You’re comfortable wielding a firearm or crossbow in one hand
and a melee weapon in the other, combining melee attacks
with shots from the firearm. When you make a successful
ranged Strike against an enemy within your reach with your
one-handed firearm or one-handed crossbow, that enemy is
flat-footed against your next melee attack with a one-handed
melee weapon.
When you make a successful melee Strike against an enemy
with your one-handed melee weapon, the next ranged Strike
you make against that enemy with a one-handed firearm or
one-handed crossbow doesn’t trigger reactions that would
trigger on a ranged attack but not a melee attack, such as
Attack of Opportunity. Either of these benefits is lost if not
used by the end of your next turn.

PISTOL TWIRL [one-action]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites trained in Deception
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed ranged
weapon.
Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your
opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks.
You Feint against an opponent within the required weapon’s
first range increment, rather than an opponent within melee
reach. If you succeed, the foe is flat-footed against your melee
and ranged attacks, rather than only your melee attacks. On
a critical failure, you’re flat-footed against the target’s melee
and ranged attacks, rather than only its melee attacks.

WARNING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 2
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
Who needs words when the roar of a gun is so much more
succinct? You attempt to Demoralize a foe by firing your
weapon into the air, using the firearm’s maximum range rather

–4 circumstance penalty if the target doesn’t share a language
with you.
4TH LEVEL
ALCHEMICAL SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You have an alchemical bomb worn or in one
hand, and are wielding a firearm or crossbow in the other.
You’ve practiced a technique for mixing alchemical bombs
with your loaded shot. You Interact to retrieve the bomb
(if it’s not already in your hand) and pour its contents onto
your ammunition, consuming the bomb. Next, Strike with
your firearm. The Strike deals damage of the same type as
the bomb (for instance, fire damage for alchemist’s fire),
and it deals an additional 1d6 persistent damage of the
same type as the bomb. If the Strike is a failure, you take
1d6 damage of the same type as the bomb you used, and
the firearm misfires.
The persistent damage increases to 2d6 if the bomb is 11th
level or higher, or 3d6 if it’s 17th level or higher.
BLACK POWDER BOOST [one-action] OR [two-actions]
FEAT 4
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.

If both attacks hit, combine their damage and then add
any applicable effects from both weapons. You add any
precision damage, only once, to the attack of your choice.
Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances
and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when
calculating your multiple attack penalty.

10TH LEVEL
CALLED SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
You target a specific area of your foe’s anatomy to debilitating
effect. Declare a part of your foe’s anatomy to target and make
a ranged weapon Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target
takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you
targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline
when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy—for instance,
applying the “arms” effect to a creature’s tentacles if those are
what the creature uses to attack.
•	 Arms The target is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next
turn. On a critical hit, it’s also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

damage from the fall.
DEFLECTING SHOT [reaction]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An ally within the first range increment of your firearm
or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You’re always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon
or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The

a sufficient difference.
PENETRATING FIRE [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
You blast a bullet through one foe and into another. Choose two
targets, one of which would give the other lesser cover against
your ranged attacks. Make a single ranged Strike with the

lesser cover the nearer target provides the other. Roll damage
only once and apply it to each creature you hit. Penetrating Fire
counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty.

FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm or loaded
crossbow in one hand and a bludgeoning or slashing melee
weapon in the other.
You hurl your melee weapon at an opponent, then fire a bullet
into the weapon’s hilt, making it deal additional damage and
bounce back to your grasp. Make a thrown ranged Strike with
the melee weapon, then a ranged Strike with your firearm.
Both Strikes use the same multiple attack penalty. If the melee
115

PAGE 117
================================================================================

weapon doesn’t already have the thrown trait, it gains the thrown 10 feet trait during
a Rebounding Assault.
If both attacks are successful, the bolt or bullet hits the thrown melee weapon instead
of your target, adding its force into one attack. Combine the damage from both Strikes,
using the thrown weapon’s damage type, and add an additional 1d6 precision damage.
The impact sends the melee weapon rebounding off the target and back to your hand.
In any circumstance other than both attacks hitting, carry out the individual Strikes
normally. The thrown weapon doesn’t rebound and remains in the target’s space as
normal for thrown weapons.
REDIRECTING SHOT [reaction]
FEAT 10
FORTUNE
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An ally misses with a ranged attack that uses a thrown weapon or
ammunition. The ally must be willing to accept your assistance, you must see the

or standard cover.
TRICK SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 10
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded crossbow or firearm.
You shoot not at your foe but at an object nearby. Make a Strike with your firearm
against an AC equal to an easy DC for your level (Core Rulebook 504). On a success,
instead of hitting your foe, your attack hits an object behind or to the side of your
target, creating one of the following effects. The GM might determine that a different
AC is appropriate or that a particular effect isn’t a valid option, such as using the
explosive barrel option when there’s no such object on the battlefield. The GM should
inform you if a Trick Shot is feasible before you spend your actions, since your trained
eye can easily recognize loose or volatile objects.
•	 Dislodge Object Your attack knocks an unattended object of no more than 2
Bulk out of position, moving it up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. For
example, the weapon could knock a wizard’s crystal ball off a table.
•	 Explosive Barrel Your attack strikes a barrel of expensive rum, a vial of volatile
alchemical fluids, a demonic pustule erupting from the earth, or some other
explosive object. The object explodes in a 20-foot burst, and creatures in the
area take 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The
damage type is chosen by the GM, based on the exploding object. Increase the
damage by 1d6 for every 2 levels you have above 10th.

heads (such as ettins) might survive the destruction of a head.
SHOWSTOPPER
FEAT 14
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Pistol Twirl, master in Deception
Your twirling weapons create a grand distraction that’s difficult to look away from.
When using Pistol Twirl to Feint, you can target all enemies within your weapon’s
first range increment who you can perceive and who can see you. You roll one
Deception check and compare it against each target’s Perception DC.
TWO-WEAPON FUSILLADE [one-action]
FEAT 14
FLOURISH
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding two weapons, each in a different hand. At least one of
these weapons must be a loaded firearm or loaded crossbow.
You attack with both your weapons in a furious barrage. Strike twice, once with
each weapon.
16TH LEVEL
FATAL BULLET
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
You’re especially talented at striking your enemies in their most vulnerable areas.
When you critically hit with a fatal firearm, you deal an additional die of the
appropriate size and damage type for the fatal trait after doubling the weapon’s
damage. For example, after getting a critical hit with a fatal d12
weapon, you add an additional 1d12 damage to the
attack after doubling its damage.
HAIR TRIGGER
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites initial deed that allows you to Interact to draw a weapon
No one can react faster than you can pull your trigger. When using your initial deed,
instead of Interacting to draw a weapon, you can Strike with a firearm or crossbow
you’re already wielding. If this Strike hits, the target is also flat-footed until the end
of your first turn of the encounter.
Special If your initial deed allows you to Interact to draw a weapon more than
once, this feat allows you to replace one of these Interact actions and use the other
one to draw a weapon. You can’t replace both Interact actions with Strikes, but you
SAMPLE GUNSLINGER
SNIPER
You favor long-range guns and
powerful shots taken while hiding at a
safe distance.
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Dexterity. Wisdom can
improve your Perception and make
your stubborn class feature even
more effective, while Intelligence can
give you access to a broader array of
skills you can utilize from your perch,
away from the thick of battle.

can draw a loaded firearm or crossbow with one of the actions
and immediately shoot it with the other.
INSTANT RETURN [reaction]
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Trigger An enemy misses you with a ranged attack using a
type of ammunition appropriate to your weapon (a bullet if
you’re wielding a firearm).
Requirements You’re wielding an unloaded firearm or
crossbow.
With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the
air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker.
Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make
a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering
opponent. Since you’re using the foe’s ammunition, this Strike
applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for
instance, if it was explosive ammunition, it would explode in a
burst of fire if your Strike hits).
RICOCHET MASTER
FEAT 16
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Ricochet Shot
You have an eye for angles and can find shots that others
believe are impossible. When using Ricochet Shot, you can
bounce your bullet off up to two solid surfaces within your
weapon’s first range increment instead of just one.
In addition, a creature is flat-footed the first time you attack
it with a Ricochet Shot during an encounter.
18TH LEVEL
FINAL SHOT [three-actions]
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Requirements You’re wielding an unloaded firearm.
You jam a triple charge of black powder into your weapon to
unleash a devastating but risky and inaccurate attack. Interact
to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition
to your normal black powder or ammunition, then Strike with
your firearm against a creature within the weapon’s first
range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a
critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires.
Regardless of your roll, after the attack you’re flat-footed until
the start of your next turn and stunned 1.
PIERCING CRITICAL
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Your attacks with your preferred weapons deal especially
devastating wounds. When you Strike with a firearm or
crossbow for which you have legendary proficiency, you
critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die, as long as that
result is a success.
UNERRING SHOT
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Your senses are finely tuned to the slightest variations in
the air, so much that you can place your shot exactly where
you intend to aim it from any range possible with your
weapon. When attacking with a ranged weapon in which
you have master or greater proficiency, ignore the penalty
from its range increment. (The weapon’s maximum range is
unchanged.) In addition, if your target has cover against your
attack with such a weapon, it doesn’t gain the bonus to AC
if it has lesser cover, gets only the bonus of lesser cover if
it has standard cover, or gains only the bonus of standard
cover if it has greater cover.
REACH FOR THE STARS
FEAT 18
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Black Powder Boost
The sky’s the limit, as long as you’ve got enough black powder.
When you use Black Powder Boost, you can expend additional
black powder or ammunition to boost yourself farther. For
each dose of black powder or piece of firearm ammunition you
spend in addition to your shot, you add another 10 feet to the
height or distance of your Leap, to a maximum of 5 boosts (a
+50-foot status bonus). You must be wearing a dose of black
powder or piece of ammunition, or have it in hand, to detonate
it for a boost.
You can choose at which points in your Leap you detonate
each boost, allowing you to change direction each time. You
must then move in a straight line until you boost again or end
your Leap.
20TH LEVEL
PERFECT READINESS
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
You prepare to fire with an instinctive speed and muscle
memory that go beyond your conscious thoughts. You’re
permanently quickened. You can use your extra action only to
Step or Interact to reload.
RICOCHET LEGEND
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
Prerequisites Ricochet Master
The more obstacles between you and your target, the deadlier
your shots become, as you ricochet off multiple surfaces to hit
them. When using Ricochet Shot, your shot can bounce off of
any surface within your weapon’s first three range increments
and the target can’t benefit from cover unless they have total
cover on all sides.
In addition, a creature must attempt a Will save against
your class DC the first time in an encounter you attack it
with a Ricochet Shot. If it fails, it’s stunned 2 and is unable to
determine where your shot originated.
SLINGER’S REFLEXES
FEAT 20
GUNSLINGER
Your ability to react to unexpected circumstances is
preternaturally sharp. At the start of each enemy’s turn, you
gain an additional reaction you can use on only that turn to
use a gunslinger reaction.

Guns &
GEARS
Guns and the people who use them remain uncommon
in the world of Golarion, as the technology required to
produce firearms and black powder is limited to a few
technological strongholds scattered across the globe.
Despite their rarity, or perhaps because of it, firearms
leave a lasting impression on those who witness their
destructive power and startling impact. Residents of
the Inner Sea from outside of the Impossible Lands
who behold a gunslinger or other wielder of firearms in
action might undertake a pilgrimage to Alkenstar and
attempt to negotiate with the Alkenstar Gunworks in
order to obtain one of these unusual but potent weapons
for themselves.
Even people who never see or obtain a firearm might
have a compelling reason to take these options, however.
Crossbows are vastly more common than firearms but
serve a similar purpose and can be put to many of
the same uses. An artillerist leading a cannon team in
Alkenstar might have a counterpart in Taldor who uses
similar abilities with catapults. The sniping duos who use
their arquebuses to guard the walls of Alkenstar from
monsters in the Mana Wastes are not terribly different
than the elven archers who patrol the forests of Kyonin
and brave the demon-haunted swamps of Tanglebriar.
In the islands of the Shackles, pirate captains fight with
swords and pistols while their crew, most of whom can’t
afford a rare and expensive handgun, might use the same
combat style with a similar weapon such as a crossbow
or hand crossbow.
While firearms are still relatively rare in the Inner
Sea, the stories they inspire and the combat styles that
incorporate them have spread faster than the technology
itself. Snipers, drifters, weapon performers, and more
have a place in Golarion that is larger than the impact
of firearms alone. Even if your world or region doesn’t
include guns, there might be options perfect for your
next character in this section. The options presented here
can add new choices and exciting abilities for characters
of any campaign world, regardless of the setting’s
technology level.
CHARACTER OPTIONS
A sniper without a spotter is like a sentry without a spyglass. Sure, you might catch a few
enemies, but you’ll miss more threats than you’ll ever see on your own. I knew that going
after the bandits, but I went anyways. Was I supposed to just let them take everything
from me and hope they didn’t do it again to the next family? Absolutely not.
Things started out well enough. Tracked them down by the trail of bloody footprints and
careless tracks they left from my farm to their camp. I found a nearby spot overlooking
the camp from a small bluff. They probably set up there knowing it’d make it harder
for anyone to see the smoke from their fires, or for people like me to sneak up on them.
Fortunately for me, the top of that bluff was as close as I needed to be.
I saw my shot when the bandit who killed my boy stood up in the middle of the camp
to make some speech. Don’t know what he was planning on saying, but my statement
was loud and clear when Alessandra roared like an angry dragon and put a lead round
clean through him. Reload, aim, fire. Reload, aim, fire. Two more down, but a pair of
them got clear and started climbing the sides of the bluff. Should I focus on the bandits
who were still in my field of fire or give up my position to deal with the ones coming at
my flanks? Rough spot, hard choice. That’s the kind of thing a spotter would’ve been real
helpful for. Should’a had someone watching my back. Ah, well. Reload, aim, fire.
—Griestly Peppercorn, retired shield marshal
WHY NO GUN PROFICIENCY?
While most of the character options in this section
provide benefits that are particularly useful or even
specifically tailored for firearms, remarkably few of
them outside of the gunslinger give a firearm-specific
proficiency progression. You might be asking yourself
why that is and there’s a very simple answer: for the vast
majority of characters, it isn’t necessary.
Just like knives, swords, spears, and every other
category of weapon, firearms come in simple, martial,
and advanced variants. As long as a character has
access to firearms (page 148), they’re also likely to have
a selection of firearms with which they are already
proficient. Additionally, many of the character options in
this section work equally well with crossbows as they
do with firearms. This means the options in this chapter
automatically support whichever category of weapons
(simple, martial, or advanced) your character knows how
to use.

COMMON BACKGROUNDS
The following common backgrounds are particularly
appropriate for characters that interact with guns,
areas that have guns, and gun-related themes. While
the backgrounds are listed as common for an area with
themes of guns and gears, and their mechanics and story
impact aren’t likely to require a discussion with your
GM or the other players, many of them still might not
be thematically appropriate for regions and campaigns
that lack these themes. Thus, be sure to discuss with your
group before using these backgrounds in a campaign
without any guns to ensure that your expectations
match those of the other players.
BACK-ALLEY DOCTOR
BACKGROUND
You’re the medic many turn to when a more official clinic or
healer might not be available. You may specialize in stitching
up bullet wounds or have a standing, confidential deal with
a criminal syndicate to provide your services any time of
day or night. In either case, you’ve perhaps turned to the
adventuring life because a former client is unhappy with
your work or members of the local constabulary have been
asking too many questions.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the
Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Risky
Surgery (Advanced Player’s Guide 208) skill feat.
CANNONEER
BACKGROUND
You served as a crewmate aboard a military
vessel or pirate ship and were responsible for
the use and maintenance of the ship’s cannons. A
strong back and quick reflexes were equally
important to you in your duties, and you know
your way around explosives and the dangers
that lie therein. These skills serve you well in
your new life as an adventurer, as compared
to the weight of a cannon, a gear load that
makes your allies blanche just makes you
laugh instead.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must
be to Dexterity or Strength, and one is a free
ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the
Warfare Lore skill. You gain the Hefty Hauler
skill feat.
DEPUTY
BACKGROUND
While your life may have taken some twists
and turns in the intervening years, you were
once deputized as the lawful protector of
a community. While the role was temporary
and you’ve since turned in your badge, that
responsibility shaped you. Whenever a community is in
trouble, and the sheriff is nowhere to be found, residents call
on you to capture a criminal, rescue the mayor’s offspring
from bandits, or go toe to toe with outlaws.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Hunting Lore
skill. You gain the Experienced Tracker skill feat.
FIREWORKS PERFORMER
BACKGROUND
Few celebrations in Tian-Xia are complete without a show of
fireworks, and your job is to make sure they go off without a
hitch. You load the fireworks, set the fuses, and choreograph
the performance, bringing the show together in a finale of
lights and explosions. Then it’s time to pack up your gear
and move on to the next civic holiday or religious festival.
Of course, someone who travels the roads with a pack full
of high explosives is bound to run into an adventure or two
along the way, and so over time, your fireworks have been
spent in support of that life.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Engineering
Lore skill. You gain the Fascinating Performance
skill feat.
GUNSMITH
BACKGROUND
From a young age, you apprenticed to an
experienced gunsmith and over time your skill
and knowledge rose to match that of your master.
Today, you can easily repair, modify, or improve
nearly any firearm you’ve seen before, and even if
you haven’t seen it, you’ll break it down to learn about
what makes it tick in no time.
You’ve taken those skills on the
road, using them to assist yourself
and your allies as an adventurer
when it comes to maintaining their
weapons, shields, armor, and more.
Choose two ability boosts. One of
these boosts must be to Intelligence or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the
Engineering Lore skill. You gain the Quick
Repair skill feat.
HIRED KILLER
BACKGROUND
Your life truly began after your first kill.
Maybe you killed in self-defense, maybe
it was a crime of passion, or maybe it was
just an accident and you were a kid in the
wrong place at the wrong time. In the end,
the why doesn’t matter. You got away with it.
And then you found that maybe it didn’t bother
you as much as it should have. And maybe, just

maybe, you had a talent you could use to forge a life for
yourself. A blood-soaked talent and a blood-soaked life,
sure. But it’s yours.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Strength
or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore
skill. You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat, choosing a terrain
appropriate for where you make your kills.
FARMSTEADER
BACKGROUND
You built your house using wood from the trees surrounding
it. Raised it up from the dirt and called it home. You thought
that it would be where you would grow old and die. But
despite your best efforts, you were wrong. The land that
once gave you food fell fallow, and dust took to the air and
choked the livestock. Now you wander the world as an
adventurer. Are you in search of a new place to settle down
and try again, or have you become disillusioned by your old
dreams, leading you to seek out a new purpose?
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Farming Lore
skill. You gain the Forager skill feat.
JUNK COLLECTOR
BACKGROUND
You live by the adage that one person’s trash is another’s
treasure. Whether by sifting through scrap heaps or
digging up old battlefields, you remain on the lookout for
lost or discarded objects that you might be able to turn into
something useful. More often than not, what you find is just
junk... but you’re convinced that one of these days, you’re
going to hit the jackpot. You’ve even taken up adventuring
as a means to supercharge your access to all sorts of junk,
gear, and loot.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and your choice of
either the Engineering Lore or Mining Lore skill. You gain the
Crafter’s Appraisal skill feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 204).
SALOON ENTERTAINER
BACKGROUND
All you want to do is entertain the people, but sure enough,
bad news seems to follow you. Gunfights, brawls, robberies,
and more befall establishments you play at, and word is
quick to spread. Keep one town ahead of the gossip, and you
just might be able to play a gig, command a stage, or run a
table again.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or
Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Performance skill and a lore skill of
your choice. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat.
SPOTTER
BACKGROUND
An eye for detail, a sense for the wind, and a strong trust in
your gut feelings. These qualities have set you apart from
others when it comes to assisting a sharpshooter with setting
up the perfect shot against their target. Elevation, velocity,
and concealment—these are all vital factors that need to be
considered to pull off a feat of true marksmanship, and no
sniper would be able to function without an experienced
spotter. Since your younger days, you’ve put your skills as
a spotter to work as an adventurer. Whether you’re taking
your own shots now or spotting for others, your talents
grant you an edge in an adventuring career.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Stealth skill and the Scouting Lore
skill. You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat.
UNDERTAKER
BACKGROUND
People die. This is the unfortunate fact of life on which
you’ve founded your business, because wherever people
die, there is a demand for mortuary services. You might be
a Pharasmin priest or a secular professional, but your job
is seeing to the body, comforting the bereaved, and making
sure that the deceased goes to their ultimate reward with all
due dignity. Of course, someone in your position sees a lot of
strange deaths, and chances are one of them set you on the
road to adventure.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and a Lore skill
specializing in one local type of undead. You gain the Forensic
Acumen skill feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 206).
WANDERING PREACHER
BACKGROUND
While you once spoke to a small congregation in a
ramshackle church, those days are behind you now. Your
church was destroyed, your congregants scattered, and now
you meander the lands holding a worn copy of your religious
text in one hand, and a fiery conviction in the other.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to
Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Religion skill and a Lore skill
associated with the deity you preach for (such as Pharasmin
Lore). You gain the Pilgrim’s Token skill feat (Advanced
Player’s Guide 208).
WASTE WALKER
BACKGROUND
Whether you grew up in the Mana Wastes or another
similarly desolate place, you quickly learned that only the
strong survive. You and your family were forced to evade
monsters, mutants, wild magic, and worse, as each new day
heralded the possibility of a danger or threat you’d never
seen before. You learned to adapt to the worst possible
conditions and how to forage and survive in a place few
others would dare to live.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Strength
or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Survival skill, and Mana Wastes Lore
(or another similar Lore skill associated with the wastes
where you grew up). You gain the Forager skill feat.

================================================================================

UNCOMMON BACKGROUNDS
The following backgrounds are uncommon, typically
because they require a character to be a member of an
organization, own a current residence in a particular
settlement, or a maintain a level of social status or
responsibility that you should discuss with your GM
and group first.
For instance, the rank of a judge or sheriff grants
social status and judicial power with the area of your
appointment, so it’s appropriate to check with your
GM and group to ensure the stories and adventures
everyone wants to tell make sense with a character
possessing those titles, and determine how prominent
the associated locales will be to the campaign.
ALKENSTAR OUTLAW
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re an outlaw whose first crime was stealing the guns
from Alkenstar’s Gunworks which allowed you to commence
a crime spree of epic proportions. You don’t know where
your road ends, but it’s probably going to be a bloody affair.
The life of an adventurer might even be a relief compared
to a life forever on the run from Alkenstar authorities and
their allies.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to Dexterity
or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Thievery and Underworld Lore. You gain
the Subtle Theft skill feat.
ALKENSTAR SOJOURNER
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You came to Alkenstar because you heard they had guns,
but you stayed because of the atmosphere. Or the guns.
Either way, journalism and scientific curiosity opened the
door to a life of adventure. Now you continue to adventure
in the Alkenstar area, using your skills to deal with
whatever situations present themselves.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Society and Engineering Lore. You gain
the Streetwise skill feat.
CIRCUIT JUDGE
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re a circuit judge, a courtroom on horseback who serves
a group of communities out in the Mana Wastes or a similar
backwoods region. You show up every couple of months, hear
the cases that have piled up since your last visit, give verdicts,
and then it’s on to the next town in your itinerary. It’s not the
easiest life in the world, but it’s an interesting one, and you
hear some mighty strange cases. Chances are, it was one of
those cases that set you on the road to adventure.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Deception and Legal Lore. You gain the
Lie to Me skill feat.
GOLDHAND ARMS DEALER
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You’re a dwarven agent of the Goldhand Lodge, a collection
of dwarven merchants based out of Dongun Hold who
seeks to sell guns far and wide. High King Anong Arunak
hasn’t expressed approval for such a method of distribution
yet, but in the meantime you’re still out and about,
talking up your wares and occasionally providing visceral
demonstrations of the overwhelming stopping power of
your firearms. These demonstrations and sales have given
you a taste for adventure, and the constant threat of piracy
has convinced you of the importance of adventuring with
a group.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Diplomacy and Mercantile Lore. You
gain the Group Impression skill feat.
PRESS-GANGED
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
Was it five shots or six? It doesn’t really matter in the
end, because after those nice folks bought all your drinks,
you woke up on the lowest rung of the ladder. Whether a
crewmate on a ship, a conscript in an army, or something
worse, you’ve nowhere to go but up. This background
generally requires buy-in with the entire group to tell
a story allowing you to play a character starting their
adventuring due to circumstances outside their own
control. However, you can also play a character who was
once press-ganged and has since escaped that life. If you
do, press-ganged doesn’t have the uncommon trait, and it
has the same mechanical effects either way.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Labor Lore
skill. You gain the Armor Assist skill feat (Advanced Player’s
Guide 203).
SHERIFF
BACKGROUND
UNCOMMON
You hold an official title of sheriff or deputy in a small
community. Those that would do harm to others flee your
gaze, for they know it brings the promise of castigation.
You protect your town, watch over those who have placed
their trust in you, and make sure those that would do
others harm are brought to justice.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Hunting
Lore skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat.

While most backgrounds are available to any character,
some backgrounds are so unusual that just having them
makes a character rare and extraordinary.
These rare backgrounds can give a player a significantly
different roleplaying experience by setting their character
up with a history or legacy beyond the norm, situated in
a special position within the narrative. Your character’s
background is an intrinsic part of where they come from
and not something they earn during the game. Rare
backgrounds should be chosen only after a discussion
with the GM as to whether one would apply for a
particular character in your group’s game.
OTHERWORLDLY MISSION
BACKGROUND
RARE
You’re called to serve a specific purpose—your deity told you
so, and so it must be true. Maybe you grew up knowing all
along, or maybe it came to you one day in a vision, clear as
a bell and twice as loud. You have some task that only you
can accomplish. You mission might be as dangerous as
killing a deadly tyrant or as simple as opening a particular
door on a particular day.
You should work with your GM on how to handle the
truth of your character’s backstory or leave it to the GM
to decide in secret. Is this call to action a message from the
character’s own mind, are they being manipulated by some
manner of supernatural entity, or are they actually getting
marching orders from one of the deities of the setting?
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Religion. Once per adventure, you can ask
the voice you believe to be a deity for orders and get some kind
of instruction—you never get any kind of explanation, simply a
command to go somewhere or do something. Following those
commands isn’t always safe, but it’s usually interesting.
REVENANT
BACKGROUND
RARE
You died. No real doubt about that. Bullet to the brain or knife
to the throat, you were dead as dead can be. Then you got
back up again. Maybe you had some unfinished business, or
maybe you were just so tough and so mean that Hell itself
spat you out. Either way, you came back for a reason.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Religion and Boneyard Lore. You’re still
alive, not undead, but you have the negative healing ability,
which means you’re harmed by positive damage and healed
by negative effects as if you were undead.
TALL TALE
BACKGROUND
RARE
You’ve ridden a tornado, lassoed a river, mooned a dragon under
RARE BACKGROUNDS
a full moon, and shot six zombies with one bullet. That’s what
the stories say, anyway, and even if people don’t strictly believe
them, they are curious about you. Certainly, the stories keep
spreading, and it would appear that you either have a unique
destiny or are trying to convince the world that you do.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Performance. You gain the Impressive
Performance skill feat. You can gain the Connections skill
feat later without being expert in Society or having Courtly
Graces—this represents less traditional social connections
and more the way that your legend has spread, and you’ve
learned to leverage your legend, with people wanting to
meet you and see you for themselves.

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in several archetypes.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in it for some time. A stance lasts until you’re
knocked unconscious, until its requirements (if any) are
violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter
a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take
an action with the stance trait, you can’t take another
one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in
encounter mode.
ARCHETYPES
While gunslingers are especially known for using firearms,
various other sorts of characters use them too, and you
might find the gunslinger class isn’t the perfect fit for your
character concept. Archetypes allow you to expand the
scope of your character’s class.
Applying an archetype requires you to select
archetype feats instead of class feats. Start by finding the
archetype that best fits your character concept and select
the archetype’s dedication feat using one of your class
feat choices. Once you have the dedication feat, you can
select any feat from that archetype in place of a class
feat as long as you meet its prerequisites. The archetype
feat you select is still subject to any selection restrictions
on the class feat it replaces. For example, if you gained
an ability at 6th level that granted you a 4th-level class
feat with the dwarf trait, you could swap out that class
feat only for an archetype feat of 4th level or lower with
the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you gain in place of a
class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you
select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy
its requirements before you can gain another dedication
feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat
by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s
list. You can’t retrain a dedication feat as long as you
have any other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another
feat, such as the alchemist’s basic concoction feat. You
must always meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain
in this way.
Additional Feats
Some archetypes allow other feats beyond those in their
entry. These are typically class feats, such as fighter
feats that represent certain combat styles. The list of
additional feats includes the feat’s name, level, and the
page number where it appears. You can take the feat
as an archetype feat of that level, meaning it counts
toward the number of feats required by the archetype’s
dedication feat. When selected this way, a feat that
normally has a class trait doesn’t have that class trait.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t
select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you’re a
member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
fighter can’t select the Fighter Dedication feat).
Guns Archetype List
The following archetypes each allow you to build a
character with strong ties to gears and gadgets.
•	 The gunslinger multiclass archetype (page 127)
adds some gunslinger options to characters of any
other class.
•	 The artillerist archetype (page 128) launches powerful
attacks from siege weapons and heavy artillery.
•	 The beast gunner archetype (page 130) forms a
mystic bond with a powerful beast gun, gaining
spells and magical abilities in the process.
•	 The bullet dancer archetype (page 132) performs
a unique form of martial arts focusing on various
uses of firearms.
•	 The demolitionist archetype (page 133) sets
explosives that trap foes and demolish edifices.
•	 The fireworks technician archetype (page 134)
launches fireworks for a variety of interesting
special effects.
•	 The pistol phenom archetype (page 136) combines
flashy pistol work with a powerful personality to
take control of any situation.
•	 The sniping duo archetype (page 138) teams up with
a spotter of their choice in order to gain benefits
helping both the sniper and their spotter.
•	 The spellshot class archetype (page 140) adds
magical options to the gunslinger class.
•	 The unexpected sharpshooter archetype (page 142)
is either incredibly lucky or secretly extremely
skilled. Whichever is the truth, such a character
always seems to hit their targets and dodge attacks
as if propelled forward by some uncanny power.

Artillerist
“Load Pathfinders, load! That fey-blighted moth will be
coming around for another pass quick as a blink and
if we don’t meet it with a rain of cannon fire, you’ll be
wishing you had a diving suit like mine. Steady the aim
there! Steady... fire!”
—Khoumrock Blackthorne, captain of the Unsinkable
and self-proclaimed slayer of “giant evil moth gods.”
The artillerist’s maxim holds that while fights might
be won with swords, battles are won with cannons.
Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults,
hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat
engineers’ corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the
penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need
to operate on a small scale. You’re a consummate
professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging
mathematics and manpower to transform whatever
castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon
offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.
You’re not just some daredevil demolitionist, though.
You’re part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with
your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness.
Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next
round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine’s
next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence
on the team ensures their chances of success are
maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the
sum of its parts.
ARTILLERIST DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in martial weapons
Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew
has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might
just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin
could cause the whole thing to explode. You’ve taken these
lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team
assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon’s
deployment and usage. If you’re serving on a siege weapon
crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the
weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the
weapon’s aim twice as far as normal.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you’ve gained at least two other feats from the artillerist
archetype.
NAMED ARTILLERY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege
weapon most important to them and closest to
their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon
is their livelihood. You’ve gone a step further,
and you always make sure that your named
artillery has the best possible maintenance and
upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and
working on a single siege weapon to designate
it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you
designated as your named artillery gains a +2
circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and
Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice
your level.
During your daily preparations, you must spend at least
one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery.
If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a
new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery
loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist
can designate a particular siege weapon as their named
artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same
siege weapon’s crew (though it’s typically more efficient
for a group with several artillerists to divide them up,
assigning one to each siege weapon).

Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with
a very specific minimum number of members designed to
ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable
and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon.
In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people,
provided you know what you’re doing. You can operate a siege
weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an
increasing penalty. You and your crew take a –2 penalty to
checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for
each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number
of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this
feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew
size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take
a –10 penalty when doing so.
CANNON CORNER SHOT
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can
make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other
siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally
contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon’s
loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a
line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a
10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns
into a 10-foot burst).
FIELD ARTILLERY [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one
place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a
gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact
with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed
by 10 feet for one round.
LIVE AMMUNITION
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot
out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use
the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it’s
more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs
or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer
demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires
two additional Load actions, which you must conduct
personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or
restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon
must be physically capable of firing the creature in question,
based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas
don’t qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which
require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and
onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the
weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot
square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to
its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.
MASTER SIEGE ENGINEER
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
What you don’t know about artillery isn’t worth knowing and
your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of
actions as part of a siege weapon’s crew. You’re permanently
quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch
a siege weapon.
LEADING WITH A CANNON
A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their
skills in that field certainly shouldn’t be underestimated.
When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of
knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle,
but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and
a few good siege weapons can make the difference
between prolonged months of battle with countless lives
lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths
and a more lasting victory.
Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding
land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all
vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on
the military might of either side, but on a castle’s ability to
withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers
capable of penetrating a castle or keep’s defenses, the
occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as
they have enough food and water to keep their citizens
and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been
“won” when the besieged force manages to last through a
single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break
down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold
weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor
hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an
opportunity to impact their opponents.
An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely
rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on
the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the
besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist
hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult
stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling
down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their
opponents have brought siege weapons, especially
powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons,
will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even
started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be
staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but
not thwarted without outside intervention.
Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow,
might take things a step further, specifically targeting
granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting
food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town
near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle,
so too does the morale of the castle’s inhabitants and
defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it
hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops
mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.

Beast Gunner
The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred
to as “beast guns” (page 154) is truly ancient, with the
first iterations of the weapons created on the continent
of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that
beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting
in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets
have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing
beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into
the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare
as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige
associated with star guns has allowed more people access
to equivalent destructive power without the intense
requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast
gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.
The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the
full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with
multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking
to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand
new weapon made after they hunt down the creature
themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the
beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature.
Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored
to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the
prospective beast gunner. However, it’s also possible to
bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the
generations by adding symbolic fresh components from
the same kind of creature, after performing the same
ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the
intent of establishing a bond.
To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner
must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding
to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand
new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun.
Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five
assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who
help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants
are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature,
or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood
a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the
bonding process and the hunt and organic materials
are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of
the hunter. The same doesn’t apply if the prospective
beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are
significantly more powerful than the creature, such that
the creature never stood a chance against them in a one
on one fight.
You’re one of those who successfully completed the
hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you
seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think
they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.

The beast gun also acts as a conduit, drawing out and
amplifying any latent or active magic power you have. You
learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell
activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your
choice, from either the arcane or primal spell list. You choose
this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list
or from other spells you have access to on the list. This cantrip
must require a spell attack roll. You’re trained in spell attack
rolls and spell DCs for arcane or primal spells, whichever of
the two traditions you chose. Your key spellcasting ability for
these spells is Charisma.
If you already cast arcane or primal spells from spell slots,
you learn one additional cantrip from that tradition. If you’re a
prepared caster, you can prepare this spell in addition to your
usual cantrips per day; if you’re a spontaneous caster, you add
this cantrip to your spell repertoire.
You also gain Spellsling.
Spellsling [three-actions] Requirements You’re wielding your bonded
beast gun; Effect You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions
to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the
spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the
beast gun you’re wielding. Make a Strike with that beast
gun. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your
attack roll result to determine the effects of both the
Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the
purposes of determining your multiple attack penalty, but
you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed
resolving the attack and spell.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve

You create a direct magical connection with your beast gun,
allowing you to guide the beast gun’s next shot by taking
control of the projectile directly, steering it through the air,
and swerving and veering it to continue to hit target after
target. Make a beast gun Strike against a creature within the
first range increment. On a hit, the shot tears through the
target and continues toward another target you can see. You
make a Strike against this new target. The new target must be
no farther from the previous target than a distance equal to
the beast gun’s range increment. For example, the new target
must be within 150 feet of the previous target when attacking
with a drake rifle. On a hit, you can direct the bullet toward a
new target.
You can continue to make Strikes against new targets in
this same way until your attack misses, at which point your
shot dissipates. You can’t make a Strike against a target
you already attacked during this use of Controlled Bullet,
but you can otherwise continue to make attacks against
valid targets until you miss. Each attack counts toward
your multiple attack penalty, but don’t increase your
penalty until you’ve made all your attacks.

CHOOSING YOUR BEAST GUN
A beast gunner’s bond with their beast gun is deep and
mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner,
it’s important to choose a beast gun that suits your
temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if
you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is
the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be
optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the
battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow
and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close
range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can
be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun
has a personality and magical abilities that attract people
who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast
gunners say the weapon chooses you.

and weaknesses, and this damage ignores
an amount of the object’s Hardness equal
to your level. Any creatures adjacent to the
hazard take the bombs’ splash damage, also
combined for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses. As a reminder, since you
didn’t throw the bombs, Calculated
Splash and similar effects don’t
apply. Making sure your timing
is correct requires concentration,
so you can’t Set Explosives again
while you’re waiting for a previously
set bomb to detonate.
Special You can’t select another
dedication feat until you’ve gained two
other feats from the demolitionist
archetype.
SAFETY MEASURES
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
You’re often careful to be sure you’re not
hoisted on your own petard, or anyone
else’s, for that matter. When you have cover
from a bomb, you gain resistance to damage
caused by that bomb equal to half your level,
plus a value equal to the circumstance bonus to
AC granted by the cover. You gain these benefits
against your own bombs regardless of whether
you have cover.
EXPLOSIVE ENTRY [two-actions]
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites
Demolitionist
Dedication,
master
in
Engineering Lore
You know exactly how to make a memorable entrance... by
detonating a bomb to produce a devastating explosion, of
course! You Set Explosives on a door, window, container,
or heavy gate. When the explosives detonate, you can
attempt an Engineering Lore check to Force Open the
target. If a bomb would add an item bonus to attack rolls,
add that item bonus to your Engineering Lore check. Since
you’re blasting your way in, you can’t avoid breaking the
object or structure. If you roll a critical success, you get a
success instead.
CONTROLLED BLAST
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication; Calculated Splash,
Directional Bombs, or Expanded Splash
You maximize the effectiveness of your explosives
by controlling every possible parameter of the
blast meticulously. If you have the Directional
Bombs feats, you can use it with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge, even though you didn’t throw
the bombs. If you have the Calculated Splash
or Expanded Splash feats, you can apply the
additional splash damage to one of the bombs
when you Set Explosives or use Demolition
Charge, and you can apply the increased
splash area from Expanded Splash to all
the bombs.
COLLAPSE WALL [reaction]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Demolitionist Dedication
Trigger A creature moves into the bombs’
splash area.
Requirements You’re within 30 feet of an area
where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or
similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or
Demolition Charge.
You detonate the required bombs in order
to bring a wall down on a creature. If
your bombs deal enough damage to
reduce the wall’s Hit Points below its
Broken Threshold, the wall partially
collapses on the creature. The creature
takes bludgeoning damage equal to the
damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex
save; the DC for this save is equal to
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is
higher). On a failure, they must spend an
Interact action to dig themselves out of
the collapse, and on a critical failure,
they must spend 2 Interact actions
to do so.

Firework Technician
The brilliant display of cascading lights and flickering
aerial flowers, the thunderous boom, the sizzling crackle,
and piercing screech—these are the stock and trade
of your craft. You know how to perfectly pair light
and sound to create fireworks displays that can amaze
children and adults, comfort friends, and even confound
your foes.
As a fireworks technician, you might be an itinerant
wanderer, roaming from town to town and developing
your craft on your own. In that case, you make a living
on the road, selling fireworks to the townsfolk, setting
up public displays upon request and receipt of payment,
and even tailoring individualized performances to those
wealthy or interesting enough to be worthy of receiving
their own private show.
 On the other hand, you might be part of an established
fireworks house from Tian Xia or Vudra and rely on
teamwork to perfect your various formulas and displays.
Hoping to produce the next great innovation in fireworks
technology, you often send back the notes from your
studies and field demonstrations to esteemed colleagues
from your fireworks house, seeking their opinions on
your next big idea.
FIREWORK TECHNICIAN DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
DEDICATION
DEDICATION
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You’ve learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom
using black powder, metals, and paper. You most likely came
by this knowledge through formal training with a fireworks
house in Tian Xia or a fireworks company from Vudra, though
perhaps you mastered fireworks completely by yourself after
finding a secret stash in an old shipwreck.
You become trained in Fireworks Lore or become
an expert if you were already trained in it. You
gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, a pool of
infused reagents equal to your level, and advanced alchemy
(allowing you to make alchemical items during your daily
preparations without the normal cost or time expenditure).
You can use your infused reagents only to make fireworks,
Launch a Fireworks Display, and use other feats from this
archetype (see below). Your advanced alchemy level is 1.
The rules for these are in the Alchemical Crafting section
on page 258 of the Core Rulebook, and rules for infused
reagents and advanced alchemy are on page 72. If you gain
infused reagents from more than one source, you use the
highest number of reagents to determine your pool rather
than adding them together.
You can also create special fireworks displays using your
infused reagents, designed to create distinctive effects you can
use to make onlookers marvel and even to gain an advantage
in combat. You gain the Launch Fireworks Display action and
learn some basic displays, and you can learn additional, more
complex displays through other firework technician feats.
The DC for any display is equal to your class DC or spell DC,
whichever is higher.
Launch Fireworks Display [one-action] to [three-actions] (see below); (manipulate);
Cost 1 or more batches of infused reagents; Requirements
You have a free hand; Effect You set off a fireworks display.
You can launch a normal firework to simply create a visual
or audible signal within 20 feet or you can choose one of
the following special effects. A firework display has the
listed traits, and if it costs more than 1 batch of infused
reagents, it is noted in its Cost entry.
Comet [one-action] (visual) You shoot a streak of shining light in a
60-foot line. All spaces in that line are lit with bright light
until the start of your next turn. As part of this action,
you can also Point Out a single creature in the line, and
your allies do not need to hear or understand you.
Flower [one-action] (visual) You ignite a ring of sparks, creating a shape
that might be reminiscent of a flower blooming in the sky.
Each enemy with 20 feet of you must attempt a Fortitude
save. On a failure, the enemy is dazzled for 1 round, and on
a critical failure they are dazzled for 2 rounds.
Salute [one-action] (auditory) You create a startling bang or whistle,
adding an auditory component to your fireworks display.
When you launch a salute display, you can choose a
confused or fascinated ally within 60 feet. If the ally you
chose is fascinated, the noise is so violent that it acts as a
hostile effect for the purpose of their fascinated condition
(though it has no negative repercussions) automatically
ending most applications of the fascinated condition. If
they’re confused, the sound is so loud and violent that it
might snap the ally out of confusion. They can immediately
attempt the flat check to remove the confused condition
which normally occurs when a creature is damaged. If the
confused condition has special rules that remove the flat
check when taking damage or make the flat check harder,
those rules also apply to the salute.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until
you’ve gained two other feats from the fireworks technician
archetype.

COUGHING DRAGON DISPLAY
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering
trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate
your audience’s attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly
effective use in combat, suppressing auditory or visual effects
behind your magnificent display. You gain the Coughing
Dragon fireworks display.
Coughing Dragon [two-actions] Cost 2 batches of infused reagents;
Effect Choose either auditory or visual effects. The display
gains that trait, and you attempt to counteract one or more
effects within 60 feet that have this trait. On a success, the
effect is suppressed until the start of your next turn, rather
than ending entirely. Use your Fireworks Lore modifier
as your counteract modifier, and your counteract level is
equal to half your advanced alchemy level (rounded up). A
coughing dragon costs 2 batches of infused reagents rather
than 1, but you can increase the cost to 3 batches and spend
an additional action to create an even bigger coughing
dragon display that attempts to counteract both auditory
and visual effects at the same time.
EXPERT FIREWORKS CRAFTER
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication, expert in

You’re particularly adept at crafting fireworks, allowing you
to create much more powerful fireworks than you otherwise
could. Your advanced alchemy level for fireworks increases to
your level – 3.
JUMPING JENNY DISPLAY
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
This multi-sequence rocket blasts confetti at a series of
altitudes. While the design is intended to delight children
of all ages, you’ve found it has an unexpected side effect
of confounding enemy fliers. You gain the Jumping Jenny
fireworks display.
Jumping Jenny [one-action] Cost 2 batches of infused reagents; Effect
Target a flying creature within 60 feet. Until the start of
your next turn, each time that creature attempts to Fly,
they must succeed at an Acrobatics check to Maneuver in
Flight against the DC of your fireworks display, or the Fly
action is disrupted. If all the creature’s attempts to Fly are
disrupted, at the end of its turn, it falls harmlessly to the
ground below. A jumping jenny costs 2 batches of infused
reagents, rather than 1.
GOBLIN JUBILEE DISPLAY
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and
devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest
goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that,
while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical
health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You
gain the Goblin Jubilee fireworks display.
Goblin Jubilee [three-actions] (fire, sonic, visual) Cost 3 batches of
infused reagents; Effect Chaos fills a 20-foot burst within
120 feet. All creatures in the area takes 3d6 fire damage
and 3d6 sonic damage and must attempt a Fortitude save.
A goblin jubilee display costs 3 batches of infused reagents,
rather than 1.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is dazzled and deafened until the end
of its next turn and takes half damage.
Failure The creature is dazzled and deafened for 1 minute
and takes full damage.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round, dazzled
and deafened for 1 minute, and takes double damage.
BANSHEE CRY DISPLAY
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Firework Technician Dedication
You’ve learned how to pull off a sudden noisemaker at just
the right moment in your display, a technique that can disrupt
precise wording. You gain the Banshee Cry fireworks display.
Banshee Cry [reaction] Trigger A creature within 30 feet Casts a
Spell that has a verbal component or Activates an Item
using a command Activation; Effect You set off a firework to
explode with a loud screech near the creature. The creature
must attempt a Will save.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature must use an additional action on the
triggering action or activity, or it’s disrupted.
Critical Failure The triggering action is disrupted.
DESCRIBING YOUR FIREWORKS DISPLAY
As a firework technician, the exact visuals of your
character’s special abilities might matter significantly to
you. No two firework technicians use exactly the same
fireworks display, even if they come from the same
fireworks house and both use the same feat to generate
the display. In fact, it’s likely that when you use a feat
from the firework technician archetype, the resulting
display remains a bit different each time as you tinker,
perfect, and refine your technique. Even so, you probably
have a few themes that you prefer for each of your
firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing
Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine
shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering
trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric
shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a
shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree
blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you
can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what
your character is doing, you might come up with some
go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your
favorite displays.

Pistol Phenom
“You saw what I can do, so you know I’m telling the
truth when I say that I don’t miss. That was just a
warning shot. Now if you’d kindly empty out that coffer
into my bag of holding, I don’t see any need for this to get
unpleasant... do you?”
—Unidentified pistol-twirling half-elf desperado, just
before absconding with the funds a corrupt Alkenstar shield
marshal planned to use to bribe a judge.
You treat combat as an art and your pistol as an extension
of your performance. You might wield a single pistol, a
pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to
pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though,
the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial
to your technique and style.
To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun
as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents
but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into
doing what you want them to do. While others tend to
focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as
possible, your style is all about control. By controlling
a foe’s attention and actions, you can bolster your own
attacks and mitigate the foe’s potential for mayhem. You
control the tempo of the battle much as you would a
staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe’s actions
don’t fall outside of your intended script. You’re both
the director and the star of this show, and your enemies
dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes
quite literally!

This otherwise serves as Pistol Twirl for the purpose of
meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn’t count
as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting
Pistol Phenom Dedication’s special entry and taking another
archetype. Whenever you Feint with a one-handed firearm,
you can choose to attempt a Performance check instead
of a Deception check.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until

phenom archetype.
GUNPOWDER GAUNTLET [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed firearm.
Your flair keeps foes’ attention, as your motions with your gun
draw your foes into a deadly game. As you toy with them and
performatively brandish your weapon, you build their tunnel
vision, leaving them trapped in a perceptual gauntlet of your
own making. Attempt a Performance check against the Will
DC of a single target within your one-handed firearm’s first

HOT FOOT [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
Using a carefully aimed shot, you make a creature “dance.”
You shoot at the ground near a target’s feet, causing
them to react involuntarily; even mindless creatures have
unconscious responses to dodge an attack, and you can
capitalize off those uncontrollable reflexes to achieve your
aim. As they dance to the sweet tune of your pistol’s retort,
you ensure your foe can’t use whatever nasty surprise they
had planned in store for you and your allies. Make an attack
roll against the Reflex DC of a target creature within your
firearm’s first range increment.
Critical Success The creature can’t use reactions, is flat-footed,
and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves. These
effects last until the start of its next turn.
Success The creature can’t use reactions until the start of its

PHENOM’S VERVE
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
You’re possessed with an incredibly vivacious spark that
separates you not only from ordinary gun users and
gunslingers, but even from other phenoms. Using that
distinctive verve, when you perform impeccably and control
the scene with your abilities, you also manage to set up your
foes for disaster and ensure they remain in your sights for
any follow-up attacks you want to make against them. If you
critically succeed at a Performance check for Pistol Twirl or a
pistol phenom archetype feat, you gain a +1 status bonus to
your attack rolls with one-handed firearms and one-handed
melee weapons until the end of your turn.
REACH FOR THE SKY [two-actions]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
VISUAL
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded firearm.
You command the room, firing a gun into the air and ordering
everyone to surrender and put their hands in the air. You
fire your firearm and then attempt a single Intimidation
check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet. Creatures
who become frightened instinctively put their hands in the
air. If they had Raised a Shield, they lose the benefits, as
they raise the shield above their head where it’s of little use
to block attacks. With their hands in the air, each of these
frightened creatures can’t use reactions or free actions that
require their hands, or items held in their hands, until the
beginning of their next turn. Regardless of the result, each
creature is then temporarily immune to Reach for the Sky
for 1 minute.
WHIRLING KNOCKDOWN [two-actions]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Pistol Phenom Dedication
Requirements You’re wielding a loaded one-handed firearm
and a one-handed melee weapon.
You fire your gun while throwing off a target’s balance with
your melee weapon. Then, you topple your foe to the ground
with the quick orchestrated combination. You don’t need
to use brute force to do so, or even necessarily to hit with
your gunshot; the effect is all about performing perfectly and
eliminating your target’s movements and options, leaving
them no choice but to fall.
Make a ranged firearm Strike against a creature within the
reach of your melee weapon and then attempt a Performance
check against the creature’s Reflex DC. If the Strike critically
succeeds, the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its
Reflex DC against this check. The Performance check has the
following effects.
Critical Success The target falls and lands prone. It takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Success The target falls and lands prone.
Critical Failure Your plans backfired on you, and you’re forced
to drop your melee weapon in your space.
WHAT MAKES A PHENOM?
Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or
intimidate a foe, but it’s not just your skills that make
you a phenom, it’s your style and attitude. As a pistol
phenom, you understand how to grab everyone’s
attention with everything you do, especially the way
you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your
gun. But what’s more, you’re well aware of that fact and
the power you have over others, and you aren’t afraid
to flaunt it.
Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol
phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of
allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to
protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they
get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be
other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms
gather in the same group, it’s almost inevitable for a duel
or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not
end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that
of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating
rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong
friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your
greatest achievements to compare exploits.

Sniping Duo
Skilled shooters who don’t let their egos get in the way of
their efficacy are likely to say that sniping is a two-person
job. Taking down a target without giving away your
position or giving the opponent a window for reprisal is
difficult work that requires teamwork and coordination,
as well as a tight-knit bond and shared perspective. Sniping
duos live and die by the credo “two heads are better than
one,” focusing their skills and strategies toward deadly
efficiency. Whether your spotter and partner is a fellow
ranged combatant or a melee enthusiast, you’ve learned
how to use the openings they provide to devastating effect.

SNIPING DUO DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in at least one type of weapon in the
bow or firearm groups, trained in Stealth
When you take this dedication, choose one willing,
non-minion ally to act as your spotter. As part of your
training in this archetype, you train your spotter in the
necessary habits and techniques to use your abilities
automatically; your spotter doesn’t need to spend any feats
of their own to grant the effects. You only gain the benefits
of your Sniping Duo archetype feats if both you and your
spotter are alive and conscious. You and your spotter don’t
grant your foes lesser cover against one another’s Strikes.
Whenever you or your spotter successfully Strikes a target,
the other member of your duo gains a +1 circumstance
bonus per weapon damage die on the damage roll of their
next Strike made against that target before the end of their
next turn.
You can change your designated spotter by spending 3
days of downtime training with another ally.

can see the target of your attacks, you don’t take a penalty
for attacking within your weapon’s second range increment.
The penalty you take for firing into further range increments
is –3 for the third range increment, with an additional –2
penalty for each additional increment beyond the third (–5
for the fourth range increment, –7 for the fifth, and –9 for
the sixth).
EXPLOIT OPENING [reaction]
FEAT 6

Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
Trigger Your spotter critically succeeds at a Strike against a
creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon’s
first range increment.
You take advantage of your spotter’s devastating attack to
unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged Strike
with a –2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to the Strike.
TARGETED REDIRECTION [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You aim a shot at your spotter, intending for your spotter
to redirect that shot off their own weapon or shield to hit
your foe from a better angle, and avoid your foe’s cover.
If your next action is to make a ranged Strike, you treat
your spotter’s position as your own for the purposes of
determining cover and range. Your spotter must be within
your weapon’s first range increment and they must use a
reaction to redirect your shot.

With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially
accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon Strike against a foe
either within your spotter’s melee reach or the first range
increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On
this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack
roll and ignore the target’s concealment. If you’re using a

required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.
VANTAGE SHOT
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter take advantage of each other’s attacks
to momentarily hide and throw your foes off-balance against
your follow-up attack. When you successfully make a
ranged Strike against a foe, your spotter can use a reaction
to attempt a Stealth check against the foe’s Perception DC.
On a success, the foe is flat-footed against the spotter’s next
attack before the end of your spotter’s next turn. Similarly,
when your spotter successfully makes a ranged Strike
against a foe, you can use a reaction to attempt a Stealth
check against the foe’s Perception DC. On a success, the foe
is flat-footed against your next attack against them before
the end of your next turn.
TAG TEAM [reaction]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
Trigger You or your spotter misses with a Strike against
a creature, and the creature is within the other’s melee
reach or first range increment.
Your skilled teamwork with your spotter enables you both
to assist one another when you falter, using either other’s
failures as opportunities to strike. If you used Tag Team after
your spotter missed the triggering Strike, make a ranged
Strike against the same target with a –2 penalty. If you used
this reaction after you missed the triggering Strike, your
spotter can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged
Strike against the same target. Strikes granted by this feat
don’t count toward your or your spotter’s multiple attack
penalty and your or your spotter’s multiple attack penalty
doesn’t apply to the granted Strike.
EAGLE EYES
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
AUDITORY
VISUAL
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one
another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither
of you is flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking
creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level
or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help
their allies flank.
CONCENTRATED ASSAULT
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sniping Duo Dedication
You and your spotter combine your efforts to bring down your
target. If you and your spotter both use the Ready activity
to make a Strike against the same opponent and choose the
same trigger for the readied action, resolve your attacks at
the same time. Each of you can use the higher of the two
attack rolls for your Strikes, each using your own modifier;
this is a fortune effect. If both attacks are successful, total
the damage for both attacks for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses.
CHOOSING A SPOTTER
The most important aspect when choosing a spotter
for the sniping duo archetype is the out of character
component; make sure you team up with another
player who is excited about the idea of roleplaying
out teamwork and coordination in combat, and with
granting you benefits and gaining benefits from you. The
mechanics of the archetype are not very demanding of
your spotter’s actions, but that still doesn’t mean every
player is interested in the narrative component.
Mechanically, a good spotter is likely either another
ranged attacker or a melee attacker, and depending
on the type of spotter you choose, certain feats might
become more or less enticing. For instance, Targeted
Redirection is more useful with a melee spotter.

Spellshot
(Class Archetype)
Rarity Uncommon
Spellshots aren’t ordinary gunslingers. They come from
a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they
temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots
combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create
a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots,
enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the
world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots
tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code
and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive
crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns,
the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts
of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together
by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that
defined how one should behave while using these powerful
weapons. You can find more information about star guns,
the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code on page 206.
Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as
the stories describing the relevant skills and training to
become one have been passed down over the generations.
Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these
tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques
to channel magical energy through their firearms in
imitation of the Regents’ arcane methods. While Arcadia
is home to the vast majority of the world’s spellshots, the
techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However,
spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea
region due to the unique history of guns there and their
connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists
in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.
WAY OF THE SPELLSHOT (1ST)
You’ve learned the intricacies of magic and technology,
blending the two together with deadly results. You
combine a knowledge of arcane theories with a strong
connection to your chosen weapon that allows you to
manifest unique effects, though your knowledge doesn’t
extend as far as actual spellcasting. You can imbue
energy into your weapon and conjure bullets from thin
air. As you progress, you eventually learn to phase bullets
through walls or even to teleport yourself along the path
of your bullets. You must select Spellshot Dedication as
your 2nd-level class feat.
Prerequisites: You must be a gunslinger.
Spellshot Adjustments: Instead of choosing a way
from the options listed in the gunslinger class, you have
the way of the spellshot. It has the following way skill,
slinger’s reload, and deeds. You gain these abilities at the
same levels as normal for the class. You use Intelligence
for your class DC.

“Oh would you look at that, there’s a bunch of bullet
holes around here... so that’s what all the ruckus was
about! Six... seven... eight of you, huh? Oh, but did you
notice the northern finch over there in that tree a minute
ago? Its nest is up there, but I think all those gunshots
startled it. You think you could quiet down so maybe it’ll
come back?”
–Viri, gnome ornithologist, just before a series of
strange accidents mysteriously took down a hardened
bandit squad of eight former Alkenstar veterans.
Some people say you must be the luckiest soul in all of
Golarion to still be alive and kicking after all the dangers
you’ve seen. Others say that, given the circumstances
and the number of foes who you’ve defeated seemingly
by accident, that there’s no way you can really be as
incompetent as you seem. These critics claim there has
to be some kind of angle, some racket you’re running.
Either way, you sure don’t look or act dangerous, except
possibly to yourself.
Somehow, despite your apparent clumsiness, professed
confusion, and known propensity to incite calamity, you
find yourself standing after every battle. The same can’t
often be said for your enemies. Funny how that works

Dedication
Frequency once per hour
Requirements Your previous action was a ranged weapon
Strike that missed a foe within 60 feet.
Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction
that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet
knocks your foe’s weapon away or they stumble over stray
debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a Deception
check to attempt to Shove, Trip, or Disarm the foe you missed.
CHAIN REACTION [three-actions]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Unexpected Sharpshooter Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You fire your gun once, creating a devastating and
unpredictable chain of events; perhaps your bullet strikes
exactly the right spot on a water tower, causing it to
flood and incite a stampede of horses which knock over a
lantern that sets a city on fire. Whatever the exact chain
reaction, and no matter how improbable, the indiscriminate
catastrophe creates significant challenges for your enemies
across a wide area while leaving everyone else alone.
Make a Strike with a ranged weapon, and if you hit, you
can make another Strike at a target within 30 feet of the
first target. If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a
third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on,
continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at
any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack.
However, you can’t target the same creature more than once;
each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you
haven’t made a Strike against yet during this particular use of
Chain Reaction.
This damage is caused by some improbable set of events
that injures one target after another, rather than from
actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree
branch that then fell on the targets, or one target’s scream
caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot
themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target
suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical
ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes
the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage
is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However,
the GM might choose to change the damage type based on
their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one
target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage
instead of physical damage.
SKILLED OR LUCKY?
Part of the fun of roleplaying an unexpected
sharpshooter is the ambiguity and mystery of how
your character achieves their surprising success. Your
character at first seems like they bumble into their
successes through sheer circumstance. However, when
the circumstances pile up, others might start to suspect
another possibility: perhaps your character is secretly
so incredible that they not only achieve impressive
results but do so in a way that hides their skill behind
a veneer of lucky breaks. Ultimately, either could be
true about your character, or some combination of
both. You might decide the truth together with the GM
as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until
later to make that call. Because this archetype hints at
hidden talent intentionally obfuscated, it offers a good
choice for a character who’s secretly more powerful or
skilled than they seem or who must hide their abilities
for some reason—perhaps associated with the plot of
the campaign.
If your inclination is to play a character who hides
their abilities, consider training in the Deception
skill and taking skill feats like Charming Liar and
Confabulator that emphasize your character’s crafty
nature and skill at concealing their true intent.
If you instead prefer to play a character who’s
legitimately a bit uncoordinated but abnormally lucky,
you might choose to pursue actions that have a high
chance of earning you a Hero Point. You could also
consider taking abilities with the fortune or misfortune
traits, such as Halfling Luck or Harbinger’s Caw.

Black powder weapons have many permutations
throughout history, from simple, handheld affairs
built for self-defense to mighty cannons designed
to blast holes in castle walls and fortifications. In
the world in which you, the reader, live, the history
of firearms followed a meandering course around
the globe, developing in a slow and uneven arc with
many dead-ends and tributaries of varying success and
longevity. On Golarion, a world of spells and myths,
creatures and cataclysms, this developmental arc is
even more diverse, with unexpected leaps forward and
unique variations incorporating elements only possible
in a world of magic and fantastical creatures.
This chapter will showcase a variety of firearms.
Some have historical inspirations, while others are
more unusual black powder weapons, never seen
on Earth due to the differences in the two worlds’
technological advancements, historical eras, and
societal shifts. We’ve also included a short segment
here to talk about the ways in which the development,
spread, and evolution of firearms on Golarion differs
significantly from those on Earth.
Firearms on Golarion
Golarion’s guns come from three different continents
and have spread to at least two more, with each
devising their own particular style and gunsmithing
techniques. In Tian Xia, the birthplace of black powder,

The greatest lesson I’ve learned from my dwarf allies is that progress and innovation
demand patience and iteration. In a few short years I have grown a duchy from a blasted
desert with the gift of my ambition, but it shall outlast me thanks to the gifts our patient
dwarven neighbors have laboriously engineered. These weapons, these “guns,” named for
this dwarven kingdom, were meticulously crafted one painstaking piece at a time over
decades. High King Arunak told me once that she personally built the firing mechanism of
the weapon she carries today nearly 50 years past, hand crafting each component dozens,
even hundreds, of times until she made the most perfect version of each part.
When I showed her the first of the weapons forged by my own hands—a heavy,
handheld affair with three barrels and a sliding catch mechanism so that multiple shots
could be prepared and easily reloaded even when carrying a sword or shield—I thought
she would be dismayed or even disappointed by my hubris. But instead, she smiled
and acknowledged what we both knew in our hearts to be true. “We shall be stronger
together than we could ever hope to be apart.”
When I’m gone, if Arunak’s heir and my distant successor have kept the dream we kindled
together alive, may liches and monsters quake in fear of the weapons we have wrought.
Let humans and dwarves challenge villains with weapons of defiance forged by countless
lives dedicated toward a single purpose. Let the dragons beware—here, there be guns!
—Ancil Alkenstar, the first Duke of Alkenstar
gunslingers tend to prefer more versatile weapons,
such as the modular hand cannon and the fire lance, a
precursor to the more complex combination weapons
presented later in this chapter.
In Arcadia, home to millennia-old guns that use
magic rather than science to propel their ammunition,
multiple traditions and lineages exist, none of which
used the black powder essential to other continents’
firearms. Arcadian firearms range from the mystical
beast guns to the scientifically produced air guns, as
well as the legendary star guns that inspire the hearts
of Arcadians even now, thousands of years after the
secrets of their creation were lost to time.
In Garund, the forges of Dongun Hold and Alkenstar
billow smoke and flame night and day as industrious
smiths constantly innovate, developing new varieties
of guns and creating special customizations and
attachments to improve nearly any firearm.
You can find more information on all these regions in
The Rotating Gear chapter starting on page 186.
THE BIRTH OF GUNS
While Arcadia has had firearms for millennia longer
than any other continent, these didn’t use black
powder at all. The first firearms, beast guns, and star
guns worked purely via magical processes. The many
wards and magical anomalies that guard passage
to Arcadia’s shores have kept beast and star guns

relatively contained over the millennia. These same
barriers to travel have also sheltered Arcadia from
many of the worst catastrophes to wrack other parts
of Golarion, so the continent’s gunsmithing techniques
and traditions have grown more slowly and along
more focused paths tied to ritual hunts and ceremonial
weapons forged from skymetals and magic.
One of the most significant innovations in technological
firearms to come from Arcadia, though it has fallen into
relative obscurity on the continent in modern days, was
the development of air guns: lower-impact firearms
fired using compressed air stored in specially crafted
cartridges. Sealed with a wax stopper that is punctured
and resealed by the gun’s firing mechanism, these
relatively lightweight and efficient containers could
be combined with cartridges containing metal balls or
darts. Due to their inexpensive nature and ease of use,
they were a staple of Arcadian hunters for many years,
until the techniques to create beast guns and imitation
star guns became more affordable to those who admired
and desired these weapons for themselves.
Compared to black powder firearms, air weapons
are far less volatile and don’t have any problems with
water, but their destructive potential is also much lower.
Black powder firearms, however, are virtually unknown
in Arcadia. Beast guns and new magical guns patterned
after the ancient star guns are powerful and effective,
lessening any desire for black powder weapons, and the
barriers to trade cut both ways.
Beast guns were the earliest firearms created in Arcadian
history, first invented well over 10,000 years ago. Star
guns, too, predated Earthfall, created by a mysterious
and isolated group called the Crowned Regents. These
in turn inspired air guns, as well as imitation star guns
created with skymetals scattered across the continent by
Earthfall. Though limited trade exists between Arcadia
and Tian Xia, it’s unlikely that Tian Xia’s weaponry took
any cues from Arcadian firearms; hand cannons and
fire lances are distinct from Arcadian weaponry, with
similarities between the weapon designs and innovations
of the two continents only appearing long after their
respective gunsmithing traditions were well established.
ADVENT OF BLACK POWDER
For the rest of Golarion outside Arcadia, black powder
preceded firearms, and was first discovered by alchemists
in Tian Xia, perhaps as a secret negotiated from a
dragon’s hoard if the legends are to be believed. As
fireworks, rockets, hand cannons, fire lances, hwachas,
and other black powder innovations became known in
various cities across the continent, an interest in trade
arose, most prominently from Tian Xia’s neighboring
western continent of Casmaron and the Impossible
Kingdoms of Vudra.
The Dragon Empire of Lung Wa was in ascendance
across much of Tian Xia, however, and had a
near-monopoly on black powder technology. The
empire was cautious of other continents in general
and was thus understandably hesitant to provide these
secrets beyond their borders, where they could get
into the hands of potential enemies and increase their
future military might. However, Vudran negotiators
were enthusiastic and persuasive, offering ever-more-
enticing gifts and wonders, and at last Lung Wa
acquiesced, gifting a significant amount of black powder
to their Vudran neighbors, along with a formula to
make more. However, a secret that the Vudrans never
learned, even many centuries later, was that their Tian
trading partners traded them a watered-down version
of the black powder formula—much more stable but
also less powerful and, therefore, less threatening to
their hegemony.
There’s no indication that black powder technology
ever reached Arcadia through their limited trade
interactions with Tian Xia. Unlike the Vudran
negotiators who wanted to learn the formula at any
cost, it’s likely that Arcadian traders would’ve seen
little value in obtaining a technology clearly more
volatile and unreliable than their own.
For many years, the black powder trade was
primarily locked between Tian Xia and Casmaron.
Vudra, on the other hand, found many innovative uses
for the modified black powder formula they received,
which turned out to be much more stable than the
original. This in turn allowed them to trade farther
and wider than Tian merchants were allowed, and
without fear of their wagons or ships exploding. This
ultimately facilitated Vudran trade in both directions
and, most notably, introduced the Vudran formula for
black powder to the continent of Garund.
DONGUN HOLD AND THE FORMATION OF INDUSTRY
Before sealing their gates for what they believed would
be the final time to defend against a war between
archwizards that threatened their very existence, the
dwarves of Dongun Hold made a critical trade with
their Kulenett cousins. Kulenett dwarves had obtained
several casks of black powder from Vudrani traders
and brought it to the Hold, using a combination of
underground and overland routes to safely navigate
the war spreading across the regions. Surprisingly, the
Kulenett dwarves had no idea that their cousin nation
would ultimately turn these casks into the foundation

for a technological revolution. Knowing that Dongun
Hold’s access to the surface was being closed with
the intent to never reopen, the Kulenett provided the
black powder with the intent that it could serve as a
food preservative that would also give the foodstuffs a
peppery bite when eventually consumed. The powder’s
explosive properties were an incidental reality, though
not one that went unnoticed in Dongun Hold.
Over the following centuries, dwarves of Dongun
Hold learned to recreate and then further perfect
several of their own new recipes for black powder,
eventually recreating the stronger and more volatile
blend kept secret in Tian Xia. Their discoveries as
they experimented led to better explosives for mining,
powerful black powder traps to protect their tunnels,
and ultimately, their first modern black powder
firearms. Dedicated perfectionists who had already
survived one war while under constant threat from
Darklands factions, Dongun Hold dwarves innovated
rapidly, producing pistols and muskets in various
forms and configurations and soon creating entire
elite military units of long gun–wielding snipers and
armored vanguards with blunderbusses.
The forges and processes for arming the soldiers of
Dongun Hold would later expand dramatically when
a human wanderer by the name of Ancil Alkenstar
sought, and received, audience with High King Anong
Arunak of Dongun Hold, spurring yet another leap
forward in the development of firearms. As Dongun
Hold’s surface-facing gates opened for the first time in
millennia and the duchy of Alkenstar was established,
human ingenuity met with dwarven craftsmanship
for the first time in the history of firearms and black
powder on Golarion. The result was an explosive
period of discovery and growth in firearm technology.
This period bred innovations like the crank-handle
pepperbox and threaded breech for quickly reloading
arquebuses, making firearms both more accessible and
more practical for use as personal defense weapons.
The arquebus in particular became perhaps one of
the most favored weapons for both military and
personal use against the enormous monstrosities that
haunt the Mana Wastes. The name arquebus refers
to the hooked mechanisms usually attached to the
underside of the weapons and used to mount them on
defensive fortifications as a means of mitigating their
enormous kickback.
FIREARMS ON MODERN GOLARION
Today, firearms are still relatively uncommon across
Golarion and only available from less than a handful
of sources in the Inner Sea. However, magic and
clockwork technologies have advanced and evolved
firearm innovations in unique and remarkable ways
only possible on a world like Golarion. While many
of the firearms currently produced in Golarion share
names and basic functions with counterparts from
Earth’s history, they often feature mechanisms that
weren’t uncovered until later in our history and
refinements that never happened or never proliferated.
On Earth, such firearms were discarded predominantly
in favor of more advanced technology that Golarion
has not yet discovered how to reproduce or has had no
need to replicate.
In Alkenstar, most firearms are crafted with a
flintlock firing mechanism and folding breech, a hinged
barrel that allows the weapon to be quickly opened
and reloaded with new prepackaged paper cartridges
of powder and shot. Alkenstar also hosts a thriving
industry of smiths who focus their ingenuity and
creativity on singular elements of firearms, such as
specialized firing mechanisms and scopes both magical
and scientific in nature and function.
In Dongun Hold, the steady and methodical process
of iteration and refinement continues, spurred on by
a determination not to be shown up by their human
neighbors in Alkenstar and to retain their reputation
as the preeminent gunsmiths on Golarion. The
scatterguns produced in Dongun Hold are some of
the most powerful and sought-after firearms in the
Inner Sea, using a simple but ingenious clockwork
system built directly into the weapon to eject a firing
FIREARMS AND ACCESS
In the world of Golarion, firearms and black powder
weaponry remain largely limited to specific regions.
In Avistan, reckless scientists and innovative undead
hunters in the nation of Ustalav have championed a
technological renaissance, spurring the development of
basic but effective muskets copied off Alkenstar originals
and, in the process, creating a burgeoning market for
silver bullets and bayonets. In the Shackles, Motaku Isle
Ironworks continues to pump out shoddy, but deadly,
replicas of firearms and cannons stolen from Alkenstar,
as well as create new (usually unstable) black powder
weaponry. Alkenstar itself boasts the premier black
powder gunsmiths on the planet and is the undisputed
center of modern innovation for firearm accessories.
In Tian Xia, the nations of Goka, Ling Shen, Po Li, and
Quain have long worked with black powder, using it to
spur other technological advancements. The continent
of Arcadia has seen decades of relatively uninterrupted
peace and might contain more gunslingers than the rest
of Golarion combined, though their firearms are a more
diverse array of magical star guns, technological air
guns, and ceremonial beast guns, with no black powder
whatsoever. Characters from these regions have access
to the gunslinger class and firearms. Other than Arcadia,
they have access to black powder siege weapons if
the GM has opened up siege weapons as an option for
the campaign.
