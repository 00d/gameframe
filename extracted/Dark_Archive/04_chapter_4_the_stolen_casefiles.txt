Campaign Background­—
for GMs only
The casefiles in this section each introduce setting
information on a different paranormal topic, then present
a variety of player and GM options to bring that
topic to life at the table, whether it’s an
archetype that lets players command
temporal magic or new space-bending
hazards for GMs to use in spooky
mansions. Each casefile concludes
with a short mini-adventure that will
make your players directly confront the
paranormal topic discussed in that file,
from a mysterious beast stalking the forests
to the aftereffects of a strange demonic
artifact. Each mini-adventure can
be completed in one or two
sessions, and they proceed from
lower-level adventures to higher-level ones.
TABLE 4: STOLEN CASEFILE ADVENTURES
The adventures and the player level they are designed for
are as follows. Each adventure is balanced for a team of
4 PCs.

A number of single-page incident reports are also
interspersed between the main casefiles, each describing
a paranormal event logged by a different member of the
Dark Archive, as well as a rules option to bring it to life at
your game table.
USING THE CASEFILES IN YOUR CAMPAIGN
If your group is interested in playing through the
adventure contained in this book, then ensure your PCs
come across the Dark Archive folio—a small, unassuming
bound book of notes and reports—within the game world,
sometime before they reach 4th level to ensure they’ve
been introduced to the story before the first adventure.
THE STOLEN CASEFILES
The Last Mysteries of the Lone Archivist
Cryptids. Secret societies. Deviant abilities. Mirror duplicates. Cults. Curses and pacts.
Temporal anomalies. Mindscapes. Each topic presenting enough questions to fill a library,
and each a mystery I was unable to solve. I know there must be something more behind them.

—K.H.W.
How your PCs initially come into possession of the Dark
Archive folio is up to you. Perhaps it’s buried in the back
of the local tavern, left behind by a mysterious traveler
who passed through. Maybe your PCs find it in their
adventures through a lost library or Pathfinder
warehouse, collecting dust but calling out.
The eight mysteries span the entire planet of
Golarion. While the Dark Archive’s agents
were no strangers to global transit, the Lone
Archivist took this a step further, creating
a secret system to enable later agents to
return to the site of his open casefiles,
using a form of teleportation known
as the somnambulist’s bridge. When
the bridge becomes active, usually due
to an alarm, beacon, or similar signal
being triggered from the site of the casefile, the
Dark Archive folio will flip open to the relevant
location and the pages will glow with a hypnotic light.
Viewers who gaze at the open book will find themselves
growing drowsier and drowsier before finally falling asleep,
during which they feel the sensation of floating gently
through a dark void. When they awaken, they are at the
adventure’s location and can begin their daily preparation as
if they had slept a full night, then proceed on the adventure.
The somnambulist’s bridge can be traversed only once to
the destination and once back, after which point the folio
closes the casefile, the mystery resolved.
Because these mini-adventures span only a single, short
incident each, they intentionally do not reward players
all of the Experience Points or treasure that they would
normally receive in a full level of play. You can intersperse
these casefiles between the main campaign of your players,
with the folio opening to the next casefile at any point
when the players are an appropriate level to take it on,
or you can use the content of the casefile (or the content
of an incident report) as a springboard to come up with
your own paranormal home campaign. For instance, after
finishing the cryptid-themed Beast of Birchfrost adventure,
the PCs might find other cryptids in nearby towns and
continue cataloging them until they are of the appropriate
level to take on the next adventure, Shaking the Helping
Hand. If you prefer to play through the adventure as a
single campaign, you can also simply level your PCs up
to the appropriate level whenever they clear a casefile—
whatever approach best fits your group!

Cryptids aren’t simply monsters, but rather beings that
chafe against our sense of what’s possible or right. Their
very nature refuses logic. They’re frayed threads of a
larger tapestry. Perhaps they made sense with the whole
once, but no longer, now simply disparate dead ends.
Cryptids occupy the minds of the general populace,
and from there they’re witnessed, or perhaps birthed.
For instance, the ever-popular “Mosquito Witch” of
Shimmerford. Our time there, just after the Archive
disbanded when a hoax involving the cryptid entered the
Chronicles, was largely spent accosted by locals peddling
merchandise or self-proclaimed “cryptozoologists”
chattering like summer cicadas. But it seemed clear to us
something deeper was going on. In fact, the Mosquito
Witch stories diverged into three different broad paths,
each internally consistent but contradictory to the
other two. Is this the case of three different cryptids, or
perhaps one cryptid whose storyline diverged at some
point in the past?
What determines popularity? Behavior? Appearance?
Look at too many cryptids and suddenly normal animals
appear strange. Study drawings of the Sandpoint Devil
and an ordinary horse seems threatening. The Melfesh
Monster’s plantlike features only serve to emphasize
the danger it represents. Perhaps it’s inevitable the most
famous of all are those cryptids, like the Sandpoint
Devil, that intentionally leave behind scarred survivors
to tell their tales. On the other end are cryptids that have
thus far gone unnoticed in the academic community.
Noted below are four cryptids that, to our knowledge,
haven’t been documented elsewhere.
THE IRONBOUND SIREN
I must admit few things unnerve me so much as open
waters. Sometimes it feels as though as far as the sky
stretches up to the stars, so mirrors the ocean down.
And while the prospect of discovering the unknown
excites me, I’m equally terrified of what lurks below.
EYES IN THE FOREST,
TRACKS IN THE MUD
On Cryptids and other Strange Creatures
Fear gnaws at the back of our minds always, taking shape in the corners of our vision
and rustling into the shapes we dare not envision. We’ve spent a great deal of time
investigating legend given form, born from nowhere and nursed by rumor, and each
time we think we’ve seen all the creatures our world has to offer, more crawl forth.

Serpents, krakens, and devilfish may swallow us whole
and we stand helpless to do anything but pray. But
what’s truly frightening aren’t the monstrous beasts
that slither the undercurrents. Their motivations are
clear. It’s creatures we can’t even begin to comprehend
we should truly fear.
An expedition into arctic waters isn’t my first choice
of activity, but fishers from the Ironbound Archipelago
spoke of a peculiar phenomenon where a strange choral
singing could be heard in the distance. Setting out to
sea, we could follow the sound. Most who set out never
returned, and sometimes their vessels would arrive on
shore, devoid of any signs of life save the clothes lying on
deck, as if rashly discarded—reminiscent of the frequent
disappearances on Lake Ocota.
Archivist Vyi was speaking to the helmsman of our
vessel about some unrelated matter when we heard the
sound. The singing grew louder as we approached, until
our eyes caught the shining of multicolored lights below,
bouncing off shards of ice. Though clear for quite a ways
down, it was evident the lights were coming from much,
much deeper. It was at this point the helmsman began
shedding clothing, like a moth emerging from its cocoon.
It took two of us to hold him back as he struggled,
attempting desperately to dive into the water.
Sometime later, having managed to restrain the
derelict helmsman, we set up an observation platform
closer to the water, taking care to cover our ears—not
that we’d have liked them exposed in sub-zero anyway.
What we saw was chilling. Dozens of undressed bodies
floating aimlessly around the source of the lights: a
colossal jellyfish-like creature, extending nearly 100 feet
across, scattering beautiful, scant light in all directions.
Whatever this creature was, it seemed far more ancient
than we could understand. Gazing on its light gave me
an uncanny impression that in the course of its life it
swam amid the stars themselves.
Upon our observation of it, the singing stopped
abruptly. Though the creature made no movements
toward us, the bodies pivoted to face in our direction,
in unison. It was then we decided to pack up and move
out. I had Archivist Galan navigate the ship until the
helmsman returned to consciousness, seemingly no
longer under whatever affliction had overtaken him. He
reported very few memories of the occasion, simply that
“it was like a warm dream.”
FACSIMILE
Near Shokuro’s capital city of Mukinami, a woodcutter
walked into the forest, slept for one night, and returned
a rich man, sporting bags full of golden coins. He first
repaired his home with the money, then bought meat
for his son, then gifts for his wife. Every new moon, he
returned to the forest, slept for one night, then came
out with a bag of gold. It wasn’t long before he moved
from buying necessities to luxuries, and from luxuries
to excess. The wealth twisted him, until he no longer
resembled the humble woodcutter.
And then the typhoons hit. Powerful storms strong
enough to tear through every home. “No matter,”
thought the woodcutter, only to find his hoard of gold
had disappeared. He ran to the forest but to no avail.
His wellspring had run dry. When he returned home, he
found an angry mob of people, all complaining about the
gold he’d paid them disappearing. The mob tore through
his home and, in less than a day, he had even less than he
started with.
This is the stuff of folktale and myth, a straightforward
moral lesson about the importance of tempering one’s
greed. The kind of bedtime story my mother would
tell (though the Varisian version of the story involves
a high tide), half chiding. And we would’ve believed it
remained firmly in that realm were it not for the ruined
home in front of us. Interviews with aggrieved merchants
churned out equally bizarre stories of disappearing gold,
all stemming from the storms that ripped through the
area. We seemed to be at a standstill until we spoke
with the woodcutter’s son, who’d evidently followed his
father into the forest one night. He reported watching
as the woodcutter tossed a coin and a large amount of
meat scraps into a hole in the ground before returning
home. The youth reported, quite specifically, saying this
father’s hands “glistened strangely, as if he’d dipped
them in honey.”
We took that lead and began to search the forest.
The blood-swollen insects and spiked seed pods the
size of my thumb left me with some sympathy for the
woodcutter—I too would have leapt at any means to
make my living other than felling trees in that miserable
place every day. It wasn’t long before Archivist Langbris,
the younger one, discovered a patch of oddly uniform
gravel. When we dug in, below the surface was a strange
ooze of moderate size, from which we recoiled. However,
upon observation, we discovered the miraculous source
of the money: the ooze created materials, rather than
destroyed them. Rather, it copied anything put into it.
Except for meat. Any biological material put in was used
to fuel the duplication.
The copies are remarkably detailed, and the ooze can
even replicate complex objects, such as weapons. While
testing however, we found there’s one fatal flaw with
these copies: they dissolve in water.
THE WALKER
It’s the adjacency to normalcy, the almost-right that can
cause the mind the most distress. An animal in the night
rising up to stand on two legs, the improper gait of a
shadow, or stretched features that don’t quite fit. The
Walker stalks among us, deep in the hearts of our largest
cities. Most pay no heed to those they pass in the light of
day. It’s only at night when we see what isn’t quite right,
when our bodies are attuned to the paranormal.

At night in Absalom, on a leisure excursion no less,
I caught sight of the Walker. It was in the form of a
woman, and only in the brief torchlight did I catch her
too-wide eyes and too-sharp teeth. I cleared my eyes
and the figure was gone. Vexing. Had I more time, I
would have gladly pursued this thread personally. Alas,
we handed the assignment to another archivist
who seemed delighted at “not having
to go somewhere too weird
this time.” The strange
creature has many names
across many continents.
Reported
sightings
are
erratic,
but
compound,
the swirling rumors only
reinforcing,
maybe
even
manifesting, its presence.
I left the next day for
Riddleport.
It
happens
the
previous encounter we’d had
with the Walker took place there,
and somewhere in my bones I knew
we’d find it there again. A rash of
disappearances, often late at night,
and always just off major streets.
Our initial suspect was a particularly
irate spirit or some such, but, increasingly,
bodies began turning up torn apart, missing limbs,
tucked into with voracious bites. Every one of the
victims seemed to have struggled. Too earthly to have
been a vengeful ghost but too personal to have been a
simple monster—the circumference of the bite marks
indicated a humanoid mouth.
By happenstance, we encountered it one night in
Oppara, catching its erratically long limbs leading up
to a face completely devoid of features, save for the
vague suggestion of a woman’s mouth. We attempted
to apprehend the creature but were caught unaware by
its preternatural strength and sent flying. It bolted, legs
growing longer and longer with each stride.
ANGLER
Many times, we’re sent to investigate a string of
disappearances, especially if traditional investigations
turn up little of value. How people can continue to
simply vanish in some of the most populated and
well-monitored areas in the world is concerning. It’s
important to keep one ear listening to the choir of
rumor, especially in places so densely populated. It’s in
those stories where we begin to narrow the scope of
investigation to something more tangible. In rare cases,
those rumors might cause the creature to manifest, or
perhaps to metamorphose into something more.
In this case, we were in Sothis, where gossip
spreads like a disease. A popular bedtime story told
to misbehaving children concerned a spirit that would
cry for help, luring unsuspecting victims, only to drag
them to the underworld. It was by sheer chance we
heard this for ourselves, on a late night patrol through
the winding streets. Though the sun had long since set,
the city was still alive with lights and festivity, tables
flooding from the cafes and bars into the
streets, where workers enjoyed their drinks.
It’s places like this where we feel at ease
and most reminded of the importance of
our work.
Only when we had broken off into
deeper and darker alleys did we hear those
haunting cries. Not screams. Lilting,
moaning cries. Encounters with even
the mundane creatures of our world,
like the Howling Banshees Incident,
harden
us
to
the
monstrous,
even the strange. But nothing
haunts more than the sounds
we hear from the mouths of
ordinary people.
It took some work to
trace—the
sounds
came
indistinctly from a distance, but we
located a route, albeit complicated, to the
remnants of an underground laboratory.
Boards intended to seal the entrance had long since rotted
out. All the while, the cries became louder, sometimes
changing pitch, age, anything to get someone to notice
them. When we came up on the creature, a handful of the
younger archivists turned away, nauseated. Piles upon
piles of human bones. A writhing mass of withered flesh
sitting between, like so many worms spreading across
the ground, with countless signs of experimentation—
bolted-on alchemical devices, patches of scarred skin,
and marks from needles, blades, and more. It was clear
what had happened here and what it cost.
Archivist Nailah, an Osirian born during the
Palemoon Crisis, skimmed through what records were
intact enough to salvage. It’s no secret that fragile
mortals seek the embrace of immortality, unable to
envision the end to their time on the Material Plane. In
the process of pursuing such things, creatures like this
result, an attempt to emulate the power of the gods and
bring new life into the world. Some attempts are more
successful than others.
By many measures, the Angler was a success. It seemed
to have been alive for a very, very long time. Even as we
operated around it, it never stopped the cries, perhaps
belonging to the countless people it had feasted on. It
wasn’t very nimble, but it was strong. It took Archivist
Ulf, big even by orc standards, and two others to secure
it while we worked. But ultimately, it knew only how to
prolong itself in twisted eternity, and had long outlived
its purpose, maybe even consumed those who created it.
Mere speculation.

Rarity: Rare
Aftermath feats, which are always rare, represent new
powers causes by dangerous encounters with the weird
and deadly. The prerequisite of an aftermath feat can be
met only at a dramatic moment in your story—
slitting the throat of a drowsy drake in a random
encounter likely won’t awaken any latent
abilities, but defeating a mighty dragon
at the end of a long, heroic journey just
might. A fool who runs around dousing
themself in the blood of every dragon
they slay is more likely to contract
some sort of disease than
manifest a new power.
Every aftermath feat is a
class feat but can be taken by a
character of any class, provided
the character has gone through
the unlikely ordeal that unlocks
it. The feat gains the appropriate trait
for the class of the character who selected
it. If an appropriate story event occurs that fits the
prerequisites of an aftermath feat of your level or lower,
the GM might permit you to immediately retrain a class
feat into the appropriate aftermath feat. An aftermath feat
isn’t something you can typically remove once you have
one, so you can’t retrain it in the normal manner. The
GM might determine a specific quest or other procedure
you could use to remove the aftermath feat.
DEVIL’S EYE
FEAT 4
RARE
AFTERMATH
Prerequisites You made a bargain with a devil or won a legal
case or other similar duel of wits against a devil.
Your experience in the finer points of bargaining with a devil
has awakened a sinister power that now inhabits your left
eye. The eye is the same shape and iris color as your normal
eye would be, but the sclera is a deep red instead of white
and the pupil is a narrow, vertical slit. The eye grants you an
abnormal understanding of the loopholes and legal processes
employed to trap poor creatures that don’t know any better.
You gain the Objection reaction. You also become an expert
in Legal Lore and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to any check
you make to read or negotiate a treatise, contract, or similar
text. At 7th level you become a master of Legal Lore, and at
15th level you become legendary in Legal Lore. You can use
Legal Lore in place of Perception to detect verbal loopholes,
double entendres, hidden meanings, code, or contradictions
in a conversation you can hear. This doesn’t let you fully
understand coded speech but alerts you to its presence.
Objection [reaction] (fortune) Frequency once per minute; Trigger
You’re about to attempt a saving throw against a linguistic
effect; Effect Your devil’s eye crackles with
infernal glee as you discover a loophole in the
wording of the triggering effect. You roll
your saving throw twice, taking the
higher result.
ECHO OF THE FALLEN
FEAT 4
RARE
AFTERMATH
Prerequisites You helped to lay a
haunt, ghost, or spirit to rest.
With the utmost gratitude for your help
in releasing them from their unearthly coil,
a tiny sliver of a ghostly entity has remained
attached to you. This manifests as an echo of
their former self that follows you around and
that you and anyone capable of casting divine
or occult spells can see and speak with. When
you take this feat, work with your GM to choose
one martial weapon and one skill (or an advanced
weapon if you’re trained in all martial weapons) that are
appropriate for the spirit; once you’ve chosen the weapon and
skill, you can’t change them. You gain the Accept Echo action.
Accept Echo [one-action] (concentrate) Frequency once per day; Effect
You allow the echo to inhabit your body, gaining a glowing
aura around you, shining pale-green irises, a resonating
voice, and the silhouette of the spirit around your own
body, all of which can be seen clearly by others. While in
this state, you become trained in the weapon you chose and
an expert in the skill you chose. Additionally, while you’re in
this state, the echo can speak and interact with the Material
Plane using your body, and you gain a +4 status bonus to
all saves against possession effects, as the possessing spirit
protects you from other possessions.
This state lasts for 10 minutes, after which the echo
disappears completely until the next time you make your
daily preparations. You can Dismiss this effect.
At 7th level you become a master of the skill you chose,
at 13th level you become an expert with the weapon you
chose, and at 15th level you become legendary with the
skill you chose.
LINGERING CHILL
FEAT 4
RARE
AFTERMATH
COLD
Prerequisites You’ve been brought to 0 Hit Points by an
enemy that has the cold trait or an enemy’s ability that has
the cold trait.
The chill of ice entered your veins and never left, adjusting the
internal temperature of your body. Your breath comes out in
AFTERMATH FEATS
Stories abound of a battle-scarred hero, bathed in the blood of the fearsome dragon, awakening to a strange new power.
The conflict changes their very being, leaving an unforgettable reminder that awakens greater power and a unique kind
of heroism.

puffs, and your skin is as cold and smooth as the ice in your
veins. You can cast ray of frost as a primal innate cantrip. You
gain resistance to cold damage equal to half your level, and
you’re protected from severe cold temperatures.
ELYSIUM’S CADENCE
FEAT 6
RARE
AFTERMATH
Prerequisites You’ve partied extensively with an azata or
entered a romantic relationship with an azata.
You’ve been ensnared by an azata’s infectious enthusiasm
for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent
afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft
steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and
eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Make an Impression, or a
+2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain
the Set Free reaction.
Set Free [reaction] (fortune) Frequency once per hour; Trigger You
attempt a check to remove or counteract an effect with the
confused, controlled, fascinated, immobilized, paralyzed,
or restrained conditions; Effect You roll twice and use the
better result.
JELLY BODY
FEAT 6
RARE
AFTERMATH
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites You’ve been reduced to 0 Hit Points while
engulfed by an ooze.
Some of the ooze that surrounded you made its way
permanently into parts of your body, turning you soft to the
touch and semitransparent enough to show bones. You gain
resistance equal to your level to precision damage and damage
from critical hits. You can submerge up to 1 Bulk of items

the protrusion of the item is still visible from the outside,
the items don’t count toward making you encumbered or

MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites You have succeeded at an important task
given by a dragon, such as procuring a special treasure for
their hoard.
In pleasing the cravings of a mighty dragon, they have deigned
to impart some of their magical essence into your body. Your
eyes begin to glow and change color while your limbs and neck
grow a veneer of scales, all the same color as the associated
dragon, accompanied by a near-insatiable desire to amass
a hoard of your own. You gain the dragon breath sorcerer
bloodline spell, emulating the breath of the associated dragon,
and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus
pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. You Refocus
by counting and arranging your treasure.

NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Prerequisites You’ve been reduced to 0 Hit Points by an
enemy with the negative trait.
Experiences with necromantic energy have left a permanent
mark on you, casting you in a deathlike pallor, chilling your
body temperature to be ice-cold, turning your very blood
black, and giving you the power to rip out an enemy’s life
force. Strike with an unarmed attack. If you hit and the target
is a living creature, it takes 4d6 additional negative
damage, depending on its Fortitude save. If the target
takes any negative damage, you gain an equal number
of temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute.
Critical Success The enemy takes no additional
negative damage and becomes temporarily immune
for 1 minute.
Success The enemy takes half the additional
negative damage.

effect, and an element of that stony gaze has remained with
you, both protecting and slowly consuming you. Your limbs
are coated with a layer of stone that rests atop your skin and
covers more of your body as you lose health. You gain a stone
fist unarmed attack that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage, has
the shove trait, and is in the brawling weapon group (unlike a
normal fist, it doesn’t have the agile or finesse traits).
Additionally, you become more petrified as your life force
ebbs. When you have fewer than half your maximum Hit
Points, you increase the damage die size of your stone fist
from 1d8 to 1d10 and gain resistance to physical damage
(except adamantine) equal to your Constitution modifier.
If you would gain the dying condition, you can choose to
instead be permanently petrified and avoid the risk of death.
When you do, you enter your petrified form with your full
maximum Hit Points instead of the normal number. If you
become unpetrified, you return to 0 Hit Points, as normal.
You can’t voluntarily end this petrification. Counteracting this
petrification requires a casting of stone to flesh of a spell level
equal to at least half your level, and a successful counteract
check against the hard DC for your level. Other effects like
stone to flesh have similar limitations, as determined by the
GM. Each time you recover from this petrification, you gain
a new scar on your skin in the shape of a long, thin crack.
DORMANT ERUPTION
FEAT 14
RARE
AFTERMATH
FIRE
Prerequisites You’ve been brought to 0 Hit Points by an
enemy that has the fire trait or an enemy’s ability that has
the fire trait.
A sweltering heat and sparks of flame that take the form
of tiny copies of you surround your body. You’re hot to the
touch, gaining resistance 5 to cold and fire. Whenever an
adjacent creature Strikes you with a melee attack or touches
you, it takes 1d6 persistent fire damage. You gain the Thermal
Eruption action.
Thermal Eruption [two-actions] (evocation, fire, primal) Frequency once
per day; Effect You concentrate your thermal energy and
explode it outward. All creatures in a 20-foot emanation
take 14d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save. Afterward,
you lose all effects of the Dormant Eruption feat until your
next daily preparations.
SINK AND SWIM
FEAT 14
RARE
AFTERMATH
WATER
Prerequisites You’ve been brought to 0 Hit Points by an
enemy that has the water trait or an enemy’s ability that
has the water trait.
Your body looks like it’s made of flowing water, clear and
pristine, providing a natural grace to all your movements. You
gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you already
had a swim Speed, it’s increased by 10 feet. You gain the Water
Transfer activity, which enables you to teleport through a
body of water.
Water Transfer [two-actions] (conjuration, primal, teleportation, water)
Frequency once per minute; Requirements You’re on land
and adjacent to a body of water; Effect You sink into the
water and emerge back onto land in another space within
120 feet that’s adjacent to the same body of water. You can
transport yourself, any items you’re wearing and holding,
and up to one other willing creature.
FEY LIFE
FEAT 16
RARE
AFTERMATH
HEALING NECROMANCY
PRIMAL
Prerequisites You helped to save a fey from a terrible fate, and
you’re not a fey.
There are some fates worse than death–and you worked to
save a fey from one such fate. In return, your life became
bound to theirs. Fey magic has since become a part of you,
bringing the vibrant colors of the First World to you and all
that surrounds you. Your skin, hair, all that you touch, and
anything within 5 feet of you changes to the most brilliant
hues possible, though the colors fade as you cease to touch an
object or you move away. You gain the ability to cast summon
fey as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day. At 18th level
the spell heightens to 8th level, and at 20th level it heightens
to 9th level.
The first time you die after gaining this feat, the bond
you made with the fey invokes the power of the First World
to return you to life. Immediately after dying, you revive,
becoming conscious (and wounded as normal) at 27 Hit Points,
and you gain the fey trait. Your eyes become a rainbow of
colors, and you take on a visual aspect of the fey with whom
you are bound, such as by growing wings, horns, or a plantlike
body. The change has no mechanical effect; for instance, the
wings wouldn’t allow you to fly, nor would horns grant a horn
unarmed attack.
The second time you die, you reawaken in the First World
with the full appearance of the fey that was bound to you. You
become an NPC, unconcerned with your old mortal life. You
can be returned to your previous life in the Material Plane by
having allies spend 3 days building a shrine to the First World,
giving three offerings that hold deep sentimental value for you
or another, and holding a raucous, three-day long feast.
Any time that you die after that, you reawaken again in
the First World with no memories of your previous life, and
you can only be brought back by powerful magic such as a
wish spell.
WALK ON THE WIND
FEAT 16

AIR
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites You’ve been brought to 0 Hit Points by an
enemy that has the air trait or an enemy’s ability that has
the air trait.
A flighty breeze follows you wherever you go, granting a
dramatic flair to everything you do. You’re light on your feet,
your voice gains an airy quality that allows it to travel further
than normal, and your clothing and hair rustle gently around
you at all times. You can Stride at half your land Speed across
calm air. If you attempt to carry another creature with you
while walking on air, even if it’s in an extradimensional space,
you fall.

Experimental Cryptids
An experimental cryptid has been purposefully altered
through alchemy, engineering, magic, or ritual to
contain some degree of construct components. Although
powerful, the process is volatile and imperfect.
EXPERIMENTAL CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into an experimental
cryptid by completing the following steps. Increase the
creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small
number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the amount listed on
the table.

Experimental Cryptid Abilities
An experimental cryptid gains the experiment trait
and, depending on the type of construct parts, might
gain the alchemical trait, clockwork trait, or another
construct‑related trait as appropriate. An experimental
cryptid gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Augmented An experimental cryptid is partially artificial and
designed in a way to specifically prevent biological afflictions
and instant death. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to saving
throws against death effects, disease, and poison.
Operational Flaw An experimental cryptid has a flaw in its
construction that can be identified with a successful
Perception check to Seek against the hard DC of the
creature’s level. An experimental cryptid has weakness
equal to its level to the attacks of any creature that has
successfully located the experiment’s operational flaw.
Clobber [two-actions] The experimental cryptid Strikes a creature. On a
hit, the creature is pushed 5 feet (10 feet on a critical hit) and
knocked prone. If this causes the creature to collide with a
solid object, the creature takes an additional 1d10 damage. If
the experimental cryptid is at least 5th level, this Strike deals
one additional weapon damage die of damage, and if the
experimental cryptid is at least 15th level, this Strike deals
two additional weapon damage dice of damage.
Energy Wave [two-actions] The experimental cryptid unleashes a
30‑foot line of energy of a type specific to the experimental
cryptid (typically electricity or fire). Creatures in the area
take 1d6 damage per level of the cryptid with a basic Reflex
save. The experimental cryptid can use this ability once
every 1d4 rounds. This action has the damage type’s
trait. If the experiments that reshaped the
creature were magical, this action also has
the evocation trait and the trait matching
the magical tradition of the experiments
(arcane, divine, occult, or primal).
Power Surge [one-action] The experimental
cryptid draws on its augmentations
to empower its attacks. It attempts
a DC 5 flat check. On a success,
the experimental cryptid deals 1d6
additional damage with its Strikes
until the end of its turn. On a failure,
the experimental cryptid takes that much
damage instead. The damage and traits for
Power Surge are the same as those of Energy Wave.
This additional damage increases to 2d6 if the
experimental cryptid is 9th level or higher, 3d6
if the experimental cryptid is 15th level or
higher, and 4d6 if the experimental cryptid is
18th level or higher.
CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
They resemble the familiar creatures common to the world, but are always just a bit off. The following sets of adjustments
can make ordinary creatures suited to be cryptids.

Mutant Cryptids
Some strange creatures defy what’s expected from others
of their kind due to a peculiar mutation. A mutation can
come from a wide variety of sources: a quirk in their
lineage, effects from their environment, radiation from
bizarre crystals, or exposure to uncontrolled magic. A
mutant cryptid can defy the normal expectations of its
kind. A water elemental might have a planar disjunction
that changes its makeup moment to moment, or a
werewolf might detest music instead of silver.
MUTANT CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing, living creature into a mutant
cryptid by completing the following steps.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and
change its statistics as follows.
•	 Add the rare trait.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses,
DCs, Perception modifier, saving throws,
and skill modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of its Strikes and other
offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be
used only a small number of times (such
as a dragon’s Breath Weapon), increase
the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the
amount listed on the table.

Mutant Cryptid Abilities
A mutant cryptid should typically either have all four
the following abilities or just two abilities, not including
unusual bane.
You might decide to give a specific mutant cryptid a
unique mutant ability created just for that creature (or
copied from a different creature). Such an ability replaces
one of the three abilities that increases the monster’s
power, or replaces unusual bane if it’s detrimental.
Unusual Bane The mutant cryptid gains an unusual
weakness to a specific bane—such as aversion to saffron
or to the sound of children’s laughter. The first time each
round the creature comes within 15 feet of its bane or
interacts with its bane (such as stepping over a line of
saffron or hearing children laugh) it takes an amount of
mental damage equal to its level and must attempt a Will
save with a hard DC for its level. On a failure, it’s stunned
1 (stunned 3 on a critical failure).
Explosive End The mutant cryptid’s death reveals one last
surprise as it explodes into flame, acid, a pile of toxic goop, or
something stranger still. Choose a damage type appropriate
for the mutant cryptid. When it dies, it explodes, dealing
1d6 damage of the chosen type to each creature in a 10-foot
emanation, with a basic Reflex save against a standard DC
of the creature’s level. The damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd
level and every odd level thereafter.
Shifting Iridescence (abjuration, magical) Whenever the
mutant cryptid takes energy damage to which it isn’t
resistant or immune, after taking the damage normally, it
gains resistance 5 to that damage type. If it had a resistance
to a different damage type from shifting iridescence, it
replaces the old resistance with the new resistance. The
resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 17th level.
Marrowlance The mutant cryptid can make wicked spears
of bone erupt from its body. The creature can make
marrowlance ranged unarmed attacks. Use the highest
attack modifier from the creature’s highest ranged Strike,
as well as the damage from that Strike. If it has no ranged
attacks, use moderate accuracy and low damage for the
creature’s level. Marrowlance unarmed attacks have a range
of 60 feet and the versatile S trait.

Primeval Cryptid
Scholars dream of discovering primeval creatures:
remnants of an older age, long thought extinct. Primeval
cryptids are resilient survivors of their kind or particularly
clever individuals.
PRIMEVAL CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing, living creature into a primeval
cryptid by completing the following steps. Increase the
creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Increase the creature’s rarity to uncommon if it was
common or rare if it was uncommon. If the creature
was an animal, it loses the animal trait and gains the
beast trait.
•	 Increase the creature’s size by one size. If this makes
the creature Huge or Gargantuan, increase the reach
of all its Strikes by 5 feet.
•	 If the creature’s Intelligence modifier is –4 or lower,
increase it to –3.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of the creature’s Strikes and
other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used
only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s
Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase the creature’s HP by the amount listed on
the table.

Primeval Cryptid Abilities
Primeval cryptids gain two abilities from the list below.
You can add more than two abilities if you wish to make
an especially tough primeval cryptid, but you might need
to weaken it in some other way to avoid making it too
powerful.
Stench (aura, olfactory) 30 feet. A creature entering the
emanation or starting its turn in the emanation must
succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC for
the creature’s level or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1
as long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). While within
the emanation, affected creatures take a –2 circumstance
penalty to saves against diseases and to recover from
the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at
its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Broken Arsenal Fragments of broken blades
and spears, the remnants of countless failed
attempts to fell the primeval cryptid, remain
lodged in its flesh. When an adjacent creature
hits the primeval cryptid with a melee attack
or otherwise touches it, that creature takes
piercing damage equal to half the primeval
cryptid’s level (minimum 1 damage).
Grasp for Life [free-action] (healing) Frequency once
per week; Trigger The primeval cryptid
would be reduced to 0 Hit Points; Effect The
cryptid’s will to live is second nature, and
its second wind has allowed it to survive
when others of its kind went extinct. The
creature shrugs off death. Instead of being
reduced to 0 Hit Points, its Hit Points become
equal to four times its level (or 4 Hit Points for
a level 0 creature).
Shockwave [two-actions] Effect The primeval cryptid
creates a shockwave by stomping on
the ground, beating its tail on the
ground, or making another similarly
violent, percussive slam. Creatures
on the ground within 30 feet of the
primeval cryptid take 1d6 bludgeoning
damage per level of the primeval cryptid
(minimum 2d6 damage), with a basic
Reflex save. On a critical failure, a creature is
also knocked prone.

Rumored Cryptid
As stories spread about a rumored cryptid, the weight
of collective belief transforms the creature to match the
tales. The limits of its physical body no longer confine it.
RUMORED CRYPTID ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into a rumored cryptid
by completing the following steps. Increase the creature’s
level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
•	 Add the rare trait. If the creature was an animal, it
loses the animal trait and gains the beast trait.
•	 If the creature’s Intelligence modifier is –4 or lower,
increase it to –3.
•	 Add Stealth with a modifier equal to its highest skill
modifier.
•	 Increase the creature’s AC, attack bonuses, DCs,
Perception modifier, saving throws, and skill
modifiers by 1.
•	 Increase the damage of the creature’s Strikes and
other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used
only a small number of times (such as a dragon’s
Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.

Rumored Cryptid Abilities
All rumored cryptids gain the following abilities,
unless they conflict with the theme of the creature.
Burning Eyes The cryptid’s eyes are distinctive; perhaps
they burn bright red in the dark night. The rumored
cryptid gains darkvision. If the base creature already
has darkvision, it gains greater darkvision.
Creature Obscura The cryptid appears in so many
urban legends, it can be identified using Society
or a Lore skill connected to a nearby settlement,
in addition to the normal skills. However, much of
the information known about it is dubious. The DC
to identify a rumored cryptid is incredibly hard
(rather than very hard for most rare creatures),
but all failures to identify a rumored cryptid gain
the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
Shifting Form The cryptid is sustained by localized
tales or reports from witnesses. As a result, its
appearance morphs between different appearances.
If all records of the rumored cryptid are destroyed or
all witnesses die, the rumored cryptid ceases to exist.
Obscura Vulnerability The cryptid is weakened by those
who seek its truth. Whenever a creature succeeds at a
Recall Knowledge check to identify the rumored cryptid,
the rumored cryptid becomes drained 1 (or drained 2 if the
Recall Knowledge check was a critical success).
Stalk [one-action] Requirements The rumored cryptid is undetected;
Effect The rumored cryptid swiftly stalks prey from hiding.
It Strides, then Strikes.
Vanishing Escape [one-action] The rumored cryptid breaks away and
fades into the background. It Strides, then Hides.
Optional Abilities
The rumored cryptid might have one or both of the
following optional abilities.
Hybrid Form The cryptid’s form morphs to be like a specific
animal as the tales get longer. The rumored cryptid gains
either a burrow, climb, or swim Speed equal to its land Speed.
Howl [two-actions] (auditory, emotion, fear, mental) The rumored
cryptid calls out with a wretched sound no living creature
should make. Each creature in a 30-foot emanation must
attempt a Will save. A creature that fails is frightened 1 (or
frightened 2 on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds
is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The DC is the high DC
for a creature of the rumored cryptid’s level.

ELIXIR
Price 155 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
This vial of murky, acrid-smelling liquid is
derived from a blend of strange blood, typically
coming from aberrations and cryptids. It has
no special properties when used alone, but
if you drink one shortly before drinking
an alchemical elixir, you enhance
the elixir’s duration. Many tales of
mysterious cryptids are actually based
on encounters with people suffering
the aftereffects of such concoctions.
After drinking a baleblood draft,
the next elixir you drink within
1 minute that has a duration of
at least 1 minute and at most 1 hour has
its duration extended by 50% (so a lesser
cheetah’s elixir lasts for a minute and a half
instead of 1 minute).
However, after pairing baleblood draft with another elixir,
you suffer an eerie side effect for 1 week. This side effect
never causes serious harm, although it might be inconvenient
and is always ominous in appearance. All elixirs made in the
same batch cause the same side effect. Drinking another draft
with the same side effect extends the side effect’s duration by
another week, and drinking one with a different side effect
causes you to suffer both effects simultaneously.
CHAOS COLLAR
ITEM 5
COMPANION
INVESTED
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 125 gp
Usage worn collar; Bulk L
This unobtrusive collar is made to
hide beneath an animal’s fur or
blend in against scaled skin. It’s
most often used by unscrupulous
trophy hunters hoping to make a
name for themselves by defeating
threats they artificially created,
using hapless animals as pawns.
A chaos collar fuses to its
animal bearer the first time it’s clasped
around the creature’s neck. Three nights per
month, it transforms the animal into the form of a
terrifying monster. The appearance is the same size as the
original animal and doesn’t change the animal’s statistics,
but it’s always something new, horrifying, and unique to
that particular chaos collar. The transformation lasts from
dusk until dawn, and it occurs with complete randomness
throughout the month.
An animal slain while wearing a chaos collar remains in the
form it had at the time of its death. Once its bearer dies, the
collar transforms into a scrap of dirty string and falls off, where
the unscrupulous hunter can collect and use it again.
CHIMERA THREAD
ITEM 4
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 15 gp
Activate 10 minutes (Interact)
This multicolored skein is twisted together from
strands of many different materials. When used
to stitch together pieces from the carcasses
of two or more animals, it fuses them into a
single intact carcass of an outlandish‑looking
monster
with
characteristics
of
the
component species. The thread disappears,
leaving no obvious seams and smoothing the
transition between the parts of the creatures.
CLOAK OF THE FALSE FOE
ITEM 12
INVESTED
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,850 gp
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
Images of strange animals and distorted figures are woven
into this coarse, fur-lined cloak.
Activate
Interact
(polymorph,
primal,
transmutation);
Frequency once per day; Effect The cloak rises to envelop
your head and body, reshaping your appearance into that
of a locally feared cryptid. If there is no such figure in local
lore, the cloak of the false foe instead alters your appearance
into a form imagined by the crafter of the cloak. One choice
that occurs with disturbing frequency is a gaunt figure with
triple-jointed fingers; an eyeless, hairless
head with a lamprey mouth in the center
of its face; and stubby tentacles
waving down its neck. The
transformation
also
grants
the effects of either a 3rd-level
humanoid form spell that lasts for 1 hour
if you turn into a Medium cryptid, or a 5th-level
humanoid form spell that lasts for 10 minutes if
you turn into a Large cryptid.
While you’re in cryptid form, any wounds left by
your spells and Strikes appear to be the result of the
cryptid’s unarmed attacks and special abilities to a casual
inspection. This doesn’t alter the actual damage type inflicted
or the effects of such attack. Someone closely studying the
wounds can, with a successful DC 30 Medicine check, realize
that magic has altered the appearance of the injuries.
CRYPTID GEAR
Cryptid hunters make use of unusual gear to track down and uncover their hidden quarries, and those who find
ingredients salvaged from a cryptid’s corpse create new items that seem impossible to a normal crafter.

HOAX-HUNTER’S KIT
ITEM 3
UNCOMMON
Price 50 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This wooden box unfolds into a stack of hinged trays holding
calipers, magnifying lenses, acids and reagents, comparison
sketches of species commonly mistaken for one another, and
glass slides for specimen testing. When you use this kit to
study accounts of a creature or what it left behind (such as
spoor, tracks, or fur samples), you gain a +1 item bonus to
Recall Knowledge about the creature or to Track the creature.
In addition, if you fail to Recall Knowledge about the creature
(but don’t critically fail), you’re able to eliminate at least one
possibility of a common type of animal. For instance, you
might be able to verify the creature isn’t an owlbear, even if
you get no further information.
OLD TILLIMAQUIN
ITEM 12
UNIQUE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Price 2,000 gp
Bulk 3
This beloved tavern mascot is a shabby old stuffed beast
mounted on an immense slab of ironwood. The beast is
roughly the size and shape of a wolverine but with a broader
snout, blue stripes along its upper legs and bristled back,
and a club of spiked bone at the end of its long tail. No one
can recall where Old Tillimaquin originally came from, how
the taxidermic beast came to stand in its tavern, or even
whether it’s a genuine article. The tradition of rubbing its
bronzed claws for good luck has been observed for so long
that the front claws are worn to stubs. Local belief holds that
as long as Old Tillimaquin stands, neither fire nor flood will
claim its town.
Activate Interact (divination, fortune, occult); Frequency once
per month; Effect You rub Old Tillimaquin’s bronzed claws
for good luck before setting out on a task that might benefit
the town. You can reroll a single failed saving throw within
the next 24 hours, but you must take the second result,
even if it’s worse than your original result. Each person
who rubs the claws can benefit only once per month,
but there’s no limit to how many people can draw on Old
Tillimaquin’s luck.
SAMPLING AMMUNITION
ITEM 5
CONSUMABLE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Price 22 gp
Ammunition arrow, bolt
The head of this arrow or bolt is a pointed glass cylinder with
a hollow core. Upon hitting a corporeal creature, sampling
ammunition captures a small portion of the target’s skin, blood,
and flesh. The sample falls to the ground below wherever the
creature was hit. This sample is sealed and magically preserved
inside its chamber, although it deteriorates normally once
the cylinder is opened. Sampling ammunition can’t
collect samples from creatures made entirely of
metal, stone, or other hard substances.
CRYPTID SIDE EFFECTS
The following side effects are appropriate for a
baleblood draft or other items made from cryptids.
•	 Your shadow appears to be that of a monstrous,
winged fiend. It sometimes claws and clutches at
nearby creatures, even when you don’t move.
•	 Light breezes die in your presence, and weather vanes
within 50 feet turn slowly to point in your direction,
creaking gloomily as they twist.
•	 Every time you cross the threshold of a sanctified
place, you hear a phantom crash of thunder and are
struck by a visible web of ghostly electricity, which
causes no real damage but forces you to flinch.
•	 Your reflection appears as a pallid, skeletal version
of yourself with distended fangs and sunken eyes.
Any drawing or depiction of you made during this
time transforms, over the course of an hour, into the
same appearance.
•	 From dusk till dawn, wet blood wells up from the
ground to fill your footsteps. Attempts to track you
during this period gain a +4 circumstance bonus.
•	 Food and drink lose all their color after 24 hours in
your possession, becoming monochrome black and
white. This doesn’t affect the edibility of your supplies.
•	 Your voice rises to a high, vibrating chorus of whispers
that seems to contain at least five different voices
speaking in unison. Your breath reeks of sulfur, and
in cold air, the clouds you exhale are yellow rather
than white.
•	 Your skin becomes disconcertingly clammy and anyone
who touches you feels a brief, tingling numbness as
though they had encountered a mild contact poison.
You leave behind distinct fingerprints on every surface
you touch, even those that shouldn’t normally hold
fingerprints—but the prints aren’t your own.

CRYPTIC SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Requirements You’re in natural terrain.
You hide your magic in the croak of a frog, in the sway of the
trees, in the howl of the wind, and the flicker of the will-o’-wisp.
If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a Nature
check against all observers’ Perception DCs. If you succeed at
your check against an observer’s Perception DC, that observer
doesn’t notice that you’re Casting a Spell, even though verbal,
somatic, and material components are usually noticeable, and
spells normally have sensory manifestations that would make
spellcasting obvious to those nearby. All of these are instead
hidden in the natural sights and sounds of the environment.
This ability hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see you
transform into a giant bear.
WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING
FEAT 4
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Deception
With a bit of hide, some antlers, and some cast-off fur, you can
create a disguise that will fool even an experienced hunter.
You can Impersonate creatures with the animal, beast, or
plant traits, so long as they are either the same size or one
size larger than you and have a body shape that conforms at
least vaguely to your own (in other words, a typical humanoid
could Impersonate a bear or an arboreal, but not a horse, giant
scorpion, or assassin vine). Impersonating a larger creature
doesn’t change your actual size.
CAN’T YOU SEE?
FEAT 8
DRUID
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Occultism, expert in Stealth
The eye rebels, the mind recoils—no matter how much those
who can see you try to explain what’s there, their friends’ gazes
just skitter over you, like a bird afraid to land. A character
who attempts to Point Out your location must attempt a DC
14 flat check. If they fail, their allies misunderstand them and
aren’t sure where you are. On a critical failure, their allies think
they pointed you out in a different location entirely, chosen by
the GM. Similarly, when a creature critically fails to Seek you
while you’re hidden to or undetected by it, it thinks you’re in a
different location chosen by the GM. In either case, you appear
to be hidden to a creature that thinks you’re in a different
location, though you’re actually undetected by it for targeting
and further uses of the Seek action.
CRYPTID CLASS FEATS
While most druids and rangers deal with typical animals, plants, and natural creatures, you feel the call of the unknown.
You’ve unlocked stranger techniques associated with mysterious cryptid beasts.

EERIE ENVIRONS
FEAT 8
DRUID
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation, trained in Stealth
The natural world can be scary to those not used to it—and you
make it scarier still. If you’re hidden from a creature, you can
attempt to Demoralize it without losing your hidden condition—
imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to
rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don’t take a penalty to
your check if the target doesn’t understand your language.
EERIE TRACES
FEAT 8
CONCENTRATE
DRUID
EXPLORATION
MOVE
RANGER
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation, trained in Survival
The tracks you leave behind are strange, somehow disconcerting
and unnerving—they might travel backward, or through places
no one would think to pass through. You change your tracks
into eerie traces, moving up to half your travel speed as you
do so. You don’t need to attempt a Survival check to change
your tracks, but anyone tracking you must attempt a Will save
against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
Success The tracker is unaffected.
Failure The tracker becomes frightened 1 for as long as it
follows your tracks. This condition doesn’t decrease until
the tracker stops following you, and it comes back if the
tracker resumes following your tracks. If the tracker enters
into an encounter with you after following your tracks, it
begins the encounter frightened 1.
Critical Failure As failure, but your disturbing traces cause the
tracker to be frightened 2 instead.
FORGOTTEN PRESENCE
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
DRUID
The world conspires to keep you forgotten and unnoticed—
memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits
of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to
Recall Knowledge about you take a –2 circumstance penalty.
Add modify memory to your spell list as a primal spell.

PRIMAL
RANGER
Prerequisites expert in Occultism, expert in Survival
Frequency once per hour
Requirements You must be in either natural terrain or in
abandoned or relatively unused artificial terrain (such as a
darkened alley or haunted house).
You know there are places in the world that are just wrong—
places where the birds don’t sing and where you always feel like
you’re being watched. You can spot these places, and you can
awaken them. To do so, you must gesture toward a 10-foot by 10-
foot square you can see and make an ominous proclamation of
some manner (i.e. “This is cursed ground,” “That is an ill-omened
place.”). The next creature that enters the marked territory must
attempt a Will save against your spell DC (if you’re a druid) or
class DC (if you’re a ranger).
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure Something goes horribly awry for the victim in the
cursed ground. The details are up to the GM—it can be a
purely “natural” accident (they step into an old bear trap,
perhaps) or something stranger and more spectral. The target
gains a condition for 2 rounds. Roll 1d4 on the table and use
the failure column to determine which condition.
Critical Failure As failure, but the effect is astonishingly
gruesome. Use the critical failure column, and the condition
lasts for 1 minute.

OBSCURED EMERGENCE
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You are, by nature, a thing of gloomy woods and barren wilds,
and when you choose show yourself, a bit of this gloom clings
to you, obscuring your form with strange distortions or mist.
When you stop being hidden due to your own actions (not due
to someone successfully finding you), you gain concealment until
the start of your next turn as people’s eyes find it oddly hard to
focus on you. As usual for concealment involving an obvious
visual manifestation, you can’t use this concealment to Hide.
BIZARRE TRANSFORMATION [one-action]
FEAT 14
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Wild Shape
The forms you take on defy belief—chimerical sights of twisted
antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast wild shape,
you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack
granted by the wild shape form to one of the following: acid,
bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing.
The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.
UNSEEN ANIMAL COMPANIONS (UNCOMMON)
Cryptid animal companions look a touch peculiar,
often with uncanny features or ones that seem to
come from a different animal. If you take a feat
that would normally allow you to choose to have
your companion become a savage or nimble animal
companion, you can choose to make it an unseen
animal companion instead. An unseen companion
increases its Wisdom modifier by 2 and its Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution modifiers by 1. It deals
3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks
and deals an extra 1d4 precision damage against
flat‑footed targets (if the animal companion already
deals precision damage, such as a cat, combine the
precision damage). Increase its proficiency rank
in Stealth to expert. It also learns the advanced
maneuver for its type.

Adventure Background
Due east of Port Ice and off the shrouded shore of the
Lake of Mists and Veils, the town of Birchfrost weathers
the gales of late autumn and the seasons of political favor.
As a settlement that thrives off furs the trappers bring in
and the wealth of local fishers, Birchfrost’s independence
is hardened against outside influence. However, this
bounty depends on managing the local ecosystem.
Without beavers to skin or whitefish to eat, Birchfrost
would fall to the demands of Brevoy’s unsteady rule.
While generational knowledge provides a guide on how
many snares to put out or nets to place, the land also
supplies a protector.
The Birchfrost Beast, as this protector is known, guards
against greed. Local legend says the Birchfrost Beast
appeared a few decades ago when a man came to town
seeking fortune. He ignored the warnings of the town’s
residents to limit his fishing only to what he needed for
subsistence, instead casting out dozens of nets. In a single
season, he brought in a catch equivalent to what an entire
family would bring in over a decade. As he enriched his
purse by packing the catch in caravans and selling it far
away from the shore, the rest of the town grew angry. The
town knew he would leave with his boats once the lake
was empty and the forests bare. Those remaining in town
after his departure would be left destitute and starving.
As the town prepared to ensure they wouldn’t be starved
of a future, he disappeared. Rumors abounded: one of the
trappers killed the man and hid his body in the woods, the
man fled in fear of such a plot, or he fell victim to a hex
brought about by his own heedless greed. Seasons passed
and the man’s story faded to a cautionary tale, until the day
his campsite was found a hundred paces off a well‑known
path, torn apart by some clawed creature. Not long after
the discovery, an unknown beast tore the snares from a
poacher’s trap. The matching claw marks at both sites led
to a rumor spreading that the town’s “guardian beast” was
responsible for the incidents.
Those who live in the town have mixed feelings about
the creature, some fearful and some grateful. The stories
of the Birchfrost Beast seem to keep the creature living,
as the power of years of belief transformed it from
a territorial giant boar into legend itself. As the tales
grow taller with each telling, so does the actual beast.
THE BEAST OF BIRCHFROST
Strange creatures seem to come up most often at the fringes of society, where they can easily fade into the background.
The town of Birchfrost, off the Lake of Mists and Veils, has a legend of a local creature, once responsible for protecting the
town. If there is anything more to this so-called “Beast of Birchfrost,” I am sure that the slightest change in circumstance
might herald a dangerous change in the Beast, one the Archive would do well to mind. — K.H.W.

However, a new skipping song has enhanced both legend
and source, transforming the beast into a more dangerous
one: it aggressively attacks anyone it finds in its territory,
not just those engaged in over-hunting.
Getting Started
As the PCs doze off in front of the Dark Archive folio, the
magic of the somnambulists’ bridge takes hold. A strange
drifting sensation fills the PCs’ bodies as they fall asleep,
and time stretches and contorts as darkness swallows them.
Then, like waking from a dream, the PCs come to their
senses as the bracing cold air of Birchfrost touches their
cheeks—they have arrived at their destination, the Dark
Archive folio slamming shut with a clap and dropping to
the ground before them.
The Adventure begins as the PCs hear a commotion
outside of the supply store. A local trapper, the grizzled
Tola Regoli (NG female half-elf trapper) limps from the
trailhead, without the companions who departed with
her. As she drags herself into a rocking chair set outside
her home, she begins to unwind the makeshift sling
securing her arm. The PCs can overhear gossip already
spreading about what happened: Tola went out to set
snares with two other trappers this morning. She made
it back, albeit with a broken arm, but the other trappers
are still missing.
Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs catch
her attention.
“Come around here,” the scarred half-elf Tola says as she gingerly
presses on her wounded arm. “You seem sturdy enough folks
with time on your hands. I don’t want to leave my people out
there with that beast and no backup. If you’re of sound body
and adventurous spirit, I’d appreciate it if you could try and
find them.”
If the PCs express interest, Tola explains what happened.
She takes a swig from her canteen to wet her throat before
launching into the tale. It was a typical day of setting up
traps to catch some beavers for their pelts with her crew.
She works with two twins just out of adolescence, Iri
and Shei (N female human hunters), who usually have
good heads about them. While she and the other trappers
were setting up their snares, a furred beast burst from the
ground below. Tola swears it looked like a badger, but Iri
was going on about a devil attacking her. The creature dug
back into the ground, so Tola made the call to take the
traps and leave. When she leaned over to collect them, the
creature struck at her from behind. She fell on her arm and
felt something in her wrist snap.
By the time she fought off the nausea and scrambled
back to her feet, the others were fleeing. She was in no state
to keep fighting, so she followed. As they fled through the
forest, she jostled her injured arm and had to slow down
due to the sudden pain. During that moment, she lost track
of her allies. She thought they would follow the game trails
back to town, but clearly she made it back before them.
While they’re capable in the woods, the attack concerns
Tola. She asks the PCs to find Iri and Shei, saying she has a
bad feeling about the situation.
If the PCs ask more questions about the beast, she
scoffs and says she didn’t believe the stories before today
and wasn’t expecting to see it. The Birchfrost Beast’s tale
is best told by a local net-maker named Ligh, since Tola
stopped listening to it once she was taller than her dads’
apron strings.
Treasure: If the PCs express any hesitation about facing
the Birchfrost Beast, she offers to help equip them. She has
a set of studded leather armor, her +1 dagger, and a pair
of lesser healing potions. Even if the PCs don’t express
concern, she volunteers this equipment. If the PCs agree to
help, she promises her finest pelt in exchange for word of
Iri and Shei’s safe return.
ASKING AROUND THE TOWN
After the discussion with Tola, the PCs can learn more
about the Birchfrost Beast. The PCs can attempt a DC 18
Diplomacy check to Gather Information. If they follow
the lead from Tola and try to find Ligh, they gain a +2
circumstance bonus on this check. On a success, the PCs
meet with the young net-maker, Ligh (N agender human
weaver), who has been collecting tales of the Birchfrost
Beast. Over tea, they tell the story of the rich man’s folly
and the Birchfrost Beast (see Adventure Background). On
a critical success, a PC gains the favor of Ligh’s shy child,
Mae. Mae teaches them a skipping song about the beast
that hunts hunters in the woods, though Ligh chuckles
and says the song’s incorrect, and the beast should only
attack those who don’t respect the natural balance
of the world.
Walk through the forest, skip through the trees
Listen to the wings flap on the breeze.
Touch a leaf, skip a beat, fall your cheeks turn red
Hunt in the Birchfrost, soon you’ll be dead!
If the PCs fail the Diplomacy check to Gather Information,
Ligh and the other villagers aren’t willing to talk to them
about the beast, worried it might take offense and strike
back against them. Regardless, proceed to Hunting
the Beast (page 68).
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 3rd-level
characters.
The Beast of Birchfrost takes place on the shores
of the Lake of Mists and Veils, where tales of the
town’s local cryptid appear to have changed from
a local protector to something more sinister. The
PCs will have to track and confront whatever this
creature is to get to the bottom of the local tales.

Hunting the Beast
Once the PCs have finished their exploration of the town,
they can find the trailhead and begin searching for the
other trappers. A PC can follow Tola’s tracks
back to the snares with a successful
DC 16 Survival check to Track. After
successfully following the tracks for
an hour, after 4 hours of thorough
wandering if none of the PCs are
trained in Survival, or if they fail
four times in a row, the PCs find the
site. Examining the snares reveals
they were broken by a creature
with large claws. Searching the site
reveals two sets of tracks: Tola’s and
then the paired humanoid footsteps of
the other trappers. With a successful DC
18 Perception check, a PC can spot disturbed
areas of the ground consistent with the burrowing
Tola described. A PC trained in Survival can continue to
Track the Beast with a successful DC 18 Survival check.
Following the humanoid tracks doesn’t require a check
as their boots made clear impressions. It takes 1 hour for
PCs following these to find Iri and Shei sitting at the top
of a poplar tree. They lost the trail and are relieved to see
help, particularly since they haven’t been able to leave
their perch. The Birchfrost Beast has been stalking them
since they were attacked in the woods, and they beg the
PCs to help them by hunting it down. If asked about the
attack or the beast, both Iri and Shei tell a story similar
to Tola’s (see Getting Started). However, the two trappers
have wildly different descriptions of the beast. Iri says it
burst out of the ground with furious snapping teeth, while
Shei describes how it had a tail that felled a sapling with
its force. Both of the twins are certain of what they saw,
leaving the PCs to make their own sense of the strange
creature. This difference is due to the beast’s nature as a
creature of rumor and legend whose appearance matches
the viewer’s expectations, so each telling is, in fact, true.
Iri and Shei explain the creature has returned every few
hours, though it hasn’t been able to reach them up in the
tree. They last saw it on a rocky beach with good tree
cover and a small cliff. The trappers recommend trying
to catch the Birchfrost Beast unaware (see the Stakeout
section on page 69). If the PCs took 4 or more hours to
reach the trappers after departing Birchfrost, the trappers
suffer from exhaustion and hypothermia and require help
to return to Birchfrost safely without being caught by the
Beast. Accompanying them to the town causes the PCs to
lose 1 Stakeout Point, as the PCs lose valuable time.
 Following the Birchfrost Beast’s tracks or the trapper’s
instructions leads to the lakeside trail the Birchfrost Beast
regularly patrols. While traveling to the trail, each PC can
attempt a Perception, Nature, or Survival check to find
signs of the Beast, hints about its capabilities, or the way it
patrols the local woods. The DC for this skill check is 16.
On a success, the PCs earn 1 Stakeout Point (2 points on
a critical success; see the Stakeout section). On a critical
failure, the PCs lose 1 Stakeout Point.
If the PCs earn at least 2 Stakeout Points during
this travel, they discover the creature alternates
between walking above ground and
burrowing under the surface. These
tracks show the beast has five-toed
hooves with claws. On a successful
DC 16 Nature check to Recall
Knowledge about these tracks, a
PC learns they don’t belong to any
known animal, though the hooves
bear a passing resemblance to a boar.
At that point, attempting to Recall
Knowledge to learn more requires
a Nature check with a DC of 30 (an
incredibly hard 5th-level DC because of
the beast’s creature obscura ability), so it’s
extremely unlikely the PCs will be able to do so, and
far more likely they will receive false information from a
critical failure instead. Focus any false information various
PCs deduce on contradictory descriptions to make it seem
like PCs couldn’t both possibly be right. Later, when they
encounter the creature, they’ll realize what happened. If a
PC actually identifies the creature successfully, be sure to
explain to them about rumored creatures and how they
come to be. Their success also means the beast becomes
drained, due to its obscura vulnerability.
A. Lakeside Trail
The lakeside trail the Birchfrost Beast frequents is
approximately 3 miles from the trapping site, or about 7
miles out from Birchfrost.
DEPICTING THE BIRCHFROST BEAST
Throughout this adventure, the PCs will find signs
of the Birchfrost Beast. Until they meet the beast
after the stakeout in area A, they only find tracks
or occasional remains, like a stray tuft of fur, tusk
marks, or hooved tracks. Once the PCs see the
Beast, the confusion continues. The Birchfrost
Beast blends into the natural landscape and
moves quickly. Its appearance is unstable, though
it typically appears as a large boar with enlarged,
mole-like claws it uses to burrow.
Depict the creature as though the PCs only
glimpsed it and provide different PCs with different
details. For example, a PC attempting to engage the
Beast in melee combat focuses on its mauling tusks,
while a PC that stays far away notices the claws on
its hooves that help it burrow. These descriptions
can (and should!) contain contradictory details, as
the creature’s appearance is more myth than fact at
this point.

Read or paraphrase the following as the PCs approach
the Lake of Mists and Veils.
Just past the tree line, the elevation drops substantially.
From the eroded ground, tree roots emerge like tendrils. A
well‑marked trail slopes down to the rocky shore below. Past
the curve of the trail, haze burns off the lake. The fog still
clings to the day, softening the shape of the natural features
until they disappear into the milky distance. Bird calls, croaking
frogs, and the rustle of trees cut through this muffled world.
The sounds occasionally turn sharper, like a branch snapping
under something’s weight.
The drop-off between the tree line and the shore is
20 feet. The steep slope of the trail descends 5 feet per
square. The shoreline is rocky and solid beneath the PCs
feet, though occasional large rock formations jut out of the
sand and can be used for cover. The thick brush beneath
the tree provides cover for any creature within it. The
lake’s eponymous misty fog obscures vision past 100 feet.
STAKEOUT
The Birchfrost Beast’s patrols are irregular, so finding the
Beast requires patience on the part of the PCs. If they
choose to follow the hunters’ advice, the PCs can
choose to set up a stakeout in the area where the Beast
was last seen. The PCs have two rounds of preparation
available, with each round lasting approximately 1 hour.
However, the PCs aren’t aware of how much time they
have available; as far as they know, the beast could
arrive after any number of rounds.
Below are some common plans that PCs might try.
The DC for all skill checks is 16, though an appropriate
Lore skill might be DC 14. On a successful check, the
PC earns 1 Stakeout Point. On a critical success, the
PC earns 2 Stakeout Points. On a critical failure,
the PC loses 1 Stakeout Point. If the PCs present
a plan other than the ones below, do your best
to determine the appropriate skills, either using
DC 16 if the plan seems reasonable, or a higher
or lower DC if the plan is especially clever or
implausible. Spending an hour on a stakeout plan
is an exploration activity. Different PCs can attempt
different plans at the same time, and each contributes
to the others. For instance, if one PC is acting like a
careless hunter while another searches for tracks to
find the best approach and the remaining PCs prepare a
counter ambush, these all contribute to the stakeout.
Coax It Out: By mimicking the stories they heard
about the creature, a PC can attempt to coax the creature
out. This requires the PC to purposefully mimic the
behavior that summons it, such as setting traps or
attempting to cast nets into the lake. A Deception
or Society check is required to accurately
remember the stories and reenact the
actions in a believable manner.
Counter Ambush: The lakeside has ample cover, allowing
a PC to set up blinds to hide behind and prepare camouflage
in the hopes of spotting the beast as it moves through. PCs
using this option use the Avoid Notice exploration activity.
Preparing a hideaway requires a Stealth check.
Find Tracks: By assessing the area for natural game
trails or tracks with a Survival check, a PC can identify the
most likely approach that the Birchfrost Beast will take.
THE BEAST APPROACHES
MODERATE 3
After 2 hours of preparations, the Birchfrost Beast enters
the area during its patrol of the forest. The creature’s exact
approach and awareness of the PCs depends on how many
Stakeout Points the PCs earned.
3 or Fewer Points: The Birchfrost Beast notices the
subtle changes to the local area. It’s aware of the PCs as
it approaches the area and takes precautions. It Avoids
Notice as it approaches by burrowing from the east.
4–6 Points: The Birchfrost Beast approaches from the
west, unaware of the PCs’ current position.
7 or More Points: The PCs’ preparations hide them
expertly from the Beast until it’s almost upon them. It
approaches from the west and has the flat-footed condition
for the entirety of the first round.

Creatures: The Birchfrost Beast typically patrols this
area from west to east, seeking out any trappers in the tree
line before approaching the shore to find anglers. It focuses
on PCs that appear to be hunters, starting with any PCs
that attempted to raise its ire and Coax it Out during the
stakeout, then turning to those who use abilities like Hunt
Prey or items like snares during the fight. It uses hit-and-
run tactics, preferring to approach from underground, use
its Blur Form ability to disappear into the underbrush, and
then Stalk. If reduced to less than half its Hit Points, the
Birchfrost Beast attempts to flee back to its lair to the east.
THE BIRCHFROST BEAST
CREATURE 5
Rumored daeodon (page 61, Pathfinder Bestiary 43)
Initiative Perception +13
Speed 40 feet, burrow 40 feet
Development: The fleeing Birchfrost Beast points the
PCs in the right direction to find its lair, either by following
the creature as it attempts to escape or finding one of the
well-packed paths along the way. If the PCs defeated the
Birchfrost Beast before it started fleeing, Searching the area
uncovers these same tracks. Examining the tracks with a
DC 16 Survival check reveals the Birchfrost Beast is the
main creature using this path, but occasionally two smaller
but similarly hooved creatures also use this path. Following
the trampled path doesn’t require any skill checks and
leads the PCs down a winding route alongside the shore.
After about 10 minutes of walking, the path ends by an
eroded cliff (see area B).
B. Cliffside Lair
Nestled into the side of the cliff is an opening, large by
human standards but easily overlooked in the eroded
cliffside. This naturally occurring cave in the cliffside served
as the original lair of the Birchfrost Beast years ago, back
when it was only a foul-tempered daeodon. When the rich
man attempted to make his fortune, he camped too close
to the daeodon’s lair. At night, when it emerged to forage
for food, it caught the rich man unaware. A scuffle ensued,
and the daeodon was victorious. The transformation to the
Birchfrost Beast began later, after it tore out the rabbits
caught in snares during a hard winter. As its story and
reputation spread, its foul, territorial nature changed with
the tales, turning the Birchfrost Beast from an ordinary
creature to an ecological protector.
If the Birchfrost Beast escaped, it engages the PCs in a
desperate last stand at the entrance to this lair. It fights
more aggressively than by the lakeside and attempts to
injure the PCs enough to drive them off. Past the entrance,
light leaks in, illuminating area B1 and filtering to dim light
in area B2. The height of this cave is 10 feet.
B1. FOOL’S GALLERY
Read or paraphrase the following as the PCs enter the
cliffside lair.
Sunbeams filter through the ivy curtain at the entrance of the
cave, illuminating a grisly scene in soft lighting. Humanoid
corpses in varying states of decay are laid out in haphazard
positioning. Over a dozen bodies are present among the sickly
sweet stench of death.
A passageway in the cave winds past the corpses and into
deep shadow.
This area contains the remains of the poachers killed
by the Birchfrost Beast. The remains still have all their
possessions and have been killed in a similar manner. A
successful DC 18 Medicine check identifies the cause of
death as bodily trauma from when the Birchfrost Beast
charged at them with its tusks. None of the remains have
been consumed or otherwise disturbed. In all, the fifteen
bodies line up in a grisly timeline.
The first body is a tall human dressed in a quilted
damask vest, which a successful DC 18 Society identifies
as a fashionable style from approximately eight decades
ago. This is the original man from the Birchfrost Beast’s
tale. The next six bodies have about a decade between each
death, until the most recent eight that all died within the
past year. The newest body is a halfling whose leg is still
stuck in a snare and seems to have died about a week ago.
If the PCs return the halfling’s body to Birchfrost, they can
be identified as a tourist who was interested in gathering
local flowers for dye. The clothing and equipment on the
bodies are too soiled by decay to be of any value.
B2. THE NEST
MODERATE 3
Read or paraphrase the following as the PCs enter this area.
In the dim light of the cave, shadows obscure a den of long
grass. The air in this space stills, diminishing sound. Damp
natural clay forms the sides and floor of this area, making every
footstep squelch and covering everything in cool moisture.
The Birchfrost Beast and its family nest here. Crushed
acorn caps, bark, and tough bulbs litter the area, the
remains of the creatures’ meals. The grass den covers the
mate and whelp as the PCs arrive, though their breathing
and movement make it clear there are creatures here.
Hazard: A hampering web (Gamemastery Guide
77) spans the entrance to this area, just past the turn in
the cave. The Birchfrost Beast is aware of this web and
typically burrows under it when it leaves the area.
Creature: As the PCs enter this nest, the Birchfrost
Beast’s mate slumbers with its whelp. They sleep under
the long grass nest, stirring as the PCs enter. The grunting
snores are audible as they enter the area, alerting them
to the presence of the creatures. Unless the PCs made an
extraordinary amount of noise in the lair, the mate just
stirs from its slumber as they approach, giving them a
round to plan.
Prior to the death of the original Birchfrost Beast, its
mate was a mundane boar. However, with the death of the

Birchfrost Beast, the mate has started to transform to take
on that role. Already its snout is starting to elongate, and
its hooves adapt to dig into the ground. A PC can identify
this transformation with a successful DC 18 Nature or
Society check. On a critical success, they also realize this
transformation comes from the urban legends about
the beast. If the PCs manage to subdue and capture the
Birchfrost Beast alive, the transformation is more tenuous
as the legends of the indomitable beast strain against the
creature’s defeat and seek a new claimant.
As the mate and whelp awaken, they’re disoriented. The
PCs have a short window of opportunity to decide what
to do with the creatures before the disorientation turns to
territorial defense. Below are common plans the PCs might
choose. The listed skill checks all have a DC of 18. If a PC
critically fails, the mate immediately attacks to defend the
nest and the whelp joins in. If they present another plan, do
your best to determine the appropriate skills, either using
DC 18 if the plan seems reasonable, or a higher or lower
DC if the plan is especially clever or implausible.
Alter the Creature’s Story: The PCs might already be
aware of the Birchfrost Beast’s rumored nature from a
successful Recall Knowledge check, though it’s highly
unlikely. However, seeing the transformation in process
makes it much easier. They can attempt a Society check and
on a success realize the mate has begun transforming into
the creature of legend. With this success, they realize they
can change the Birchfrost Beast’s story to more appropriate
behavior, such as avoiding local Birchfrost trappers. To do
so, a PC must succeed at a Diplomacy, Performance, or
Society check as they tell a new version of the tale. On
a success, the PCs see the mate change to match the new
tale, such as relaxing if the new story says the Birchfrost
Beast is docile. Ultimately, they will need to spread their
tale throughout the settlement to ensure it endures.
Drive the Creature from the Area: If the PCs opt to drive
the Birchfrost Beast out of the area, they must first identify
an appropriate alternate habitat with a successful Nature
check. On a success, a PC can determine there’s safe area of
forest half a day’s walk outside of town that makes for poor
hunting and is rarely visited by any townsfolk as a result.
After determining where they want to drive the mate and
whelp, they must succeed at an Athletics, Intimidation, or
Nature check as they herd the creatures to their new home.
In their new home, the boars can’t be caught in the story
of the Birchfrost Beast, but in this case the story continues,
awaiting a new beast to take the mantle.
Take the Creature as a Companion: If a PC is interested
in taking one of the creatures as a companion, they can
attempt to form an initial bond with a successful Nature
check. The mate and whelp are both unfriendly to the PCs,
and the DC is increased from 18 to 23. A character with
wild empathy can attempt Diplomacy as normal for the
ability and the DC for the Diplomacy check is only 18. A
success on this check only indicates the mate and whelp are
willing to accompany the PC, as fully training the creature
is beyond the scope of this adventure. By traveling with the
PCs they escape the legend, just as in the previous plan, but
the mantle remains.
Combat: If a PC critically fails a skill check, the moment
of hesitation breaks to combat. The mate aggressively
defends the nest, trying to drive the PCs out by charging
and Shoving the opponent closest to her nest. The whelp is
an ambitious youngster that attempts to pick off weakened
or isolated PCs.

Conclusion
After ensuring the new Birchfrost Beast won’t harm the
town, the PCs can return. If they bring news of the trappers
or accompanied them back to town, Tola upholds her end
of the promise and gives them her finest pelt, a splendid
beaver skin worth 20 gp.
If the PCs return with the Birchfrost Beast, either with
the body of one of the creatures or a living companion,
this definitive proof turns them into local celebrities for
the next month. If they stay in Birchfrost, they receive
inquiries to see the Beast, tell the tale, and provide pointers
to other would-be cryptid hunters. If they don’t return
with proof, most of the town chalks their stories up to the
exaggerations of wandering adventurers.
If the PCs didn’t find the lair, or if they found it and let
the Birchfrost Beast’s mate and whelp remain there, what
happens next depends on if they returned with the Beast’s
body. With definitive proof, reports of the Birchfrost
Beast’s demise cause the transformation to slow. While the
tale still has its power, the accepted belief that the Beast is
dead means there’s no more requirement for a replacement.
While rumors might pick up again if someone goes missing,
they also might die off. The PCs may be able to add their
own inventions to the tale to avoid another tragedy, or
may even work to aggressively squash the tale and remind
the town the Birchfrost Beast was slain, creating an end
for the tale and causing the need for a beast to disappear.
Even if the PCs learned of the creatures’ true nature, they
still might opt to keep the tale alive. Even if the Birchfrost
Beast, its mate, and litter are dead, encouraging the tale will
eventually cause another creature in the area to transform
to match the rumors. The long-term fate of the Birchfrost
Beast is truly in the PCs’ hands.

Swirls in the Sand
Incident Location: Beachcomber, Shackles, Garund
Incident Type: Unknown. (Presumed Lure or Threshold?)
Reporting Archivist: Wendur Cricklee (unfinished report,
later filed by Kosha Mistparter)
Journal found in Archivist Cricklee’s
suitcase recovered from Port Peril auction:
Day 1
Day 1
I’ve arrived in the Shackles, sent by the Archive to follow
up on a strange rumor. Many build sandcastles in their
youth, but the tales from Beachcomber are different. It’s
not just children but a whole neighborhood building a
tower in the sand. The structure is said to possess strange
properties. I hope this isn’t another wild cauthooj chase,
but if it is, at least I’ll enjoy a pleasant stay at the beach
among fellow halflings.
Day 3
Day 3
The rumors are true. At first, all I found were children on
the beach building the same tiny, swirling tower. I took
it for local custom. Only after I traveled north along the
coast did I discover the truth. Hidden within a grove of
palm trees is a cove where ocean waves gently lap against
the sand. In the center of the cove lies the helical tower.
A gust of wind blew sand in my face as I drew close.
Though it was overcast, the grains felt warm to the touch,
as if under the hot sun for days. I brushed away the
sand, feeling its coarseness against my skin.
Young or old, regardless of ancestry, the people
seemed content with their work. They might’ve been on
an outing save for their utmost devotion to
the swirling sand spire. When I asked why
they were doing it they answered with a
calm smile. “We’re making things ready.
The swirls draw their eye and let
them know it’s safe.”
The work required to maintain
the structure never ceases. The people
work in shifts at different hours of the
day and continuously during rough
weather or a storm.
My spells confirmed the triple helix
tower is magical in nature, though
what type of magic eludes me. The image of the place does
stick in the mind, however...
Day 5
Day 5
Further tests yield no information. I need better equipment
if I’m to ascertain what kind of powers this thing
possesses. The people are unusually placid. They don’t care
if I cast spells on their creation—they don’t even mind if I
take samples. In fact, they encouraged me to do so.
Day 9
Day 9
Bad dreams. I woke to find my sheets tossed on the
ground in a familiar pattern. At breakfast, I spilled
coffee and noticed my finger tracing the brown liquid in
a helix. I see the tower everywhere now—just a natural
side effect from spending so many days studying the
phenomena, that’s all. My will is strong, my mental and
spiritual defenses are impenetrable. I’m a thaumaturge
of the Dark Archive and it will take more than some silly
sandcastle to get in my head. Only... why did I find myself
turning widdershins while waiting in line to pay my bill?
Widdershins, the same direction as the spire, the beautiful
edifice of swirling sand...
Later Note:
Later Note: Wendur Cricklee was last seen
leaving Beachcomber, heading north along
the coast.

Swirling sand carries a faint trace of strange
compulsions from the helical sand spire
near Beachcomber. Adding this catalyst
to a suggestion spell implants a strange
compulsion in one target of the spell. The target
creature must spin counterclockwise at the end
of its turn if it didn’t take a move action that
turn. This spin is a free action that has the
move trait. This effect lasts for 3 rounds on
a success, failure, or critical failure against
suggestion (even if the target completes its
suggestion in fewer rounds); a target that
critically succeeds against suggestion is
unaffected by the swirling sand.

On the Topic of the Twin
Village
Incident Location: Podinhi Village, Johar Mountains,
western Vudra
Incident Type: Keystone (possible qualities of Shadow
type, pending further investigation)
Reporting Archivist: Imshaidi Jikhtari
The following is an excerpt from an interview with a
man named Sawis, whom I found waiting patiently for
me upon my arrival.
Imshaidi Jikhtari: Do you know who I am? And why
I’m here?
Sawis: I only know what Shrivan told me: he
spoke with you in the streets of Niswan, and
you wanted to come study our home. Is that
about right, Pathfinder?
Jikhtari: I don’t know that “study” is quite
the correct term. It’s more I want to learn
about Podinhi with your help, though I come
here with the most respectful of intentions.
Sawis: As you say, Pathfinder. What do
you want to know?
Jikhtari: Your twin, Shrivan,
told me everyone is born a twin
in this village, and you’re
able to speak with each
other in your dreams. This
is true?
Sawis: So it is. Every time
there’s a birth, there are
twins. Sometimes even double twins, though
that’s rarer.
Jikhtari: And you’re all able to cast dream magic?
Sawis: No, Pathfinder, we don’t cast any spells. We
aren’t wizards or psychics. We simply talk. Just like
you and I are talking now.
Jikhtari: I see. How often do you talk with Shrivan?
Sawis: About as often as anybody would talk to
family, I suppose: a couple nights a week, more if
something special is happening, less if we’re busy.
The normal amount.
Jikhtari: Of course, normal. You do understand that,
normally, most people aren’t born as twins, let alone twins
who can speak to each other in dreams, yes?
Sawis: Normal depends on the person. For you,
maybe it’s strange. For us, it’s part of life. Just like
traveling across the world to talk to someone might
be normal for you but seems strange to me.
Jikhtari: Well, I suppose I can’t dispute that claim. Tell
me, do you know the source of your birth, your abilities?
Sawis: The source is just us, Pathfinder. There’s no
special reason—it simply is. Though in the past,
some have given a name to it: “dohtsaeka.”
Jikhtari: Dohtsaeka? I’ve studied the dialect, but I’m
afraid I don’t know that word.
Sawis: It’s a little difficult to explain. It’s like being
together. It means a bond so strong it remains
intact no matter how far you pull it. It means two
people who are separate but are also one.
Jikhtari: That is rather touching. It seems like there’s
no shortage of learning for me. Do you think the rest of the
village would be amenable to talking to me?
Sawis: Shrivan believes you mean no
harm and that should be enough
for them. He’s often quite right
about those sorts of things. In
the meantime, you’re welcome to
stay here. There’s plenty of room
and Asmani will be excited to
learn you’re here. She’s
always wanted to talk to a
Pathfinder.
Jikhtari: I’d be happy to
oblige such a request.
Asmani is your partner,
I presume? Will she be
returning soon?
Sawis: That would be
surprising, she’s dead.
Jikhtari: Oh. I’m sorry for your
loss. How, then, do you intend on telling
her? Can you dream speak with her too?
Sawis: Don’t be ridiculous—she’s my wife, not my
sister! No, I write letters for her sister Kantika to
read at night and Kantika writes down her replies.
Jikhtari: One could almost say it’s like she never left.
Sawis: I told you, Pathfinder. The distance doesn’t
matter—it’s dohtsaeka.
CHILD OF THE TWIN VILLAGE
BACKGROUND
RARE
You were born in a village where everyone has a twin with a
special link. You have moved to the wider world for reasons
of your own, but you still have an unbreakable connection to
your twin through your dreams.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Diplomacy and Dreamlands Lore. You gain
the ability to communicate with your twin in your dreams. You
and your twin gain the effects of dream message every night,
only between the two of you; this isn’t a spell, but a natural
effect. Unless your twin is another PC, your GM roleplays your
twin or summarizes your interaction during these dreams.

A secret society wears its nature in its name; it is, first and
foremost, a secret. We hide our hearts from the outside
world because we know others won’t understand or
approve of our efforts. We hide from unkind rivals, from
the laws of nations or gods, and from the opprobrium of
society at large. Some secret societies are harmless bands
of well-meaning fools out to enjoy a pleasant evening,
but most are criminals in the eyes of their peers, delvers
into the taboo and the forbidden.
Second, it is a society. Unlike mere criminal gangs,
there’s ritual, there’s rule, there’s a way of order that
makes us more than just a loose collection of motley
allies. Most secret societies claim traditions and a long
history, and when such things are unavailable, they
invent them; it’s something of a tradition for a secret
society to claim ancestry dating to the Four Pharaohs
of Osirion, Choral the Conqueror, or Thassilon. These
claims are mostly lies. A few, we suppose, might be telling
the truth—I did encounter once in Senghor a gentleman
who admitted to being a librarian-assassin, and that his
order had been sanctioned since the days of the Azlanti.
I expressed skepticism, but he spoke seven words to me
then, and Archivist Onreni corroborated them later as a
formula used by Azlanti judges prior to sentencing one
to death. Perhaps the founder of the gentleman’s order
knew more Azlanti than most and used it to give their
society a sense of realism, but it’s not entirely impossible
the group truly was ancient.
THE NATURE OF CONSPIRACY
There are three ways, we’ve found, of organizing a
proper secret society. At the one extreme, there’s the cell:
small, isolated, secretive. At the other is the pyramid:
hierarchical, controlled, vulnerable. In between is the
Pathfinders’ structure, the humble chapter, independent
geographic structures, that are free enough to operate
as they see fit, but organized enough to take larger-scale
action as needed.
A WEB OF CONNECTIONS
Secret Societies, Underground
Organizations, Those Who Whisper
The irony of secret societies is that we’re just one more conspiracy. Our goals are
greater, our means more substantial, but when we look at these others, we see
fellow spiders, all of us weaving our webs of fact and fiction, lies and truth, until
we catch whatever prey we choose to hunt—or it catches us.

Cells are the smallest and most secretive of
conspiracies. Each one consists of at least three people,
rarely more than a dozen, who are known to one
another. There’s a single cell leader, who is in contact
with a few other cell leaders, usually reporting to some
higher master or facilitator. The masters of the society
have no idea of the identity of most of their members, as
the cell leader doesn’t pass that information along. Nor
does the membership know of those above them. And
each cell leader knows about only their own cell.
The advantage of such an organization is it’s nigh
impossible to root out. If a key member is slain, then
contact is lost, and it becomes impossible to follow
the chain and wrap up the entire conspiracy. The
disadvantage, of course, is that it becomes a trivial
matter to misplace a cell, and a single death might
splinter a group entirely. Archivist Meila reports she
encountered two cells of a Brotherhood of Seven in
Varisia. One was dedicated to the summoning of a
certain daemon, the other equally committed to ensuring
its eternal imprisonment. Neither seemed entirely aware
their historic foes were but a rival tradition of their own
secret society, and which came first is impossible to say.
The pyramid is at the other end spectrum: a
traditional hierarchy of king and country with ranks,
titles, and chains of command. There’s a leader—one or
many—and then below them officers, and below them
lieutenants, and below them still the common members
of the society, milling about like so many ants. The
advantage of such a structure is clarity; everyone knows
where they stand and who the society’s leadership is. The
disadvantage is the centralized nature of the conspiracy
makes it vulnerable—there’s but a single ruling power,
often located in a single place, and if they’re slain, the
whole thing collapses.
Then there’s the chapter. It sits somewhat between
the two extremes, not as secretive or decentralized
as the cell, but not as vulnerable as the pyramid. The
conspiracy consists of separate chapters, each one
given primacy over a particular territory. The chapters
communicate and know one another on the level of
leadership but aren’t as siloed off as cells. There may be
some overarching authority, but it’s typically more a first
among equals, not absolute control of a pyramid.
Societies
keep
their
secrecy
in
diverse
ways.
Cell‑structured conspiracies are usually the most
absolute in remaining hidden. Their name and nature are
thoroughly unknown, and the cells go to considerable
lengths to keep it that way. Chapters and especially
pyramids, on the other hand, tend to be too big to hide.
Instead, they disguise themselves as some more innocent
organization, like a wasp pretending to be a bumblebee:
a social club, a hunting society, sometimes a religious sect.
In such cases, usually there’s an inner membership that’s
fully a part of the conspiracy and an outer membership
that’s ignorant of the society’s nature and believes it to
be what it claims. On occasion, there are further layers,
so a member might first believe themselves a member of
a fraternal drinking club, and then a criminal conspiracy,
and only then initiated into the society’s deeper secrets.
Recruitment is always a challenge for secret societies.
Most societies recruit from a particular pool of
applicants, people who suit them on an ideological level.
One society might take members from the disaffected
and marginalized, another recruits from the cream of the
aristocracy. They tailor their pitches to their proposed
membership and recruit slowly and deliberately,
drawing members into their web one hesitant step at
a time. Societies with cover organizations usually have
an advantage in this regard; if one is looking to recruit
corrupt occultists, then managing a library is an effective
way of locating such dubious characters.
The counterpart, of course, is once one’s in a society,
one does not leave. Many initiates swear fearsome oaths
and make dire promises of vengeance should they leave
or share their conspiracy’s secrets. In Iblydos, I met a
coterie of wizards who had to provide their true names,
written in blood, to the conspiracy’s grand ledger.
More mundane secret societies simply ensure they
have plentiful extortion options for anyone before they
become a member. Others threaten to kill defectors and
follow up on their threats with aplomb.
A THOUSAND SHADOWS
Over the years, our organization has encountered many
secret societies and conspiracies. Though my fellow
archivists have rarely been able to fully catalog their
organizational structure, we’ve learned at least few
pinpricks of information.
The Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye
A walking contradiction in terms, the Esoteric Order of
the Palatine Eye is the largest and most public secret
society in the Inner Sea region. Any child may tell of its
elegant cathedrals, of the three Thrones that make up its
ranks, of their members’ belief in the numinous power
of self-enlightenment and of the raw power they wield.
Yet secrets remain.
 The order is a chapter-style conspiracy headquartered
in Ustalav, but with tendrils snaking throughout much of
the Inner Sea. After its homeland, its strongest presence
is in Osirion; that ancient land casts a glimmering
fascination upon the order. Each chapter, called a
“Cathedral,” is essentially independent, although
the Cathedral of Caliphas is first among equals. The
order recruits from the wealthy and educated, and at
this point, its membership is reason enough to join, as
initiates are expected to support and aid one another
in all endeavors. To become an ally of such a group is
no small prize. The membership is further divided into
the three Thrones. The Third Throne is the general
rank‑and-file, and most members who are interested

purely in self-advancement reside there. The Second and
First Thrones, meanwhile, consist of the conspiracy’s
elders and sages, its mystics and hierophants.
Though the minute details are obscured, we’ve
uncovered enough information over the years to
grasp the order’s twin mandate. First, they believe in
enlightenment. The order teaches that all creatures
possess a divine spark, and through ritual and
meditation, the order cultivates
this spark, fanning it into a
mighty flame. In theory, a
sufficiently enlightened being
can do remarkable things. One
is reminded of Irori’s ascension
to godhood.
The
order’s
other
mandate
is
much
more pragmatic. Their
members believe certain
knowledge is dangerous,
and so go out of their way
to secure strange artifacts or
obscure lore they deem unhealthy to Golarion at large.
Usually, they prefer to pay someone else to do the actual
acquisition, after which they ensconce the prize in one
of their less public Cathedrals, away from unworthy
eyes. They judge who’s worthy, of course.
Codicil: The Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye is
fascinated with all things Osirion. We’ve heard it said
their founder, Count Aldus Aldon Canter of Vieland,
encountered the fallen angel Tabris in a tomb in that old
land and learned from the angel the fundamentals that
would become the order’s philosophy. He wrote them
in a book, the Lost Gospels of Tabris. We’ve tried to
obtain a copy but have had no luck thus far.
The Way of the Kirin
Another chapter-based conspiracy, the Way of the Kirin
is an example of just how difficult it is to root out a
sufficiently determined secret society. Formed in Imperial
Lung Wa about 400 years ago, the Way of the Kirin
presented itself as a merchant consortium on the surface
while harboring a decidedly revolutionary political
agenda. Reading between the lines of the denunciations
that followed later, one gets the impression they were
mostly crusaders for just governance, fair wages and
work practices, and social rights. Needless to say, they
earned a host of enemies.
When Lung Wa fell, the Way of the Kirin was caught
off guard, and numerous chapters were destroyed
by their foes. Some survived, however—primarily in
Goka, Lingshen, and Shokuro—by going underground.
Today, the society is not quite as weak as it was in
the immediate aftermath of Lung Wa’s fall, though it’s
still far from what it used to be. A few years back, it
founded a few new chapters in the Inner Sea region, in
Katheer and Absalom, and forged an alliance with the
Pathfinder Society for reasons that undoubtedly made
sense to its members.
Currently, the Way of the Kirin is locked in a brutal
struggle with the Golden League, a collection of
organized crime lords that pervades Tian Xia. At its
height, the way was known for wealth, honor, and
a willingness to use force to defeat its foes. Perhaps
its sojourn in the dark has taught it cunning now
as well.
The Cat and Mouse Society
A secret society of much more recent
vintage, the Cat and Mouse Society was
founded in Aspenthar in Thuvia
about 30 years ago. It’s a group
with a brutal philosophy: all
the world can be divided into
two groups, the weak and the
strong, the prey and the predator,
the victim and the victimizer, the
mouse and the cat. Members of the
society see themselves as cats, and believe it’s their
prerogative—indeed, their sublime right to do with the
mice as they please.
For the outer circle of the society, this mostly translates
into being aristocrats of a particularly obnoxious sort.
They attend risqué parties, drink a great deal of wine,
peruse scandalous art, and generally indulge in illicit
vices, but only in a rote fashion. But there exists an inner
circle, and I’ve seen it at work. Compared to the outer
circle, the adepts of the society are older, more cunning,
and much, much more vicious.
The central rite is the Hunt, which I once had the
dubious honor of witnessing. An occult ritual exists that
gives their victims the heads of mice and makes them
paranoically afraid of all things feline, while binding
them to reside in a certain place. The society then hunts
their victims, garbed in cat masks, and kills them—the
purest expression of its twisted philosophy.
Most members of the inner circle of the Cat and
Mouse Society are mages of some sort, and the group
as a whole has a unified pyramid structure with three
leaders at its pinnacle. The High Sire is the Master of
the Hunt and the keeper of the Great Black Sphinx, an
otherworldly cat the size of a lion. The High Talon is
the Master of the Lodge, in charge of recruitment and
propaganda, the society’s public face—his name is Tabar
Rashem, and he is the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the royal court of Prince Zinlo (which means he is the
man who would handle the actual sale of the sun orchid
elixir should it take place in Aspenthar). Finally, there
is the Grand Malkin, the Master of the Rites and the
society’s main occultist. Curiously, the man I know to be
the Grand Malkin, one Kideiun Maqem, died about five
years ago. Yet rumors say he somehow rules the society

through some sort of connection with a person known
only as the Grand Dam.
The Marlview Village Society
I have in front of me right now Archivist Krayne’s
report of a peculiar little society from the River
Kingdoms, in the village of Marlview. Presuming I can
decipher
Krayne’s
execrable
handwriting, she was initially
visiting a small village just
outside Brevoy to follow up a
rumor that something has been
buried there since the days of
Old Koloran. The villagers were
entirely helpful and friendly,
even when Archivist Krayne,
somewhat the worse for drink,
let slip what precisely she was
looking for.
That very evening, two of
the villagers came to her room
in the local inn and tried to
strangle her. Archivist Krayne,
being a remarkable agent even
when somewhat incapacitated with drink, was able
to disarm them and presented them to the proper
authorities the next morning, whereupon she was
arrested for attacking two of the local worthies and
was forced to escaped from the village jail (a root cellar
when not in use as a cell). She reports she eventually
found a tunnel beneath the mayor’s house, which led her
to a subterranean chamber containing, in her words, “a
great sarcophagus of gleaming, ebony metal, 40 paces
long and half as wide, undecorated.” Archivist Krayne
was forced to escape the village at that point, pursued
by hunters with hounds, until she eventually crossed a
river and was able to secure refuge in a major town. She
was most irritated.
We believe the secret society Archivist Krayne
uncovered was dedicated to watching over the
sarcophagus, either to protect it from any who might
wish it harm or to protect the rest of the world from
whatever lies within. The society clearly had penetrated
all levels of Marlview’s civic infrastructure and was able
to use it to force Archivist Krayne to retreat.
Marlview is not unique. For all that we focus on
the great conspiracies and webs of intrigue, there are
dozens, perhaps hundreds, of small groups hidden in the
back roads and dismal forests of Golarion, little spiders
hidden in cupboards, out of sight and out of mind.
The Exarchate of the Infinite Clock
If one is to believe Archivist Varien’s increasingly
unhinged missives, the Exarchate of the Infinite Clock
is a rather malignant cabal of surgeons, engineers, and
mages, dedicated to achieving an arcane apotheosis
through the replacement of portions of the brain with
precisely calibrated magical clockworks—unlikely to be
successful, but likely to have a high body count.
Archivist Varien suspects, and we think he’s likely
correct, they originated in Alkenstar, probably sometime
in the last half-century. Precise information is difficult
to come by, as the clockmakers are a highly secretive
organization
of
small
cells
largely uninterested in their
own history. We can say for
certain that clockmaker agents
have been found in much of
northern Garund and western
Casmaron—a cell was uncovered
in Katheer about a year ago.
Clockmakers derive from the
Nexian understanding of magic
as a tool of the world’s creation,
that spells are simply leftover
instructions from what came
before. They further believe that
with a sufficiently advanced
understanding of mathematics,
one can improve the power of
one’s spellcrafting to absurd heights. Reasonable. They
also theorize that by utilizing ancient Jistkan automaton
techniques, one can replace portions of the brain with
occult devices that make them more powerful mages,
with a theoretical “Infinite Clock” granting near‑deific
power. Riskier, but not the strangest thing we’ve
encountered.
The clockmakers prefer not to experiment on
themselves and instead kidnap unsuspecting victims,
ideally apprentice mages or hedge-witches, and use them
as a testing ground for their studies. Here is where they
cross the line from strange theory to sinister conspiracy.
Most victims die from such invasive brain surgery, and
the few survivors, who, in fairness, do show a great deal
of power, are killed lest they endanger the cell.
Assuming we can take the Katheer cell as typical,
the society’s clockmakers typically operate in cells of
a half dozen, with a single mage-engineer conducting
experiments while the rest of the cabal secures victims,
deals with authorities, and makes certain there’s a
suitable location in which to conduct arcane surgeries.
Someplace quiet, remote.
Through informants, we’ve gotten the impression
that the clockmakers are almost as concerned about
each other as they are about the authorities objecting
to their gruesome research. A conspiracy of scientist
serial killers is hardly a convivial bunch, and each
clockmaker cell is deeply paranoid a rival is going to
develop the Infinite Clock before it does. In fact, we
believe the Katheer cell was uncovered through the
actions of a rival cell in the form of anonymous tip‑offs
to the satrap’s agents.

Prerequisites expert in Occultism
Frequency once per hour
You’ve learned how to read the natural auras of other living
creatures. To do this, you must focus on a single living target
without blinking for 1 minute. You can do this while performing
some other minor task—such as making conversation to
distract from your intentions—but you can’t blink or otherwise
lose your concentration. You can then perceive any or all of
the following information.
•	 The target’s current apparent attitude toward you
(friendly, indifferent, and so on).
•	 The target’s current apparent emotional state.
•	 A general assessment of the target’s physical health, such
as what conditions or afflictions it has. You might need
to succeed at an Occultism check against the affliction
or condition’s DC to detect the presence of a specifically
hidden or subtle condition or affliction.
In addition, the GM rolls a secret Occultism check for you
against the target’s Deception DC. If your result exceeds your

When confronted with the unknown, you can receive
knowledge beyond your own experience via written messages
delivered by your hand. You spend 10 minutes seated while
holding a writing utensil, using it to make small circular
motions as you open your mind to the forces around you. You
receive information as your hand writes on its own, guided
by spirits. At the end of these 10 minutes, Recall Knowledge
with any Lore skill in which you are not trained, using your
Occultism modifier instead of your modifier with that skill. The
strain of this spirit channeling leaves you stupefied 1 for the
next 10 minutes.

HEALING
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You firmly believe in the technique of strengthening one’s
life force, spiritual energies, and bodily fluids through the
application of colored light. When using a torch, lantern, or
other artificial light source to illuminate an area of dim light
or darker, you use a combination of alchemical reagents,
medicinal components, and colored lenses to turn that light
one of seven colors, allowing you to help an ally recover from
persistent damage. You give that target an assisted recovery,
but the target can be anywhere within the bright light of
the light source instead of needing to be adjacent to you.
Ambient bright light (like sunlight) drowns out your artificial
illumination and prevents you from using Chromotherapy.
The color of the light you choose determines the type of
persistent damage from which you help the target recover.

Red
You increase blood flow to heat the body,
attempting to end persistent cold damage.
Orange	 You cancel out electric charge, attempting to end
persistent electricity damage.
Yellow	 You reduce pain and mental stress, attempting to
end persistent mental damage.
Green
You promote blood flow in a way that helps clot
wounds, attempting to end persistent bleed
damage.
Blue
You cool the body, attempting to end persistent
fire damage.
Indigo
You render acids inert, attempting to end

Prerequisites trained in Occultism
You know how to stimulate a body’s natural healing abilities
through the application of resonant crystals. Doing so requires
you to use at least two semiprecious stones with a total value
of 5 gp or more in place of healer’s tools, which allows you to
attempt to Treat Disease or Treat Poison using Occultism rather
than Medicine. Examples and prices of semiprecious stones can
be found on page 114 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.
If you’re an expert in Occultism and you use gems whose
total value equals or exceeds 50 gp, you gain a +1 item bonus
to your Occultism check. If you’re a master and the gems’
value equals or exceeds 700 gp, the item bonus increases

if it stems from an underground spring or is piped through a
wall—this technique points you in the right direction. The GM
determines the DC, which is usually the trained simple DC with
a hard or very hard adjustment if the source of water is small.
If you’re an expert in Survival, the GM also makes a Survival

and nearby graves. The DC is usually the expert simple DC,
with DC adjustments for smaller deposits.

Prerequisites master in Nature
You’ve attuned your natural aura to that of plant life, coaxing
it to grow faster than normal. You sit for 10 minutes with a
small, natural non-creature plant—such as a lone flower, a
small bush, or a potted succulent—while you bring your aura
in tune through meditation. You coax the plant to advance one
stage in its life cycle: from seed to sprout, sprout to plant,
plant to flower, or flower to fruit. If the plant doesn’t have
proper nutrients (if you’re sprouting a seed without soil or
water, for example), the plant withers 5 minutes after you
complete the activity. Performing this activity more than
once per day renders you fatigued and unable to use Morphic

With a touch, you can read the psychic impressions left on
objects by their previous owners. This exploration activity
functions similarly to Detect Magic in that you move at half
your travel speed or slower while looking for psychometric
resonance. You must brush your bare hands over any objects
you pass while you do this. This detects objects with significant
emotional resonance attached to them, such as the joy from
a child’s beloved teddy bear, the sorrow from a widower’s
wedding ring, or the fear from a victim’s murder weapon. If
you’re looking for a particular type of emotional resonance,
you can choose to ignore other emotions. If you find an item
with that resonance, you can explore that resonance with the
following action.
Psychometric Assessment (concentrate, divination, emotion,
exploration, mental, occult) Requirements Your bare hands
are touching an object in which you detected psychometric
resonance; Effect You spend 1 minute concentrating on
the object to get a vision of the face of the person who
imbued the item with such emotion in the first place. If the
associated emotion is painfully negative, you might take
1d6 psychic damage, as determined by the GM.

SECRET SOCIETY MEMBER ADJUSTMENTS
You can turn an existing creature into a secret society
member by completing the following steps. This
adjustment is best applied to NPCs and other humanoid
creatures rather than beasts or other monsters.
Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics
as follows.
• 	 Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, the Perception
modifier, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.
• 	 Increase Deception and Society to be primary skills
for the creature’s new level.
•	 Increase either Diplomacy or Intimidation to be a
primary skill for the creature’s new level, and the
other to be a secondary skill.
•	 Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive
abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small
number of times (such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon),
increase the damage by 2 instead.
•	 Increase HP by the amount listed on the table.

Secret Society Member Special Abilities
All secret society members gain the following abilities.
Connected The secret society member has numerous
connections, especially within the broad band of social
class from which the society recruits, but stretching further
through friendships, extortion, and other forms of influence.
Whenever encountering a character from a settlement
where the secret society has influence, the secret society
member can attempt a Society check with an easy DC for
the level of the encountered character if that character is a
member of the demographic from which the secret society
recruits, and a DC of hard or higher for other characters.
On a success, the secret society member has a connection
with that character they can use to ingratiate themself or
push that character into acting the way the secret society
member wants. This grants the secret society member
a +2 circumstance bonus to Make an Impression, Coerce,
Demoralize, or Request. On a critical success, the connection
is especially strong or powerful and might even include a
direct connection with the secret society. The circumstance
bonus increases to +4. A secret society member can use this
ability on a PC, though beyond Demoralize, the connection
is more of a roleplay note informing their interactions with
the PC.
Shibboleth Secret society members can communicate
with other members of their secret society using coded
language that seems innocuous enough to go unnoticed
SECRET SOCIETY MEMBER
A secret society member is an NPC or creature that belongs to a covert organization with influence and connections
throughout its local setting and perhaps beyond. Characters with this adjustment have been elevated from the outer
periphery of the secret society and possess some leverage in its halls of power, able to command the loyalty of other
members and use their connections to their advantage. Secret society members have received advanced training from
their organization, which makes them slightly more of a threat in combat than they would be otherwise, but much of
their power is expressed in social situations.

by most onlookers. A creature specifically gauging the
conversation, such as with Sense Motive, can attempt
a secret Perception check against the secret society
member’s Deception DC to notice something secret has
been communicated, after which they can attempt a
Society check against the same DC. On a success, they
discover the rough topic of the message; on a critical
success, they discover the exact message.
Additional Abilities
A given secret society member gains two to three of the
following abilities, as befit the nature of their secret society
and their role within that society. For instance, a society
among the downtrodden, planning a violent uprising, might
grant the tag team ability, whereas a society within a
wealthy aristocracy might be unwilling to get its hands dirty
and grant the get out of jail ability instead.
Get out of Jail It’s almost impossible to force the secret
society member to face the consequences of their actions.
Their society has fingers in the halls of law and justice,
and where it can’t sway the verdict, it can at least arrange
the escape. When the secret society member would be
brought to justice for their crimes, they attempt a Society
check against a simple DC, depending on the severity
of their crimes and the exposure of the evidence to the
public. This is typically an expert simple DC of 20.
Critical Success Not only is the secret society member
exonerated but they also manage to stay clean in
the eyes of the public. Those who attempted to bring
them to justice are called in for harassment, libel, filing
frivolous charges, or other trumped-up indictments.
Success The secret society member is declared not guilty
and exonerated of their crimes in the eyes of the law.
Failure While the secret society member is initially
declared guilty, they’re released on a technicality, or
manage to bribe or sneak their way out. While they’re
free, their reputation has been damaged.
Critical Failure Justice prevails, and the secret society
member can’t escape their sentence. Their society likely
cuts ties with them and might turn to more dramatic
means to ensure they can’t expose the society.
Not Today! [reaction] Frequency once per day; Trigger The secret
society member is reduced to 0 Hit Points; Effect Whether
it’s a fellow society member waiting in the wings to spirit
them away, a clever contraption, a contingent spell, or
some other means, a secret society member always has an
escape plan. Instead of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, the
secret society member remains at 1 Hit Point. They gain
temporary Hit Points equal to their level and then Stride
twice. If they have the appropriate forms of movement,
they can instead choose to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim.
Prepared Diversion [free-action] Frequency once per hour; Effect The
secret society member has fellow members in all sorts of
places, ready to make a distraction to help them duck from
sight or make a quick attack against their foe. The secret
society member either Creates a Diversion or Feints. If they
Create a Diversion, it doesn’t gain either the auditory,
linguistic, or manipulate trait (since someone else has
provided the diversion), and onlookers who have already
been diverted by the secret society member don’t receive
a +4 circumstance bonus against the attempt. If they Feint,
they don’t need to be in melee reach of their target, and the
benefit applies to both melee and ranged attacks against
their target.
Prepared Trap [one-action] Frequency once per hour; Effect The secret
society member’s agents trapped the area in advance, and
the secret society member arms one such snare. The secret
society member chooses an unoccupied space within 60
feet and activates a snare hidden there; the snare can be
any common snare of the secret society’s member’s level –
2 or lower (minimum level 1). From this point on, creatures
can trigger the snare as normal. During the activation, the
secret society member must attempt a Deception check
against the Perception DCs of creatures observing them;
on a failure, those creatures realize where the secret
society member activated the snare.
Skill Savvy The secret society member has a few tricks
most others do not. They gain two of the following skill
feats: Charming Liar, Courtly Graces, Glean Contents,
Hobnobber, Lengthy Diversion, Lie to Me, Quick
Coercion, or Streetwise. If they are at least 2nd level,
they can also choose from among the following: Discreet
Inquiry, Glad Hand, or Lasting Coercion. If they are at
least 7th level, they can also choose Shameless Request
or Slippery Secrets.
Tag Team A secret society member works best with other
members of the same society (whether they have the
secret society member adjustment and this ability or
not). Any creature is flat-footed against a secret society
member’s melee attacks due to flanking as long as the
enemy is within both the secret society member’s reach
and the reach of one allied creature that is a member of
the same secret society. Against a creature within the
reach of two or more allied creatures that are members
of the same secret society, the secret society member’s
Strikes deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.
SECRET SOCIETY MEMBERS IN GOLARION
Golarion is a world of many secrets, so it’s
unsurprisingly full of secret societies. While some
such organizations exist in isolated settlements and
might be so ubiquitous within those communities
as to encompass nearly the entire populace,
secret societies are more common in urban
areas. The regions heaviest with secret societies
include decadent nobilities with storied pasts like
Taldor and Ustalav, intrigue-laden courts of the
successor states to Imperial Lung Wa in Tian Xia,
and cosmopolitan metropolises like Absalom and
Katapesh. Since Goka falls into two of these three
categories, it’s especially rife with secret societies.

purchased by tourists. The glittering scarab, though,
can be squeezed gently, causing the wings to part and reveal
an eye painted underneath them. This pin is used to gain
entrance to most meetings of the Esoteric Order of the

and purchasers tend to return to the same weaver
each time to ensure new cords match previous
ones. In a room lit only by dim candlelight, the
reflective metal threads shimmer in a specific

revealed by exposing the stamped item to direct moonlight
for 1 minute. A character checking a good or document
marked by a moonlit ink stamp must succeed at a
DC 25 Perception check to spot the stamp without
exposure to moonlight. In addition to its use by
secret societies for their secret books, papers, and

SECRET SOCIETY GEAR
Secret societies employ all sorts of tools to help their members and safe houses stay secret, but they’ve learned over time
that magic items themselves can sometimes attract attention rather than divert it, necessitating the use of even more
magic, in the form of wards or illusions, merely to prevent the item from alerting magically inclined investigators. Thus,
they’ve also taken to using non‑magical tools of the trade that are much more difficult to detect.

SELF-IMMOLATING NOTE
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
ALCHEMICAL
CONSUMABLE
FIRE
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
Access Member of a secret society
This paper is crafted with an unusual formula, causing it to catch
fire and self-immolate 5 minutes after being exposed to the air.
The item activates automatically when the envelope is opened,
which typically takes an Interact action. Anyone holding the
note when it catches fire takes 1 fire damage. Often, these
notes are given as practical jokes or threats, but secret societies
find them quite useful when sharing information about
upcoming meetings or any other relevant news.
These letters must be written in haste and require
the use of their accompanying envelopes,
which prevent air from interacting with the
paper until the envelope’s seal is broken.
SIBLING’S COIN
ITEM 1
UNCOMMON
Price 10 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Access Member of a secret society
Contrary to widespread belief, secret handshakes are not the
preferred method of confirmation between secret society
members, mostly because this would be obvious in the middle
of a crowded street or busy tavern. Instead, societies tend to
mark each other by carrying sibling’s coins. The name was
originally coined by a past secret society that has since fallen into
obscurity, but its ingenious coins remain. The coins are
innocuous, resembling common silver coins until
the owner twists the outer edge clockwise. At
this point, the face of the coin rotates to reveal
the symbol of the secret society of the owner.
Suspected compatriots often toy with their
coins as a half-recognized fidget, before
trying to subtly flash the inscription to
their fellow conversationalist.
While it’s possible to notice the coin’s
mechanism if you specifically check
the coin (DC 20 Perception), few people
individually inspect coins unless they have a
reason to be suspicious of them.
SILENT BELL
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
Price 600 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Access Member of a secret society
This large handbell is made from cast bronze and has a
wooden handle. The outside of the bell is covered in fine
etchings, showing a group of varied people sitting around a
table with clouds obscuring anyone in the background. The
clapper is curiously absent from this bell and, when idly rung,
it produces no audible sound.
Activate [three-actions] envision, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect The silent bell creates an invisible wall surrounding
a cube, 20 feet to a side, that prevents sound from passing
into or from the cube for 10 minutes. The wall isn’t solid and
doesn’t prevent anything but sound from passing through.
Since the cube is invisible, creatures can still read lips and
body language through the wall.
SOCIETY PORTRAIT
ITEM 6
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
Price 210 gp
Bulk 1
Access Member of a secret society
These large portraits are commonly commissioned
by secret societies to display their current member
ranks, and to protect against members who would
break their vows to keep their secrets. Each member
being painted gives their consent to be traced by the
portrait, and they agree to keep their vows for as long
as their membership stands or until death, whichever
comes first. This consent can be transferred to a new
portrait if one is needed once the society expands,
without needing another confirmation.
Should a member betray the secrets of their society, their
image in the society portrait changes within 10 minutes, altering
the image of the member by spelling out “TRAITOR” across their
form. It provides no details on the specifics of the betrayal. The
traitor can attempt a DC 30 Will save or Deception check at the
time they betrayed a secret to avoid the portrait revealing their

TRAITOR’S RING
ITEM 0

Price 15 sp
Usage worn; Bulk —
Access Member of a secret society
This ring has a thick band supporting a square‑cut
gem that can be customized to the buyer’s
preference. The thickness of the band allows it to be
taken to any jeweler or blacksmith to be adjusted
to different hands or fingers from the original
make. There is a tiny clasp at the side of the gem
that, when pressed, opens the gem, revealing a small, hinged
compartment. This compartment is designed to hold one dose
of poison, allowing wearers to slip the contents of the ring into
the food or drink of an intended target. The compartment can
be closed again by gently pressing the gem back into place.
Noticing the compartment requires a DC 15 Perception check
for anyone inspecting the ring.

CODED SIGNAL
Secret societies are notorious for their rituals and
symbolism, and for working those symbols into their
properties and belongings. The silent hunters of the Cat
and Mouse Society wear cat masks and brand their lodges
with the sign of the sphinx. Some of this is due to ego,
some due to what might be best understood as an exercise
in branding, but some is to convey messages to members.
Unlike other secret messages, coded signals make no
effort to direct themselves to a specific individual. Rather,
the message is clearly visible, but the actual meaning is
decipherable only to members of the secret society.
Recognizing the Signal: If one isn’t a member of the
relevant society, then identifying the presence of a coded
signal requires succeeding at a Society check, with a
critical success also conveying the general meaning. The
DC depends on how secretive and widespread the society
is—the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, widespread
and famous, might use a simple expert DC of 20, while
the paranoid Exarchate of the Infinite Clock might use a
simple master DC of 30, and an even more obscure society
might use the simple legendary DC of 40.
•	 Temporary signal examples include newspaper
advertisements or temporary illusions.
•	 Permanent signal examples include graffiti on a wall
or small carvings in building stones.
•	 Monument signal examples include occult symbolism
on a civic landmark or in a seal of an organization.
COUNTERFEIT GOODS
Many secret societies dabble in ancient lore and rare
antiquities. If one were to ask what their greatest challenge
is, instead of evading police attention or dealing with
the occasional mystic curse, most members would say
it’s separating counterfeit goods from real ones. Almost
anything can be counterfeited, and counterfeiting is a
major criminal enterprise with its own tricks, techniques,
and intricacies. Some counterfeiters specialize in the
production of adulterated coinage, while others produce
beautiful legal documents with forged signatures and
stolen stamps. Another class of forger produces artwork
in the style of some great master, while ancient relics can
be churned out by the dozen in subterranean workshops.
You can hire a counterfeiter to create low-grade,
medium-grade, or high-grade counterfeit goods. In all
cases, the goods can still act as mundane examples of
their type (a counterfeit copy of the queen’s longsword is
still a longsword), and if the original is enchanted, then
the counterfeiter attempts to fake the appropriate magical
auras. Counterfeit goods don’t have any other magical
powers, though—a counterfeit scroll can’t be used to Cast
a Spell, for example. A counterfeit good can’t be cheaper
than the base item. For example, the sword couldn’t be
cheaper than a longsword, nor the scroll cheaper than a
piece of parchment.
An item sold to a store goes through a rigorous vetting
process that is extremely likely to detect a counterfeit, so a
secret society member can’t simply create counterfeits and
then sell them at a profit. Counterfeits excel in situations
where the item’s hand-off is illicit or the item doesn’t need
to pass intense scrutiny from an appraiser.
Detecting Counterfeits: Determining something is
counterfeit requires inspecting the item and succeeding at a
relevant skill check against the counterfeit’s DC. Typically,
this is Crafting, but one might use Religion to detect a fake
reliquary or Medicine to realize a potion is mere snake oil.
Low-grade counterfeits typically have a very easy DC of
the item’s level, medium-grade counterfeits typically have a
standard DC of the item’s level, and high-grade counterfeits
typically have a hard DC of the item’s level.
FALSE WITNESS
There comes a time in every thief’s life when they need
a friend, an ally, a boon companion who will look a
judge straight in the eye and swear over a stack of holy
books that the two of them were out drinking—yes,
your honor, all night, never left my sight for more than
a minute, you have my solemn oath. Lucky thieves have
a friend who is willing to be an alibi; for everyone else,
SECRET SOCIETY MEMBERSHIP SERVICES
The following services are available to members of a secret society as long as they remain in the society’s good graces.
Other characters with underworld connections can attempt to leverage their connections to provide these services as
well, though this might require an exchange of favors determined by the GM.

there’s the false witness, a professional in the art of
fraudulent testimony.
Some false witnesses are truly freelance, willing to
claim to have seen someone for the price of a round of
drinks. More respectable witnesses, however, tend to be
associated with thieves’ guilds, secret societies, and other
conspiracies. Such organizations can match a person in
need of an alibi with a witness
with no apparent connection
to them, and they often
have large enough numbers
that no one witness appears
before law enforcement often
enough to arouse suspicion. The
most expensive and professional
false witnesses use memory charms
or similar techniques to render their
testimony foolproof. Typically, a false
witness charges per incident, providing a false alibi and,
if necessary, hiring other witnesses to back themselves up
and thus foul an investigation.
False witnesses generally know better than to ask
questions, but depending on their background, might refuse
to protect—and might even turn in—someone involved in
a particularly heinous crime. A tavern keeper might have
no qualms about covering for burglars and footpads but
will gladly send a child murderer to the gallows.
•	 Disreputable false witnesses fall into two main
types: people considered unreliable to a typical
investigator—barflies, beggars, petty criminals—and
poor actors, their perjury painfully transparent to any
court taking a cursory effort to cross-examine them.
•	 Ordinary false witnesses are usually on the edges
of the criminal community but can at least pass
themselves off as respectable: retired thieves, relatives
of criminals, or the like.
•	 Reputable false witnesses are upstanding members of
the community, though typically ones with secrets: a
merchant who acts as a fence on the side or a clerk
with gambling debts. This is the highest level that’s
ever available to characters without membership in
a secret society or similar conspiracy (such as a spy
network or thieves’ guild).
•	 Honorable false witnesses are pillars of society and
likely have no illicit connections save for their contact
with the society or conspiracy: well-to-do aristocrats
who were discussing business with the subject or
somber church deacons who report the subject prayed
all night for a loved one’s soul.
•	 Unimpeachable false witnesses provide signed
affidavits from impeccable sources like the High
Priest of Pharasma, the Chief Magistrate of the Royal
Court, or the king’s favorite aunt.
Detecting False Testimony: To defeat a false witness’s
testimony, an investigator must succeed at a check against
the DC listed in the table. The check used depends on the
investigation: Perception to Sense Motive versus spoken
testimony, Society to determine forgeries, and so on. A
false witness can sometimes stymie an investigation where
the lead investigator is sufficiently lower level than the
false witness, and they might be able to delay or befuddle
a more serious investigation.
POLITICAL FAVOR
For many, the allure of being
in a secret society is the chance
to place their hands on the
levers of power in government.
Members can rub elbows with the
great and good, introduce themselves
to politicians and powerbrokers, and
form bonds through shared allegiances
unavailable to the common rabble. They can
lean on those connections for a favor, some little trifle that
might matter a great deal to them.
Purchasing political favors typically requires membership
in a secret society that has significant political sway in the
region (such as the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye in
Ustalav). At the GM’s discretion, characters with similarly
deep connections (perhaps by virtue of having the royalty
background) might also be able to purchase political
favors. While the options below assume the favors are
being purchased with cash, in most secret societies, favors
are more likely to be traded for other favors or services
rendered. The granter of the favor isn’t necessarily a
member of a secret society, but anyone in high office is
invariably entangled in webs of favor and obligation.
The degree of the favor is based on how much effort
it requires of the decision-maker and how much risk to
which it exposes them. This can vary depending on the
NPC. A moderate favor that takes days or weeks of work
for a lord in high standing might be fulfilled with one
sentence from a monarch.
•	 Minor favors involve little risk and can be done in a
matter of minutes, or at most, a few hours. Examples
include signing a search warrant against a target of
no political importance or arranging the loan of some
horses from a military stable.
•	 Moderate favors require work from the politician
and the expenditure of at least some political capital,
such as having the government purchase a specific
building, or reassigning a meddlesome city watch
officer. Typically, only NPCs of 11th level or higher
can grant such favors. If an NPC is a specialist with
a higher level for some tasks, that higher level could
apply here, as determined by the GM.
•	 Major favors are serious, politically fraught, or
otherwise controversial: pardoning a notorious
criminal or granting a royal trade monopoly.
Typically, only NPCs of 17th level or higher can grant
such favors, with exceptions for specialists.

Adventure Background
Vir Zhees (NE female elf collector) is a longtime contact of
the Dark Archive, though a dubious one. An eccentric and
dilettante, the elf merchant has taken her last two centuries
residing in Absalom to weave together a complex web of
social influence across the city. Vir has been working with
an organization in Shadow Absalom recently that takes
payment in captives. She’s hired a group of mercenaries
to abduct servants from an upcoming opera, with the aim
of carting them off to a rendezvous point in the opera’s
basement where they can be whisked away through a
portal to Shadow Absalom. She has convinced two proxies
of members of Absalom’s Low Council, Mechna Vellerine
(LE female human representative) and Erat Orzell (NE
male tiefling human representative), to assist her by
bringing mercenaries disguised as their own servants.
To allow them to converse freely, the proxies fabricated
a dispute between the two of them that Vir is ostensibly
helping to resolve.
Word of Vir’s unsavory dealings reached the ears of
the Helping Hand, a secret organization of commoners
in Absalom who check the excesses of the aristocracy.
Two members of the Helping Hand, Bahvan (N male
human spy) and Jaynt (CN female tiefling human spy)
infiltrated Vir’s household. While snooping through Vir’s
files, Jaynt learned of Vir’s plan, but she was caught by a
loyal servant of the house. Bahvan rushed to the scene,
drawing his blade and sending the loyal servant away. In
an attempt to prove his devotion to Vir, he severed Jaynt’s
hand before helping her escape.
With Bahvan openly accompanying Vir and Jaynt
hiding among the opera guests, they plan to stop Vir’s
mercenaries from carrying out the abductions and frighten
Vir into confessing her crimes to escape the wrath of the
slighted agents of Shadow Absalom. With so many secret
plots swirling about the opera, however, it’s anyone’s guess
which group will come out on top.
Who claims victory will ultimately hinge upon the actions
of new player in Absalom that none expected—a group of
adventurers following notes from the now-defunct Dark
Archive. Following rumors about the treasures in Vir’s
collection, as well as suggestions that the collector may
have gotten in over her head, these adventurers arrive at
Vir’s manor hours before the opera is set to begin.
SHAKING THE HELPING HAND
Even the Dark Archive can’t keep tabs on every single club or society, which is why it’s so vital to cultivate connections
with those who can. Vir Zhees has long helped us keep tabs on the various societies in Absalom high society, her shrewd
interpersonal skills, social position, and long elven lifespan making her uniquely suited for the task. Yet, we should
always be wary, for those who deal in secrets know how to keep them, even from us. — K.H.W.

Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge created by the Dark Archive
folio deposits the PCs in Absalom. From there, the PCs
can ask around about Vir Zhees or draw upon their own
knowledge. They determine the following information
based on a DC 20 Diplomacy check to Gather Information,
or a DC 20 Society or DC 18 Absalom, Mercantile, or
Underworld Lore check to Recall Knowledge.
Critical Success As success, and the PC has also heard rumors
that Vir Zhees’ desire for curios sometimes drives her to
black market contacts. If she can discreetly procure products
that catch her interest, she doesn’t ask too many questions.
Success Vir Zhees is an elven merchant whose pride and joy
is her collection of curios. Her negotiation skills combined
with her lack of political ambition make her a sought-after
mediator in disputes. The PCs easily locate Vir Zhees’s manor
house in the Petal District.
Failure The PC has never heard of Vir Zhees.
Critical Failure The PCs hears that Vir
Zhees is affiliated with the Lion Blades,
spies based out of Taldor and loyal to
Grand Princess Eutropia. She engages
in clandestine missions to assist the Lion
Blades in tracking down agents that may
pose a threat to Taldor’s interests.
If all the PCs fail, they can
pay a local newsie 1 gp to
show them the way to Vir
Zhees’s estate.
When
the
PCs
arrive,
a
guard, Bahvan, greets them and takes
their measure, deciding they could act as
insurance for the Helping Hands’ plans. Bahvan
escorts them to the dining room to meet with Vir. Bahvan
assures a wary Vir that these guests are just the people to
help with their current predicament. Read or paraphrase
the following.
Bahvan leads the way into a lavish dining
room where a finely dressed elf woman
stands, lost in thought. Her eyes are fixed
on a glove that rests at the center of the
table. It’s hewed of black velvet, rimmed with
dried blood at its opening—the empty hand a
stark focal point against the white marble of the
large surface.
“Please, have a seat. I am Vir Zhees, and I
understand you are here to meet with me?
We can discuss business later, but for
the time being, there are more pressing
matters at hand. My guard Bahvan
assures me you are the type of people
who might be able to help?” Vir continues,
her voice grave. “This is the third time in recent
memory that someone has been meddling with my affairs and
those of my associates, and the first that someone has been
caught at my estate. I think I’m being watched.
“Bahvan managed to claim a hand before the miscreant got
away with a scroll. The glove bears a strange
mark: look close.” She gets up from her
chair and slides the glove toward the
edge of the table for inspection.
The PCs can observe the mark.
It looks like an infinity symbol
turned vertical, crossed with an
X at its middle and pointed on
its top arc. A PC who succeeds at
a DC 18 Society check or Absalom
Lore check to Recall Knowledge surmises
that the mark signifies membership in some sort of secret
society; with a critical success, the PC recalls that it’s
associated with an organization called the Helping Hand,
a group of people from the lower classes of Absalom who
work to expose corruption.
After showing the PCs the glove, Vir
continues.
“I’d hoped this was just a few scattered thieves looking
for a chance to loot my considerable treasures,
easily countered. But Bahvan caught
this intruder snooping through my
documents, specifically the ones
about a meeting I’ll be conducting at the
Fullbloom Opera House tomorrow. If my
documents were merely trade manifests,
that would certainly be concerning, but
as a public servant, I hold information
of a more sensitive nature. Absalom has
many factions, and it has been my honor and
pleasure over these past few decades to apply the
skills I’ve learned as a merchant to help government officials
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 5th-level
characters.
Shaking the Helping Hand takes place in the Petal
District of Absalom. On the request of a wealthy
patron who had been targeted by a mysterious
secret society, the PCs attend an opera. The patron
fears that this society will attempt to sabotage
a meeting that she is holding with proxies for
government officials. In fact, the secret society,
known as the Helping Hand, had come to the opera
to stop the patron and proxies from abducting
servants and trading them away to traffickers from
Shadow Absalom. If the PCs uncover the truth, they
can stop these abductions and assist the Helping
Hand with exposing these criminals from Absalom’s
high society.

find common ground. Tomorrow’s opera-house meeting is a
mediation of a trade dispute between members of Absalom’s
Low Council, as represented by their proxies.” Vir taps the
symbol on the glove. “I fear that whatever organization uses
that symbol plans to disrupt the mediation, but I don’t know
what their ultimate aims are.
“And so we come to my request: please accompany me
to the opera. Keep a watchful eye out for people with that
symbol or others who might seek to disturb the mediation. If
you do come across such dangerous individuals, do what you
can to capture them for official questioning and trial.”
After the meeting, Vir offers lodging and says she has
opera-appropriate clothing on hand, though the
occasion doesn’t exactly play well with being
armed. As a registered and recognized guard
of a member of the city elite, Bahvan
is best equipped to bring the
group’s arms and armor into
the venue without stirring up a
scene. Bahvan agrees to find a
lavatory in which to stash the
PCs arms and armor, and then
to inform them of its location.
A NIGHT AT THE OPERA
The Fullbloom Opera House in the Petal District lives up to its
name this evening. Attendees stroll through the gated grounds
of the opera house and up to the building itself, the outside of
it looking like a lavish cross between a domed temple and an
unfurled golden rose. A tastefully verdigris ironwork fence
outlines the wide perimeter of the venue and its surrounding
garden. The central gate is open, welcoming in the players to
walk the paths that spiral through the garden, as well as the
main avenue that leads to the triple flight of wide marble stairs
at the facade of the building itself. The who’s who of the Petal
District mingle, indulging in delectable appetizers. Members
of the operatic orchestra play gentle songs to accompany the
sociable chatter in the garden.
The attendees trickle into the theater, wearing a
dizzying array of finery. If the PCs opted to accept Vir’s
outfitting or wear their own fashionable and fancy attire,
they fit right into the crowd. If they’ve opted to wear
more common clothing, they get questions from the staff,
and the venue’s security takes keen note of any arms the
party bears without a golden reason to look the other
way (1 gp for each individual sighting, or 20 gp to pay
off security so that the venue guard will not hover around
the group).
As the party makes their way indoors, Vir explains
she intends to head to her reserved box house right after
procuring sweetberry wine from the bar. She asks them
to look out for suspicious parties bearing the mark of her
assumed enemy, then leaves them to mingle for the 20
minutes leading up to the seating for the performance of
The Cyclical Conundrum of Cynthia and Evelyn.
Conspicuously, Bahvan is nowhere to be found in the
crowd, though Vir seems unconcerned, explaining that he
likely is scouring the box before the performance.
ANATOMY OF THE OPERA HOUSE
The PCs can freely roam the opera house before the
show starts. Use these locations as backdrops.
A. Entrance/Box Office: The Box Office is a partitioned
space immediately beyond the front doors. Three ticket
vendors attend it, as well as four
guards—two
at
the
entrances,
and two at the doors leading to
the lobby and front of house.
The dome is a stone relief of
flowering branches. A statue of
the goddess Shelyn points to the
ceiling, where multicolored glowing
glass petals create a stunning array of light
and shadow; the way some fall creates the
illusion of laughing and crying faces in profile.
B. Front Lobby: The front lobby, hewed from
marble and painted with flowers on the ceilings and
walls, is furnished with plush seats where guests can enjoy
drinks or play cards before the show. Waitstaff operate
two well-stocked bars, taking drinks to tables or private
boxes. A doorway leads straight into the performance hall,
and two more doorways lead to the hallways.
C. Hallways: These hallways connect to the
performance hall, washrooms, and staircases that lead
to the private boxes on upper floors. Each private box
is outfitted with a good lock (Core Rulebook 290). Two
security guards patrol each floor.
D. Backstage: The backstage area has lavish makeup
and dressing rooms, a backstage proper (hidden by two
gigantic curtains), and a prop room. A spare curtain rests
along the east wall of backstage proper. While this curtain
seems ordinary, it becomes a portal in Act III. Behind the
backstage proper is a door leading into a performer’s
lounge, which has an emergency door out of the back of
the building. Before the performance, the cast and crew
are gathered here and backstage proper.
E. Performance Hall: The hall is filled with several
rows of general seating at the ground level that slope
in toward the stage, each divided into 2 sections with
avenues for ushers to navigate. In front is an elevated
stage for an orchestra, and behind that is a further
elevated stage for the main performance, which has two
staircases flanking its proscenium, strategically cast in
shadow. Until the performance begins, the main stage is
hidden behind a pair of rose-red curtains. The hall air
is cool and smells pleasantly of peony, and when there
is no performance happening, elaborate candelabras
dangle from the ceiling, casting a calming blue light
from the flame of their torches.

INVESTIGATION
The PCs can use a variety of strategies to investigate the
opera house, including the following. Each PC has time to
follow two leads before the show begins; if the PCs pick a
different tactic, use these as a guide. Since time is limited,
the PCs likely want to split up to cover more ground.
Speaking with Staff
As opera guests, it’s easy for the PCs to catch the attention
of staff. In general, staff are polite but brief; with so many
guests, they can’t afford to get caught in discussions. If the
PCs ask staff members about the gloves, they don’t have
more information; it’s common for people to wear gloves
to the opera, and they see far too many guests. A PC who
succeeds at a DC 22 Perception check to Sense Motive
notices one of the staff members, Henrietta (N female
human custodian), is hiding her familiarity with the gloves.
As the PCs are talking, they hear a commotion. A
harried staff member named Savi (N nonbinary human
waiter) trips and falls, dropping a tray full of drinks, which
splash on the face, suit, and long, plaited beard of Alaric
Brunstone (NE male dwarf weapons dealer), a bald man
wearing a suit of pinstriped blue corduroy and white cotton
gloves. Alaric looms over the fallen Savi and screams at
him for soiling his beard and outfit. A PC who succeeds at
a DC 20 Society check or DC 18 Absalom Lore check to
Recall Knowledge knows Alaric is a weapons dealer who
owns a chain of stores in the Coins district.
The other guests don’t intervene, but the PCs can put a
stop to this. They might calm, trick, or frighten Alaric into
standing down (DC 18 Diplomacy, DC 20 Deception, or
DC 24 Intimidation). Alternatively, if the PCs call his name
or otherwise prove that they recognize him, Alaric turns
on a dime to business and apologizes to the PCs (but not
Savi) for his unseemly display. Before the show, Henrietta
approaches the PCs and asks them to swing by the bar to
speak with the bartender Kevel during the first act.
Speaking with Mechna
Mechna Vellerine is a proxy for the Ivy District’s low
councilwoman, Jostlin Ferqyr. She is embroiled in the
fictitious dispute Vir is mediating. Well-dressed folk hover
as she complains Erat Ozell is just like Brythen Blood,
the councilman for whom he is a proxy. He has his “head
in the clouds” and spends too much time on “academic
frippery” and not enough time attending to “what actually
needs to be done to run the city.” A PC who succeeds at a
DC 18 Society or DC 16 Absalom Lore check to Recall
Knowledge knows Brythen is the High Curator of the
College of Mysteries, an elite magical academy, who
prioritizes the academy and finds politicking dull. While
the complaints are plausible, a PC who succeeds at a DC
20 Perception check to Sense Motive realizes that she is
playing up her annoyance for the crowd. A pair of servants
attend to Mechna as she complains. One fans her while the
other brings her a drink from the bar.
Eavesdropping on Erat and Vir
Vir Zhees is speaking with the other party in the
fabricated dispute, Erat Ozell. Erat wears a sharp suit
and has the look of a librarian. He’s a proxy for Brythen
Blood, the Petal District councilman and High Curator
of the College of Mysteries. Erat loudly complains about
Mechna Vellerine and the councilwoman for whom she is
a proxy, Jostlin Ferqyr. He claims Mechna’s insistence on
doing things by the book stifles innovation and is a parody
of the admirable traits of Abadar that Councilwoman
Ferqyr exemplifies. A PC who succeeds at a DC 18
Religion check or DC 16 Absalom Lore check to Recall
Knowledge knows Councilwoman Ferqyr is the Keeper
of the Vault of Abadar, Absalom’s largest bank and center
of the faith. As a follower of Abadar, Councilwoman
Ferqyr advocates for structure and protocol. While
Ozell’s complaints are plausible, a PC who succeeds at
a DC 20 Perception check to Sense Motive realizes he is
projecting his voice more than normal and exaggerating
his complaints.
After a short conversation, Erat, Vir, and a pair of
servants slip into a side room. Any PCs who wish to follow
unnoticed can attempt a DC 18 Stealth check. If no PC is
caught, the PCs catch a snippet of the conversation between
Erat and Vir. Erat assures Vir her people are “ready for the
deal,” says that “Vellerine’s are too,” and says he’s “looking
forward to continuing this conversation later.”
Searching for Gloves
Gloves are standard in opera attire, so there is no shortage
of them. Finding gloves that bear the insignia is more
difficult, but PCs who succeed at a DC 20 Perception check
spot the symbol on the white cotton glove worn by the
busy bartender Kevel (N male human bartender). Kevel is
swamped by orders and tries to brush off any conversation.
If the PCs ask about the glove and succeed at a DC 20
Deception or DC 18 Diplomacy check, he sighs and asks
them to come back to speak with him during the first act.
Searching for Bahvan
Bahvan stepped away from Vir to confer with fellow
Helping Hand members, blending into the crowd. Finding
Bahvan requires a successful DC 22 Perception check.
PCs who succeed notice him conversing with servants,
many of whom seem to recognize him. If a PC finds him,
they can attempt to tail him with a DC 24 Stealth check.
On a failure, Bahvan notices the PC and doesn’t engage
in suspicious behavior. On a success, Bahvan approaches
a socialite wearing a stylish eye mask and a pair of long
black gloves. She greets Bahvan with a kiss on the cheek
and smilingly whispers something in his ear while rubbing
her right wrist. A PC who succeeds at a DC 22 Perception
check hears her message, “That hurt like hell. I’ll play nice
until we take her down, but don’t think we’re done here.”
Should the PCs confront them, they ask the PCs to speak
with them out in the lobby during the first act.

ACT I
After the attendees have mingled for some time, the doors to
the Performance Hall open, welcoming in the audience. Ushers
whisk Vir away, off to the left staircase. “Look for me in booth
A3 on the right side if you have news for me!” she says. She
dons a mask for her night at the opera.
The blue flames illuminating the hall dim once the ushers
manage to seat everyone. With darkness comes anticipatory
silence. Suddenly, a wistful vibrato starts the performance with
a cold open. As the lush curtains rise, a beautiful song tumbles
out of the orchestra and the lights of the stage bloom, pulling the
image of a woman singing in a tower into the audience’s focus.
Most of the crowd has its attention on the performance,
but a few stand out. Up in Vir’s box, Bahvan is fixated on
one woman, Jaynt. In the middle, third row from the front,
Jaynt is staring back at him. Vir doesn’t notice, but the
PCs do with a DC 23 Perception check, as well as seeing
Bahvan rubbing his fingers on the covered wrist of his right
glove. Jaynt gets up from her seat at a crescendo, using the
distraction to run off to the dark and out into the front of
the house. Bahvan departs soon after.
The PCs can choose to follow Jaynt or Bahvan, but
they’ll have to act casually. Each PC must attempt a DC 18
Performance or Deception check to not rouse suspicion or a
DC 20 Stealth check to escape notice. If the two don’t notice
the PCs, they head to the bar to talk to Kevel. If the PCs
successfully tail either of them, they witness the following.
The tiefling woman strides up to the bar, leaning onto the counter
over an empty stool. Bahvan lingers, watching from a distance.
“Do you have it,” she asks, in a whisper, “the sleep?” The
bartender Kevel grins through his blond goatee warmly, reaching
behind the bar and procuring a show program which looks a
bit larger than the ones that have already been distributed to
the audience. She takes it from him, orders a glass of red, and
touches the back of her gloved right hand to the back of his.
If the PCs are caught, the person they’re following leads
them close enough to call for help before confronting
them. Proceed to Meeting the Helping Hand below.
MEETING THE HELPING HAND
It’s likely the PCs have motive and opportunity to speak
with the Helping Hand ringleaders during the first act.
Creatures: Kevel, Jaynt, and Bahvan are confident the
“program” Kevel handed Jaynt will take care of Mechna,
Erat, and their mercenaries (it’s a 4th-level scroll of sleep),
but they don’t know who will come to take the captives.
To convince the Helping Hand to share their plans, the PCs
will need to earn the trust of two of the three agents.
Bahvan is optimistic the PCs might help. He asks them
to let him know what they have uncovered. If they mention
the Helping Hand or express suspicions about Mechna,
Erat, or Vir, he judges them able to handle the truth.
Jaynt is disinclined to trust Bahvan after he cut off her
hand and wants to test the PCs. She asks them what should
happen when the powerful use their station to abuse
others. If the PCs give an answer that indicates respect for
the system to handle the situation, she scoffs. If they give
an answer that suggests people sometimes need to take
matters into their own hands, she asks them to tell her a
time they acted on that principle. So long as the PCs can
provide a satisfactory example, they pass Jaynt’s test.
Kevel has a more neutral opinion. If the PCs already
earned his trust by talking to him or helping Savi, he
vouches for them. Otherwise, the PCs can convince him
with a DC 20 Deception or DC 18 Diplomacy check.
If the PCs succeed, they warn the PCs not to sit in the
west side during Act II, as Jaynt will use magic to disrupt
a plan to traffic innocents for profit. Bahvan tells the PCs
where to find their weapons and armor, in a bathroom on
the second floor. Proceed to the Helping Plot on page 91.
INTERMISSION
Vir tracks down the PCs, asking if they’ve found anything.
She mentions that any interference jeopardizes trade with
Shadow Absalom, an important arrangement for the city.
If the PCs press her, she explains she’s personally at risk
from the threat; thus, it’s imperative she make her meeting.
If the PCs haven’t figured out what’s going on, Bahvan
says he’s dug up a lead and asks them to meet him in a
lavatory during the second act to retrieve their arms.
The PCs can also snoop around more and perform one
round of investigation. If they look for gloves, the DC of
the Perception check decreases to 18, and they see the
insignia appearing on the gloves of more servants and even
some of the guards.
ACT II
The audience re-congregates and the opera continues. Despite
the vigorous performance between the play’s star-crossed
lovers, the audience starts to yawn and tire, save for an absent
Bahvan, and the conspicuous tiefling woman—reading the
“program” she procured from the bar.
Most attendees on the boxes along the right side,
including Vir, Mechna, and Erat, doze off as Jaynt activates
a scroll of sleep (4th level). While the PCs’ seats aren’t in
this area, it’s possible PCs may be present. Any such PCs
must attempt a DC 23 Will save. The PCs might choose
to awaken Vir. She tearfully claims she’s being pressed
by fetchling merchants to provide folks who “won’t be
missed” to test out magical wares before taking them back
to Shadow Absalom. She knows it’s wrong but has been
convinced that refusing will stifle magical trade and cause
dire consequences for her. This is the story she told Mechna
and Erat. Vir cares little for the fate of anyone but herself.
If the PCs haven’t figured out what is afoot, they’re
likely to go to the lobby to investigate or the second-floor

bathroom to retrieve their weapons and arms, at which
point they run into Bahvan and—a beat later—Jaynt.
“The Helping Hand has no wish to harm any of
you,” Bahvan says. We only want your help—
Vir is not the kind of person you think she is!
Give us two minutes to explain, and we could
end up saving a life tonight, and many more
tomorrow.” Kevel the bartender and two valets
creep in from the sides, looking apprehensive
about the possibility of a skirmish.
Proceed to the Helping Plot below.
THE HELPING PLOT
If the PCs earn the trust of the Helping Hand
or confront them, Bahvan explains they are
members of a network of Absalom servants
and workers that protect each other from
the aristocracy. They’ve been investigating
people going missing at gatherings. Jaynt
found a seamstress friend named Paroma in a
basement with no memory of the past fortnight. Others
never returned, so they’ve planned a rescue. Jaynt takes out
a note, which says, “At performance’s peak, pass through
curtains behind curtains behind curtains when you wish to
meet.” The PCs might be able deduce what this means; if
not, give them a DC 22 Perception or DC 16 Performance
check to realize it refers to a curtain backstage, behind
the curtains that divide the main stage from the hall and
those from backstage. The NPCs can also come to the same
conclusion. If the PCs have questions, use the information
from the Adventure Background to fill in details.
Joining the Helping Hand: Assuming this convinces the
PCs, Bahvan tells them to prepare for a fight. Jaynt inverts
her gloves, exposing the symbol, and taps the back of her
hand to PCs who accept the solidarity gesture. “Tonight,
you’re one of us!” she says. Continue to Act III.
Opposing the Helping Hand: Alternatively, the PCs
might insist on fighting. Kevel, Jaynt, and Bahvan would
rather save their strength, but if believe the PCs intend to
sell them out to Vir, they attack.
KEVEL
CREATURE 1

CREATURE 3
CN female human tiefling mage for hire (Gamemastery Guide 226)
Perception +7; low-light vision
BAHVAN
CREATURE 4
Male bounty hunter (Gamemastery Guide 227)
This ends the adventure. Vir offers each PC 50 gp. The
city arrests the Helping Hand. Vir is alone, and simply says
a deal was made. Mechna and Erat are gone.
ACT III
SEVERE 5
By this point, the group has likely realized what they are
looking for is behind the stage, accessible by the hallways
leading to the staircases down into the back of the
house. A guard sympathetic to the Helping Hand
provides the group with a key to the
backstage area.
On entering, the PCs see shadows
that are unnaturally long. On the east
wall, a spare curtain reflects no light
and flutters despite lack of wind. A
PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Arcana,
Nature, Occultism, or Religion check to
Identify Magic realizes the curtain functions
as a portal. If the PCs pass through the portal,
they are met with a mysterious fetchling agent.
Read or paraphrase the following.
A woman wearing a shadowy mask and a
dark cloak flecked with starlight slinks from
the darkness. Despite being barely louder than
a whisper, her voice echoes. “Where is Vir Zhees?
Don’t tell me you’re sent to tell me that she’s not planning to
hand over the merchandise? Or perhaps…” The woman grins
viciously, revealing rows of too-sharp teeth. “Perhaps you are
the merchandise? A bit heartier than my usual fare, but you’ll
do. Come quietly, and my servants will allow you to live.”
Unless the PCs surrender immediately, the fetchling
agent chuckles. “Pity. We’ll make use of their corpses then.
Kill them all.” She vanishes into shadow, and at the same
time, the portal vanishes, leaving the PCs trapped in a
shadowy version of the Fullbloom Opera House’s main
stage. Seven fetchling agents in dark robes, each wearing
masks evoking trees made of twisting shadows, drop down
from above the stage, silent as twilight.
SHADOW’S MINIONS (6)
CREATURE 2
Elite fetchling scouts (Bestiary 2 6, 117)
SHADOW’S LIEUTENANT
CREATURE 4

Conclusion
With the agents defeated, the PCs can search for a way
home. A PC can re-open the portal from this side in 10
minutes with a successful trained DC 20 Arcana or
Religion check. Otherwise, after an hour, Jaynt manages to
reactivate the portal from the opera-house side.
Jaynt pens a missive to both Jostlin Ferqyr and Brythen
Blood about their representatives’ scheme and exposes
Vir’s meeting during the Encore. Vir, Mechna and Erat are
arrested by the authorities. Jaynt leaves the PCs with her
opera glove, itself embroidered with the Helping Hand
sigil, with a note written in ink up the arm that says,
“Reach out if you require a Helping Hand.”

The Empty Vale
Incident Location: [Redacted] Village, Avin Prefecture,
Taldor, Avistan
Incident Type: Hiatus
Reporting Archivist: Rhine Laufent
Day 1
Day 1
The people here are scatterbrained, to put it kindly, prone to
déjà vu. Investigations into water supply, air quality, miasma,
and other possible environmental sources turned up nothing
unusual. Checks for local cryptids, ancient ruins, and magical
artifacts are thus far negative on all fronts.
Day 2
Day 2
This village seems entirely unremarkable.
There was little reason for me, as the sole
archivist sent to this location, to select
an inn room spacious enough to
house two—not when nearly every
other room remains available.
As proficient an archivist as I
may be, it still seems careless to
breach the Dyad Protocol, even
on a case as inconsequential
as this. Perhaps the inanity
of the village occupants
is transmissible.
Day 4
Day 4
It has been a few days since my last
entry. I was told upon arriving the bread is baked daily
here, but the loaf I was given almost shattered my teeth.
When I filed complaints to the innkeeper she seemed lost,
claiming none in the inn even knew how to bake bread. An
odd occurrence, to be sure, but one that would not pique my
interest were it not in line with an emerging pattern of
other seemingly trivial abnormalities. All the luggage and
supplies for the expedition are in my room on the second
floor, but none claim to have carried it. The damnable lot is
far too heavy for me to have done it alone.
Furthermore, a scant few belongings located in my
effects undeniably don’t trace their origin to me. A handful
of incense sticks—I’m not a religious woman—and a small
silver necklace, a frivolous trinket of no use to me. Perhaps
unrelated but vexing, so I will make a point to make note:
I found at least one of my spell tomes marred by coffee
stains. While I recall riding the carriage here, I, for the life
of me, can’t remember booking nor boarding it. I usually
leave such matters to... someone? Something? Odd.
Day 9
Day 9
A more thorough investigation of the residents has revealed
many are experiencing the same lapses in memory as I.
It has become evident I wasn’t the sole archivist assigned
to investigating this village. I feel out of balance; an
uncharacteristic hollowness drags in my chest and a
haziness clouds my usual sagacity. Attempts to rationalize
the unaccounted for memories lead my mind down strange
paths or invoke the sudden affliction of terrible headaches.
In return, I find my physical investigation proceeding more
certainly than before, as if my hand were guided by
another’s, as if a voice were speaking to me from a corner
I can’t turn my head to see.
Were I to posit my own theory, it’s possible this village
harbors an anomalous tear in the fabric of reality; if one
were to wander too close, they would
inexorably “fall out” of existence.
Yet I feel compelled to continue
the investigation.
Day ?
Day ?
I’m unclear how much time has truly
passed since my arrival. The origin
of my escalating exasperation
appears to be a bewildering
phenomenon, a rift between realities,
as I previously surmised. Theoretically,
it erases evidence of its own existence,
existing only for brief moments. Entities
and objects can pass through this rift
into nonexistence—at which point, reality
reconstructs over what’s missing, like scar tissue
over a wound. I’m writing this, taking care to frame my
mind in the space of what might be happening, lest my
words become entangled in this accursed causality. If these
lines return blank, there is something terribly awry.
Upon my return, I will request a formal inquiry into
the Archive’s records to cross-reference this event, and,
perhaps, to locate any potentially erroneous or otherwise
inconsistent associated documentation.
Signed,
Archivist Rhine Laufent

The Anvil and the Duck
Incident Location: [Redacted] Village, River Kingdoms,
Avistan
Incident Type: Figment
Reporting Archivist: Murana
FROM THE JOURNAL OF HUMPHREY L. WYNFALL
Randall and I elected to finish our breakfast
before setting out to see the commotion. As we
arrived at the forge just north of the square,
we saw a few others who had taken interest
in the proceedings: the local herbalist, an
elven man wearing hunting leathers, and an
armored town guard among them. Aldric,
the blacksmith, was gesturing to the duck
sitting in the center of his workshop.
It was plain to anybody in the room: the
man’s anvil, which I had seen there not a
day before, had been replaced by the largest
duck I’ve ever seen! Remarkable size, and
quiet as a temple mouse, just sitting there
pleased with itself. Randall could scarce
believe his eyes at first—the man insisted the
anvil hadn’t changed before I pointed out
that of course, this was a duck that sat
before him.
With the herbalist’s help, we calmed the
blacksmith and collected the facts. He
heard nothing all night, but when he awoke
this morning some prankster had replaced
his trusty anvil with a duck. Despite the
man’s best efforts, the duck
wouldn’t leave. We tried
shooing it away, scaring it
off—I even had Randall set
off one of his noisemakers,
and there the duck sat!
Even lifting it scarce
budged it; never have
I met a more dense or
stubborn animal in all my
years of travel.
The remainder of our
day was spent trying to get the blasted thing
to move. Marcus, the guard, applied the flat
of his blade to the duck’s backside, resulting
in naught but a loud metallic clang from the
tail feathers. The herbalist’s poultices only
produced ghastly smells and induced rust
upon the duck’s beak, typical for this species
of waterfowl, I presume. Around dinnertime,
one of the children brought another duck,
fetched from the pond, in the hopes it would
encourage its larger compatriot to leave, but
neither duck showed any interest in the other.
The second duck did induce a powerful
confusion in the hunter, however, and they
spent the remainder of the evening trying to
figure out how to pluck a feather from the
larger creature.
Everyone who agreed to an interview swears the anvil was
replaced by a duck for two days and then returned. None
appear to have puzzled out the obvious illusion yet. Still
trying to track down Wynfall’s companions; the guard
mentioned was buried in Magnimar years later, the rest
are still in the wind.
FALSE NATURE
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range touch; Target one unattended item or one item you’re
holding
Duration until your next daily preparations
You create an illusion that makes an object seem to be
something entirely different. When you Cast this Spell, speak
aloud a declarative statement that the target is a different,
nonspecific object. Your statement can’t presuppose any other
facts. For instance, you could claim an object is “a stone” or
“an antidote,” but not “the Starstone” or “the
antidote to the lethal poison you already
drank.” Creatures who previously observed
the target receive an immediate Will save
to disbelieve, but on a failure, the illusion
temporarily rewrites their memory that the
object was something different. A creature who
failed their Will save, or didn’t already see the
item’s original form, must Interact with the
illusion as normal to receive a Perception
check against the spell DC to disbelieve.
When the spell ends, targets remember
the object’s true nature, even if they never
disbelieved the spell.

In reality, we are all woodlice squatting in a rotten
log, telling ourselves that as we understand the log we
understand the world, for that is all there is. And so
we happily feast until the odd ray of sunlight breaks
in, and all the learned woodlice stroke their chins and
proclaim themselves baffled. Pray our log is never
overturned entirely.
Over the years, my fellow archivists have stumbled
across a considerable number of individuals with
potencies that stubbornly fails to align with traditional
understandings of the supernatural, which we’ve taken
to calling “deviant abilities” for convenience. Their
powers are not the codified spellwork that we think
of most often as magic. Instead, they represent strange
anomalies, twists of circumstance, or other alien codes
that result in logic-defying abilities. They obey no
harmony we understand; if we think we comprehend
these things, then we delude ourselves.
I’ve gathered together here a few of the more
noteworthy casefiles from the Archives.
POPPY
Let’s begin with a relatively mundane example, insofar
as that word has any meaning at all in our line of work.
Poppy is a halfling girl born, we think, in 4697 ar, in
what was apparently a rather abusive familial situation in
a farming village out on the edges of Nirmathas. Archivist
Feries was unable to get much detail—one “does not
SPONTANEOUS IGNITION OF
SUPERNATURAL MIGHT
On so-called “deviant abilities”
and other anomalous powers
The wise and learned scholars at the Arcanamirium or the Egorian Academy of
Magical Arts would have you believe that they understand magic. While they indeed
note the great unknowns, the sublime mystery of thrumming power on the whole, I
get the sense that they feel they know every way by which a mortal can wield magic.
That everything has been deciphered and decoded, classified and categorized and calculated, with just a few little
loose ends awaiting tidying. But there’s always more to wonder at.

talk” about such things in the nameless community that
Poppy hailed from—but the key point is that at a certain
stage, the abuse escalated to physical violence.
As best Archivist Feries was able to piece together, on
the night of the 17th of Rova, 4718, Poppy stepped in to
try and shield her younger sister from a brutal beating
by their father. This both redirected and intensified
their parent’s wrath, and in the ensuing confrontation
something extremely strange occurred. The local plant
life began to produce pollen. Pollen with a very strong
soporific effect. The effect spread out from Poppy’s farm
in a rough circle, knocking out half the village. Poppy’s
father, curiously, received such a strong dose that he never
woke up, dying in a coma some weeks later. Poppy herself
went into what, reading between the lines of Archivist
Feries’s report, was a species of allergic shock—it fell to
her sister to nurse her through the subsequent illness, and
to spirit them away when suspicion in their father’s death
fell upon them.
Archivist Feries was able to track the pair for some
time by following up on rumors of unexplained comas
or entire areas falling asleep, but the trail went cold in
central Taldor. It is possible that Poppy and her sister
were killed, but I suspect—no, I know—that the girl is
still out there somewhere; as her powers were reliant on
a specific ecological environment, it could be that she’s
simply left it behind. Maybe the sisters now safely reside
in Oppara or some such city, living peacefully and staying
away from parks or gardens.
In any case, Poppy’s situation is a good study of several
typical elements of a deviant ability manifestation. First,
they rarely conform to traditional spellwork, and are
often extremely complex or situational. Archivist Feries
consulted with several druids, and at best a few suggested
some theoretical ways that Poppy’s effect might be
achieved, but none had ever experienced something like
this firsthand. Secondly, the abilities come unexpectedly,
but are often triggered as a result of extreme stress,
whether violence, emotional conflict, or similar. Though
not an absolute rule, most deviant abilities manifest in
unhappy situations. Third and lastly, the ability is both
powerful and taxing. Poppy was able to knock out several
square miles, but the shock of it quite nearly killed her.
Whether with practice she would have learned to control
her powers more effectively is an interesting question, but
one we do not have the means to answer.
SILVERSMITH
Another file I have here relates the case of one Silversmith,
the scion of a minor Nidalese noble family near Pangolais.
From an extremely young age, Silversmith displayed
what I might term “argentokinesis”—the ability to
manipulate silver, and only silver. According to the family
servants I interrogated after the fact, the youth’s talent
was discovered when, at the age of four, he was found
casually rearranging the crests on the family silverware.
The family, displaying uncommonly good sense knowing
the danger that comes from power over silver in a land
of monsters that recoil from its touch, contrived to keep
young Silversmith’s power under wraps.
With plenty of time to practice and a relatively safe
environment, Silversmith seems to have mastered his
ability to an uncommon degree. By the age of twelve
he was able to transform silver from solid to liquid and
back, and by eighteen could shape silver at a range of
sixty paces. Around when the youth was twenty, several
rival noble families found themselves attacked by a
lethal assassin (the young man did come from Nidalese
aristocracy). It was on one such foray that he was
eventually discovered, and the family forced to publicly
repudiate their wayward scion. How much of that is
true remains questionable, but Silversmith has been seen
operating as a rather debonair killer-for-hire in several
other parts of Avistan.
GLOWWORM
As a best estimate, most deviant abilities manifest around
when the subject reaches adulthood, with the second
largest contingent acquiring them in early childhood.
Glowworm is one of the exceptions, a tengu woman, a
widow, living in Kwanlai. Powers manifested at the age of
about sixty-three. I’ve been unable to determine what the
inciting event was for this—chances are good that there
were no other witnesses to it, and only Glowworm knows
for certain. In any case, Glowworm’s powers relate to the
silk manufacture that is her village’s specialty, and to a
tradition of silk-weavers singing while they work.
Glowworm’s song causes the silk she is working on
to glow with a soft, inner light, which thereafter never
entirely fades. I have a sample before me right now, and
to the best of my abilities I’ve been able to determine
no other powers or characteristics. Just glowing silk,
albeit very well made. Nevertheless, Glowworm’s silk
is in high demand, as it has been variously termed
auspicious, blessed, or simply lucky, and it is interesting
that as near as I can determine, none of the wearers of
her silks have suffered from unfortunate accidents or
unexpected diseases.
The old woman can only produce a small amount
of silk per day—the process is extremely exhausting
and causes her internal body temperature to rise to a
worrisome degree if she continues for too long. At present,
Glowworm remains in her village, her silk fetching a high
price, and a few suitable gifts to the local lords allow her
to stay where she is. How long that situation can remain
stable, or what will happen when someone insists on her
exclusive production, is anyone’s guess.
ABYSS
This is a file I have from Archivist Krayne, who
discovered rumors of a “shark-talker” while in the
Shackles. Investigating further, she discovered that a

certain child in one of the island communities was
reportedly able to speak with sharks, and possibly other
marine predators, and persuade them to leave certain
fishing boats at peace. I had absolutely no desire to
address a casefile concerning not only the open ocean,
but also anomalously empowered marine predators, but
thankfully, Archivist Krayne proceeded to travel to the
community in question herself.
When she arrived, she found that someone else had a
similar idea—a local pirate lord had attacked the fishing
village, killed a fair number of the local inhabitants,
and kidnapped the child with the goal of using him to
control an armada of sharks, for some reason. Krayne
stole a fishing boat and set out in pursuit, catching up
with them not far from the Island of Empty Eyes in
the northern archipelago. There followed some highly
vigorous negotiations, and despite throwing several
pirates overboard, Archivist Krayne was eventually
outmaneuvered. It was at this point that, if I can read
her rather horrendous script correctly, both pirates and
Archivist noticed that the child had gone oddly quiet,
was bleeding from the eyes, and was writing something
in crimson tears upon the deck.
Whereupon, Archivist Krayne reports, they were
attacked by a monster. I suspect that Krayne may have had
a few drinks when she wrote this report, but in any case,
she writes that a hundred-foot shark with three heads and
tentacles overturned the pirate vessel. Krayne was able
to escape by means of clinging to a spar, but most of the
pirates were either drowned or devoured. She lost track
of the child, codenamed “Abyss,” in the chaos—perhaps
the boy drowned, but equally likely is that he fled atop his
pet sea monster. Krayne herself eventually washed ashore
on the Island of Empty Eyes and was marooned among
the cyclopes for a few weeks prior to building a raft and
returning to civilization.
TRAVELER
This file comes from the Terwa Uplands along the western
coast of Garund, not that far from the Shackles, as a matter
of fact. The subject is, at present, a middle‑aged dwarven
artisan working in Cloudspire, whose peculiar ability is
a form of astral travel. When Traveler sleeps, his mind
separates from his body and goes onto oneiric journeys—
at least some of which lead to real, if impossibly distant
lands. Initially, we were able to confirm that Traveler has
visited Irrisen, Shenmen, and the Crown of the World,
among other places.
Until discovered by Archivist Messerzeinig, Traveler
was unaware that these journeys were anything except
particularly vivid and inspirational dreams. These dreams
the Mbe’ke dwarf then proceeded to translate into
masterful works of iron and bronze-crafting, covering
fine plates or decorative urns with imagery drawn
from Jadwiga ceremonial dress and Lung Wa imperial
calligraphy. Archivist Messerzeinig first realized that
something was amiss when they were purchasing a set of
trade goods in Cloudspire that had certain Tien symbols
on them that would not normally be found so far from
Tian Xia. This investigation led them to Traveler, and
thus to the revelation of Traveler’s bizarre dreams.
Under Messerzeinig’s tutelage, Traveler began to push
his abilities further, traveling more frequently and more
distantly. After a few years, Traveler was able to leave
Golarion entirely, describing “a world strewn all in red
dust,” or “a place where night and day are countries to
be visited, not times, and all dwell in the dusk-dawn.”
Traveler and Messerzeinig’s reports became increasingly
fascinating, glimpses of distant shores. Then, rather
suddenly, they went silent.
Archivist Krayne stopped by to investigate on her way
back from the Abyss case in the Shackles. Traveler and
Messerzeinig were discovered dead in Traveler’s shop.
No signs of violence on their bodies, but for a look of
profound terror on their faces. One wonders what
Traveler saw, and what he told Archivist Messerzeinig.
THE GLUTTON
This gentleman first came to our attention as a sideshow
act on the Isle of Kortos. A young Absalomian man of
Thuvian heritage, Glutton had discovered at an early age
a curious set of powers. First, he could eat anything that
he could fit into his mouth. On stage, he happily devoured
twigs, whole eggs (shell and all), rocks, bullets, live mice,
and at the conclusion of his act, he drank a flask-full of
alchemical acid, all without the least sign of injury or
discomfort. Secondly, he could consume far more than
his body should be able to contain, and never seemed
to run into limits of gut or gorge. Finally, though this
particular talent Glutton was cautious about advertising,
he could unhinge his jaw and tear his cheeks in a manner
something like a viper and swallow a small rosebush in
one gulp.
The cost of this power was an endless, unceasing
hunger. Glutton’s appetite could not be sated, and
though he ate as much as six people, he still continuously
complained of hunger—and indeed, showed certain signs
of malnourishment, especially in the gaunt, loose-skinned
aspect of his figure.
In his act, Glutton claimed to be a former soldier.
Possibly accurate? At the very least, he wore a genuine
Thuvian military uniform, though the sideshow did
slather on a great deal of unnecessary gold braid. He was
cashiered out when he was found to be impossible to
feed, and took up with the sideshow as a way of getting
at least close to the food that he needed.
About a year ago, Glutton was accused of a particularly
heinous crime. A child had vanished from a small village
on the western slope of the island. Glutton, perhaps out of
guilt, or perhaps simply sensing the way that the wind was
blowing, promptly vanished, causing rumors to spread
that he had eaten the child. We were planning to dispatch

an archivist to investigate, but the recent situation has left
us too short-handed to follow up. Assuming that Glutton
hasn’t been executed by some enraged vigilante, he is
probably hiding in Absalom.
JUGGERNAUT
This casefile comes entirely second-hand, from an associate
of the late Archivist Messerzeinig in Katheer, who was
able to acquire certain files that used to belong to a local
cell of the Exarchate of the Infinite
Clock—a
rare
and
dangerous
conspiracy that seeks to unlock the
hidden powers of reality through a
great deal of involuntary surgery.
About seven years ago, the
Katheer cell had embarked on a
major experiment. They procured
a set of just over a dozen unwilling
subjects, mostly by kidnapping
young adults in and around the
city’s poorest areas. They then
carved open each subject’s skull and
replaced portions of the brain with
a complex clockwork mechanism.
Of the 14 original subjects, 11 died
during the operation or within
a week of it. Two with signs of
brain damage, otherwise nothing of
interest. But the 14th, a young Keleshite woman, began
to demonstrate a very strange ability.
This woman, Juggernaut, was able to merge her body
with objects of metal and stone, integrating them into
her own flesh with commensurate increase in strength.
In a burst of genuine if ill-omened brilliance, the
Clockmakers began to provide her with especially choice
metal components, including a sliver of inubrix skymetal
and an enchanted Alkenstari engine. In retrospect, they
probably should have expected what followed—as soon
as Juggernaut was strong enough, she killed two of her
captors and escaped. The Clockmakers were still trying
to recover their experiment when they were uncovered
by the Satrap’s agents. Juggernaut’s present location
remains unknown.
MAGPIE
Archivist Harachi encountered this bizarre individual in
Razatlan, while following up an unrelated investigation.
A series of corpses had been discovered in a line of
villages, consistent with a killer moving through the
region, each corpse missing its eyes. In the normal
course of events, this would be disturbing enough, but
according to Harachi, these corpses were not missing
their eyes in the sense of them having been scooped out
with a knife or pecked away by predators. Rather, a
smooth expanse of skin occupied the space where the
victims’ eyes should have been. As if their eyes had never
been there. The actual cause of death was a knife, either
a slit throat or a pinpoint strike to the heart.
Archivist Harachi diverted from his course to follow
up on these strange deaths, and he soon came to the
conclusion that he was not the only person following
the line of deaths—a group of blue-painted soldiers were
also investigating the murders. Harachi attempted to join
their number with his customary “tact” but was rebuffed
and ordered to leave the country. While finding out that
the soldiers had official backing was
interesting, Harachi politely declined
and had to go into hiding.
Archivist Harachi finally caught
up with the killer in the historic
ruins of Yovala, near the border.
The murderer had been traveling
as a pilgrim, wrapped in bandages
to hide what was claimed to be
a
disfiguring
disease.
Harachi
managed to identify them by
connecting the pilgrim to a prior
victim by means of a stolen knife,
and presented himself as a fellow
bandit seeking a partner. The false
pilgrim initially agreed, and then,
as Archivist Harachi expected,
attempted to consume him when
him guard was down.
Without their bandages, the murderer—Harachi
never did discover the individual’s real name—proved
to be covered in blinking, all-gazing eyes, which the
murderer had somehow “scooped” from the corpses
of their victims. To what purpose remains opaque, but
Harachi does report that the murderer crowed about
“seeing every possibility” and “I have their sight and
my sight and soon I’ll have your sight and I will see
and see and see” and similar babbling. They also proved
uncommonly difficult to subdue. Archivist Harachi,
thankfully, is an extremely able shot with a pistol, and
the murderer was neither notably quick nor particularly
strong or skilled but was nevertheless able to keep
up with Harachi by virtue of some kind of spotlights
emitting from their many eyes, which seemed to predict
the trajectory of the archivist’s bullets and which
withered any grass or bark they touched, though leaving
the stone and sand completely unarmed.
How things might have ended remains unclear, as
before things could reach a conclusion the blue soldiers
arrived and tried to arrest both murderer and Archivist
Harachi. Harachi was forced to withdraw, though not
before setting fire to a section of forest. While he is
reasonably certain that the murderer did not escape the
conflagration (also damaging one of the historic ruins,
no doubt), he does admit to being a bit preoccupied with
dodging Razatlani soldiers to confirm by finding the
body. Follow-up investigation is necessary.

DEVIANT ABILITIES
The frost struck in the time it took him to look. No waving fingers, no incantation, no circle of ancient runes hanging in
the air. Just ice covering everything he laid eyes on, his breath hanging white in the summer afternoon as chills wracked
his body.
Rarity: Rare
Though Golarion contains classically trained spellcasters,
descendants of magical creatures, and entire species who
can invoke ancestral patrons for supernatural aid, there
are always some who gain unique and unstable powers in
strange or unorthodox ways. GMs can use the rules here to
grant these so-called deviant abilities to their players and
incorporate them into their games. A deviant ability can
be the result of exposure to exotic energies, a boon from a
powerful entity, cutting-edge scientific experimentation, or
any other process that makes sense for your story.
Acquiring a Deviant
Ability
There are two main ways to approach deviant abilities
in your game: as an intentional and persistent part of
a player’s character that is intrinsic to them and grows
throughout their career, or as a more turbulent and
transient power they gain as part of an ongoing campaign,
intended to be acquired at a certain point in the story and
to eventually burn out or fade away when that chapter of
the story is told.
BACKGROUND DEVIANT ABILITIES
A background deviant ability is a core part of a character’s
concept—a character may simply have been born with the
power to light things on fire by whistling, or they may have
gained it as part of whatever incident set them down the
road to adventure.
When using background deviant abilities, the player
should get to decide what type of deviation they want and
build their power. As the player grows, they should be able
to improve their deviant ability, whether through special
training, seeking out objects of power, or self-improvement,
represented as taking additional deviant ability feats.
If everyone in your party wishes to make deviant abilities
a part of their character, or for a setting where these abilities
are more common, consider using a variant similar to the
free archetype variant rule (described on page 194 of the
Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide) to grant each character an
extra class feat at 2nd level and every even-numbered level
thereafter that they can use only to take deviant feats. In
most cases, they can gain every possible deviant ability feat
by 16th level in this fashion, so there’s no need to grant
extra feats after that.

CAMPAIGN DEVIANT ABILITIES
A campaign deviant ability comes about as part of the
story of your campaign. The party may find themselves
with strangely expanded senses after taking shelter
beneath an ancient monolith, or they might drink from a
spring of pure magic in a grove and find themselves able to
command the elements. As the GM, you should decide the
specifics of the deviant abilities yourself, matching them
to the event and themes of your campaign. The players
might not discover the full capabilities or quirks of their
new abilities immediately. Consider waiting for a dramatic
moment to reveal that a player has gained a deviant
ability, perhaps letting them unleash an unexpected blast
of lightning right when they need it the most.
Because a campaign deviant ability is normally only
present for a level or maybe two, you usually don’t
have to worry about advancing the ability or adjusting
campaign rewards to take stock of your PCs’ additional
powers. Rather, simply keep in mind that the players might
have an extra source of damage or utility ability up their
sleeve while they are in a given town or dungeon. Be clear
with your players that their newly acquired abilities are
temporary; for instance, it might be that the powers the
players gained from the ancient monolith will fade once
their journey takes them too far. If a player enjoys their
deviant ability and wants to keep it even after the moment
in the campaign has passed, work with them to develop a
story that fits their character—maybe they take a piece of
the monolith with them, letting them keep their powers.
In this case, you can give them the opportunity to retrain
some of their existing feats into deviant ability feats or let
them take those feats again in the future.
Building a Deviant
Ability
Decide what deviant ability you want to build, and what
event led to the deviant ability or awoke it. Each ability
comprises a main classification—grouping energy projection
or enhanced physiology together—with an attendant
backlash effect that can occur when the unstable power
is pushed too far, and finally, one or more strange quirks
(page 103) that personalize the deviant ability further.
If building a background deviant ability, take a feat from
the classification that best matches the power you want—
these ability classifications determine the general theme of
your ability, as well as what type of backlash can happen if
your ability runs rampant. For instance, if your power is to
breathe blasts of electricity, you could take the Storming
Breath feat from the dragon classification, which covers
energy manipulation. Once you have gained a feat in
a given classification, you can take only feats from
that classification, as well as universal deviant ability
feats. If you are playing with campaign deviant
abilities, simply grant your player the abilities
that best fit the story, ignoring the split between
classifications if needed.
Deviant Classifications
The Dark Archive classifies deviant abilities into broad
categories, typically filing them according to their ultimate
effects, since the source of the deviations range so widely.
If you are advancing your deviant ability, you can do so
with the below deviant feats. Feats with the deviant trait
are class feats, but can be taken by any class. When you
take the feat, it gains the trait appropriate for your class.
DEVIATION SAVES AND ATTACK ROLLS
Many deviations allow for a saving throw or have other
abilities that change as you go up in level. The DC for
any saving throw called for by a deviation is the higher
of your class DC or spell DC. The attack modifier of a
deviation is 10 lower than that DC, unless the deviation
calls for a Strike, in which case the attack modifier is
the normal attack modifier of the Strike. A deviation’s
counteract modifier is equal to your counteract modifier.

BACKLASH
The same blood that lets one of the dragon-descended spit
out a gout of flame is precisely what keeps the inside of
their mouth from being singed in the furnace. Deviations,
unfortunately, lack these safeguards, their powers coming
from haphazard circumstance and interactions rather
than intentional design. A character using their deviation
always risks the chance of backlash.
Whenever you attempt to use a deviation, roll a DC 5
flat check. On a success, you use your deviation and the
DC for subsequent checks increases by 5, to a maximum
of 20; on a failure, you use your deviation and then suffer
a backlash effect, after which your flat check DC resets to
5. Backlash progresses from mild, to moderate, to severe.
When you have already taken mild backlash in a given
day, the next time you would take backlash, you take the
moderate backlash instead, and if you have already taken
moderate backlash, you take the severe backlash instead,
and your deviation can’t be used for the rest of the day—
attempting to use it simply brings pain. When you make
your daily preparations, your flat check DC returns to 5
and your next backlash returns to mild.
Any effects from backlash can’t be reduced, prevented,
or otherwise bypassed. Conditions and damage you take
from backlash can’t be reduced or prevented by resistance
or immunity, but still triggers any weakness you have to it.
AWAKENED POWERS
A deviant ability’s unstable nature means it can grow in
power at a later point, responding to a stressful moment or
continuing to evolve along a mysterious path. “Awakening”
lines in deviant feats represent possible paths the power’s
awakening can take. You don’t gain the awakening unless
you take a feat that grants you those benefits. You can gain
only one awakening for a given deviant feat.
UNIVERSAL FEATS
These feats are useful for any deviant ability user. If you’re
using the background approach, you can select these feats
regardless of your classification.
AWAKENED POWER
FEAT 4
RARE
DEVIANT
Your power spontaneously evolves or reconfigures itself. You gain
one awakening benefit for a deviant feat of 4th level or lower.
Special You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, choose a different deviant feat of 4th level or lower, and gain
one of its awakening benefits.
GREATER AWAKENED POWER
FEAT 10
RARE
DEVIANT
Your power undergoes yet another awakening. You gain one
awakening benefit for a deviant feat of 10th level or lower.
Special You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you
do, choose a different deviant feat of 10th level or lower, and
gain one of its awakening benefits.
DRAGON
Deviant abilities often trace their origin to massive
concentrations of energy, such as being at ground zero of
a detonating magical artifact. These energies can linger
within an individual to grant them deviations falling under
the dragon classification—gouts of flame, electrical breath,
and the like—projecting and absorbing it to great effect.
When you gain a dragon-type deviation, choose a type of
damage, from cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. All abilities you
gain from this deviation deal this type of damage and add the
corresponding trait to the ability. You also use this damage
type for the damage and weakness from your backlash.
BLASTING BEAMS [one-action]
FEAT 2
RARE
ATTACK
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Requirements You have a free hand.
A directed beam of heat or an arc of lightning is one of the
simplest ways to project energy. You fire a blast or beam from
one hand. Make an attack roll against a creature within 30 feet.
If you succeed, the beam deals 1d6 damage for every 2 levels
you have to the target, or double damage on a critical success.
Awakening Your beams blast through targets. Instead of
making an attack roll to damage a single creature within 30
feet, you can use Blasting Beams as a 2-action activity to
damage all creatures in a 60-foot line, with a basic Reflex save.
Awakening You can choose to launch smaller, quicker
beams from your eyes instead. These deal d4s instead of d6s,
but the attack has the agile trait, and you don’t need a hand
free to make it, though your eyes must be uncovered.
CONSUME ENERGY [reaction]
FEAT 2
RARE
ABJURATION
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
Trigger An enemy within 60 feet uses an ability that has the
trait corresponding to your deviation damage type.
Your connection to energy is so much stronger than the
offending display in front of you, allowing you to claim it for
yourself. Attempt a counteract check against the triggering
effect as you draw it into your body. If you successfully
counteract the ability, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to
double the counteract level of the ability, which last for 1 minute.
Awakening The energy you consume helps empower your
abilities. The next ability from the dragon classification that
you use increases its range by 30 feet if it has a range, or
increases its area by 10 feet if it’s a cone or line. If you don’t
use this benefit within 1 minute, it fades.
Awakening You channel some of the seized energy into
your next attack. Choose one of your weapons or unarmed
attacks. Until the end of your next turn, Strikes with the
chosen weapon or unarmed attack deal an additional 1d6
damage of a type matching the energy you consumed.
STORMING BREATH [two-actions]
FEAT 6
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
You spit out a freezing breath or sonic scream. You deal 4d6
damage, plus 1d6 damage for every level you have beyond 6th,
to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a basic Reflex save.

Awakening Your blast powerfully batters your foes. A
creature that critically fails its save is knocked prone.
Awakening The kickback of your blast helps you make a
speedy escape. When you use this ability, you Fly backward
15 feet in a straight line directly opposite your blast. This
movement doesn’t trigger reactions based on movement.
PROPULSIVE LEAP [one-action]
FEAT 10
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
By expelling flames from your feet or levitating through electrical
repulsion, you propel yourself through the air. For 1 minute, you
gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed or 20 feet, whichever is
greater. If you aren’t on solid ground at the end of your turn,
you must attempt another backlash check for your deviation,
though you remain airborne even if you fail your check unless
the damage from the check renders you unconscious.
Awakening You blast through the air at great speed, gaining
a +15-foot status bonus to your Fly speed from Propulsive Leap.
Awakening You can use your propulsion as a makeshift
weapon. The first time each round you Fly starting from the
ground, all creatures adjacent to you take 1d4 damage for
every 2 levels you have, with a basic Reflex save.
Backlash: Energetic Meltdown
As you channel energy through your deviant abilities, some
of it turns back on you, spiking your body temperature or
dancing across your skin.
Mild Backlash You take damage equal to your level as
energy scours your body.
Moderate Backlash Energy wracks your body. After taking
the damage, you gain weakness to the energy type of your
backlash until your next daily preparations. The weakness is
equal to one-third of your level. You also lose immunity to the
energy type if you had it, until your next daily preparations.
Severe Backlash Whatever furnace or well within you that
provides the energy for your deviation overloads completely,
cascading out of you in an uncontrolled burst. You deal 1d6
damage per level to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation with
a basic Fortitude save. You automatically take full damage
without attempting a save.
TROLL
Especially common when a deviant ability is born of
scientific experimentation, the troll classification connotes
improved physical abilities. While often thought of as
biological mutation, clockwork implants and personal
magical enhancements are equally likely mechanisms.
BONE SPIKES [one-action]
FEAT 2
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Sharp shards of bone tear forth from your elbows, wrists, or
other parts of your body. For 1 minute, you can make bone
spike unarmed Strikes, which deal 1d6 piercing damage and
have the versatile S and sweep trails. When you take the
Bone Spikes action, you can choose one weapon on your
person and duplicate its weapon runes onto your bone
spikes (with the exception of any runes that couldn’t apply
to the bone spears).
Awakening Your bones grow longer, lashing flexibly at
range. While you have bone spikes, you can Interact to give
your bone spikes reach 10 feet until the end of the current turn.
Awakening Grooves in your bone spikes form a channel for
venom. Your bone spikes deal 1d4 persistent poison damage,
which increases to 2d4 at 10th level and 3d4 at 18th level.
TITAN SWING [two-actions]
FEAT 2
RARE
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Your limbs tense as you deliver a mighty swing. Make a melee
Strike. If it hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage and
push the target back by 5 feet. If you’re at least 10th level,
increase this to two extra dice and push the target by 10 feet,
and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice
and push the target by 15 feet.
Awakening On a critical hit, you push the target back
double the normal distance and knock it prone.
Awakening On a hit, you deal 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
This increases to 2d6 at 10th level and 3d6 at 18th level.
HIGH-SPEED REGENERATION [free-action]
FEAT 6
RARE
DEVIANT
HEALING
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Trigger Your turn begins.
Your wounds knit together with barely a thought. You regain Hit
Points equal to double your level. When you gain this deviation,
the GM secretly selects one type of energy damage or precious
material, such as fire or cold iron. When you take damage of
that type, your wound smokes until the end of your next turn,
preventing you from using High-Speed Regeneration.
Awakening Your regeneration can automatically save you
from the brink of death. Once per day, you can use High-Speed
Regeneration when your Hit Points would be reduced to 0
instead of the usual trigger. You avoid being knocked out and
remain at the number of HP you regained.
Awakening Regrowth invigorates you. You gain a +10-foot
status bonus to your Speed until the end of your turn.
TECTONIC STOMP [two-actions]
FEAT 10
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
You cause minor tremors that topple your enemies. All creatures
in a 30-foot emanation who are standing on the ground take
1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have, with a
basic Reflex save. A creature that fails its save also falls prone.
Awakening Your stomp also ejects large fragments from the
ground. You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground
in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can’t be
adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block
movement, and are large enough to Take Cover behind. They
have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level.
They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone
chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them
crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.
Awakening Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly. A
creature that critically fails its save is also stunned 1.

Backlash: Strained Metabolism
Your body’s overclocked physiology requires larger-than-
usual amounts of nourishment, leaving you weakened
when it kicks in mid-combat.
Mild Backlash Your metabolism immediately burns through
your body’s energy stores, making you enfeebled 1 and clumsy
1 until you take a bite of food (which usually requires 2 Interact
actions: one to retrieve the food and another to consume it).
Moderate Backlash Ravenous hunger wracks your body.
You are enfeebled 1, clumsy 1, and fatigued until you can eat a
full meal, which requires at least 10 minutes.
Severe Backlash The strain on your body is truly
incapacitating. You become sickened 2 as nausea wracks you,
and you are also enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 until you can eat a
full meal (which requires you to no longer be sickened). You
are fatigued until you can get a full night’s rest.
WRAITH
Wraith-type deviations often result from contact with
otherworldly presences or artifacts, comprising a strange
assortment of abilities that involve realms beyond our own.
EERIE FLICKER [reaction]
FEAT 2
RARE
CONJURATION
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
Trigger A enemy’s Strike would hit you and you weren’t
already concealed, hidden, or undetected by that enemy.
Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane.
You become concealed for 1 round, and the flat check for
concealment applies to the Strike that would have hit you. If
the flat check fails, the Strike misses you.
Awakening When your body flickers, you momentarily
assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against
concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes frightened 1,
and it doesn’t reduce the frightened condition from this effect
at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.
Awakening You can choose to compress your flickering
movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to
avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived
effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment
against the triggering attack increases to DC 9, but the
concealment affects only the triggering Strike.
GHOSTLY GRASP [one-action]
FEAT 2
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
An invisible arm extends from you to grab and manipulate
objects. The arm reaches up to 15 feet, grabs an unattended
object of 1 Bulk or less, and immediately deposits it in one of
your free hands or at your feet. Alternatively, it reaches up
to 15 feet and performs a simple Interact action like pushing
o p e n a window, though it can’t perform actions that
require significant mechanical dexterity. For every
5 levels you have, the amount the hand can lift
increases by 1 Bulk, and the arm’s range increases
by 15 feet. Being ghostly, the arm can affect ghosts,
spirits, and other incorporeal entities, though
in most cases, you need an awakening for this
to be useful.
Awakening Your invisible arm can grab on to an unsuspecting
target. You can modify the power’s target to be 1 creature within
range. You make an attack roll against the creature’s Fortitude
DC and add the attack trait to the action. On a success, the
target is grabbed by the arm (or restrained on a critical success).
This lasts for 1 round or until the creature Escapes.
Awakening You summon additional ghostly arms that
entwine together to push targets. You can modify the power’s
target to be 1 creature within range. You make an attack roll
against the creature’s Fortitude DC and add the attack trait to
the action. On a success, you can move the target 5 feet in any
direction (10 feet on a critical success).
ENERVATING WAIL [two-actions]
FEAT 6
RARE
AUDITORY
DEVIANT
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby.
All living creatures in a 20-foot emanation take negative
damage with a basic Fortitude save. The damage is 4d6, plus
1d6 for every level you have beyond 6th.
Awakening Your scream echoes in the mind. You can
choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes

the damage type to mental, changes the save to a Will save,
removes the auditory trait, and adds the mental trait.
Awakening Your wail saps your foes’ strength. In addition
to the normal effects, living creatures in the area are enfeebled
1 for 1 round on a success (but not a critical success), enfeebled
1 for 1 minute on a failure, and enfeebled 2 for 1 minute on a
critical failure.
DISTANT WANDERING [one-action]
FEAT 10
RARE
DEVIANT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Your body falls unconscious and your spirit projects out of it.
While in spirit form, you can’t consciously move your body, and
you are invisible and inaudible, though a creature still might
notice the signs of your presence and passing, just like for an
invisible creature affected by silence, or a prying eye. You can
freely move about, though you can’t touch or move anything,
cast spells, attack, or otherwise affect anything around you.
Despite your ghostly form, you are not incorporeal and can’t
pass through barriers you couldn’t in your body. Most effects
can’t harm your spirit form, though some spells, like spirit
blast and spirit song, explicitly damage a creature’s spirit.
You can return to your body as a free action. If you are in
spirit form at the beginning of your turn, you must attempt
another backlash check for your deviation, returning to your
body if you fail.
Awakening Your spirit moves at the speed of thought. You
gain a fly Speed and a +20-foot status bonus to your Speed
while in spirit form.
Awakening Time seems to pass more slowly while you are
projecting your spirit, letting you notice things around you.
When you enter spirit form, you can Recall Knowledge or
Seek. You are quickened while in spirit form and can use the
extra action only to Recall Knowledge or Seek.
TABLE 5: ABILITY QUIRKS
d10	 Quirk
1
Temporal Effectiveness The deviation’s power feels slightly stronger (or slightly weaker) at a specific time of day.
2
Musical Notation Your deviation produces strange ethereal tones or chimes when activated, or you activate it through
singing, whistling, or similar performance.
3
Strange Biology When you gained your deviation, you grew extra eyes, a set of chitinous antennae, or some other
strange biological feature unusual for your ancestry. While you might be able to hide it underneath clothing, your
deviant abilities all center around this organ, so it must be uncovered and unobstructed for you to use your deviation.
4
Chromatic Absorption Whenever you use your deviation, you absorb or mute a specific color from an object near you, and
any manifestation of your deviant ability has that color. The absorbed colors return to your surroundings within an hour.
5
Selective Application The deviation works slightly better (or slightly worse) on a certain type of creature (such as
gnomes or caterpillars) or material (such as glass or silver).
6
Atmospheric Disturbance When you use your deviation, tiny clouds, light wind, or other small atmospheric
disturbances occur within 5 feet of your body.
7
Fractal Sign Your deviation causes sand, droplets, small insects, or other lightweight objects to organize themselves
into strange, geometric patterns whenever activated.
8
Harmless Wound When you use your deviation, trace amounts of blood drip from your eyes or nose.
9
Strange Fuel Each day, you must consume a small amount of a specific material, such as quartz or holy water (which
you can do harmlessly), or your deviation is painful to use.
10
Forgotten Prayers When you gain your deviation, piecemeal knowledge of a forgotten language fills your mind—not
enough to communicate, but enough that you control your deviation by commanding or beseeching some higher power
in the language.
Backlash: Encroaching Presence
Seeing and touching the beyond leaves you open to its alien
influence, warping your perceptions and thoughts.
Mild Backlash Something inexplicable touches your mind,
leaving you with lingering horror. You become frightened 3.
Moderate Backlash Disorienting visions and figments cover
your vision, as if you’re seeing through another set of alien
senses. For 10 minutes, all creatures become concealed to you
as they are covered in visual distortions only you can see.
Severe Backlash Your life force is siphoned away as the
presence tugs your soul to wherever it resides. You become
doomed 1 and drained 2 until your next daily preparations.
Quirks
No two deviant abilities are exactly alike, and even when
two characters gain the same ability in the same event,
individual factors like age, ancestry, and personality alter
how their abilities manifest. Every deviant ability has one or
two quirks, determined when the ability is gained. If playing
with background deviant abilities, collaborate with your
player to decide the quirk, maybe each suggesting one. If
playing with campaign deviant abilities, simply pick quirks
that fit the story or roll randomly.
You can also use the quirks on Table 5 as a guide to invent
new ones for your players. These quirks don’t normally have
any mechanical effect, since their purpose is only to alter
minor details of a power to make them stand out, though
they may have narrative implications on occasion. If you
want to give a quirk a mechanical effect, it should never
grant more than a +1 status bonus or –1 status penalty,
and even then the statistic or check it applies to should be
narrow and not in the direct control of the character with
the quirk.

DEVIANT SPELLS
While the supernatural magic of deviant powers exist outside the frame of spellwork, the Dark Archive has been able to
develop several new spells for its field agents, especially psychics, by studying the abilities of various unique individuals.
A selection is presented below. A list of all the spells in this book by level and tradition can be found on page 216.
Spell Descriptions
BILOCATION
SPELL 9
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You exist in two places at once. When you Cast the Spell,
another copy of yourself appears in an adjacent square.
During bilocation’s duration, whenever you act, you can
choose which of your selves does so, and whenever one
of you uses a move action, you can both move. Your two
selves share Hit Points, and any condition or effect on one
affects both. If both of your selves are in the area of the
same effect, or targeted by the same multitarget effect,
you are only affected once. Even if you are reduced to 0
Hit Points or killed, both selves remain until the duration
expires. Your link continues at any distance, even across
planar boundaries. You can Dismiss the Spell, and if you
do so, you choose which of the selves vanishes and which
becomes you, allowing you to extricate one of your selves
from a dangerous situation.
BRACING TENDRILS
SPELL 3
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
Visible tendrils of force anchor your body to the ground,
preventing unwanted movement. Whenever you’re on the
ground and a creature or effect attempts to forcibly move
you from your space, you can use your spell DC in place of
your Fortitude DC as the DC of the check to move you. If
a creature wouldn’t normally need a check to move you, it
must succeed at an appropriate check (usually an Athletics
check for physical movement) against your spell DC or you
are unmoved; if an effect wouldn’t normally need a check
to move you, it must counteract bracing tendrils or you are
unmoved. When a creature fails to move you in this way, you
can choose to have the tendrils lash back and push them 5
feet away from you.
While the tendrils anchor you in place when you come
to a stop, they uproot easily to cooperate with your own
voluntary movement, so you can still move freely while
under the effect of the spell.

EMPTY PACK
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range touch; Target 1 container of 2 Bulk or less
Duration 1 hour
You render every item inside the container you touch invisible,
although the container itself remains visible. The items within
are undetected to all creatures, though a creature can attempt
to find an item by reaching into the bag, making an item
hidden to them instead if they succeed. Additionally, the spell
doesn’t prevent the items from making protrusions in the bag,
adding weight, making noise when jostling around, and so on.
However, the spell prevents anything within the container
from falling out if it’s upended. Any object removed from the
container becomes visible and remains visible even if returned
to the container.
Heightened (4th) The duration is until the next time you make
your daily preparations.
ETHERIC SHARDS
SPELL 5
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration 1 minute
You reach out and sow glittering splinters of force throughout
the area, otherworldly caltrops of will and ectoplasm. The
area is difficult terrain, even to flying or incorporeal creatures.
Any creature that moves through the area takes 1d4 piercing
damage per square traversed, with a basic Reflex save made
at the end of each move action they take through the area.
Heightened (+2) The spell’s area increases by 5 feet, and the
piercing damage increases by 1.
FALLING SKY
SPELL 8
EVOCATION
INCAPACITATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 60-foot tall, 30-foot radius cylinder
Extraordinary telekinetic pressure smashes down through
the area, battering creatures within it to the ground. All flying
creatures in the area descend to the bottom of the spell’s area,
taking twice as much bludgeoning damage as if they had
fallen the distance moved, to a maximum of 60 falling damage
if they fall 60 feet. They take this falling damage even if the
spell’s area is entirely in the air and they don’t hit the ground,
as they concuss against the bottom of the spell’s area at great
speed. Creatures on the ground and within the spell’s area,
including flying creatures forced to the ground, must attempt
Fortitude saves.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and if it was
flying, it isn’t knocked prone even though it took falling
damage.
Success The creature is knocked prone.
Failure The creature is knocked prone and stunned 2.
Critical Failure The creature is knocked prone and stunned for
1 round.

DIVINATION
ENCHANTMENT
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [one-action] somatic, verbal
Area 15-foot emanation centered on you
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You infuse the air around you with a sustained hum that
allows creatures within it to resist distractions. The DC of any
flat check to Cast a Spell while stupefied for creatures within
the area is 2 lower. Confused creatures in the area don’t attack
anyone, including themselves, and instead lose the ability to
speak coherently. You take a –2 penalty to Stealth checks to
Hide and Sneak.
IMPLEMENT OF DESTRUCTION
SPELL 4
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 enemy, and 1 weapon that is either
unattended or wielded by you or a willing ally
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death
to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the
target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy’s
mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The
effect is based on the target enemy’s Will save.
Critical Success The target enemy is unaffected.
Success The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental
damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the
end of the spell’s duration.
Failure The target weapon deals an additional 2d6 persistent
mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically
hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1 for as long as it
takes this persistent mental damage.
Critical Failure The target weapon deals an additional 4d6
persistent mental damage to the target enemy. If the enemy
is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is doomed 1.
Heightened (+2) Increase the mental damage by 1d6 on a
success, and increase the persistent mental damage by 1d6
on a failure or by 2d6 on a critical failure.
KINETIC RAM
SPELL 1
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [one-action] to [three-actions] verbal
Range varies; Targets 1 or more creatures
Saving Throw Fortitude
Gathering kinetic energy, you either focus it in a straight line
or disperse it as an encircling ripple. Any creature targeted
by this spell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be
pushed 10 feet away from you (or 20 feet on a critical failure).
The spell’s area or range and how many creatures it affects is
based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

MOMENTARY RECOVERY
SPELL 7
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet
You instantly teleport yourself and any items you’re wearing
or holding from your current space to a clear space within
range that you can see. If this teleportation would bring
another creature with you—even if you’re carrying it in an
extradimensional container—the spell is lost. After you vanish
but before you arrive, you can take up to 2 actions (or the
number of actions you spent to cast momentary recovery,
if it was fewer than 2 actions). You can’t target any other
creatures or objects with anything during these actions and
any effect with a duration that you create during these actions
ends immediately when you arrive. After you arrive, you are
slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.
MOTH’S SUPPER
SPELL 3
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
You sigh, and your breath transforms into delicate, black‑winged
butterflies and huge death’s-head hawkmoths. They flutter
about you briefly, and then range forth in search of sustenance—
fresh-spilled blood, by preference, but rotting corpses, flowering
plants, or even left-behind food will do in a pinch. They then
return, perching on your hair or shoulders and whispering their
secrets into your ears. This has three effects.
•	 You heal 2d4 Hit Points every 10 minutes.
•	 The first time during the duration when someone
successfully Treats your Wounds, you regain an
additional 4d4 Hit Points.
•	 You gain an imprecise sense out to 30 feet that senses
only freshly spilled blood and rotten flesh.
Heightened (+1) The amount of Hit Points healed every 10
minutes increases by 1d4 and the amount of Hit Points
regained from the first Treat Wounds increases by 2d4.
PHASE BOLT
CANTRIP 1
ATTACK
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that
stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a
ranged spell attack roll against your target’s AC; if the target
has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or
cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success,
you deal 1d4 piercing damage plus your spellcasting ability
modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.
Heightened (+1) The bolt’s damage increases by 1d4.
POLTERGEIST’S FURY
SPELL 6
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Area 20-foot emanation
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Your fury spills over in a telekinetic storm of terrifying
proportions. Any loose, unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less
within range are picked up and begin to orbit you at breathtaking
speeds. All creatures in the area take 6d4 piercing damage with
a basic Reflex save. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
increase the radius of the storm by 10 feet, to a maximum of
100 feet. The storm moves with you and provides you with
lesser cover, though you can’t use this cover to Hide or Sneak.
Allies within the storm who roll a success on their Reflex save
against your poltergeist’s fury get a critical success instead, as
you attempt to avoid hitting them.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
RALLY POINT
SPELL 3
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range touch; Area one 5-foot square
Duration 1 minute
You mark the area touched as a rally point. During the
spell’s duration, you can take a single action, which has the
concentrate trait, to teleport to the rally point along with
items you are wearing or holding. This teleportation fails if the
area is occupied, if the rally point is more than 120 feet away,
or if you try to bring along any other creature, even if it’s in
an extradimensional container. Once you teleport to the rally
point, the spell’s duration ends.
Heightened (7th) You can target up to four other creatures
within 30 feet, in addition to yourself. Each of you can
teleport to the rally point once during the spell’s duration,
by taking a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
The duration no longer ends once you teleport to the rally
point, though you still can’t teleport to the rally point again.
SEA OF THOUGHT
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 15-foot burst
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified
thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult
terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature
starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save
against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a

SHADOW SPY
SPELL 3
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult, primal
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 120 feet
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You mix blood, soil, and shadow together to form a half-real
homunculus in the shape of a crow, sparrow, or other bird.
You then command the bird to fly to a location within range
and observe all around it. The bird has the statistics of a
homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares
your Perception modifier. Once the spell’s duration elapses or
upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simple—“at dusk”
or “when the judge leaves”), the bird flies to your location.
If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn
all that it saw since its creation.
SOFT LANDING
SPELL 4
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 1 mile; Area 20-foot tall, 60-foot radius
cylinder with the ground at the bottom
Duration 1 minute
You create a magical field that buoys any creature or object
falling into the area, providing a harmless landing from any
height. As you generally fall 1,500 feet per round, you can cast
this spell while you are falling to ensure a
safe landing, provided you can see your
landing point and it’s within range.
TELEKINETIC BOMBARDMENT
SPELL 7
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Area 10-foot burst or 30-foot line
Saving Throw Reflex
You grasp a piece of the landscape—such as a tree, carriage, or
piece of masonry—and lob it in your foe’s direction. Your missile
crashes down in either a 10-foot burst (for most missiles) or a
30-foot line (for something long and tall, like a tree or a ship’s
mast), dealing 14d6 bludgeoning damage and turning its area
into difficult terrain as it breaks into rubble. All creatures in the
area must attempt a Reflex save. If the area is a line, it doesn’t
have to start from your square but can instead start anywhere
in range, as long as the entire area remains within range.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is knocked prone.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is knocked
prone, and is stunned 1.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
WARP STEP
CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
When you walk, the earth warps beneath your feet—your
steps extend, distance contracts, and everything is just a little
bit closer. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed until
the end of your turn. You then Stride twice. You can use warp
step to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you
have the corresponding movement type.

Adventure Background
As the meteorite that contained the Starstone fell upon
Golarion, pieces of the meteorite rained down across
the lands. Countless pieces fell on Arcadia, and while
many pieces housed skymetals, others held even greater
treasures. Some of these fragments held a power not
unlike the Starstone, having become magically irradiated
by to the Starstone’s power. These magical fragments led
to the rise of powerful, nigh deific individuals, particularly
among central Arcadia. The hero-gods of Xopatl helped
shape the land and lead the young nation to a time of
prosperity, using their powerful abilities to defend the
region from threats of all kinds.
One of these hero-gods was Yllaldo the Manifester.
Yllaldo was among the oldest and most powerful of
Xopatl’s hero-gods and would regularly leave the nation
to face dangers that other hero-gods couldn’t. While this
typically included armies and mighty beasts in other
regions of Arcadia, Yllaldo’s greatest victory took place
somewhere beyond even Golarion itself.
Yllaldo’s abilities allowed him to sense dangers from
other planes that threatened Xopatl. The most notable of
these dangers was the demon lord Nolimarthos, Keeper
of the Unmaking Song. Yllaldo traveled to the Abyss
and faced Nolimarthos, slaying the demon lord after a
legendary battle. As Nolimarthos perished, he bellowed
a note of his destructive melody, a note that continued
to ring from his now dead body. Yllaldo sensed that the
demon’s lord power lived on and the note would continue
to reverberate throughout the Great Beyond, causing
great destruction if left unchecked. Rather than allow the
malevolent tone to continue unabated, Yllaldo took it
upon himself to silence this evil sound forever.
Yllaldo took the demon lord’s jawbone, which
contained the malign resonance, and brought it with
him to Xopatl. Once there, he worked with his fellow
hero-gods to destroy the jawbone. Unfortunately, even
together, the hero-gods were unable to destroy the bone.
They found that the power of the note made it impossible
to destroy the jawbone in its current state. The hero-gods
would have to wait for the note to ring for some time and
lose some of its power before the jawbone was susceptible
to destruction. The best the hero-gods could do was seal
away the jawbone and wait until a later time to destroy it.
A SONG OF MAKING AND UNMAKING
Xopatl has always struck me with a sense of wonder, its ancient, long-lost magic casually defying what we thought
possible. The area around Yllaldo Castle has, for several years now, seen an unusually large number of people, or even
nonsapient creatures, gaining spontaneous deviant powers—at first one every few years, then yearly, and then more
frequent. Accelerating. There must be a cause. Powerful things dwell there, and nothing so powerful is ever lost. —K.H.W.

To help with this goal, Yllaldo constructed an enormous
keep near the agricultural town of Tapláche, located on
Xopatl’s southern border. He created a sprawling, maze-
like network of tunnels beneath the keep and placed the
jawbone within a magically sealed chamber hidden among
the depths. Yllaldo remained at the keep for centuries,
guarding it from intruders and using the keep as a watch
point against any threats from the nation of Nalmeras to
the south. Once Yllaldo passed away near the end of the
Age of Darkness, a number of Xopatl’s citizens moved into
what they called Yllaldo Castle. The castle would change
hands several times over the following centuries, with
the most recent residents of the keep being an order of
monks who call themselves the Order of Yllaldo and took
residence in 4608 ar.
The Order of Yllaldo has been trying their best to
maintain the castle while committing to regular patrols
of the tunnels beneath the keep. The depths of the keep
are home to countless monsters and other terrors that
took residence over the millennia of the keep’s existence.
A recent patrol attempted to clear out a bulette that had
taken residence in a cave. The battle was unsuccessful and
the monks fled from the creature. As the bulette returned
to its den in a cave beneath the keep, it collapsed one of
the walls to the sealed chamber containing Nolimarthos’s
jawbone, exposing its resonance to the world once more.
While the note reverberating from the jawbone had
become severely weakened during its containment, it still
had significant power. This power echoed throughout
the chamber, bouncing off the chamber’s magical wards
countless times over millennia. This caused the wards
to weaken over time, allowing for the wall’s accidental
destruction. Now free, the note rang out from beneath
the keep, its power changed. Rather than causing outright
destruction, it granted power to beings near the keep.
Local farmers, travelers, animals, and more soon found
themselves transformed by the resonance and gaining a
number of abilities. These abilities manifested in different
ways, with some creatures gaining control over the
elements or others gaining enhanced physical abilities.
Most became overwhelmed with this power, however, and
simply perished, destroyed by the power of the resonance.
Unclear as to what has caused the development of these
abilities, but recognizing it began after the encounter
with the bulette, the Order of Yllaldo activated a beacon
left by the Dark Archive, calling for specialists to aid in
righting the situation.
Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge ferries the PCs to Yllaldo
Castle, in the magic-saturated Arcadian nation of Xopatl.
As they approach the rose-pink stones, head monk of the
order, Edibaro Jolínarez (LN male human caretaker),
strides out to the meet them. Edibaro takes a moment to
explain the situation to the PCs before taking them to the
tunnels beneath the keep.
As the adventure begins, read or paraphrase
the following.
A muscular man with simple robes opens his tattooed arms
in greeting. “Ah, welcome, heroes! I am glad to see you have
come to aid our humble order in our time of need. I am Edibaro
Jolínarez, head monk of the Order of Yllaldo, ever in your
service.” Edibaro bows slightly.
“As you may have heard, there have been strange goings‑on
in and around Yllaldo Castle of late. I’ve learned of locals
waking with awesome and nightmarish abilities, but becoming
overwhelmed with their mysterious powers, often hurting
themselves or others in the process. While I can’t explain the
reason for these, I do believe I know when they began. Our
order routinely scours the network of tunnels and chambers
beneath the keep to clear out any creatures that might have
taken up residence. During one of these undertakings, we
ran into a powerful bulette that caused a sizable amount of
destruction. We magically sealed off the area in hopes of
returning later to finish the task, but the first transformations
and awakenings of abilities began shortly afterward. We
believe that something occurred during that engagement with
the bulette that might be the cause for all of this.
“Unfortunately, many of our order are now bedridden,
injured as others transformed or sickened by their own, and I’m
afraid our numbers are too small to safely return beneath the
keep to investigate. We assumed a group of investigators such
as yourself could take the lead and assist us with the matter.
Hopefully we can put an end to this whole matter altogether.”
Before heading into the tunnels, the PCs might have
a few questions for Edibaro. The following are a few
possible questions and Edibaro’s responses.
What are these transformations? What abilities are
people gaining? “It’s hard to say. We’ve seen everything
from extreme strength to astral projection. When these
abilities awaken, the person sometimes undergoes a
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 6th-level
characters.
A Song of Making and Unmaking takes place in
Yllaldo Castle, a keep near the town of Tapláche, in
the Arcadian nation of Xopatl. A strange artifact is
causing people to spontaneously manifest unique
abilities and powers. Rather than a blessing, these
abilities have led to chaos or loss of life as they
often consume those who awaken them. The PCs
venture into the depths of Yllaldo Castle with a
contingent of monks to investigate the matter, but
when the artifact grants the group abilities, only the
PCs survive the awakening. The PCs will have to use
their new powers to explore the tunnels and defeat
the new guardian of the artifact if they are to put a
stop to the demonic song once and for all.

physical mutation—one brother grew a second, fanged
mouth over his heart that spits bolts of lightning.”
These abilities are hurting people? “In a lot of cases,
yes. These abilities are sometimes powerful, and the
newfound power can overwhelm the person. Many
people manifest an ability and almost immediately fall
comatose. In other cases, the ability is unleashed in
a destructive manner that hurts the person and others
around them. One traveler began to unintentionally
throw things about their guest room as they were unable
to control their new telekinetic abilities. Even for those
who survive the initial awakening, their newfound
abilities are often incapacitating and unstable.”
What’s in the tunnels below the castle? “Any number of
things. The chambers have been used over generations as
storage, dormitories, libraries, and more. Since the
tunnel network appears to be massive, there could
be any number of different chambers below. The
area where you’re going appears to have been
used as burial chambers. The bulette seemed
to have dug into the tunnels by chance and
even appeared to be carving out a den
for itself. I would work under the
assumption that it’s still living
in the den and won’t take kindly
to visitors.”
Who is coming with us? “I’m
sending a few of our monks with
you. Some of them are already
downstairs, the rest will lead you
down to the appropriate area. I
have to remain here to tend to
some of the ill.”
Once the PCs are ready, a
trio of Yllaldo monks lead the
PCs down into the tunnels.
CHAMBER FEATURES
The stone tunnel and chamber
walls here were all carved by Yllaldo
during the keep’s original creation.
Unless otherwise noted, the ceilings
for all tunnels and chambers are 20
feet tall. The walls feature a regular
pattern of glimmering bas-relief
stars along the wall; while this
glimmer isn’t enough to light a
chamber on its own, touching a
star with an Interact action causes
all the stars in a chamber to glow
brighter, filling the given chamber
with dim light. Touching the star
again deactivates this light. All
doors are made from large, heavy
stone (Hardness 21, HP 84, BT
42), but open as easily as any
simple door. The doors don’t have an obvious locking
mechanism, but they do have a magical means of locking
and unlocking via a spoken command. Though the monks
normally share this command with guests and visitors,
their distraction in the ongoing crisis means they don’t
think to share it with the PCs immediately, forcing the
PCs to have to learn it themselves (or remind an available
monk). A character that recognizes that a door is magical
and succeeds at a DC 20 check to Identify Magic can
learn the command word, which is the same for all the
doors in this wing of the complex.
A1. ENTRYWAY
LOW 6
The monks lead the PCs deeper and deeper into the keep
for a few minutes before the band arrives at the entrance
to this wing of chambers. The monks note a set of
obvious guides along the floor that the PCs can use
to return to the surface if they need. When the
PCs arrive, read or paraphrase the following.
A large pair of stone doors, set with a carved star,
is the only feature in the otherwise empty hallway.
One monk proceeds toward the door,
intent on leading the group inside,
but just as she reaches out, she lets
out an anguished cry. Two more
pained screams follow, as all three
monks drop to their knees, erupting
in flames. The cries grow quiet as the
flames seem to burn away what life
remains in the monks. A moment later,
the monks’ bodies rise, still burning on
despite being exhausted of fuel. They howl in
pain as they reach out to attack!
Creatures:
The
monks’
constant
exposure to the power of Nolimarthos’s
jawbone finally ignites, quite literally.
The three each gain a deviant ability
related to manipulating fire… but become
immediately overwhelmed by it and die as
they are consumed in its power. This fiery
death combined with the power of the
jawbone’s tone causes the three monks to
immediately rise as combusted—corpses
that suffer eternal burning in their new
unlife. The combusted attack the nearest
target, keeping their distance from any
PCs that make use of ice or water abilities, such
as ray of frost or hydraulic push spells. The trio
unleash their Blazing Howl whenever available.

Ignition: Once the combusted are destroyed, the power
of Nolimarthos’s jawbone begins to affect the PCs. As
they catch their breath, the PCs feel an alien vibration
within their own bodies. What at first feels like a light hum
quickly grows into a shiver and then an overwhelming
but inaudible tone that the PCs feel throughout their own
bodies. The tone catalyzes the awakening of a deviant
ability. Each PC must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save.
On a failure, the PC falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds, or
1 minute on a critical failure. The PCs end up unharmed
regardless, as they’re able to otherwise endure the process
and manifest their own set of new deviant abilities as a
result. Grant each PC one deviant power from the deviant
power system earlier in this chapter—this can be either a
2nd-level power with an awakening, or a 6th-level power
with no awakening. Grant each PC two quirks as well;
one should be the musical notation quirk, representing the
strange tone that their powers stem from, and the second
should be unique to the PC. Try to give your players
abilities that don’t necessarily match their backstory or
character theme to underscore the anomalous nature of
the powers.
The PCs might be in shock at this development. They
might take a few moments to assess their situation, testing
out their abilities. They might even consider returning to
meet with Edibaro, explaining the unfortunate death of
the monks and the strange development of new abilities.
While Edibaro is distraught at the loss of more of his
order, he remains focused on the task at hand. He sees the
PCs’ new abilities as a boon; since the PCs are (seemingly)
able to control their new abilities to a much greater
extent than the others, Edibaro believes it will give the
PCs an edge when facing the other dangers that might lie
beneath the keep. He encourages the PCs to push on but
understands if they need some time to come to terms with
their changes. When the PCs are ready, they can continue
further into the chambers.
A2. TOMB
Several stone coffins lie along the length of this large chamber.
Each coffin appears ancient but bears carvings and decorations
that remain relatively intact. A set of doors in the northern
and southern walls lead out of the room. Larger doors allow
passage to east and west.
While Yllaldo the Manifester didn’t originally have
plans for the chambers beneath the keep, it wasn’t long
after his death that other inhabitants began making use of
the rooms. This room became one of many tombs beneath
the keep, honoring notable local figures. The identities of
the dead here have been lost to time, but the countless
generations of castle residents have done much to help
maintain the coffins.
Magical Ward: As they retreated from this area,
the Order of Yllaldo performed a ritual to seal off
the doors that allow further access to the chambers
beyond. The ritual created a magical shield of force that
prevents contact with the door. The shield is a 10th-level
abjuration effect. The shield has 100 Hit Points and
recovers 10 Hit Points every round it’s not destroyed.
Additionally, attempts to damage the shield are likely
ineffective, as anything less powerful than a +2 weapon
or other 10th‑level effect is unable to damage the shield.
If a character takes the time to study the shield, they can
learn about the shield’s nature with a successful DC 27
check to Identify Magic.
The PCs are likely to have a difficult time with making
it past the shield, but they luckily have a different means
of bypassing it: two magical foci that act as keys, created
when the shield was raised. The monks in rooms A3 and
A4 each have one of these keys. Once the PCs touch both
keys to the shield, it dissipates instantly, allowing access
to the door and the rooms beyond.
A3. LIBRARY
MODERATE 6
Several large stone tables stand in this room, each spaced
evenly. Shelves built into the wall hold hundreds of books,
several of which lie open on the central tables. Doors in the
southwestern and southeastern part of the wall lead in and
out of this room.
The books in this room were collected by the multiple
generations of castle inhabitants. As a result, the volumes
here cover a variety of disparate and unrelated topics.
The monks usually grab books from here and take them
upstairs to read and study, thus forgoing the need for
chairs in this room.
Creatures: Ximena and Adabero, two warrior
monks, were waiting to be relieved by other members
of the order, as well as the PCs. Much like the others,
the demonic jawbone’s tone eventually sparked deviant
abilities in both of them; however, these monks survived
the awakening of their abilities—Ximena gained a
perfectly cylindrical dimensional portal in the palm of
her hand that emits blasts of freezing arctic wind, while
Adabero can discorporate his body into fractal patterns
of roiling smoke and ash. The shock of the new abilities
has left them disoriented and hostile, causing them to
attack anyone that enters this room, including the PCs
or any other monks, using their new powers as often as
they are able.
If the PCs manage to subdue the monks, either by
knocking them unconscious or other means, they are
both more lucid once they come back to their senses and
are quick to apologize once they have the opportunity.
They can explain the details on the magical wards in
room A2, including the fact that the keys can dispel the
shield. They also offer their key to the PCs and note that
the other monks should have the other key. If the PCs
ask the monks to join them, they follow along until the

warded door is opened, but they don’t venture beyond
it, noting that they’re afraid of their new abilities and
don’t want to accidentally hurt the PCs.
Treasure: The monks here brought several books with
them to help perform their ritual, which remain open on
the table. One of the foci attuned to the ritual is also here.
The focus is in the form of a small, glowing piece of iron
in the shape of a diamond.

A4. DORMITORY
This plain chamber contains multiple beds along the southern
wall. Two separate doors in the northern wall allow access to
the room beyond.
The monks use this room as a guest dormitory when
large groups come to visit the castle.
Creatures: A pair of monks were resting in this
room when the jawbone awakened the power of astral
projection in them; unfortunately, their ability was too
potent and their spirits are currently lost somewhere deep
in the Antarkos Ocean, safe but unable to find their way
back. While their bodies are alive, they are comatose and
will remain so as long as they have their ability.
Treasure: One of the ritual foci, a simple glass disc,
fell beneath one of the beds in here, forgotten in the
chaos of unleashed power. A character can locate the
disc with a successful DC 16 Perception check.
A5. FIRST HALL
MODERATE 6
This large hallway connects to other chambers in the
area. The eastern hall has collapsed and is blocked by
rubble. Two characters could work together to clear out
the rubble, but the work takes 4 hours and the exhausting
work leaves the characters fatigued.
Creatures: The bulette isn’t the only creature living in
the depths beneath the keep. A pair of stag beetles kept a
nest in a cave down here, but they were crushed to death
during the monks’ fight with the bulette. The power of
the jawbone has reanimated the beetles’ corpses, and
now they lie in wait to attack anyone who enters the
chamber. 1 round after the PCs enter this hall, one of the
beetles crawls out from the rubble in the eastern hall and
attacks. The second beetle crawls out 1 round later. The
two mindlessly attack the nearest creature.

This chamber contains several niches built into the

fully decomposed.
Treasure: One of the bodies in the niche has a tin of
healer’s gel (Secrets of Magic 168) in one hand. Noticing
the tin requires a successful DC 18 Perception check.
A7. BURIAL CHAMBER
MODERATE 6
A number of bodies are lying in the various niches built
into the walls in this room.
Creatures: Several bodies were reanimated by the
power of the jawbone, transforming into sulfur zombies
in the process. The three zombies are obviously glowing
with a dull light, but they don’t begin moving until 1
round after a character enters the room. The zombies
fight until destroyed, chasing anyone beyond this room
if possible.

A8. PRAYER ROOM
This chamber features a multitude of religious symbols
and other iconography carved into a wall. The room was
used as a simple room for prayer. The array of religious
symbols expanded over millennia as castle residents
added their deities’ symbols. The wall now contains
hundreds of different religious symbols.
Treasure: A strand of holy prayer beads lies on the
ground in the southwestern corner here. A worshipper of
Kazutal left the beads here several years ago, and they’ve
never been claimed since.
A9. SECOND HALL
MODERATE 6
This hall connects to the bulette’s den.
Creatures: The jawbone’s power manifests in different
ways. While it mostly creates the potential for destruction
in the form of abilities, the tone also has the means of
calling forth destruction in the form of planar creatures
like demons and sahkils. A pair of wihsaak sahkils were
called into this room around the same time that the PCs’
own abilities awakened. The sahkils have spent their time
here slowly investigating the area. Unfortunately for the
sahkils, they are somewhat trapped here. The bulette
forced the sahkils out of its den, but the multitude of
religious symbols in the prayer room also kept the sahkils
at bay, confining them to this space between.
The sahkils are frustrated with their situation and
immediately attack anyone that enters this room. They
don’t follow anyone into the prayer room but are happy
to keep fighting in the cavern beyond, using their flight to
keep away from their foes. The wihsaaks fight to the death.

A10. STORAGE
This room was originally used to store food and alcohol,
but the residents that used this room left the castle several
centuries back, leaving the crates and barrels in this room
to decay.
Treasure: One crate contains various bottles of spoiled
wine. Among these bottles is a decanter of endless water.
A character that spends 20 minutes searching through
the storage containers can locate the decanter. Otherwise,
a character can notice the decanter immediately with a
successful DC 20 Perception check.
A11. CAVERN
SEVERE 6
Yllaldo originally connected the chambers in
this area to this natural cavern, intending to
transform into an underground garden.
The hero-god eventually decided against
this plan, hoping to seal off the area to
provide even greater protection
for the room containing the
jawbone. Yllaldo was never
able to return and finish the
task, though, and it remained
unfinished until his death.
A bulette took residence in the large cave, having found
it by chance. When the monks fought with the bulette in
the cave, its rampage destroyed several walls connected to
the cavern, including the sealed wall leading into area A12.
The massive cavern remains the home for the bulette. The
ceiling rises to 40 feet in this cave.
Creatures: While the bulette would likely have run away
after its fight with the monks, the power of the exposed
jawbone compelled the bulette to remain. Its greater
proximity to the jawbone caused the bulette to develop
unique sound-based abilities that share the same tone as
the jawbone’s song. The bulette now paces around in the
room, ignoring anyone beyond the cave. It attacks anyone
that enters, intending to defend the jawbone with its life.
While it doesn’t chase anyone beyond the cave to the
south, it will enter the sealed room to protect the jawbone.
EMPOWERED BULETTE
CREATURE 9
Pathfinder Bestiary 48
Initiative Perception +18
High-speed Regeneration The bulette’s body vibrates at
hypersonic speed before its wounds close. This High-Speed
Regeneration can be suppressed by cold damage, which
slows the bulette’s metabolism.
Storming Breath The bulette can emit a grinding scream
that deals sonic damage. When it uses this ability, it Flies
backward 15 feet in a straight line directly opposite its blast.
This movement doesn’t trigger reactions based on movement.
A12. SEALED ROOM
The walls of this room are marked with countless magical
runes, glowing and dimming in alternating patterns. A
massive bone marked with similar runes rests on a stone altar
in the center of the room. The southeastern portion of the
room has collapsed, opening out into a large cavern. A barely
perceptible humming fills the air, cloying against the skin.
Yllaldo and the other hero-gods created this magical
safe room to seal away the power of Nolimarthos’s
jawbone. The bone itself also bears several runes to
help contain the jawbone’s power. The room was
intentionally hidden away to avoid any disruptions
to the magic’s power. Unfortunately, with the wall’s
collapse, the power of the seals
weakened significantly, allowing
the tone of Nolimarthos’s song
of unmaking to ring out beyond
this chamber.
The song’s power is nearing its
end after millennia, and the jawbone
is now vulnerable. Having gained
their powers from the jawbone, the
PCs now have its resonance within their
bodies, which they can use to destroy the
jawbone once and for all. If the PCs enter
the chamber, the jawbone’s tone compels them to leave
the chamber. A character that succeeds a DC 23 Will
save can approach the jawbone. On a failure, a character
takes 2d10 nonlethal mental damage (double damage
on a critical failure) and can’t approach for 10 minutes.
Once a character can reach the jawbone, grabbing
the bone causes the tone to subside. This allows the
other PCs to approach safely. If all of the PCs touch
the jawbone together, their collective resonance causes
the jawbone to shatter, putting an end to Nolimarthos’s
song forever.
CONCLUSION
With Nolimarthos’s jawbone destroyed, the last
remnants of the demon lord’s song of making and
unmaking come to an end. This also puts an end to
the deviant abilities affecting the region. Anyone that
developed an ability due to the jawbone loses it within
the next few hours as the embers of power sputter out,
which also reverses the effects on the monks.
Once the PCs return to Edibaro, he praises the PCs
for their work in destroying the jawbone and ending
the uncontrolled outbreak of deviant abilities. If the PCs
ask Edibaro about the jawbone, the monk is not able
to share any information on it. He was unaware of the
jawbone’s existence and chalks the jawbone up to the
mysterious nature of the hero-gods of ancient time. For
now, the PCs can rest well knowing that the people of
Xopatl are safe from this danger.

The Inn of Healing
Incident Location: [Redacted] Inn, Verduran Forest,
Andoran, Avistan
Incident Type: Fountain
Reporting Archivist: Aether Kels
When tragedy sunk my great-aunt’s vessel, I, eldest of
her grandnieces, was called away to settle her affairs. Of
great many worthwhile items, I felt oddly struck by one
of them: an antique, unlabeled bottle full of rich liquid.
Though sealed shut with wax, it wasn’t quite full. The
red liquid looked superficially like many wines I have
encountered, yet it was clearly unlike any of them. I can’t
say whether I knew this from its viscosity, or color, or
from no clear sign at all. Curious, I took it downstairs,
setting it on the windowsill before I slumbered.
Near midnight, I awoke with a start. The bottle, slightly
aglow, caught my eye—I felt a curious fright. Full moon’s
light revealed within it deep, swirling bands of red...
“Imbibe me, all will be well...” Did I hear it, or was I
too worn from stress?
Suddenly a leather-bound diary fell from a high shelf
with a CRACK! The pages stared at me, the book open to
perfectly display a specific entry. I snatched it up, curious
about the page it had fallen to and began to read. What
follows are the contents of that entry:
After arriving at Mirus Inn, I took respite in the garden.
’Twas there I met the inn keep, who looked not over 30
summers old, long braids shining in the moonlight. She
walked with an ethereal grace. Her smile eased every
pain in my heart. Before I retired, she motioned toward
me, handing me a glass of wine. “Try this,” she said. “Let
your heart be glad.” The draft—a deep, bold red—felt
kind on my throat. Immediately, I felt immense lightness
to my step, ease in my heart. I slept with sweeter dreams
than in many moons.
In the garden under early light she greeted
me with a weary smile. I presumed she’d not
slept well, and thinking no more of it, saw
her not till late meal. She reappeared after
supper, carrying another glass of wine. “For
you,” she said, voice low. “Thank you, m’lady!”
I said, winking, hoping I’d give her cheer. If
she laughed then, I don’t know. She stumbled
forward as I caught her arm to break her fall.
Why was her skin so cold? She smiled weakly,
limping away. The wine, rich as last time, left
my heart further at ease. Retiring much renewed, I
slept well through the night.
Next day, I strolled through an oak grove nearby,
finding a strange, long ditch. A tall stone there bore
two chalk tally marks—odder still... a handprint
in the dirt nearby, as if someone recently
scrambled out. I shivered deeply, retreating toward the
inn. I queried the cook about the inn keep, whom I’d not
seen all morning. “She’s weary. Needs rest,”he said, with
dismissive nonchalance. Worry rose in my throat.
I went in search of the inn keep’s room and found her
door wide open. A thin voice spoke, “Come.” She waved
shakily from her divan, unbraided hair spilling over
her nightdress in disarray. “Drink.” Upon the table
sat an empty wineglass and a bottle with drops of wine
spilled down the sides. Except it was not wine. It seemed
a much deeper, brighter red, and far thicker, too. It
looked almost like blood. Locking eyes with her, I could
not withhold my terror.
“The spring here grants eternal life,” she said
solemnly. “Don’t drink it, else you’ll know my plight.”
“This...”my voice cracked. I couldn’t ask.
“Yes.”Her eyes looked mournful, “My blood holds magic,
not to make another live forever, just regain what one has
lost. I’m fated to revive. In one moon-cycle I shall be anew,
and though it tires me so, I will be ready to give of myself
once more”
Through tears I muttered, “Why?”
“I soothe all broken hearts I can. Each death offers
short respite.”
The cook arrived, looking grim. Taking her frail form
carefully into his arms, he motioned I follow. Among the
oaks we laid her down, bedsheet wrapped around her
like a cocoon, in the ditch I’d seen that morning. On
his demand, I wrote a third tally upon the stone, into a
well-worn groove. How many times had she sacrificed so?
Birdsong, which had failed as we carried her, started up
again, frantic and alive. Departing, I thought I heard a
faint breath, a soft sigh, echo throughout the woods.
Returning, the cook poured the wine into a flask.
“Take it when your heart becomes weary, or soul
troubled.” With that, I departed, ne’er to return.
Though I feel part of her is still with me... forever
in my blood.

Sounds of Violence
Incident Location: Nanzhu, Quain, Tian Xia
Incident Type: Siren
Reporting Archivist: Di Renjie, Senior Detective
It’s Inspector Di Renjie of Quain reporting. I know
it’s been a while since my last correspondence to
you, and I apologize in advance for the absence
of pleasantries. Something dangerous has found its
way to Quain, and I believe our field teams lack
sufficient resources to contain it. The incident in
question occurred roughly three weeks ago and was
brought to the Archive’s attention by a local contact
in the magistrate who reported spontaneous acts of
mass violence that decimated the
population of a small agricultural town
west of Nanzhu.
I charged a small response team
to join me in the investigation, arriving
two days after the magistrate’s
report. Upon arrival the village appeared
abandoned, as though a great battle
had been fought. Buildings were reduced
to rubble, bodies littered the streets, and the
foul smell of decay lingered on the air. We
discovered dozens of corpses in various degrees
of mutilation, but not all were created by conventional
weaponry. My team noted many of the victims’ wounds
appeared to be caused by humanoid bites. Most of the
dead showed no signs of defensive wounds, almost as
though they were active participants in the carnage.
The team searched what buildings remained and
discovered a single survivor, an elderly woman named
Qing Shan, beneath the floorboards of the village
temple to Qi Zhong. According to the witness, a drifter
wearing the attire of a cattle herder came into town
carrying an ornate wind instrument crafted from the
horn of an ox. She claims the drifter sent nearly
everyone in the village into a state of animalistic rage
with a single blow of the horn.
As if summoned by her words, a low, growling sound
rang out. Upon hearing it, she cried out for everyone
to cover their ears. I managed to heed her advice,
though not before experiencing an intense pressure
in my ears. Some of my newer trainees were not so
quick. They cast down their weapons, howled with
rage, and charged forward with inhuman speed.
As they set into us with their bare teeth, I couldn’t
render them unconscious with my martial arts alone
and was forced to turn my blade against my own
agents. In the melee, I glimpsed the drifter Qing
Shan described. He stood upon a hilltop, playing his
horn with bloody fingers, but I was unable to pursue.
My remaining team will relocate Qing Shan to a
secure location to conduct a detailed study of how
she was able to resist the power of this object. I
believe the wielder of the instrument might be taunting
the Archive and other similar groups, causing the
massacre to draw us into the countryside and
showing off the horn’s ability to incite violent urges.
I fear such an object could be used to destabilize
major cities.
My official recommendation is for the Archive to
send specialists to locate this cattle herder and
secure the horn—clearly a highly volatile object of vile
magical power.
HORN OF THE AOYIN
ITEM 13
RARE
CURSED ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This musical instrument is crafted from the horn of an
aoyin—a large, cannibalistic beast whose form resembles
an ox with a white body, four horns, and hair as coarse as
straw—and carved with fell
symbols. If the horn of the
aoyin’s owner doesn’t use
the instrument’s activation
on sapient creatures at least
once a day, the horn of the
aoyin activates at some point
of its own choosing on the
owner, and the owner critically
fails with no saving throw.
Activate [two-actions] Interact (auditory, emotion, enchantment,
incapacitation, magical, mental); Requirements You’re
trained in Performance; Frequency once per hour; Effect
You blow the horn, creating a low growling sound.
Creatures other than you within 60 feet must attempt a DC
30 Will save. Those who fail become overwhelmed with an
animalistic rage and the urge to consume flesh for 1 round,
or 1 minute on a critical failure. They indiscriminately
attack the nearest target unaffected by the magic of the
horn unless there are no such targets, at which point
they set on each other. While affected, they gain a jaws
unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage, deal an
additional 2 damage with unarmed attacks, and lose the
ability to use any weaponry. They also gain a +2 status
bonus to saving throws against mental effects and pain,
can detect bleeding creatures and open wounds as an
imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet, and gain a +10-
foot status bonus to their Speed. Lastly, they take a –1
penalty to AC and are unable to use concentrate actions
other than Seeking. Creatures who critically succeed are
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
Craft Requirements A horn of the aoyin can be crafted only
from a single aoyin horn. Crafting this object must be
undertaken using tools soaked in the wielder’s blood.

So it was with Archivist Irabie, after the Red Glove
Conspiracy. What looked like her wasn’t, but it was able
to fool us for some time. Her evil reflection burrowed
undetected into the Dark Archive like termites into
wood, until everything threatened to come crumbling
down. Fortunately, we had the resources to set things
right—we captured the creature, returned to Druma,
found the darkside mirror that stole Irabie, and
rescued our colleague. But was she the only one to be
changed? Or are there more out there? Doppelgangers,
reflections, clones. Anyone could be a victim. Worse,
anyone could be a false face, masquerading for
long enough to destroy the life they’ve assumed and
everything around them.
Irabie described her experience as being trapped in
a formless void, a vast, monochromatic emptiness with
no surface. Just silver fog extending in all directions.
Circles of light hung in nothingness, offering glimpses of
our reality. She said she could see us with her impostor
through one and cried out, but we heard nothing.
And she wasn’t alone there. She encountered silvery
humanoids and formless oozes glistening with prismatic
light that “echoed” as if each were seen a half-dozen
times, like a mirror reflecting itself over and over. Most
left her alone, she said, but some seemed threatening, so
she kept her distance. If they have a society, she saw no
sign of it.
This didn’t match descriptions we’d read from other
darkside mirror survivors. Their accounts hinted at
alternate realities that appeared like our own except for
eerie distinctions reversing some aspect of our reality.
Irabie’s experience suggested a new destination, which
we named the Echoing Pale. Thus, after her return, we
sought to enter the Echoing Pale ourselves, but despite
DOORS INTO THE
ECHOING PALE
On the nature of reflections,
mirrors, and what lies beyond
We should be able to trust what our eyes tell us, but we’ve seen enough in our
travels to know we can’t always do so. Our reflection in a mirror, for example:
it looks like our face, but it’s not really. It’s reversed—scars, tattoos, blemishes,
all on the wrong side. What else lies beyond the silver-and-glass frame? And what might come through?

its apparent similarities to the Shadow and Ethereal
Planes, it resisted our efforts. Spells that let us breach the
barriers between planes simply failed to work. So, if not
a transitive plane, it must instead be another dimension,
or even—like the Dreamlands and Dimension of Time—
inapproachable via normal means of planar travel.
Another reality. Yet, where spells fail, other ways to
cross the barrier seem far easier. Those circles of light
Irabie noted appear to correspond to mirrors in our
reality, each one a potential portal to this strange realm
that lurks behind the glass.
Another extant mystery: is this Echoing Pale, like
some planes, evil in and of itself? If mirror twins emerge
from this formless void, shouldn’t—like a mirror—they
be an opposite? Evil replacing good, vice versa. But we
know any twin that arrives via a darkside mirror is
malevolent, regardless of whether it’s replacing a good
or evil person. Could this behavior be related instead to
the magic that creates a darkside mirror? Or perhaps
beings from the Echoing Pale willing to use such a device
are simply the malefactors of their realm? If the Echoing
Pale is evil, does it have any influence on “reflections”
that don’t come through the darkside mirrors? Some
we’ve encountered appear to have good intentions, but
perhaps they’re simply better at hiding their nature.
Do different kinds of darkside mirrors operate
in different ways? If so, what distinguishes their
classifications, and how can we tell which are connected
to the Echoing Pale? Perhaps they all are connected. Are
the tales of inverted realms more like our own plane
recounted by victims who found themselves in the
places beyond the Echoing Pale? Perhaps the Echoing
Pale connects us to multiple realities in a way that could
help explain some of the other unsolved cases involving
echoes of events that seemed to have never happened
(see the Imbricated Courier Incident).
I suspect two groups could give us more insight: the
jadwiga of Irrisen and shadowcallers of Nidal. Sadly,
neither group is known for its cooperation. Remember
the Heldren Freeze? We know from those events the
jadwiga ice witches use mirrors to communicate and
scry. The shadowcallers in Pangolais’s Dusk Hall
sacrifice body parts to create their own nightglass,
the reflective stone that summons shadow duplicates,
similar to documented reflections. Sometimes when
such summoning goes wrong, the entire shadowcaller
instead ends up replaced with a duplicate. It’s long been
thought that nightglass tapped into the Shadow Plane,
but what if some critical error instead connected them
to the Echoing Pale? More importantly, what if there
are far more of these reflections than known in those
countries? And if they prove to be mirrored—good
versions of their progenitors—what could that mean?
Might there be a hidden group of good reflections hiding
in those societies, just waiting for some inspiration to
reveal themselves?
A FALSE AND FRIENDLY FACE
As if the denizens of the Echoing Pale weren’t enough
reason for concern, there are similar creatures and
constructs across Golarion. Every society has its
impostors—fey pranksters, rakshasas in Vudra, kuwa oni
in Tian Xia, Azlant’s veiled masters, dragons—but they
typically “create” a new person and use their span of
years to build power. It’s easy to be cautious around a new
face, but few are suspicious of old friends—we wouldn’t
have survived Jaha’s Aeon Orrery without relying on
Arakag Star-Eyes. How much more monstrous to replace
a person and take their life in every sense of the words
(yes, some impostors take advantage of a long absence or
imprisonment, but typically something willing to steal a
life doesn’t scruple about murder). And they’ve no need
to create relationships, as those come already made.
Perhaps none are more infamous than doppelgangers,
which toy with their victims mercilessly. For some, gold
is the aim, but others delight in destroying lives simply
because they can. More recently, we’ve heard disturbing
news of these solitary monsters finding common cause
to deal with an existential problem: something appears
to be locking them into their forms. Disease? Poison?
Curse? Or is someone putting a stop to them? If it’s
just doppelgangers, we don’t need to worry, but what
if it spreads to other shapechangers? Several druids
in the forest of Kyonin have expressed such concerns
after encountering afflicted doppelgangers in Galt and
the River Kingdoms. They don’t want to be trapped as
animals or, worse, an unmoving tree.
And then there are the creations of magicians and
artisans that come to life, whether intentional or not.
Many of these reflections hate the person whose form
they share, and they don’t just try to claim their life,
but undo it. Is this some influence of the Echoing Pale?
Or simple jealousy or anger? If the latter, it’s certainly
understandable. We don’t blame a wasp for stinging
after its nest has been kicked. Recall the trompe l’oeil—a
creature painted into existence to be a spy, guardian,
assassin. Imagine the masterpiece stepping forth for
the first time from its canvas to discover it was created
not as art, but as a tool. Or if it emerges spontaneously
thanks to the natural magic invoked by the perfection of
its creator’s work, discovering it was never meant to live
at all: no mindless golem, this living sculpture becomes
a flesh and blood twin of their subject. Surely that must
breed resentment.
Thankfully, we didn’t see any such animosity in a
strange small village we encountered in Arcadia. The
villagers there seemed ordinary enough, except they
numbered 20 women who looked just like one another
and 17 men who were similarly identical. A span of ages,
but clearly the same person. No children to be seen. Our
explorations led us to a cliffside laboratory of one of
the owl-headed syrinx, where we found several more of
these villagers immersed in strange goo. Their description

matches that of the clones encountered during the return
of the runelords in Varisia. If the runelords (and likely
other Thassilonians) knew how to copy themselves,
certainly syrinxes could develop the same skill. A small
village of clones doesn’t seem like a major threat, but what
was its purpose? Who were the original pair this village
was copied from? And do these copies only look like the
originals, or might they also mimic skills, faculties, and
magic? A terrifying thought in the case of the runelords.
Two beings of such power, clashing together.
ACCIDENTAL ARRIVALS
Of course, not all such artificial
duplicates are intentional. Magic goes
awry and common spells suddenly and
spontaneously
manifest
duplicates.
How widespread is this? Why does
it happen? There must be answers!
The spells range in power from the
relatively simple mirror image that
many new adventurers master to more
powerful effects, such as replicate and
mirror’s misfortune. In some number of
cases, when the spell ends, the illusion
created remains, a corporeal twin.
Our mission to the Mana Wastes to
disassemble a Catastrophe Rune led
to one such arrival, but other reports
say they have spawned from bungled
attempts to counter or dispel magic or
arisen when the caster is killed in the
very process of sustaining their spell. Some claim the
progenitor and duplicate must act even more in tandem
than expected with such magic, must be in the presence
of some reflective surface, or must be separated (is this
more common with the mislead spell?).
Archivist Irabie—the actual Irabie, who became
obsessed with these investigations after her return—
hypothesized the calendar could factor into this. Known
instances all happened on “mirrored” or “doubled”
dates: the 11th or 22nd of a month, or some other
palindromic number, such as Rova 17, 4719, when we
confirmed two instances in Garund and Avistan. I knew,
I simply knew her hunch had to be right, it explained
everything. Indeed, upon subsequent research, she was
able to confirm another such duplication event involving
a mountain priest in Shenmen, on the 12th of Sarenith
in 4716, or 7216 in the Imperial Calendar.
Unexpected duplicates seem to vary in their outlooks.
Some hate their creators for making them act as decoys
to allow their creator to escape unharmed. Others try
to carry on as their progenitor would have (especially
if their progenitor dies). Yet others simply try to
establish their own life, even going so far as changing
their appearance (how they dress, tattoos, facial hair) to
distinguish themselves.
IMPOSTORS, KNOWN AND SUSPECTED
False faces can lurk behind any warm smile. Forget reported
fey abductions and other humdrum. (The Vidric envoy
hasn’t been replaced by a mirror-risen reflection in New
Stetven, Archivist Hathshi. She’s acting strangely because
she’s having an affair. Not everyone!) Many reports of
duplicates seem to center on locations. If barriers between
our world and the Shadow Plane/First World/Ethereal
Plane is thinner at some spots, could there be locations
where the Echoing Pale exerts a stronger influence?
•	 Solitary students at the Seven Veils
Academy in Quantium find their way to
a basement study room with a crystalline
pool. Rumors claim if they cast a simple
mirror image spell in there, their images
take on more independent forms, letting
them form their own study group. But
sometimes students emerge... different.
They seem fixated on solving all their
problems. Sometimes it’s as simple as
revealing misdeeds that are troubling
their conscience (though this frequently
causes new problems), but sometimes it’s
more dire. One ambitious boy became
the top student by the simple method of
murdering his rival. Effective, but hardly
best practice. Schoolmaster Denungar
Neev won’t allow us to investigate, and
the school’s focus on illusion magic means
they’re well used to spotting subterfuge.
•	 Haseong’s Twin Orchids Theater is
known for the elaborate dramas it stages. Claims
its actors are the finest in Tian Xia. Some are so
dedicated they never shed their role and go so far as
to start resembling their subjects even after they step
off the stage. It might just be method acting, but such
a simple explanation defies the queen’s decision to
forbid the staging of the new play The Sail and the
Sky—wildly popular at other theaters—or any other
dramas or pieces featuring herself or other members
of the Nuri dynasty. This has caused much dismay in
the city, so the queen clearly fears what these “actors”
could be capable of.
•	 More ominous is the Fellowship of Guile’s Guise,
a collective of fell gnomes based in Jalmeray that
use their illusion magic to stave off the Bleaching.
They take the face and place of an innocent, random
(investigate this) victim and delight in seeing how
long they can maintain their impersonation and how
far they can push its bounds before people realize
the truth. Their victims return—or are returned—to
find their lives in shambles. Based on location, we
assumed many of this fellowship were worshippers of
Sivanah, but recent rumors indicating some members
are taking money for specific impersonations hint at
a Norgorberite influence.

Methods of their creation vary, but all reflections are
duplicates of someone else existing in the world. Some are
drawn out from literal mirrors, developing a life of their
own once set free from the Echoing Pale. Mirror-focused
rituals or spells can create independent reflections,
whether deliberately or accidentally, as can the magical
hazard known as a darkside mirror, which replaces those
looking into it with malicious duplicates. Some reflections
are created as magical clones by spellcasters, only to turn
on their creators or be left adrift, while others arise from
polymorph magic gone wrong.
If you want a character who seeks to forge their own
identity in the face of their duplicate nature, with a strong
tie to another character somewhere out there in the world,
you should play a reflection.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Feel as though you’re just an out-of-place imitation.
•	 Want to keep your nature a secret from everyone
except trusted companions.
•	 Be extremely dedicated to your friends or anyone
who gives you a sense of community.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Don’t realize your true nature as a copy.
•	 Expect you to be plotting a nefarious fate for your
progenitor.
•	 Are wary of or intrigued by your unusual abilities.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
A reflection’s physical appearance almost exactly matches
their progenitor’s. In mirror-risen reflections, their
appearance is reversed, so details such as scars are on
the opposite side. Other reflections often have a swirled
mark somewhere on their bodies, appearing as a tattoo or
birthmark. Reflections are typically indistinguishable from
a regular member of that ancestry.
SOCIETY
As duplicates of others, and ones that appear only in rare
circumstances, reflections have no inherent society of
their own. Many reflections have a degree of existential
angst, struggling to find somewhere they feel they belong
and won’t be identified as a “fake.” A reflection’s greatest
(though not necessarily best) bond is usually to their
progenitor. Progenitors and their reflections are sometimes
aware of each other, with some progenitors taking their
reflection under their wing, which often grants the
reflection a greater sense of community.
ALIGNMENT AND RELIGION
Despite the tales, not all reflections are malevolent.
Reflections formed from darkside mirrors are always evil, but
others usually have either the alignment of their progenitor
or the exact opposite one—many good-aligned reflections
arise from the nefarious experiments of an evil alchemist or
spellcaster. Most reflections are wary of religion, but those
who adhere to a faith are typically extremely devout.
REFLECTION (VERSATILE HERITAGE)
Stories of malevolent duplicates are commonly told around campfires to frighten companions. In these tales, the
duplicate forms after a botched ritual or exposure to a mysterious artifact, and is bent on replacing the creature they’ve
replicated. Most believe such stories to be only that, but such reflection duplicates are real. While some wish to replace
their progenitors, others merely want to forge a new life for themselves where no one knows of their origins.

REFLECTION (RARE HERITAGE)
You were created as a duplicate of another creature,
intentionally or accidentally, though you might not know
of your origins. Other than a minor mark or two, you
look just like your progenitor. You gain the reflection
trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You
don’t need to attempt Deception checks to Impersonate
your progenitor unless you’re interacting with people who
know them personally or you do something known to be
out of character for them. The GM might require you to
roll a Deception check in other circumstances, such as if
you’re mirror-risen and interacting with someone who has
seen an accurate likeness of your progenitor and might
notice a distinguishing feature on the reverse side. You can
choose from reflection feats and feats from your ancestry
whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Reflection Feats
The following feats are available to reflection characters.
1ST LEVEL
CLONE-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were formed from a clone ritual or alchemical experiment.
Created as a vessel for another creature, you can suppress
your sentience momentarily, making your mind harder to
alter. You gain the Empty Vessel reaction.
Empty Vessel [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per day;
Trigger You would take mental damage or be affected by
a mental effect; Effect You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to Will saves and resistance to mental damage equal to
your level against the triggering effect. This applies only
to the initial effect, not successive saves, persistent mental
damage, or other repeated effects.
MIRROR-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were created from magic
involving mirrors and still retain
some ability to seek refuge in
reflected illusions. You gain the
Mirror’s Trickery reaction.
Mirror’s Trickery [reaction] (concentrate,
illusion, occult, visual) Frequency
once per day; Trigger You would be hit
by a Strike; Effect You create an illusory duplicate at the
last instant and attempt to trick your foe into striking it
instead of you. The attacker attempts a DC 11 flat check; on
a failure, the attack hits the duplicate, changing the result
from a critical success to a success or a success to a failure.
MORPH-RISEN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
REFLECTION
You were once a shapeshifter or spellcaster using polymorph
magic, but something went wrong, and you became trapped
in the form of the creature you were imitating. This accident
might have drained your power, or you might have retained
some of your skills, but either way, your form resists further
forced transformation. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to saving throws against transmutation effects, and if you
roll a success on a saving throw against a hostile morph or
polymorph effect, you get a critical success instead.
PROGENITOR LORE
FEAT 1
REFLECTION
You didn’t just inherit your physical form from your progenitor;
you also retained some of their knowledge. You’re trained in
Deception and Occultism. If you would automatically become
trained in one of those skills (from your background or class,
for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice. You also become trained in a Lore corresponding to
your ancestry (e. g., Elf Lore if your progenitor is an elf).
WARPED REFLECTION [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
FEAR
MENTAL
REFLECTION
VISUAL
Frequency once per minute
Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most.
You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within
30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though
this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the
target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a Will
save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or
become frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical failure) and
be stupefied 1 as long as the frightened condition lasts.
Once you’ve used Warped Reflection against a creature, it’s
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
5TH LEVEL
MISTAKEN IDENTITY [reaction]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
MENTAL
REFLECTION
Frequency once per minute
Trigger You’re about to attempt a
saving throw against a mental effect.
You feel a strong connection with
your progenitor and can convince
yourself an effect targeting your
mind was meant for theirs instead,
allowing you to shrug off harmful
effects. Roll the saving throw twice, and
take the higher result. However, subsuming your
identity is disturbing, and you’re frightened 1.
REFLECTIVE POCKET
FEAT 5
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Mirror-Risen
You’ve formed a connection with a small hand mirror, allowing
you to use it as an extradimensional storage space. You can
store one item of light Bulk in your mirror at a time. Storing or
retrieving an item requires an Interact action and any creature
can do so. While an item is stored within the mirror, the mirror

reflects the item’s image. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Stealth checks to Conceal the Object unless someone checks
the mirror’s reflection.
REPLICATE
FEAT 5
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Clone-Risen
You’ve learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast
illusory disguise once per day as an innate occult spell. This
is a transmutation and morph effect, as your body physically
transforms, rather than an illusion effect.
WARP LIKENESS [one-action]
FEAT 5
MORPH
OCCULT
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Morph-Risen
Frequency once per minute
Requirements You hit a creature with a melee Strike on your
last action.
You channel some of your own nature through your blow,
temporarily warping your target’s form to resemble your own.
The creature you hit must attempt a Fortitude save against the
higher of your class DC or spell DC.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target resists the effect but its form twists in the
process. It’s clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn.
Failure The target’s body briefly warps to resemble yours. It’s
clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn and sickened 1.
Critical Failure The target’s body warps to resemble yours for

9TH LEVEL
MIRROR REFUGE [two-actions]
FEAT 9
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
OCCULT
REFLECTION
Prerequisites Mirror-Risen
Frequency once per day
Requirements You’re within 5 feet of a mirrored surface.
Your origin in the space behind mirrors enables you to use a
mirror as a hideaway, like the spell meld into stone. You meld
into an adjacent mirror. You can hear but not see outside this
space, and creatures outside can’t see or hear you. You can
cast spells while within the mirror, but no effects can cross
the mirror. Your Mirror Refuge lasts for 10 minutes unless the
mirror is broken, which expels you and deals 10d6 damage to
you. You can Dismiss the effect. You appear in a space adjacent
to the mirror when the effect ends.
TWO TRUTHS [one-action]
FEAT 9
REFLECTION
Prerequisites master in Deception
Your ability to imitate your progenitor is so strong, you can even
convince yourself. When you use this action, you alter your
thought processes to your progenitor or from your progenitor
back to yourself. As long as what you say is true from the point
of view of your current identity, you can say it even under
effects like zone of truth that force you to speak truly.
UNYIELDING DISGUISE
FEAT 9
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites ability to cast humanoid form or illusory disguise
When you cast humanoid form or illusory disguise to alter your
appearance, the spell’s duration is 2 hours. At the end of the
duration, you can extend the spell’s duration for another hour,
but doing so is taxing, making you drained 1. You can keep
extending it in this way, increasing your drained condition by
1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
13TH LEVEL
MALLEABLE FORM [one-action]
FEAT 13
REFLECTION
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites ability to cast at least one polymorph spell
Requirements You’re polymorphed by a spell that has multiple
choices of battle form.
You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance.
Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting
you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This
destabilizes the spell’s magic, reducing its duration by 1 round.
Use the level of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
REDIRECT ATTENTION
FEAT 13
REFLECTION
Through your strong connection with your progenitor, you’re
able to redirect those attempting to spy on you. Whenever
you would be directly targeted with a scrying effect, the effect
must attempt a counteract check against the higher of your
spell DC or class DC. If the check fails, the effect targets your
progenitor instead of you.
17TH LEVEL
REFLECT FOE
FEAT 17
REFLECTION
You create a copy of a foe by calling them forth from a nearby
reflection, clonally growing them in an instant from one of
your hairs or otherwise creating them in a way that matches
your own nature as a reflection. You can cast duplicate foe
once per day as an innate occult spell. At 20th level, your
innate duplicate foe is heightened to 8th level.
FINAL USURPATION
If your progenitor is deceased, you might be able to
take over their life. It might require a special ritual
and other activities taking 1 week, as you take over
your progenitor’s lodgings, activities, relationships,
and so on. Once you finish, provided no creature
has successfully identified you as an impostor, the
memories of everyone who knew or interacted with
your progenitor are altered, so they forget your
progenitor’s usual personality and behavior in favor
of yours, and you no longer risk discovery for acting
out of character for them. You belong now.

Effect The creature is confused by
the illusions and directed back into
the room they attempted to exit
through another doorway or back
to the hallway’s beginning. This
feels no different to the triggering

value below 1.
HAZARDS OF PERCEPTION
Hazards are traps and obstacles that can enhance exploration or be the focus of encounters entirely. Many of the
hazards in this section involve bending perception, creating duplicates, or otherwise creating a spooky and unsettling
atmosphere, perfect for haunted houses and similar locations.

Alter Ego (Archetype)
A highly guarded castle in the middle of an extravagant
ball, the headquarters of a city’s infamous thieves’ guild,
the locked room in the back of a cultist hideout—all
perfect targets for you to use your expertise at blending
in. Rather than skulking through the shadows, you
use your training and latent supernatural abilities to
become a mirror, playing on the perceptions of others
and taking on whatever role necessary to get in and out
of your destination before anyone has a chance to think
something is amiss.
Performing an alter ego means going unregarded.
Passing as just a face in the crowd is crucial, and accolades
come as the gratitude from your leaders or coin from your
clients, rather than the awed adoration from a crowd.
This arrangement might suit you fine, as you thrive in
a job well done and on the thrill of walking flagrantly
past your duped adversaries. Or it might become pent
up, until you can’t resist a dramatic reveal or a signature
calling card that shows you were there. One final word
before speeding away from the castle, a gloating message
left behind, or some other sign reveals your skill—usually
too late for your victims to do anything about it.

UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Deception and Stealth
You make yourself into a living mirror, becoming a double
of someone unremarkable, and you slip into exactly the role
that can get you past security or into a sensitive facility.
You become an expert in Deception. You gain the Assume
a Role activity.
Assume a Role (concentrate) Requirements You’ve spent at
least 1 hour studying a creature whose role you intend to
copy and have done so within the last 3 days. This could
include meeting and learning from someone in that role,
tailing and spying on someone, using magic to observe
them at work, or some other method, as long as you have
a visual source of information; Effect You quickly and
accurately learn how to do mundane jobs or at least copy
the movements enough to appear as if you do. A chosen
role can take many forms—from cook, cleaner, or librarian
to cult member, priest, or duke—but it’s always a role and
never a specific individual.
You perform the Impersonate activity to pass as
a member of the role you observed and gain a +1
circumstance bonus to any Deception checks you attempt
in your impersonation. This takes the normal amount of
time it takes you to Impersonate. You also choose one
Lore skill relevant to that role (such as Farming Lore for
a farmer). While in your role, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to checks for that Lore skill, and if you’re untrained
in it, you can use your level as your proficiency bonus.
You stop assuming the role after 24 hours, if you start
studying for a new role, or if you choose to.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the alter ego archetype.
CHANGE OF FACE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires
not only the right skills but also the right look—luckily you
can copy both using special magical techniques. When you
Impersonate, you don’t need a disguise kit; instead, simple
illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your
body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit
ordinarily would. When you Impersonate in this way, your
Impersonate activity gains the occult trait.

FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
When you take on a role, you become more capable with
all sorts of tasks involving that role. When you Assume a
Role, choose two skills associated with the role in some
way; if you’re untrained, you can use your level as your
proficiency bonus for those skills, and you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to skill checks with those skills as long
as you remain in that role. You and the GM determine which
skills you assume.
IN PLAIN SIGHT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
People often only see what they want to see, a weakness
you know how to take full advantage of. While you’ve
Assumed a Role, you can use Deception in place of Stealth
when using the Avoid Notice exploration activity in an area
where someone with your role wouldn’t be unusual, such
as when impersonating a sailor or fisher when infiltrating
the docks.
SOUND MIRROR
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well,
allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor
noises as distractions—perfect for misdirection and
infiltration. You can cast silence on yourself as a 2nd-level
innate occult spell and ventriloquism as a 1st-level innate
occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast ghost
sound as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained
in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key
spellcasting ability is Charisma.
MUSCLE MIMICRY [reaction]
FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
SKILL
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication; trained in Athletics,
master in Deception
Trigger An enemy makes a successful Disarm, Escape,
Grapple, Shove, or Trip attempt.
Your study of another allows you to mirror their movements
subtly, even in the heat of combat. You study the successful
maneuver of an enemy and instinctively learn to do it. The
next time you take the same action they did, you gain a
+1 circumstance bonus to your Athletics check, or a +2
circumstance bonus if the enemy critically succeeded on
their triggering action. You lose this benefit if you don’t use
it before the end of your next turn.
SWAP REFLECTIONS [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
INCAPACITATION
OCCULT
TELEPORTATION
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
You’ve learned how to use even your reflection to your
advantage. You send your own reflection to forcibly swap
places with the reflection of an enemy, pulling each of you
through opposite ends and switching places. The enemy
must be within 120 feet, you must both be adjacent to
reflective surfaces (such as glass, mirrors, or calm water),
and you must be able to see the target’s reflection and have
line of effect to it. The target attempts a Will save against
your spell DC or class DC, whichever is higher.
Critical Success The spell has no effect.
Success You swap positions with your target or arrive
adjacent to your target, whichever your target prefers.
Failure You swap positions with your target or arrive
adjacent to your target, whichever you prefer.
Critical Failure You instantaneously swap positions with
your target, and the target becomes trapped in its own
reflection for 1 minute. Once on each of its turns, the
target can spend 1 action to attempt another Will save to
escape. If the save succeeds, the effect ends early.
BORROW MEMORIES
FEAT 14
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Alter Ego Dedication
Knowing how someone thinks makes it much easier to know
where they’ll be, or even replace them altogether. You can
cast mind probe as an innate occult spell once per day, using
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
If you cast mind probe on a target you’re studying for the
purpose of Assuming their Role, and the target fails their
save, you can delay the spell from coming into effect until
you Assume their Role. When you use the spell this way,
you can Sustain it up to 10 times during its duration, asking
a question each time. The spell lasts until you ask all 10
questions or are no longer Assuming the Role, whichever
comes first. You don’t need to Sustain the Spell to extend its
duration—only when asking a question—nor do you need to
be in range or have line of effect to Sustain it.
ALTER EGOS IN GOLARION
While some alter egos work independently as
freelancers, they’re especially popular in all sorts
of espionage and intelligence agencies throughout
the Inner Sea and beyond. The Lion Blades of
Taldor, Twilight Talons of Andoran, Silver Ravens
of Ravounel, and various Chelaxian secret police
use alter egos to keep abreast of situations
throughout the Shining Kingdoms and Old Cheliax.
Meanwhile, powerful mercantile groups, like the
Golden League in Tian Xia or the Aspis Consortium,
employ alter egos for corporate espionage,
making sure they always stay one step ahead of
the competition. In Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse,
the rebels known as the Bright Lions often seek
the aid of alter egos to escape the notice of the
mummified child god Walkena.

Adventure Background
In the outskirts of the town of Ravengro, Ustalav, lies a
once-luxurious estate built by Count Eigen Lorres after
he established the infamous Harrowstone Prison. At the
height of his power, Lorres had the grand mansion built
to demonstrate his new wealth. Its most famous feature
was a spectacular hall of mirrors, a sight never before
seen in Ustalav’s war-torn history, leading to the moniker
the mansion still keeps to this day: the House of Mirrors.
Lorres purchased a tremendous amount of art during the
construction of his new estate. Chief among these pieces
was Lady of the Harvest, a celebrated work by a master
of the mid-late Age of Enthronement period. However,
as soon as Lady of the Harvest arrived at the House of
Mirrors, strange phenomena began to plague the manor
and its construction crew. Rumors circulated of freak
accidents befalling the workers as well as a few unexplained
disappearances. The crew also swore the painting had a
habit of appearing in random rooms throughout the house,
regardless of where it was hanging when the workers left
the previous night. After Lorres was deposed, the mansion
remained uninhabited for over a century.
Ravengro has stabilized into a small but prosperous
agricultural town overshadowed at times by its gruesome
history. The city council decided to seize the opportunity
of Lady of the Harvest’s upcoming 500th anniversary
to bring some positive attention to the town. They hope
to turn the house into a museum with the painting as its
centerpiece—but first, someone must deal with the pesky
alleged curse, the PCs.
However, a blood painter (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 33)
named Ogkrix wants the painting too. When news spread
of the House of Mirrors’ planned reopening, and the
accompanying unveiling of the cursed Lady of the Harvest,
Ogkrix made his way to Ravengro to claim the painting
for himself. However, he was quickly thwarted by the
painting’s habit of disappearing whenever anyone gets too
close, and its tendency to suck trespassers inside it, only
to spit them out in another room some time later. So far,
Ogkrix has been unable to get his hands on the painting.
Assuming at least one PC will be sucked into the painting,
he intends to replace that PC using his illusion magic and
tag along until they can overcome whatever supernatural
obstacle the painting poses.
LADY OF THE HARVEST
Ustalav has been the source of a disproportionate number of our open cases. Large enough for strange phenomena to
be noticed, small enough for them to remain unsolved, at the fringes. Lorres Manor, in Ravengro, is a nexus of such
events—accidents befalling the workers who built it, objects moving, possibly some kind of haunting (or curse)?
whatever the case, the mansion’s relative obscurity is likely the only thing keeping the events contained. — K.H.W.

Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge deposits the PCs in Ravengro,
where they can make their way to Lorres Manor. The city
council’s notes outlined the house’s history in their request
as well as the information that both the house and the
500-year-old painting inside are said to be cursed. While
the PCs can check with the council if they so choose, it has
no further information to share with the PCs about the
manor and its current state. No one has dared investigate
the house after its abandonment a century ago, other than
a few young people who haven’t been seen since.
FIRST FLOOR
Ceilings on the first floor are 10 feet high, and most floors
are made of once-stunning white marble that has since
become dull and covered in dust. Cobwebs fill the house,
and a pervasive smell of dust fills the entire building, which
will likely irritate the PCs’ senses but has no mechanical
impact. The blood painter Ogkrix (page 128), who has
been scoping out the house as he plans his theft of Lady of
the Harvest, left several smudges of blood behind while he
passed through the old house. These smudges are marked
with a Clues heading in the relevant areas.
A1. TERRACE
As the PCs approach the manor, read the following text.
The old manor looms above an overgrown, derelict garden.
Now very little remains but blackberry brambles and a
partially collapsed gazebo. Grand marble columns frame the
manor’s terrace entrance, the Taldan architecture out of place
with the traditional Ustalavic architecture outside the manor’s
grounds. Tall windows framed by smaller, decorative columns
outline most of the house, though a cursory look at the house’s
rear reveals the back half of the second floor is windowless.
Jutting out from the second floor at the house’s front, however,
appears to be the wall-to-wall windows of a solarium, facing
the west. Grime and decay cover nearly every visible surface
of the house, though it looks structurally sound—at least from
the outside.
A2. VESTIBULE
A gaunt woman with a sharply receding hairline greets the
PCs at the door and welcomes them inside. She introduces
herself as Liro Traventhal with a small bow of her head.
“Thank you for coming,” Liro says, holding out her arm to collect
coats and bags. “Lorres Manor contains a great many historic
works of art. Though some restoration will be necessary, the
hall of mirrors should be spectacular, and the solarium on the
second floor was apparently lovely. Though, who knows how
it’s been transformed by time. Regardless, if you have any
questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.”
If the PCs have questions for Liro about the curse, she
has a limited amount of information she has learned as
a local. She knows that numerous accidents befell the
construction crew, as their descendants still live in the
town. Additionally, she claims three children went missing
after breaking into the house on a dare (found in area B4).
As far as she knows, no one has entered the building since
then, until now. She wears a charm under her shirt, which
was given to her by the local healer to protect her from
the curse.
Clue: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception check
notices a streak of blood on the doorframe leading into the
foyer (area A3).
A3. FOYER
A grand but badly deteriorated staircase occupies the center
of this foyer, leading to the second floor (as described in
area B1). In the north and south corners, alcoves lead to
servant-access staircases. The doors to the staircases are
locked (DC 25 Thievery to Pick a Lock, requiring four
successes, or DC 30 Athletics to Force Open). The key to
the staircases can be found in area B5.
As the PCs move through the front door, read the
following aloud.
At the center of this spacious foyer is a grand staircase lined
with beautifully carved banisters, all covered in a thick layer
of dust. To the north of the stairs hangs a painting draped with
a drop cloth, completely obscuring what lies underneath.
“Here it is,” Liro says as she walks toward the shrouded
painting. “Lady of the Harvest was painted by Elsen Moonkeep
around the year 4209 ar. It traded hands many times before it
ended up in Count Lorres’s collection. He acquired it specifically
to be the centerpiece of his new home.”
Liro removes the drop cloth, revealing a painting of a lush
wheat field. A dour-looking woman stands just off-center on
the canvas, wearing a heavily starched veil and staring straight
out at the viewer. Then, right as Liro begins to speak again, the
air seems to hum before the painting erupts in a blinding light.
After a few moments, the light fades, and both Liro and the
painting are nowhere to be found.
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 7th-level
characters.
Lady of the Harvest takes place in Ravengro, a
small town in the horror-wracked nation of Ustalav.
This adventure sees the PCs entering the House of
Mirrors to assess a supposedly haunted painting,
Lady of the Harvest. The painting soon reveals
its nature by affecting the PCs with a number of
changes that affect how players roleplay at the
table, as well as secretly replacing one PC with
an evil duplicate for that player to roleplay. The
PCs will have to navigate the haunted house and
changed dynamics to recover the painting and
expose the duplicate.

Changes: When the painting’s magic activated, it did
more than suck in Liro and vanish. Each PC has been
affected by a strange change, which you should assign and
communicate to them privately. Choose from among
the following potential changes, though the first
is required. Make sure to tell the players to
keep their change a secret from the other
players. Choose the PC to replace with
Ogkrix carefully. The ideal candidate is a
player who would enjoy roleplaying as a
duplicate for a time and a character whose
absence wouldn’t wreck the party if they
discover Ogkrix early. If you choose a
character with daily resources, such as a
spellcaster, they’ll also get to feel awesome
when they return in the final fight with all
their spells. The player might also want to
fake a change similar to those the other
PCs go through to better fit in.
•	 A PC is sucked into the
painting and replaced by a
mirror double. This creature
is a disguised blood painter
named Ogkrix (page 128), drawn to
the manor by the cursed reputation of the
painting. Ogkrix hopes the PCs will take the
brunt of the effects from the curse and haunted house
while he steals the painting for his collection. The PC’s
stats don’t change when they’re replaced by the mirror
double. Ogkrix’s illusion magic is augmented by the
strange magic of the house itself to transform him fully
into an ideal copy of the PC. The double attempts to
remain undiscovered—the blood painter’s goal is to
follow the PCs until they manage to get their hands on
the painting, at which point he aims to kill the PCs and
steal it. If he’s uncovered or the impostor PC “dies,”
see the “Discovering the Double Early” sidebar on
page 132 for notes on discovering the double early.
•	 A PC who’s fluent in multiple languages loses their
ability to speak Common.
•	 A PC must speak only in questions.
•	 A PC loses the ability to say any creature’s name,
including the other party members.
•	 A PC loses the ability to tell the truth.
Painting: Though the players won’t be able to retrieve
the painting until they’ve examined the whole house, it
briefly appears and vanishes in various rooms. The PCs
should see the painting at least twice before they reach the
final encounter in area B7. If they haven’t succeeded at a
minimum of two Perception checks throughout the house
to notice the painting before it vanishes, and they’re about
to reach the end of the house, you can reveal a glimpse of
the painting to them without requiring that they attempt
a check. Once the players have each learned their secret
change, they can proceed to explore the House of Mirrors.
A4. WATER CLOSET
Clue: While there doesn’t seem to be anything of note
in this room at first glance, a PC who succeeds at a DC 23
Perception check notices a smear of blood on the corner
of the mirror.
A5. LIBRARY
MODERATE 7
The heavy smell of dust and moldering books
fills the air in this stuffy library. The wall-to-wall
bookshelves mean this room has no windows, and
the perpetual darkness and lack of circulation have
taken their toll on the furnishings and air quality. To
the northwest, a small reading nook, perhaps once
cozy, sits neglected. In the corners of the room stand
three-foot-tall marble pedestals, each topped with a
small marble statue, though one has been knocked over
and lies broken on the ground.
Creatures: Two
greater
shadows
have made this dark room their home.
One makes its lair in the once-cozy
reading nook, and the other blends into
the shadows on the shelves. The burst of
light from the PCs opening the door startles the
shadows, and they attack immediately.

A6. DINING ROOM
TRIVIAL 7
This grand dining room features a large bay window to the
northwest. On the south wall, long mirrors stretch across the
room on either side of the door. Heavy velvet curtains frame the
mirrors, a musty smell clinging to the windows and the fabric.
Painting: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception
check notices Lady of the Harvest hanging next to the bay
window, then the painting blinks out of existence.
Hazard: The strange powers of the house have warped
and distorted this room, creating a deadly trap.

A7. KITCHEN
LOW 7
The empty countertops of this kitchen, which was used
only a handful of times before the mansion was abandoned,
contrast with the well-stocked shelves. It appears the owner
never bothered to remove the fine porcelain dining ware
when the manor was abandoned, and it sits here on display in
deteriorating glass-doored cabinets.

Hazard: Another manifestation of the house’s strange
energy waits in this narrow kitchen.
CONSTRICTING HALL
HAZARD 8
Page 124
Stealth +21 (expert)
SECOND FLOOR
This floor is largely the same as the first, and in an
equal state of decay, but the ceilings are 15 feet high to
accommodate the towering hall of mirrors (area B7).
B1. SECOND FLOOR LANDING
This marble-floored landing wraps around the grand staircase.
Pseudo-classical statuettes of human figures top the pedestals
in both western corners, each draped in decorative robes, but a
layer of grime covers them.
The stairs are old and rotten. Anyone climbing them must
succeed at a DC 22 Acrobatics check to tread lightly. They
should make this check halfway up the stairs or higher.
On a failure, a creature breaks through the stairs and
falls to the floor below, taking 1d6 slashing damage from
splintering wood in addition to any falling damage. The
space on the stairs where the creature stood is then broken.
Opposite the grand staircase is the Hall of Mirrors (area
B7). The first time the PCs pass through B1 and into B7,
read the read-aloud text, but don’t run the encounters.
The hazard doesn’t activate, and the blood painter doesn’t
reveal himself until the PCs have experienced the full
extent of the curse by exploring the whole house.
Clue: A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Perception check
notices a smear of blood across the base of the statuette in
the northwest corner.
B2. MASTER BEDROOM
MODERATE 7
This master bedroom would’ve had a spectacular view of the
garden through the tall bay windows, if the garden had ever
been finished. Instead, it looks out on a tangle of overgrown
weeds and blackberry brambles. A four-poster bed occupies the
center of the room, carved in spectacular filigree. To the side, a
tall standing mirror sits in one corner, leaning slightly backward,
sporting a heavy layer of dust across its surface. A door to the
east leads into a disused but grand master bathroom.
HAUNTED HOUSE
Strange energies in the manor, combined with the deaths
that occurred, create a variety of unnatural effects.
Additionally, Ogkrix has left a mess in a number of
rooms as he cased the house. The following events can
occur in any area and, instead of being connected to a
certain location, are triggered by the PCs’ actions. Each
event describes a trigger to let you know when to run
that event. At your discretion, feel free to add or subtract
other floating events or run them at different times to
create the appropriate atmosphere for your game.
Event #1: Lost Souls
Low 7
Trigger: This event occurs the first time the PCs use
healing magic. If they do so in the middle of a combat
encounter with other creatures or a complex hazard, the
presence of the other spirits gives the ghosts pause; in that
case, the PCs hear ghostly moaning and the sounds of
ethereal construction in the ceiling right away, but wait
for 1d4 rounds to pass before the ghosts arrive so they
don’t overwhelm the PCs alongside the other encounter.
Creatures: During construction of the manor, three
workers died when a large portion of the ceiling collapsed.
Trapped in the house they gave their lives to create,
they rose as ghosts and descend through the ceiling of
whichever room the PCs currently occupy. Ending the
curse upon the mansion frees the ghosts.
ELITE GHOST COMMONERS (3)
CREATURE 5
Pathfinder Bestiary 6, 167
Initiative Stealth +14
Event #2: Ransacked
Trigger: This event triggers twice: when someone
Refocuses for the first time and after the PCs have cleared
five rooms. Once it triggers, the event only occurs after
exploring the next room.
This room has clearly been visited by some kind of
creature. Scratches and spatters of blood mark one of
the walls, a few feet off the ground and concentrated in
one area. Some of the scratches are deep enough to break
through the plaster, exposing the inner frame of the wall.
Several small objects have been knocked over in the
vicinity. The general sense is that someone has been here,
searched for something on the wall, and when they came
up empty, left a mess in their wake.
Event #3: Blood Painted
Trigger: This event occurs after the PCs have cleared
eight rooms, the next time they enter a new room.
A curtain in this room has been slathered in blood
in elaborate whirls, and a PC who succeeds at a DC 23
Perception check or DC 18 Art Lore check can tell that they
resemble brush strokes. In the center of the bloodstained
curtain, a hefty chunk of fabric has been ripped out, leaving
a gaping hole. The jagged edges suggest they were made
by claws, or perhaps teeth. Bits of frayed threads litter the
floor beneath, along with dried drops of blood.
A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 Occultism or
appropriate Lore check can tell a strange feeding ritual
done by some kind of monstrous creature made this
mess. If they critically succeed, they suspect it might be
a blood painter.

Creatures: A number of workers died during the
construction of the House of Mirrors, their tragic fate
fueled by the dark forces at work in the manor. A number
of poor souls never escaped the Material Plane, doomed
to haunt the house that killed them. One of these former
workers is now a fearsome undead called a bodak, which
arise from souls lost to harrowing supernatural evils—
for a PC who can identify the bodak, this is an ill omen
indeed about the nature of the manor and the curse within.
The other poor soul has risen as a particularly strong
poltergeist, unable to leave the place they died, filled with
rage at the living. Ending the curse upon the mansion frees
the poltergeist, but the bodak is too far gone.

the rumors of the curse were just that, unconfirmed
and under some doubt by the more brash of the town’s
inhabitants. Three young adults broke into the mansion
shortly after Lorres left it to rot—and they never left.
Doomed to haunt the house they entered as a dare, the
three have risen as poltergeists, their powers bolstered by
the manor’s dark energies. They’re set free if the curse upon

DISCOVERING THE DOUBLE EARLY
If your players are perceptive, or if the player who
has been replaced by the double is unsubtle, the
party might discover early that they’re traveling with
an impostor. In this case, Ogkrix drops his disguise
and attacks the party. This also occurs if the impostor
PC “dies,” causing the illusion to shatter and Ogkrix to
appear in his true form at full HP, as described in area
B7. Since the painting won’t have yet spat out the PC
it consumed and whose place Ogkrix took, provide
the PC who was replaced with the statistics for a
blood painter with the weak adjustment (Bestiary
6), and have them play as Ogkrix, weakened from
his obsession with finding the painting and his
devastation at being discovered. This also balances
the encounter so the PCs aren’t punished for finding
the blood painter with a difficult encounter when
they’re already down one member.

shame. Towering, ten-foot-tall mirrors line the walls, the
individual panes joined by thin lines of gold. Golden filigree
crowns each mirror’s rounded top. With both sides of the wall
lined in mirrors, each side reflects the other, creating an endless
pattern of increasingly diminishing mirrors and figures. Crystal
chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and golden statues on marble
pedestals stand in between the mirror panels, adding to the
dazzling sparkle of the hall.
As the PCs pass through this hallway to go between
the other rooms, it seems mundane and not noteworthy
beyond the sheer grandeur of it. However, a PC using
3rd‑level detect magic can sense illusion magic in this area,
as the painting masks its true location from view.
Finding the Painting: Once the PCs have traveled
through the entire house, the final time they enter this
hallway or look in its direction, Lady of the Harvest
hangs suspended, as if from thin air, in front of the wall
in the Hall of Mirrors. The painting can’t be claimed
until the hazard is disabled, and collecting the painting
ends the curse, immediately causing a wave to move
through the house. Timbers creak, windows rattle, and
lights seem to flare as the mansion’s haunting ends.
Voices of the dead spirits being freed echo through the
house briefly, recognizable to the PCs as those of the
poltergeists and ghosts.
Creature: As soon as the painting reveals itself, Ogkrix
the blood painter removes his illusions. Removing his
disguise also purges Ogkrix of any adverse conditions or
afflictions the impostor PC was suffering, and he begins
the fight at full Hit Points regardless of the condition of
the impostor PC. Ogkrix seeks to kill the PCs and take
the painting for himself in the commotion, hoping they’ll
bear the brunt of the painting’s retaliation.
As he drops his illusion, the painting shimmers for a
moment before spitting out the original PC, who returns
in whatever condition they were in when sucked into the
painting and replaced by Ogkrix’s mirror duplicate.
Hazard: Any attempt to interact with the painting
activates its magic, triggering the clone mirrors hazard.
The hazard targets creatures indiscriminately—this means
Ogkrix is just as likely to be affected by the hazard as the
PCs. If the fight proves especially difficult for the party,
at your discretion, the hazard can heavily target Ogkrix,
identifying him as the greatest threat.

Rescuing Liro: As soon as the hazard is disabled, Liro
Traventhal is spat back out. She runs for cover, going in
initiative immediately after the turn on which the hazard
was disabled. Ogkrix is likely uninterested in Liro but
might attempt to use her as a human shield if he feels
particularly desperate, or to raise the stakes.
CONCLUSION
Once the PCs disable the clone mirrors, the painting is
calm. It appears that, for now at least, they’ve successfully
defeated the magic that generated the painting’s strange
effects, including the changes the PCs were subjected
to in area A3. Liro is shaken but incredibly grateful to
the PCs for saving her. Read the following out loud to
conclude the adventure.
As the dust settles, Liro smooths her trousers and clears
her throat. “I can’t thank you enough for what you’ve done
here today,” she says. “You’ve made this house safe for the
public and saved my life. I had no idea it would be quite so
dangerous in here, and you’ve certainly gone above and
beyond. I shall see to it that you’re rewarded handsomely by
the city council.”
As Liro guides the way out of the manor, it finally seems
still. No creatures jumping out from dusty corners; no
strange effects warping the rooms’ walls. It seems the curse
really has been lifted—at least, for now.
Using detect magic reveals the painting is still magical,
though it’s unclear when, or if, its curse might reactivate.

Village of the Lost
Incident Location: Nixqiquan, Icemark, Land of the
Linnorm Kings, Avistan
Incident Type: Impostor
Reporting Archivist: Unahk Two-Blood
Bjersig,
I’ve finally reached the Varki village of Nixqiquan as
requested. Strangely, no one here seems to recall requesting
aid from the Pathfinder Society, and my inquiries into
the missing villagers mentioned in the request resulted
in nothing but curious stares and shrugs. Despite their
apparent confusion at our team’s arrival, the people here
are nonetheless friendly and welcoming, having prepared
a lodging for us to spend the evening, along with food and
drink. I can’t shake the suspicion that something is amiss.
Day 2
Day 2
We were awakened last night by a horrible
ruckus. My old bloodhound, Druthers,
apparently snuck out of our wagon to lie
outside the door of our borrowed shelter, only
to awaken us in the lightless morning hours
with a terrible baying and frantic growls.
Grabbing my cloak and club, I threw open the
door to find Druthers with his hackles raised.
Several villagers stood nearby, concerned
for our wellbeing but unwilling to approach
my fearsome protector. I managed to calm
Druthers and return him to the wagon, securing
his leash to a mounting bolt so he could leave no
farther than his resting spot beneath the open
gate. I hate to keep the old boy cooped up, but it’s in his best
interest until I can find out what got him so riled up.
Most of the villagers were in the coastal waters by the
time the sun rose, using their sleek kayaks to fish and pull up
crab pots. I’ve given our drover and the other expeditionary
members leave to accompany the villagers on their daily
outings as long as they report back regularly.
Day 3
Day 3
A deep cold settled in during the evening. The fact that
Druthers didn’t climb into the wagon to warm himself
should have made me realize something was wrong, but
the chill brings on a deep sleep and strong desire to stay
beneath a blanket’s warmth. I found our faithful hound
dead beneath the wagon this morning, a dart in the old
boy’s neck. The villagers claim not to recognize the weapon,
though they’re oddly reticent to come anywhere near
Druthers’s body.
The ground is hard from the frost and the sunlight thin,
filtered through a haze of gray clouds. While the drovers
and other members of the expedition went to sea to help
pull in the evening’s meal, I chipped away with axe and
shovel, trying to dig a decent grave for my companion
of so many journeys, but with little success. By the time
everyone returned from their fishing and crabbing, I’d
scarcely managed to carve out a hole a foot deep, three feet
long, and two feet wide—not sufficient to protect Druthers’s
remains from the animals and elements, so for now I’ve
placed my friend under a blanket at the wagon’s gate.
Sorry, boy. I knew you were getting too old and this might
be a dangerous trip. I should have left you at Iceferry,
where you could play with Mahki and the sled dogs.
Day 4
Day 4
I know now what the face of evil looks like. I was
awakened by a terrible scream as a creature,
part man and part otter, attempted to slip into my
wagon. It tripped over Druthers’s blanket-shrouded
body and the slightest contact seemed to cause it
immense pain. As I grabbed my blade and rushed
forward, I realized the wagon was surrounded. These
things have taken all my compatriots, and likely the
entire village as well.
Snatching up Druthers’s body, I retreated further into
the wagon to scribe this final entry in my log. I believe
these creatures to be the kushtaka spoken of in Varki
fireside tales, the “land otters”that steal mortals’ souls
and transform the bodies into more of their kind. I
wept as I fashioned Druthers’s thigh bone into a crude
knife, but if what I recall of the stories is true, no other
weapon in my possession will be able to harm the creatures.
I send this via a magically called messenger owl, hoping
it reaches you. Warn Nankou and the Varki! Nixqiquan is
lost and I fear for Icemark itself if these creatures expand
their reach farther inland. As soon as I finish this letter, I
shall attempt to fight my way free. Watch over me one last
time, Druthers. I need you now more than ever.

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
The blade of this +1 striking dagger is made from the thigh
bone of a canine that died in the act of protecting its
master. A werecreature or other creature willingly under
the effects of a non-permanent polymorph effect damaged
by a dog‑bone knife must attempt a DC 19 Will save or
immediately revert to its natural form—this has no effect
on a creature unwillingly polymorphed. On a successful
save, the creature is temporarily immune to this effect for 1
minute. Kushtakas and other creatures vulnerable to canines
take a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against this effect,
and this weapon overcomes any resistance such creatures
have to physical attacks.

The Criminal Hammer
Incident Location: Cheliax (various settlements), Avistan
Incident Type: Gremlin / Peregrine (hybrid designation)
Reporting Archivist: Paralictor Lorellinda Ursion, Order
of the Scourge
Paralictor Ursion’s Report
Paralictor Ursion’s Report
“The hammer,” as I shall refer to it, is a vexing
object with a seemingly supernatural ability to show
up in the hands of lawbreakers. Physically, it
appears as nothing more than a mundane ball-peen
hammer of the sort used by craftspeople. The haft
is 13 inches long and made of common ash wood but
with a distinct pattern of brass filigree.
The head is 5 inches across
and made of low-grade iron.
The entirety weighs 18 ounces.
There’s no visible maker’s mark
(likely adding tax evasion to the numerous
crimes with which it has been involved).
I have thus far been unable to detect any
magical auras on the thing but won’t rule out
the possibility. No matter the precautions taken,
the hammer, or perhaps an identical duplicate,
always finds its way into the possession of some
piece of criminal scum. Or maybe the hammer
is the cause of their illegal behavior?
It was shortly after my first promotion to
command I first encountered this accursed tool.
The hammer was among confiscated evidence
from a routine arrest for burglary. It would have
remained a mere footnote of that case were it not for
an incident less than a week later. A minor uprising
culminated with an audacious rioter injuring the local
baron. We quickly crushed the rabble. Curiously, the
weapon of choice in the assault was the hammer.
I now admit I may have been hasty in punishing
my subordinates for not properly securing the evidence
locker, but the beatings no doubt helped them build
character. Unfortunately, the guilty halfling was
killed when we crushed the rebellion, and I didn’t yet
have the authority to call in those who might be able
to interrogate the corpse. This time, I secured the
hammer personally, to no avail. Something—perhaps
the hammer itself, perhaps an outside force—removed
it from my lockup without a trace of the method.
My interest was piqued. I began to research other
cases. Lo and behold, I found dozens of hammers
matching the item’s description in files and reports
stretching back decades. Larceny seems to be a
common thread. Burglary, robbery, and pickpocketing
make up most of the reports, with a single case of
fraud and a handful of violent crimes, though I
suspect the latter also involved thefts but were simply
overshadowed. Incidents of the hammer later
disappearing emerge in some of the reports but not
others. I can’t be sure if this means something
or if it’s just a reflection of sloppy record-keeping.
The earliest account I could find is from over a
hundred years ago. A village constable confiscated
the hammer and other goods from the cottage of a
notorious burglar. If only our forebears had kept more
precise records.
A few years ago, I was given a second chance.
One of my underlings picked up a cutpurse in
possession of the hammer, a wretch of a man
named Igino the Dirty. He certainly earned that
moniker. Extensive interrogation of Igino revealed he
stole the hammer from a local tinker and hoped to
pawn it. A search of the tinker’s shop revealed signs
of a hasty retreat, but none of the tinker herself
(likely another criminal of lesser consequence). I
had the hammer in hand. In the event it was
a corrupting influence leading the weak‑willed
to crime, I decided to dispose of the thing.
I had it burned to ash and slag in a
blacksmith’s fire and then assigned my most
reliable armigers to keep watch on the remains
throughout the day and night. I must amend
that—my formerly
formerly most reliable armigers. I don’t
care which of them decided to rest their eyes when
the remains disappeared, though their denials and
accusations of each other are vigorous. They will all
be punished for their failure.
I will not allow myself the hope that this is the
end of that damned hammer. I will find where the
hammer reappears next and uncover its true nature
once and for all.

RIGHTEOUS SECRETS
As mentioned, determination of a cult is ultimately a
matter of acceptance. It should therefore come as no
surprise that devotees of even the most widely accepted
good and lawful gods can be forced underground in
places where the evil and malevolence hold social sway.
Heralds of the Herald
By direct edict of Queen Abrogail II, worship of
non‑Asmodean gods isn’t forbidden in Cheliax... yet.
The unspoken truth, of course, is that such permission
lasts only so long as the followers of other deities make
no trouble for the lawful tyranny of diabolic rule. Thus,
members of the small Iomedaean cult calling themselves
Heralds of the Herald strive to keep their heads low and
their plans of holy rebellion a secret until they can gather
the strength and support to stage an uprising.
It’s likely to be a long wait, as most Chelaxian citizens
are still somewhat sword-shy after the death of Aroden,
civil war, and a succession crisis came in such close
sequence. Others openly resent the failed promise of
the Age of Glory and willingly ally with devils to spite
the divine.
Still, the Heralds hope to keep the dream of rebellion
and freedom from diabolic rule alive, alongside the
worship of their exemplar, Iomedae. In addition to
recruitment, they train paladins in secret, passing down
tactics from the order of Azlanti-born Aroden knights
PRAYERS UTTERED
IN DARKNESS
Cults, fringe religions, apocryphal beliefs,
and underground faith
“Cult” is a small word with outsized baggage. At its most pedantic, any religion
can be called a cult, but this tends to be frowned upon outside of Rahadoum or
Touvette, as the term is widely considered disparaging or dismissive, implying
illegitimacy, corruption, or malevolent falsehood. As if no “true” religion has ever had those problems. Yet,
a rational mind need not be so sensitive, as it’s ultimately a popularity contest: if your faith falls in line
with the surrounding culture, you observe a religion. Otherwise, you’re in a cult.
From an archivist’s standpoint, this is a pity; the lesser-known faiths are often among the most fascinating.

from whom they claim to be descended. With Aroden
dead, they’ve turned their worship to his former herald in
hopes that she will one day restore divine favor to their
beloved empire. After the failed Glorious Reclamation,
there has been need for Iomedaeans to become more
circumspect in Cheliax, and so the cult has grown.
Cult of the Unyielding
Arazni views those who would pray to her with little but
contempt, hence why this small Gebbite sect doesn’t bother.
Rather than worship the goddess of dignity or risk drawing
her ire by speaking her name, the Cult of the Unyielding
instead views their patron as a model for their own
behavior. This cult quietly thrives among the abused, the
neglected, and the forsaken—of which Geb, of course, has
no shortage. It is less an organization of worship than a set
of guidelines to survive the world’s brutality with dignity.
Each member is taught to prioritize their own dignity
above all else, and yet are expected to occasionally—when
it would not risk harm to themselves—step into the life of
another downtrodden soul to offer guidance in walking
the goddess’s path. These mentorships traditionally last for
only a year and a day, after which the two must part ways
whether the mentee believes themself ready or not.
THE RED MANTIS ASSASSINS
The Red Mantis is the second-most-infamous cult in
Golarion, though I doubt anyone would dare say that
to an initiate’s face. Assuming one could see it. Unlike
the underground cults or mysteries, the dread assassins
of Mediogalti Island protect themselves and their secrets
not through secrecy and stealth but through their
overwhelming and fearsome reputation.
The assassins’ policy of refusing contracts on rightful
rulers imitates their patron, Achaekek, and his refusal to
kill true divinities. He Who Walks in Blood seems too
busy enforcing divine punishment and being a bane of
would-be deities to pay any mind to his worshippers or
offer guidance. Instead, they model themselves on his
appearance and behavior, which serve as inspiration for
their serrated weapons, their penchant to take the promise
of a favor in lieu of payment, and the particularly bloody
aesthetics of their initiation rites.
The Red Mantis’ long history of death and violence
has placed the assassins among the most infamous
organizations on the planet. But we must ask: how much
of this dread reputation is the truth? Trickery is, after
all, counted among Achaekek’s domains, and the best
assassins are neither loose-lipped nor straightforward.
Might the policy of only appearing in public garbed in
the blood-red armor and insectile masks of their trade
serve as rather perfect misdirection? While potential
targets search frantically in every shadowed corner for
the twitch of a leather antenna, how simple would it be
for a stranger in plain clothes to slip up behind them and
do the deed themself?
Much fuss has been made over the Mantis’s ability to
contact potential clients rather than be sought out, but I
propose that the truth is much simpler than scrying spells
or even an intricate information network: the Red Mantis
appear to be everywhere because they are, hiding in plain
sight behind a mask of myth, more convincing than any
physical disguise. We on the outside can’t even be sure
that the current Blood Mistress, Jakalyn, is even the true
leader, or if she’s just an obvious figurehead to draw
attention from the cult’s shadowy masterminds.
OLD CULTS
These are inevitably the first thing to spring to most minds
whenever someone mentions cults. While I cannot fathom
why mortals would pray to a deity that barely notices
them and whose directed attentions would be disastrous
at best if it did, it cannot be argued that the Old Cults of
the Dark Tapestry infest the shady underside of almost
every culture on the planet, not unlike a stubborn mold.
The Cults of Yog-Sothoth
An illustrative example of an Old Cult is the worship the
Outer God Yog-Sothoth, an ambivalent being who exists
in all places and all moments simultaneously. Thankfully,
Yog-Sothoth is unable to manifest in the mortal universe
unless summoned, though less thankfully, his cults often
attempt to do just that through occult ritual or profane
sacrifice. Isolated individuals, or at best small cells,
each striving to attract the attention of something from
beyond the stars in exchange for a boon—knowledge of
the truth of our universe, in this case—that wiser minds
would know is better left unsought.
INITIATION RITUALS
Initiation rites are a defining feature of mystery
cults, though they also feature in other sects,
including the Red Mantis. These tend to be the most
well known of a cult’s rites, as they are the only
ones in which it is possible to fail or bow out before
reaching the sacred vows of secrecy.
For example, it’s known even to outsiders that
new initiates to the Red Mantis must subject
themselves to many years of arduous training
before being ritually submerged in a baptism of
animal blood. Upon emerging from this, they’re
immediately armed with a sawtooth saber and must
fight one of their fellow initiates to the death. Only
after surviving this rite are they permitted to take
their final oaths and don the mantis-shaped mask,
believing themselves to have been reborn in blood,
much like their god.
The initiation rituals of other cults tend to be a
little less violent, but all generally embody similar
themes of exiting or ending one’s normal life to
devote themselves to a higher purpose.

The Silent Sect of the Black Butterfly
Though the Black Butterfly is no Elder God, those
followers of hers devoted to this sect defiantly place
themselves among the Old Cults in declared opposition to
the evils of the Dark Tapestry. These faithful train in the
arts of investigation, infiltration, and stealth, all to devote
themselves to exposing and, if necessary, exterminating
the cults of the Elder Mythos wherever they appear. In
doing so, they hope to weaken their opponents’ masters
so that the Butterfly can mirror their actions in the space
between stars, cleansing it of all evil and claiming it as her
domain alone. The “Silent” part of their name comes from
situational vows of silence, which permit the
members to operate normally in their
everyday lives—so long as they refrain
from speaking while directly at work
against the forces of evil.
CULTS OF THE DESTROYER
AND THE END TIMES
The most inexplicable of all
to outsiders, the cults of
Rovagug, Groetus, and
other figures of inevitable
destruction have likely
been a part of creation
for as long as that creation
has been self-aware. Like
the Old Cults, they crop up
in all known civilizations and
inevitably cause trouble for anyone unfortunate
enough to cross their paths, sometimes resulting in
swaths of destruction that lead to the suffering of dozens if
not hundreds of people.
Why, though, would anyone pray for the end of the
world? The simplest answer: they don’t. While some of
these cultists view the world as so inherently broken and
corrupt that divine destruction is the only path to a better
future, many others simply believe the end to be inevitable
more than desire it actively. After all, the unprecedented
coalition of divinities that fought Rovagug could only
contain, not destroy him. When that containment fails—
which it no doubt will eventually—can there be any hope
of resistance, even with divine numbers bolstered by
mortal apotheosis? The very existence of Groetus seems to
confirm that there can’t. Even the River of Souls will one
day stop flowing. Even the gods must one day die.
Therefore, believers’ priorities shift to ensuring that they
and theirs are on the “winning” side in hopes of some small
mercy, even if that means they’re simply the last to go.
MYSTERY CULTS
While all cults guard their secrets and treasures, the
so-called mystery cults—or simply “the mysteries”—take
it all a step further by limiting their participation to a select
group of initiates, who are in turn forbidden from revealing
their secrets to the outside world. Research suggests that
these cults are among the oldest religious expressions in
the world.
The Cult of Sacred Intoxication
Thought to have first appeared shortly after the invention
of wine, this cult’s many incarnations are known to ferment
over time amid outcasts and the downtrodden, becoming
a prominent counter-cultural force. The seeds of its rituals
then spread throughout the world, where they take root in
other lands and begin the cycle anew.
Uniting these otherwise disparate sects is their idol of
worship: the state of intoxication, primarily from alcohol
but also from other drugs, medicinal plants, and
poisons. These faithful revere drunkenness as “the
Little Apotheosis,” a method through which all
mortals, no matter their status or ability, can
be freed from social mores and grow closer
to the divine. Participants, however, are not
encouraged to form drinking habits, especially
not to the extent that it might harm
their
day-to-day
lives.
Rather,
worship for these cultists seems
to take primarily the form
of raucous parties in private
or secluded locations, during
which all participants endeavor
to remain as intoxicated as
possible for days while indulging
in their whims for food, violence,
passion, and dancing. Rumors of
ritualistic animal dismemberment and consumption are
unconfirmed, though we feel safe in concluding that the
stories of sentient creatures being likewise torn apart are
little more than libel.
While deities of alcohol and indulgence are sometimes
invoked during these rituals, it’s only as patrons, exemplars,
heralds of intoxication, or potential drinking buddies. In
modern times, the cult’s influence is relatively weak in the
Inner Sea, as most of its local branches were subsumed
into the faith of Cayden Cailean after his ascension; it yet
maintains a decent presence in Tian Xia, where revelers
will often set aside a dedicated barrel of wine in case Sun
Wukong decides he’d like to join in.
The Sacred Truth of Love Above All
Aside from its ostentatious name, little is known about
this particular mystery cult. It’s thought to have originated
in Vudra sometime during the Age of Anguish, but this
is merely a rough guess based on the archaeological
remnants of its shrines, which are found in mountain
ranges throughout Casmaron and the Inner Sea, as well
as on mountainous islands in Iblydos. The ages of these
sites vary wildly from the ancient to the modern, with the
latter being the only documented indication of the cult’s
continued survival.

And survive it does, despite all expectations. While its
numbers, tenets, true purpose, and recruitment methods
all remain shrouded in secrecy, outside research suggests
that there’s always exactly one small sect of the faith active
at any given time, and that they worship a pair of gods
characterized as lovers separated by death. An aspect of
Shizuru and Tsukiyo, perhaps? Though the choice of shrine
location within natural caves, decorated with carvings and
a specific kind of flowering Casmar ivy, suggests otherwise.
On the other hand, our scant historical records and the
presence of star charts at some shrines seem to indicate that
the Sacred Truth appears in particular locations determined
by astrological phenomena. Presumably, shrines
are built and mystics initiated in preparation
for this astrological event, during which
the entire sect (roughly a dozen people)
enter their shrines and remain inside
for 3 full days. What further rituals they
perform there remain, as with most of their
secrets, a complete mystery. The only known
requirement of the holy caves is that they can
in no way be tied to the Darklands. The
most recently discovered shrines
reach barely more than a dozen
feet
before
dead-ending
into
solid rock.
The Wandering Way
While the intoxication cult and
Sacred Truth maintain their existence
through cycles in which sects rise, fall,
and then rise anew, the followers of the Wandering Way
maintain, conceal, and spread their faith through the very
thing they venerate: roads, and most specifically, those roads
that connect civilizations across a vast distance of wilds,
though it seems they also include hunting paths, hiking
trails, and all other paths created by sapient creatures.
The faithful, who call themselves the Wandering Ones,
are most often itinerant travelers—typically lone wanderers
or small groups of companions, but occasionally including
entire Varisian caravans or the extended families of
nomadic Arcadians. Our fellow adventurers may even have
spoken with one or more of them on their travels without
knowing it, as they are widespread and signal their faith
to one another only through a particular knot-like design
that can easily be concealed in travel clothing, jewelry,
tattoos, or even braided hair.
The Wandering Ones are known to be personable, as
they consider the bonds between individuals to be invisible
roads uniting their hearts. While they rarely broach the
subject first, most proudly acknowledge their faith when
asked about it by outsiders and can even answer questions.
One such fellow, whose acquaintance I made in an
Andoren pub, described their guiding tenets as followed:
“Be ever moving forward and leave what’s behind better
than when you arrived.” The wider cult also maintains
a small number of open practices that they’re happy to
share, such as a ritual that anoints roads with alcohol to
ensure a safe journey.
HERO-GODS OF IBLYDOS
As they come from one of the oldest surviving human
cultures, the faiths of Iblydos have taken on forms unique
to the region, much of it shaped by ancient cyclops
immigrants from fallen Ghol-Gan. Of these, the tradition of
hero-gods is likely the most well known and well regarded.
The greatest mortals earn the rite of myth‑speaking,
in which the cyclopes foresee with a soothsaying ritual
how that hero might attain mythic power
through great deeds. These hero-gods
can be regarded as the greatest
among mortals: beings of myth shy
of “true” divinity due only to their
lack of immortality.
In some ways, the cults of the
hero-gods stand in stark, optimistic
contrast to those of the Elder Mythos.
While the latter emphasizes the futile
weakness of mortals in the face of
inexplicably powerful beings, the
Iblydan tradition could not
exist without the inherent
belief that all mortals—even
barely sentient creatures like
the dire lion Drokalion—can
stand on even footing with the divine
without ascending to full immortality, if
only they are bold enough to embrace their own destiny.
Hero-god worship may be on an irreversible decline;
since the death of Aroden, the prophecies essential to
guiding future champions have failed more often than
they’ve succeeded. That, combined with the slow decline
of the cyclopes, means that any future hero-gods may well
be forced to seize their destinies without a road map to
guide them. Many fear that this generation of heroes will
be the last the islands ever see.
The Sea Cult of Thrasea
Apart from the hero-gods, Iblydos is also home to a few
mystery cults who fancy themselves as maintaining the
traditions of ancient cyclopean Ghol-Gan, specifically the
worship of its gods. One such cult, of the Isle of Thrasea,
holds significant influence over sea trade. Located on the
archipelago’s far southern edge and thought to be the last
viable landing point before entering the open sea, the island
of Thrasea is said to have once been sacred to two bonded
ocean gods worshipped by cyclopes. Their names are now
spoken only upon its shores, and only among the initiates.
Said initiates supposedly include almost all Iblydan sailors,
as it’s considered standard practice to initiate all would-be
seafarers into the cult. Archivist Cricklee is skeptical it holds
nearly the ubiquity of that claim.

Living Vessel
(Archetype)
With the dawning of a new era comes the need for a
new seat of power, and what better way to show your
coming master your devotion than by sacrificing your
entire being for their use? You presented yourself before
their altar and they answered your call, flooding your
body with their power and granting you the gift of their
original form. Or maybe you were abducted in the dark,
on a night that the moon refused to shine, when you
were taken to a profane location where a mysterious
cult bound you to their master against your will. Now
you have powers you didn’t before and you have new
features that scare (and maybe, in a small dark part of
your heart, thrill) you.
You might have even become a living vessel through
a strange bargain. For instance, perhaps at the brink of
death, you received an offer from an entity to spare your
life in exchange for inhabiting you. Or you might have
offered yourself to the entity in exchange for saving a
loved one, for riches, or to fulfill a lifelong dream.
Beings of any alignment can inhabit a living vessel.
Evil-aligned beings, especially demons, are most likely
to be interested in such an arrangement, especially if it
involves forcefully taking over and changing the body
and mind of a sapient being. Part of being a living vessel
is learning more about your entity and finding what
assuages them best and what their ultimate plans might
be for your body and the world. Few vessels can fully
dictate the terms of the arrangement, but the fact that
you give the entity a corporeal form does give you some
amount of leverage. Use it wisely.
Additional Feats: Your GM might determine that you
can take a pact feat from the pactbinder archetype (page
166) as an additional feat, as long as the pact is made
to the entity within you. For instance, if you’re hosting
a fey, you could make a pact involving fey. These pact
feats are at the same level as for a pactbinder.
LIVING VESSEL DEDICATION
FEAT 2
RARE
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Whether willingly or not, you’ve become a vessel for a
being of unimaginable power. You and your GM should work
together to determine the being’s nature and decide how
much you know and how much remains a mystery to you
for now. Some decisions might influence your options later.
You might need to decide whether the entity is a demon, for
instance, to know if you qualify for later feats.
You need to spend at least an hour each day assuaging the
entity within you or you take a –1 penalty to Will saves for
24 hours. The process of assuaging the entity is determined
together between you and the GM. It might be as simple as
meditating with the entity to learn more about them, but it
might be as extreme as committing gruesome, unspeakable
sacrifices to keep their unknowable blessings. After a full
week of failing to assuage your entity, you become doomed 1,
and you can’t remove or ameliorate the condition until you
allow your entity to take full possession of your body for 24
hours, during which time it pursues its own agenda.
You also gain the Entity’s Resurgence reaction, allowing
you to unleash your entity in lieu of falling unconscious,
though at the risk of letting it enact its will.
Entity’s Resurgence [reaction] Trigger You would be reduced to 0
Hit Points but not immediately killed; Effect Instead of
letting you fall unconscious, your entity takes control.
You remain at 1 Hit Point and gain temporary Hit Points
equal to your level + your key ability modifier that last for
1 minute. However, the entity is in control for 1 minute or
until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first.
While the entity is in control, you gain a +1 status
bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, and the GM usually
controls your character, roleplaying the entity. The GM
might decide to have you roleplay the entity instead,
but they retain final say over any decisions you make.
No matter the entity’s nature, the entity is sure to wreak
vengeance upon the foe who jeopardized the life of their
vessel—even an evil entity won’t change allegiances or
ignore danger except in the most extreme circumstances.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the living vessel archetype.
ENTITY’S STRIKE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication
The more you try to force your body to stay yours, the
more it warps to channel the energy flowing through you.
Whether you grow horns to match the wild hunt fey within
you, develop a claw like that of the treachery demon sharing
your soul, or feel a tentacle rip out of you from the outer
being that imprinted itself on your psyche, the entity within
you refuses to be contained. You gain an unarmed attack of
your choice with its type determined by your entity. It deals
1d6 damage of a damage type appropriate for the unarmed
attack (such as bludgeoning for the tentacle). This unarmed
attack is in the brawling weapon group and has the agile,
finesse, and magical traits.
TAP VITALITY [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You tap into the entity’s life force to heal your wounds,
though at the cost of the entity’s personality bleeding into
your own. You recover a number of Hit Points equal to four
times your level. Each time you use Tap Vitality, you begin to
bleed more and more of the entity’s personality and instincts
into your own until the next time you spend an hour or more
assuaging the entity, bringing your mind back under your
own control.
Special This action has the tradition trait appropriate
to your entity, typically divine for a demon, occult for an
aberration or outer entity, or primal for a fey.

EXUDE ABYSSAL CORRUPTION [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
MANIPULATE
POISON
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication, your entity is a demon
Most of the changes from the demon within you have
harmed you so far, but you’ve found a way to expel some
of the corruption within you to poison others. Until the
beginning of your next turn, you and your weapons are
covered in toxic sludge or another similar manifestation
of the demonic corruption; your melee Strikes deal an
additional 1d6 poison damage, and each time a creature hits
you with a melee unarmed attack or otherwise touches you,
it takes 1d6 poison damage.
At 14th level, the poison damage increases to 2d6, and at
20th level, the poison damage increases to 3d6.
FEY’S TRICKERY [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
ILLUSION

the effects of mirror image.
WARPED CONSTRICTION [one-action] FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication,
your entity is an aberration or outer
entity
Requirements You have a foe grabbed or restrained.
The entity inhabiting your body is an aberrant being with
unfathomable motivations, and when you hold a foe close,
tendrils and tentacles unfurl from your body to crush your
foe and pollute it with alien wrongness. Your grabbed or
restrained foe takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level
and mental damage equal to your highest mental ability
modifier. The creature attempts a basic Will save that applies
to both types of damage and uses the higher of your class
DC or spell DC.
VESSEL’S FORM [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Living Vessel Dedication
Frequency once per day
You symbiotically combine your form with that of the entity
within you, taking a powerful hybrid form to temporarily
boost your abilities in combat while maintaining control. For 1
minute, you gain the following effects.
•	 If you were Medium or smaller, you become Large, and
your reach increases to 10 feet.
•	 You gain a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls
and a +1 status bonus on saving throws against spells. If
you use Entity’s Resurgence, the status bonuses to
attack and damage rolls increase to +3 during
the time that the two effects overlap.
•	 If you have the Entity’s Strike feat, the unarmed attack
you gained from that feat increases its damage die from
1d6 to 1d8.
•	 You gain 40 temporary Hit Points.
•	 You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed.
Special This action has the tradition trait appropriate
to your entity, typically divine for a demon, occult for an
aberration or outer entity, or primal for a fey.

sect or worships an underground aspect of a deity to select
an apocryphal domain spell in place of the standard initial
or advanced spell for that domain. These characters are

characters with domain spells, like champions with Deity’s

APOCRYPHAL DOMAIN SPELLS
Not all clerical traditions are taught among the orthodoxy. Some are whispered in secret, passed down from a priest to
trusted acolytes or scribed in tomes left behind by splinter factions. Some apocryphal spells are considered heretical and
suppressed, but others have fallen out of use or are specific to a region or sect. These apocryphal spells usually rely on
more abstract associations between divine power and a certain effect than those seen in orthodox ones.

You call forth numerous breezes in which you weave gossip,
whispering subtly into the ears of those around. Choose a
rumor or information you wish to spread, which may or may not
be true, about a single subject. Those within range of the spell
overhear the rumor at some point over the next hour, though
they’ll be unable to pin it down to a source. Attempt a check
with a modifier equal to your spell DC – 10 against a hard DC
for your level. The GM might modify the DC depending on how
plausible the rumor is. Repeated castings to
spread the same rumor or information
have no effect unless circumstances
have
substantially
changed,
as
determined by the GM.
Critical Success Your rumor spreads far
and wide, and it’s at the tip of people’s
tongues. For 1 week, anyone who
succeeds at a check to Gather Information
on the specific subject learns your rumor in
preference to other rumors about the subject.
Skill checks to convince people that the rumor is
true get a +2 circumstance bonus.
Success Enough people take note of the rumor that it
begins to spread, though those who heard the rumor aren’t
necessarily convinced. For 1 week, anyone who succeeds at
a check to Gather Information on the specific subject adds
your rumor to the list of rumors they could learn about the
subject, and skill checks to convince people that the rumor
is true get a +1 circumstance bonus.
Failure Most in the area dismiss the rumor as wild gossip and
pay it little mind, granting no effect.
Critical Failure The winds’ gossip is misinterpreted and
spreads information contradictory to the rumor you were
attempting to spread. A contradictory rumor spreads, and
skill checks to convince others that your original rumor is
true take a –2 circumstance penalty.

BACCHANALIA
RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Cast 1 day; Cost a lavish meal with expensive alcohol for
every caster (225 gp); Secondary Casters 8
Primary Check Occultism or Religion; Secondary Checks
Performance
Duration until midnight (see text)
You hold an elaborate feast and stoke the celebratory spirit,
causing it to spread to other people nearby; you buoy them
with hope and good cheer as they revel into the night.
The ritual was first developed by the cult of the hero-god
Kelksiomides in Iblydos and meant to be a benefit to the
community during hard times, though other groups have
used it for far different purposes, such as to spread chaos or
to provide cover for a heist.
You and the secondary casters begin your feast in a public
space where others can see you, exactly 8 hours before dusk.
When dusk falls, you complete the ritual. The party spreads
outward from your initial site until it slowly encompasses
the settlement (for a town or smaller), or a district or division
of up to approximately 1,000 people (for a larger settlement).
Those partaking in the celebration are fascinated until the
ritual comes to an end (or someone uses a hostile action
toward them, as usual). The partying appears to spread
naturally, as others see the revelers, they too slowly join
until the celebration reaches its peak size. The spell’s effect
ends sharply at midnight, but that doesn’t mean people stop
partying right away if they’re enjoying themselves.
Critical Success The party is a huge hit! The effects work as
above, except that in a larger settlement, the celebration
can spread to an area with as many as 10,000 people.
Furthermore, the celebration leaves strong memories in
the hearts of those who participated, causing locals to
commemorate it or possibly outlaw such celebrations
(depending on their view of the event).
Success The party is successful. It spreads as described in
the ritual’s description.
Failure The party never really catches on. You and the
secondary casters get to celebrate, but the most other
people do is give you odd looks.
Critical Failure Instead of celebration, you inspire anger
and resentment toward you and the secondary casters
for disturbing the peace or possibly even deepening the
despair of a people who are already troubled. People in the
area have their attitudes toward you temporarily adjusted
two steps worse than normal. Those who become hostile
won’t necessarily attack you, but they will mock you,
break up your revelry, and potentially arrest you.
CONTACT FRIENDS
RITUAL 3
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
Cast 1 hour; Cost incense worth 50 gp; Secondary Casters 1

Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert); Secondary
Checks Survival
Duration up to 10 minutes
You meditate for a quiet moment before your mind seeks out
others whom you have befriended, as well as friends of any
of the secondary casters. The ritual projects your mind to a
blank space where you see one or more friends from your
past. Once there, you can ask each friend a single question.
If more than one friend is present, you can ask each one a
different question. These friends aren’t compelled to answer
you honestly or answer at all, but those who are your friends
are likely to help you if they can, barring special situations.
Critical Success You contact up to three close friends of
yourself or any of the secondary casters, and the friends
attempt to help you with their knowledge. They each
answer one of your questions, as described above.
Success As critical success, but your mind reaches one
friend, instead of three.
Failure Your mind reaches three friends you’ve made in the
past, but each of them gives you a useless fact. None of
these facts help with your situation at all.
Critical Failure Your mind freezes. You saw something that
terrified you to your core, leaving you and all other casters
stupefied 3 for 1 day.
OBLIVIOUS EXPULSION
RITUAL 5
UNCOMMON
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Cast 1 day; Cost incense worth a total value of 150 gp;
Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Occultism (master) or Religion (master);
Secondary Checks Deception, Society
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration unlimited
Severing ties with a member of a cult courts danger and
threatens to undermine the secrecy of the group, whether that
secrecy protects its worshippers or enables them to operate in
the shadows. Many cults end their association with a wayward
member on the edge of a blade, but there are options that
preserve both secrecy and the life of the expelled member.
An oblivious expulsion removes knowledge of the cult but is
time-consuming enough that a cult usually reserves it for only
the most well-regarded members who nevertheless need to be
removed—or for sleeper agents the cult wishes to place among
society and activate later.
CULT RITUALS
Rituals are common among cults, used to bring members together via shared ceremony, create useful magical helpers,
or contact powerful entities. A cult’s leader is usually the primary caster, with the secondary casters from among
trusted cult members. A ritual that requires sacrifices sometimes sources from truly willing members, but in the case
of unscrupulous or evil cults, pulls them from innocent victims or from lower-ranking members who have been
manipulated into accepting the sacrifice.

It’s difficult to cast this ritual unless the target is willing
or restrained. If the creature is unwilling to accept the ritual,
it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. The effects
of the ritual depend on the results of your Occultism check.
Critical Success The ritual removes all memories of the cult’s
activity, practices, and secrets from the target’s memory.
The target remembers only what an average citizen of the
larger society would know, which is typically nothing or
a few rumors with very little detail. The spell is hard to
detect: a detect magic spell or similar effect must be a
higher level than oblivious expulsion to detect it.
You can Dismiss the spell. While casting the spell, you
can choose to give the secondary casters the ability to
Dismiss it. You can also choose to set a key phrase or event
that causes the spell to be Dismissed. When the target
witnesses this phrase or event, the spell immediately ends.
Success As critical success, except the spell isn’t harder to
detect with detect magic.
Failure The ritual fails.
Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the target is temporarily
immune for 1 month.
RECALL PAST LIFE
RITUAL 4
RARE
NECROMANCY
Cast 3 days; Cost 100 gp in special wine and symbolic herbs;
Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Occultism (master) or Religion (master);
Secondary Checks Crafting
Target the secondary caster who doesn’t perform the
Crafting check
Duration 1 day
You and the secondary casters spend 2 days drawing sigils
on one another. At the end of the second day, the secondary
caster responsible for the Crafting check carefully mixes the
wine with the herbs and a small amount of saliva or blood
from the target. The target then drinks the concoction,
entering a state of metaphorical death and rebirth, their body
becoming comatose for the final day of the ritual. During this
time, you and the other secondary caster bathe the body
in dirt, symbolizing a grave, and sprinkle the remainder of
the wine around the body. If done properly, swaddled baby
orchids grow around the area, enveloping the body in a bed
of flowers.
On the final hour, the target returns to life, waking up
temporarily possessed by an incarnation from one of their
past lives. Though they retain the memories from their
current life, their demeanor and personality are different for
the remaining duration of the ritual, and they also remember
vivid details from their past life. Unfortunately, it’s impossible
to choose a particular past self or to know whether a given
former incarnation has good or bad intentions.
Critical Success The target’s personality reverts to a previous
incarnation, determined by the GM. Normally they keep
their abilities, but in rare cases, the GM might determine
that the past incarnation has a different set of abilities
based on their previous life. The lingering knowledge of
the past incarnation is powerful and sticks with the target,
allowing them to retrain one of their skills increases into
a skill in which the past incarnation was particularly
talented; the list of possible skills depends on the nature
of the past incarnation and is determined by the GM.
Success As critical success, except there’s no lingering
knowledge, and the target isn’t able to retrain a skill
increase.
Failure Nothing happens, though the target’s unconscious
state is disturbing, and they wake up fatigued as well as
likely hungry and thirsty.
Critical Failure The sigils are drawn improperly, or the wine
was tainted. The swaddled baby orchids that grow around
the body scream at the moment when the target would’ve
awakened. The target dies and immediately animates as
a malevolent zombie that carries the rot with them and
seeks to destroy their former allies. Use the statistics for a
husk zombie (Book of the Dead 170), or another zombie as
appropriate for the target’s ancestry.
SUPREME CONNECTION
RITUAL 7
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare perfume worth 250 gp; Secondary
Casters 2
Primary Check Occultism (master) or Religion (master);
Secondary Checks Performance
Duration up to 10 minutes
In a show of power, you call forth a powerful entity in front
of a crowd of onlookers, forcing the entity to manifest and
answer your questions. The being appears as a twisted ball
of vines and branches that springs forth from a nearby patch
of dirt or up from between cobblestones or bricks. The ball of
vines is relatively formless, giving no indication of the being
that controls it. However, when you make a request, it twists
into a rough face to answer your request.
You can ask up to seven questions that could be answered
with “yes” or “no,” although the entity can give you any
one working answer it wants, including vague answers like
“likely” or “unknown.” The entity is likely to know answers
related to its nature and priorities. Depending on the entity
you call, it might attempt to deceive you and likely has its
own agenda. The entity can only respond when surrounded
by the energy of a crowd.
Once it has answered your questions, the vines freeze in
place, contorted in pain, a reminder of where the powerful
creature touched this world.
Critical Success The entity is in a good mood or is more
honest than most. It won’t attempt to deceive you, though
it still might not know the answers. When it’s important to
provide clarity, the entity will answer your questions with
up to five words, such as “if you leave immediately” or “that
was true once.” The words of the entity ring with truth, and
the crowd takes the statements as gospel. You gain a +4
circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks made to influence
the crowd and to any Deception checks to Lie to the crowd
by directly incorporating the entity’s answers.

Success You can ask and receive your seven answers
normally. The crowd is excited by the entity’s words and
believes them to be true. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to Diplomacy checks made to influence the crowd and
to any Deception checks to Lie to the crowd by directly
incorporating the entity’s answers.
Failure The vines reach out in a weighted gasp before dying.
The crowd is likely disappointed, especially if you made
them wait, but they don’t necessarily change their attitude
toward you.
Critical Failure The vines wrap around you in desperation,
trying to squeeze out your life force to survive. You take
10d6 bludgeoning damage and become drained 3, and you
can’t reduce the drained condition for 1 week. The attitude
of the most members of the crowd toward you become
one step worse, though individual members of the crowd
might have different reactions.
VITAL SINGULARITY
RITUAL 9
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Cost crushed rubies worth 2,000 gp; Secondary
Casters 3
Primary Check Occultism or Religion (legendary); Secondary
Checks Fortitude, Society, Will
Duration 3 hours
When several companions or followers have reached a point
of undying love and trust in you, they might be willing
to die to save your life. You can grant them that wish.
The secondary casters must be living creatures willing to
sacrifice their energy to you, by allowing their life essence
to drain out of them to protect you whenever you’re in
danger. If you’re undead, the secondary casters must be
undead instead, and if you’re neither living nor undead,
you can’t cast vital singularity. Whenever you take damage,
after calculating the total amount of damage, including
immunities, resistances, weaknesses, and any other
increases or mitigation, divide the amount by 4, rounding
down. You and each of the secondary casters lose that many
Hit Points. If a secondary caster doesn’t have enough Hit
Points to give before dropping to 0 Hit Points, you take
any remaining damage for them as well. When a secondary
caster reaches 0 Hit Points in this way, their skin dries out
like leather as the last of their life leaves their bodies; this
is a death effect.
Critical Success The light from your secondary casters
envelops you in a warm radiance. In addition to the effects
described above, you’re healed to full Hit Points upon
completion of the ritual.
Success The secondary casters channel their energies to
you, protecting you as described above.
Failure The secondary casters cry out in sorrow, reaching out
to you to feel your embrace, then they grow sad that they
couldn’t live up to your expectations. Nothing else happens.
Critical Failure The secondary casters’ attempts to unite
with you become desperate, but ultimately, the only
function of the link was to disorient all of you, making
your bodies feel like they aren’t your own. You and all
secondary casters become clumsy 3 for 3 days.

Adventure Background
After an unusually harsh winter, people across the
archipelago of Iblydos welcome the coming of spring.
As flowers finally blossom once again, preparations are
underway for numerous festivals to celebrate the changing
of the seasons. The celebrants include the spiritual group
Verdure, which also goes by the name the Womb of the
World among followers. Having recently relocated to an
isolated island, the group spends their days helping those in
need, sharing the bounties of their lush fruit and vegetable
gardens with those in nearby areas, such as the refugees
who seek safe harbor at the port of Aelyosos. The group is
inspired by the written teachings of the elusive cyclopean
hero-god Ludovica and are motivated to spread love and
light where they can. Ludovica herself has no interest in
the group, believing herself to be merely a humble poet
unworthy of such veneration, and has gone into seclusion
away from Verdure and the rest of Iblydos, leaving her
followers to their own devices.
Rumors have begun to spread of an unwelcome change
in Verdure since the appointment of its new leader several
months ago. Some members of the group have become
insular, cutting off communication with their loved ones.
In light of these changes, a concerned and influential citizen
of Iblydos has asked the group’s new leader, Mitera, to
allow a group of local heroes the privilege of participating
in this year’s ritual. In response, Mitera has invited several
visitors to help with Verdure’s annual celebration of spring,
including a representative from the Dark Archive by way of
magical communication left by previous Archive contacts.
Getting Started
The cries of seagulls mingle with the conversations of sleepy
anglers, who methodically organize their fishing gear and load
large nets onto their sturdy boats. Dockworkers prepare more
luxurious vessels, loading them with provisions and placing
plush cushions upon their seats. The sun has just begun to rise
over the ocean, and the briny breeze brings with it the chill of
a bitter winter that has not yet loosed its grasp upon the sea.
The adventure begins with the PCs at the docks of
Aelyosos, which they can easily reach through the
somnambulist’s bridge, where they can eventually
THE VERDURE OF IBLYDOS
Iblydos’s unique association with gods and myth means it should come at no surprise that cults are as common in the
archipelago as islands. The nature cult of Verdure, devoted to the hero-god Ludovica, conducts its sacred mysteries as
covertly as any other, though its public activities have always focused on charitable services. A welcome influence, and
the reason for the Archive’s occasional contact over the years, though a group we should keep our attention on. — K.H.W.

locate a man named Hyacinth (LN male human sailor)
before sailing to Verdure’s island. The few anglers and
dockworkers who notice the newcomers greet them with
nods. Hyacinth approaches the PCs jovially. His attire is
striking, comprised of layered lavender and blue fabric, a
crown of flowers and crystals, and a necklace bearing a
glittering magenta stone. With a grin, Hyacinth explains
to the PCs that their boat is almost ready to depart for
Verdure’s commune. He calls it the Womb of the World,
claiming it to be an incredibly beautiful place where the
Womb’s followers work together to feed off the land and
give back where they can, as Ludovica’s writings preach.
Hyacinth leads the PCs to the Floodmarket nearby,
where the tide has receded enough to leave space for
simple pop-up stalls. In the market, yawning cats push
their luck to be fed, while merchants and customers barter
over produce and fish, undaunted by the early hour. A few
wandering eyes sneak curious looks at the PCs, wondering
if these tourists would be interested in their wares. Upon
recognizing Hyacinth’s clothing, their eyes change from
curiosity to the jealousy and admiration one would show
a high-profile celebrity, realizing the newcomers are about
to board a ship to Verdure. As the PCs follow Hyacinth,
a nervous young woman, Adelphie (NG female human
fishmonger), hurriedly catches up to them. She whispers
to the PCs, carefully out of Hyacinth’s earshot.
“Please, I know you’re going to Verdure. I have not seen or
heard from my sister, Corella, for months now. Members usually
return home regularly to see their loved ones. I’m worried for
her safety, and I just need someone to make sure she’s all right.”
Adelphie disappears as quickly as she appeared, and
before long, Hyacinth leads the PCs to the small boat
that awaits them at the docks. The boat rocks gently as
Hyacinth pushes it off, leading the group to the island
hidden in the dawn’s mists. He tells the PCs that Mother
is excited they have decided to join the group for the
ritual tonight. The ritual ensures a bountiful harvest
for those living in the Womb, as well as other Iblydan
residents in need. The Verdurans do much charity work
for the harbor and want to practice what Ludovica writes
through Mother’s preaching by giving to those who are
less fortunate. As Hyacinth speaks, the PCs notice that his
voice is slightly slurred. Though they may at first suspect
that Hyacinth is drunk, a PC who succeeds at a DC 24
Perception check to Seek notices that Hyacinth’s breath
smells like flowers, not alcohol. A PC who succeeds at a
DC 20 Medicine check determines that his slurred voice is
the result of sleep deprivation, and that he has taken some
kind of drug that is both boosting his mood and helping
him stay awake; on a critical success, they also notice
that the drug makes him somewhat more gullible. If the
PCs ask him about the effect, he calls it “one of Verdure’s
blessings” and assures them that they’ll have the chance to
partake in the blessing after they reach the island.
If the PCs succeed at a DC 19 Diplomacy check to Make
an Impression on Hyacinth, he opens up to them further. He
tells the PCs that he has been a part of the Womb for a few
months, though a new Mother was recently anointed after
the passing of her predecessor. He reveals how, despite the
Womb’s highly selective initiation, he was accepted by the
previous Mother even though he once was a thief who had
to scrounge for food to survive. Now his life’s mission is to
one day ascend through love, light, and helping others.
MERFOLK WARNING
The small boat sails past a few merfolk gathered by a
small isle who warily watch the boat go by, though
they dare not approach the land dwellers. The PCs see
magenta gemstone necklaces dangling against their
chests, glimmering against the light. Hyacinth explains
that sometimes these merfolk swim by the Womb to
trade. The crystals that they carry are a favorite among
the followers, and Mitera makes sure every one of them is
decorated with a piece of the stone at all times.
A PC who inspects the stone on Hyacinth and succeeds
at a DC 20 Perception check realizes that it glows
differently from the ones that the merfolk carry. The PCs
can try to interact with the merfolk from a distance and
catch their attention by succeeding at a DC 26 Diplomacy
check to Make an Impression or a DC 24 Deception check
to covertly signal the merfolk. If anyone succeeds, one
of the merfolk cautiously swims over to the boat while
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 8th-level
characters.
The Verdure of Iblydos takes place in the
eponymous island nation, an ancient civilization
whose people have traditionally venerated hero‑gods
but who have begun to seek new paths since the
Age of Lost Omens brought with it the shattering
of countless prophecies. In this adventure, the
PCs investigate troubling signs that Verdure, a
charitable religious group devoted to benevolent
ideals in the service of a hero-god, has turned into a
life-controlling cult under a new leader. Ultimately,
the PCs discover the rot at the cult’s heart and put
an end to the leader’s attempts to gather power for
herself by ritually sacrificing her devoted followers.
Content Note: This adventure contains themes
of emotional abuse, gaslighting, and other forms
of manipulation used by cults, such as sleep
deprivation and love bombing. It also features drug
use and some elements of body horror. Before you
begin, understand that player consent (including
that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun
play experience for everyone. You should talk with
your players before beginning the adventure and
modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.

Hyacinth is distracted and whispers a word of warning—
to beware the hidden danger that lurks somewhere on the
island. Without providing further details, they return to
the ocean, out of Hyacinth’s notice.
I Cherish You
As the ship pulls onto the Womb’s
pristine shores, followers dressed
in light pinks, blues, and lavenders
rush out, calling out “I cherish you” in
greeting. They place crowns made with
intertwined flowers and merfolk crystals
on the PCs’ heads, then hand the PCs pastel
sashes to wear. Though the followers accept
if the PCs decline to change clothing, they
pressure the newcomers into wearing the
crowns, encouraging them to fit in
with the others. Instead of getting
confrontational, the followers use
emotional manipulation to urge
the PCs to fall in line, referring to
concepts such as the honor of being
chosen as part of the ceremony and
the importance of group harmony.
They treat any PCs who wear the
crown more favorably and encourage them to help
persuade their friends to participate rather than causing
a scene.
A1. MOTHER’S MEDITATION
The PCs see one other boat arriving with another pair of
non-members who have also been invited to the ritual.
They introduce themselves to the PCs as Thalia and Denes
(NG human aristocrats) and attempt to make small talk
but are quickly separated and guided to a building made
of glass, where they are asked to sit. The crowd sways
to the sound of a harp, and PCs are encouraged to join
in. If the PCs feel out of place or skeptical and choose
to voice their opinions, followers hush them, telling
them not to be rude. Mother Mitera eventually arrives,
planting herself in a large gazebo, from which she guides
the group through an hour-long meditation.
“Close your eyes. Breathe in the love and watch that light go
through your body. You are a shining beacon, ready to guide
and help others. To serve the good of all Iblydos.”
Mitera continues with her lecture on how to achieve
ascension, her words taken from Ludovica’s writings but
scrambled to fit the purposes of the meditation. However,
something does not seem right. As she speaks, vines around
the gazebo spread out, crawling up the sides of the walls.
The crystals glow on crowns and necklaces, showing that a
bond between follower and Mother has been formed. If any
PCs are wearing the gemstone crowns, they, too, become
bonded (see Mitera’s crystal vitality link ability, page 152).
If the PCs investigate the crystals, they can attempt a
DC 20 Nature or Religion check to Identify Magic. On
a success, they notice that the gemstones are linked to
Mitera via some ritual relay elsewhere on Verdure.
Any harm that comes to her, even the
smallest bruise, will carry over to her
innocent followers as well.
When the meditation ends, the sun
leaks through the vines as they recede
into the ground. The followers stand
up and guide the PCs out the door while
Mitera retires to her private cabin, where she
must remain sequestered while preparing for the
ritual. Hyacinth tells them they now have the rest
of the day to explore before the big ceremony at
night, even offering to act as a guide.
A2. THE LAVENDER COAST
If the PCs walk around the edges
of the island, they discover several
enormous white-and-blue flowers
with
their
petals
spread
out,
quivering like cats stretching happily in
the sunlight. The 10-foot-wide flowers
are rooted in lavender grass that grows out
of the dark purple sand. A PC who succeeds at a DC 28
Nature check or a relevant DC 24 Lore check to Recall
Knowledge realizes that these plants are closely related
to moonflowers, carnivorous plants capable of telepathic
communication with others of their kind. Moonflowers
originated on another planet before being seeded on
Golarion from beyond the stars, and some of their groves
have developed new abilities. A PC using the Detect Magic
exploration activity notices magic pulsing in the sands;
with a successful DC 24 Nature or Religion check, they
can further determine that the moonflowers are drawing
vitality and sending it through their roots to another point
on the island. The moonflowers ignore the newcomers,
while Hyacinth explains that there is something special
about the soil here that allows these creatures to grow—
the same energy that gives Mother her power. If the PCs
decide to attack one of the moonflowers, it fights back,
using the statistics for Verdure’s moonflowers on page 153.
Hyacinth becomes increasingly distressed at this violence.
A3. THE NEW ARRIVALS
The other new arrivals, Thalia and Denes, are sipping wine
with giggling followers by the docks, taking in the calm sea.
The couple waves the PCs over, clearly intoxicated. They
mention that their friend Rose joined Verdure and they
wanted to see what the fuss was about, but they don’t see
her anywhere. They were surprised when they were invited
to the ceremony since it’s so exclusive, but they reckon it
must have something to do with Rose’s membership.
The couple reveal that they are popular healers in a
smaller Iblydan town, and Rose is a healer from the town

nearby with quite a large following herself. In addition
to providing medicinal services to the town, Thalia and
Denes maintain a healthy business selling potions. If the
PCs succeed at a DC 22 Diplomacy check to Make an
Impression, the healers give each PC a free minor healing
potion as a sample, hoping for future business.
A4. THE GIVING CEREMONY
Next to the meditation chamber is a greenhouse full of
large reflective crystals. As the day reaches afternoon,
several followers begin leaving presents by the reflective
surfaces—nail clippings, cut hair, and even what looks to
be peeled-off dry skin. Hyacinth explains that for the ritual
to work to its fullest potential, everyone must leave a bit of
themselves behind to ascend. What ascension looks like is
different for each person, but for him, he’s hoping that he
could see his twin sister who had passed away, even if it’s
just for a moment. He leaves a lock of his hair by a crystal.
If any PC succeeds at a DC 29 Perception check, they
notice a ghostly figure in the same shape as Hyacinth
touch the other side of the reflection in the crystal. The
figure quickly disappears, swept into the crevices of its
surroundings and unnoticed by anyone else in the room.
If any PCs try to attack the hidden creature, they break the
crystal; followers escort them from the greenhouse and
Hyacinth gives them a disappointed warning. He remains
by them with forgiveness in his eyes, understanding that
the Womb’s ways must seem strange to outsiders.
A5. THE CABINS
In the cabins, followers are preparing for the ritual that
night. A few of them smile through clenched teeth upon
seeing the PCs and some of them chatter their teeth
slightly, as if they weren’t in control of their faces. In the
common area, a man wobbles gently, holding a pastel
flower chain, his eyelids tempting him with sleep. On the
other end of the flower chain is a woman trying to pin it
onto a wall along with the other decorations. The PCs
witness another follower approach and reprimand the
man, who stumbles slightly, wavering in exhaustion. She
reminds him to stay awake lest he ruin the entire ritual.
The PCs can attempt to convince the woman barking
the orders to leave the rest of the followers alone with a DC
22 Diplomacy check to Make a Request or Intimidation
check to Coerce. If successful, she leaves, mumbling that
the decorators are lucky that there are visitors to impress.
If the PCs successfully send her away, the decorators
tell the PCs that they take part in a nightly event that
prevents them from sleeping for more than three hours
a day. Additionally, the decorators hand the PCs a lily
brooch engraved with the name Corella as a thank you.
They claim that it belonged to someone who ascended,
speaking about her with a starstruck adoration.
Corella’s bunk bed is just a few feet away from the
common area; perched against the wooden frame is a
handwritten sign bearing her name. Her bed is neatly
made, but hidden under the mattress is a diary; Searching
PCs can attempt a DC 24 Perception check to locate it. The
latest entry reads as follows.
“I can’t believe I got chosen to be a part of the ritual! I’ve spent
the last few days doing everything Mother told me to, so I must
be doing something right. She even gave me our island’s special
tea to drink, and I’ve been seeing things—my future when I
achieve the next level. I see myself in a beautiful temple, and
I’m the one being worshipped. I can’t wait for it to become real.”
The other entries are about the details on the cost of
the ritual and what she had been sent to retrieve for the
big night: three large quartz crystals, moonflower seeds,
merfolk gemstones, and several willing celebrants, as well
as “a piece of each of them.”
Inlaid with Flowers
As the sun sets, followers with additional tasks scramble to
get them done, while those who have finished sit back on mats
and cushions on the ground, struggling to stay awake. Many
pass elegantly carved stone cups filled with blue herbal tea.
Intoxicating floral aromas sweep through the campsite.
As followers take in the drink, they weep or collapse
momentarily in ecstasy. When asked, they describe
seeing different things—being covered in gold jewelry,
finding the love of their life, or devouring all the sweets
that their heart desires. They guide the PCs to the ritual
site and encourage them to try the tea, claiming that it
temporarily grants psychic abilities and helps folks with
their ascension. PCs who succeed at a DC 24 Medicine
or Nature check to Recall Knowledge discover that the
herb’s hallucinogenic properties simply cause the person
who drinks it to see what they desire. The tea also contains
crystals, forcing the drinker to become linked with Mitera.
A6. THE PRE-ASCENSION CEREMONY
In a cabin by the path that leads to the ritual site, a man
is brewing the same herbal tea the PCs saw the followers
drink, adding in merfolk crystals and seeds. He hands the
PCs cups of the bubbling concoction. If the PCs drink them,
they begin to see what they want the most. Each PC who
drinks must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save against the
drug’s effects. The PCs receive a result that is one degree
of success better than what they roll because this effect has
the incapacitation trait and is of lower level than the PCs.
Critical Success The tea has a pleasant and refreshing taste, but
it doesn’t affect the drinker’s mind.
Success The drinker experiences 30 minutes of positive emotions.
Failure The drinker feels as though they’re descending into
a pit of calming light and then experiences 30 minutes of
vivid hallucinations. They take a –2 status penalty on all
Perception checks while the hallucinations persist. When the
ritual begins, the drinker is sickened 1.

Critical Failure As failure, except the penalty increases to –4.
The crystals and seeds in the tea take hold in the drinker,
making them targets for Ascension is Near (page 153).
In the cabin, the PCs have an opportunity to examine
and tamper with the tea. A PC who inspects the tea and
succeeds at a DC 24 Crafting, Medicine, or Nature check
deduces its properties. While it’s too late to prevent the
followers from partaking of the brew, it’s clear that they
plan to drink many additional cups. With the knowledge
of the tea’s effects together with other herbs growing
naturally on the island, the PCs have a chance to lace
the tea with an antidote. Creating the antidote requires
two successful DC 24 checks (selected from Crafting,
Medicine, Nature, or a relevant Lore skill) and fresh
sap from a moonflower. Once the antidote is produced,
the PCs can sneak it into the tea or otherwise trick the
followers into consuming it with a DC 22 Deception,
Stealth, or Thievery check. If successful, the tea’s effects
are weakened; see Disrupting the Ritual, below.
B. THE ASCENSION
SEVERE 8
At nightfall, the followers gather at the ritual site, a
cyclopean ruin at the top of the island. The ones who
drank the tea, still coming down from their hallucinations,
crawl their way to the site, their mouths curled in delight.
Looking for her partner, Thalia finds her way to the rest
of the PCs and asks if any of them has seen Denes. He was
exploring the area with one of the followers when she
found herself without him for almost an hour. She asks if
she can stay by the PCs’ side as the ritual begins, feeling
out of place, now sober and awkward.
The darkness subsides as followers simultaneously light
lanterns, encircling everyone. Three crystals are situated
around the ritual site, each glowing faintly with violet
light. In the center, three followers lay with their arms
crossed on elevated marble beds. They’ve been gutted,
their organs replaced with fuchsia crystals and closed
moonflower blossoms that spill over the stone platforms.
Thalia, realizing that one of the sacrifices is Denes, lets out
a cry and tries to rush toward him, only to be held down
by uprooted moonflower vines. The other sacrifices were
Corella and Rose, their faces twisted in perpetual fear.
Creatures: Mitera approaches a pedestal that stands at
the center of the ritual, her eyes glowing the same purple
as the blossoms. She raises her arms, a silver dagger in
one hand, and begins her speech.
“I cherish you. I cherish every one of you and all your potential.
You are more than your physical bodies. And today, I will make
sure you ascend, like the beautiful people here, inlaid with
flowers. Let your ascended forms reveal themselves.”
As she finishes, shadows in the shape of Corella, Denes,
and Rose twist out of the crystals while a moonflower
bursts from the ground. Mitera opens the first round with
her Ascension is Near ability; what happens depends on
whether the PCs gave the followers the antidote. If they
did, the followers vomit seeds and crystals, and Mitera’s
face contorts in rage as the ascension fails. If they didn’t,
however, a few crystals trickle out of about half the
followers’ mouths before their bodies split open, revealing
blooming flowers and glowing crystals. Thalia succeeded
at her saving throw, so she is unaffected either way.
Disrupting the Ritual: Even if the PCs succeed in lacing
the tea with antidote, Mitera’s crystal vitality link with
her followers persists, meaning if the PCs hurt her, the
innocent cultists bear the same injuries (as well as the PCs,
if they participated in the service in area A1). To disrupt
the link so they can engage Mitera, the PCs must break
the three quartz formations in the ritual site. Each crystal
has 10 Hardness and 40 Hit Points. If the PCs destroy a
crystal, its connected shadow is instantly destroyed.
Endless Shadows: If a quartz formation’s shadow
creature is destroyed but the crystal itself remains intact
and unobstructed, it spends 1 round coalescing a new
shadow, after which the shadow appears adjacent to
the crystal on its initiative in the following round. The
PCs can cover a crystal to hamper its link to the shadow,
preventing the shadow from reforming or using its Crystal
Siphon ability. Covering a crystal should generally require
2 actions, or 1 action with a skill check (for example,
it might take two actions to remove a bedroll from a
backpack and wrap it around a crystal, or one action to
use Athletics to push a bunch of rubble over the crystal).
Allow creative solutions, and use 24 as a baseline DC for
checks to cover a crystal in a single action.

Ranged [one-action] dagger +18 (agile, magical, thrown, versatile
S), Damage 2d4+7 piercing plus 1d6 mental and 1d6
persistent bleed
Ascension is Near [one-action] (auditory, concentrate, emotion,
incapacitation, mental) Frequency once per ascension
ritual; Effect Mitera activates the moonflower link with her
followers. Any followers within 30 feet who failed their
saving throw against the moonflower tea become sickened 1.
Anyone who critically failed and did not receive an antidote
explodes (this is about half of Mitera’s congregation if the
PCs didn’t successfully administer the antidote). If anyone’s
body explodes, Mitera gains 30 temporary Hit Points and is
quickened for 3 rounds; she can use this additional action
each round only for Strike and Stride actions.
VERDURE’S MOONFLOWER
CREATURE 8
Pathfinder Bestiary 2 173
Spray Blossoms [two-actions] Effect The moonflower expels mind-
warping petals in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area
take 4d6 mental damage and 4d6 poison damage (DC 26
basic Will save). On a failure, they are stupefied 2 for 1
minute, and on a critical failure, they are also confused for 1
round. The moonflower can’t Spray Blossoms again for 1d4
rounds. This ability replaces a normal moonflower’s Light
Pulse ability.
QUARTZ-SPAWNED SHADOWS (3)
CREATURE 4
Pathfinder Bestiary 289
Crystal Siphon [two-actions] (death, divine, necromancy, negative)
Requirements The shadow and the target are both within 40
feet of the crystal that spawned the shadow, and the crystal
isn’t covered or obstructed; Effect Shadows in the shape
of tendrils curl around the target, drawing out a portion of
the target’s vitality and siphoning it into the crystal. The
target takes 4d6 negative damage (DC 21 basic Fortitude
save). On a failure, they are also enfeebled 1. This enfeebled
condition is cumulative with other enfeebled conditions
from quartz-spawned shadows, to a maximum of enfeebled
4. If Crystal Siphon increases the creature’s enfeebled value
to 3 or more, the target’s shadow is pulled entirely into the
shadow’s crystal. While the target’s shadow is trapped,
they feel an invisible tether linking them to the crystal, and
they become slowed 1 whenever they are more than 40
feet away from it. The enfeebled condition from Crystal
Siphon can’t be reduced until the crystal is broken; if
the crystal is broken, the effect immediately ends.
This ability replaces a normal shadow’s Shadow
Spawn and Steal Shadow abilities.
Conclusion
After the PCs defeat Mitera, the followers are too
disoriented from sleep deprivation and hallucinations to
fully understand what is happening. They readily follow
along with the PCs’ guidance. Depending on whether the
PCs provided an antidote, as well as whether they care to
bring the survivors along if they did, the PCs can either
escape the island with only Thalia or bring the surviving
followers with them. If the heroes burn all the moonflowers
on the island, they prevent anyone else from abusing their
power to take advantage of others, but defeating all the
moonflowers (which will certainly choose to fight together
in the face of extermination rather than lazing around on
the beach) is beyond the scope of the adventure.
As the PCs set sail back to the rest of Iblydos, they
see merfolk follow the boat, eyeing the passengers with
a morbid interest as if wondering how they managed
to escape the grasp of the island and the one they call
Mother. Wordless, they hold their position as the PCs sail
away until they are just dots on the dark horizon.
