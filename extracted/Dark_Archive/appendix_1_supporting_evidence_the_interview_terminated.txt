INVESTED
MAGICAL
TELEPORTATION
Price 950 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
The silver face of this glass-encased compass is etched with
dozens of esoteric symbols, obscure icons, and inscrutable
abbreviations.
Activate [one-action] concentrate, Interact; Frequency once per minute;
Effect You point the compass of transpositional awareness
at an extant teleportation effect (such as a magical portal)
or the site of a teleportation effect that existed within the
last 1 minute (such as the space where a creature just cast
dimension door). Attempt an Occultism check to determine
to where the effect leads or led. The DC of this check is
the effect’s counteract DC. On a success, you know roughly
the destination of the teleportation effect (for example “the
Plane of Fire,” “north,” or “Avistan”). On a critical success,
you ascertain the exact destination within mere feet for
local effects (such as dimension door) or within a few miles
for long-range effects (such as teleport, plane shift, or
interdimensional portals).
Activate [one-action] Frequency once per day; Effect You use the
compass of transpositional awareness to triangulate your
current coordinates and the coordinates of your intended
destination using teleportation magic. For 1 minute,
whenever you cast a teleportation spell that has a range,
increase that spell’s range by 30 feet. If the spell normally
has a range of touch, extend its range to 30 feet.

The Missing Moment
Incident Location: Ruwido, Ustalav, Avistan
Incident Type: Hiatus
Reporting Archivist: Vennick Swyth
Archivist’s Note:
Archivist’s Note: Dr. Ritalson was a most accommodating
host and gracious interview subject. Despite how his tone may
come across in this transcription, I found the man to be quite
avuncular, perhaps even likable. Keeping this in mind, Dr.
Ritalson’s frequent asides, digressions, and diatribes
made accurate transcription difficult, to
say the least. I’ve done my best
to render our lengthy conversation
here as truthfully as possible,
but the way Ritalson warped
and weaved the threads of our
conversation make it practically
impossible to truly capture the
discussion’s exhilarating spirit.
Also, please don’t mistake my
characterization of the subject as
“likable” to mean he is benign—we’ve every reason
to suspect the doctor is more than he seems, though this
is obviously pure speculation. Whatever the case, Ritalson is
clearly a man of genius and one we should not take lightly.
INTERVIEW LOG
If you want the short version—something punchy to tell your
colleagues at the Archive—then here it is: One moment, I
was tending my garden on the outskirts of town. The next,
a blinding light knocked me to the dirt. I saw in the light
myself, only not as I am now, but as a lad, young and
spry. Can you blame me for walking toward that gorgeous
mirror that looked back in time? Whatever. The next thing
I knew, it was night. I hadn’t moved an inch, far as
I could tell. I was still standing in my garden but I
immediately collapsed from fatigue, like I hadn’t eaten or
slept in weeks. When I managed to crawl down the muddy
hill toward my manor, Nanci came out to see what was the
matter. Her face was paler than the sheets hung on her
line. I’d been missing for 23 days.
If you want the long version, well, let me put on another pot
of tea. I’ve gathered my notes and relevant day log entries
here. [The doctor motioned to a tremendous pile of pristinely
organized folios and journals.] It was a gray day, thick
and muggy; my weather instruments sweated from the
unseasonable humidity, though it hadn’t rained in more
than a moon. My neighbor up the hill, Nanci, was beating
and scrubbing the week’s laundry.
Of course, I’m not the only one to have experienced this
so-called “missing moment,” as you and other pseudo-
intellectuals have taken to calling it. There exist many others
just like me, whom I’ve dubbed “gatewalkers.” (You and your
other archivists aren’t the only ones who can be clever now
and then, eh? I’m sorry. Though I jape at your expense,
I rather liked your idea of interviewing me. In fact, I’ve
borrowed your methodology and have arranged to conduct
some interviews myself, with my fellow gatewalkers as the
subjects. Who knows what secrets might be plumbed from
the psyches of my fellow miscreants? I’ll of course send you
my transcripts as a token of my appreciation.)
Ah yes, the compass. Well, in the aftermath of the “Night
of the Missing Moment”—again, where do you people come
up with these names?—I’ve taken to studying teleportation,
gates, aiudaras,
aiudaras, and every subject on translocation. I’ve
long been interested in paranormal phenomena of this nature,
but to be the subject of it myself, well! My
interest, it’s safe to say, has gone from
the realm of mere curiosity to utmost
fascination.
The compass is a trinket
I scrapped together in spare
moments during my research,
just something I stumbled upon, a
byproduct really. Here, you can keep
it if you wish. Rather curious little thing,
though I’ve doubts you’ll ever find a use for it.
I suppose it may as well collect dust in your archive rather
than mine. Though, who knows? As you and I are both
aware, strange things do happen.
[The interview subject insisted I keep the compass he
described, which is included with this transcript; see
Appendix I: Supporting Evidence. The interview terminated
shortly afterward.]

The Wood Pile
Incident Location: “The Cradle,” [redacted], Garund
Incident Type: Nexus
Reporting Archivist: Guyani Kellu
I’ve never had quite as fitful or fruitful a respite as my sleep
a fortnight ago. I had traveled from my estate in Kibwe in
search of a small conrasu enclave known as the Cradle.
I’d heard the Cradle was a small group that repaired and
upgraded the exoskeletons that house our cosmic brethren.
What I wanted from the enclave was confirmation of the so-
called “Wood Pile,”a large pile of conrasu exoskeleton scrap.
Though many believe it to be a simple refuse pile, conrasus
are sparks of planar consciousness, and just as a flower can
absorb iron in the soil to turn burnt red, so have many of
these cast-offs absorbed what I refer to as “Aeonic Essence.”
I wasn’t prepared for where it took me. (Can those who
explore the unknown ever truly be prepared?) The enclave
was surprisingly close to [redacted], but the route was
deeply inconvenient. I traveled through foothills and deep
forest and tunnels, finally arriving at an idyllic forest with
giant trees stretching their arms to the sky.
I saw even fewer conrasus when I arrived than I expected.
That said, I was greeted by an affable young conrasu named
Wane. Wane’s exoskeleton at first seemed to be a rolling
wooden ball, but when they needed to reach something, a
wooden arm would telescope out to grab it and legs extended
underneath them the few times they required height.
Wane described the Cradle to me as a place where
conrasus could come to evolve their minds and bodies. They
gave me the tour, showing me a few stations where conrasus
worked on sculpting and shaping other conrasu bodies.
By the time I got around to asking where the Wood Pile
was, Wane extended an arm to my right
and showed me we were already there.
The Wood Pile had an enormous pile of
vines, logs, and discarded wooden limbs.
It towered to half the height of the trees.
While I felt a certain sense of awe, I
didn’t detect a strong magical aura;
I expected a bonfire of planar energy
but found only a trickling stream.
That’s when I fell asleep.
I shouldn’t say fell asleep, because
that isn’t quite right—I walked over
to the Wood Pile’s base and somehow
decided to lay down on it. Midday naps
are not something I engage in and I
didn’t feel tired even moments before. The
compulsion was subtle yet undeniably powerful.
I slept.
I woke up and it was nighttime. The Cradle was buzzing
with activity. The silhouettes of conrasus of all shapes and
compositions swarmed around. I tried to call out and get
someone’s attention but soon realized no one noticed me. I
saw the silhouettes ducking, leaping, and rolling away from
invisible dangers I couldn’t see.
Then I saw my silhouette. It was walking quite innocently
away from me. Suddenly, it dove to the side and rolled up
to its feet. It looked behind, then ran.
I woke up again. It appeared to be shortly after I had
fallen asleep this time. I looked in my hand and discovered
there was light blue coin in it. None of the conrasus at the
Cradle could tell me anything about it but all insisted I
take it with me as a souvenir, so I did.
I thought little of it until on my way back. I was walking
along a river when something burst from the water. Before I
could move, I saw a flash of my silhouette diving to the side and
before I had even thought, I was mid-dive. I rolled and rose to
my feet. I looked back and saw a ravenous zinba snake spring
from the water. Not wanting to be a snack, I ran!
It appears the coin was consumed in that encounter, but
I’ll happily trade it for my life.

The answer is that curses burrow deep. Most other spells
simply wash over their victim, coating them in flames
or befuddling them with enchantments. Curses embed
themselves in their victim’s very souls, feeding on the
energies within to ruin their lives. A typical spell is akin
to a wooden club, powerful, painful, but brief. A curse
is more like a splinter, smaller and subtler, but hard to
remove and capable of turning the limb gangrenous
and foul if left unaddressed.
The deep-rooted nature of a curse has a few
ramifications. To begin with, they tend to last for a very
long time. A bolt of wizard’s lightning is there and gone.
If not fatal, it doesn’t last the rest of the target’s life. A
curse of sickness or blight, on the other hand, can bedevil
a victim for years, even decades. Some famous curses have
lasted for centuries, troubling one generation of a family
after another or else turning an entire land into something
unholy. Curses are also extremely hard to remove; most
require a sophisticated bit of magic to excise, while others
can only be torn out by the will of the gods.
Penetrating deeply into a soul, however, is no easy task.
The most powerful curses usually manipulate the victim
into accepting them, throwing open the gates of their
metaphysical defenses and allowing the curse inside with
nary a challenge. This is usually achieved by having the
victim acquiesce to a pact, of which the curse is either an
inherent part or the penalty for a broken deal.
A classic example is the geas, a ritual in which the
subject swears a mighty oath and accepts to be cursed
if they should falter or turn aside. If the geas is willingly
accepted, the penalty curse can be inordinately powerful.
A more subtle example might be a tomb curse, where the
dead spirits of a tomb curse any intruders for violating
the implicit pacts of respecting the dead and their graves.
Though not as powerful as the curse of a broken oath,
these can still prove deadly.
A CHAIN OF CONSEQUENCES
TO BIND THE SOUL
Regarding curses, pacts, and the
consequences of ill-thought bargains
Let’s begin with the simplest question. What is a curse? Given that a suitably powerful
sorcerer can strip the flesh from your bones or turn you into their marionette, what
makes curses different? Why are they so feared compared to the myriad other ways in
which magic can harm you?

Many powerful curses are by some measure
self‑inflicted by the victim. Which is absolutely not to say
that they’re deserved. Curses rarely know proportion or
appropriate consequences. A child who steals an apple
from a fey witch might deserve a stern reprimand, but not
to vomit toads for the rest of their life.
FORMS OF CURSES
There are a great many types of curses out there. What
follows is a non-exhaustive list.
Spell Curses: The most straightforward curses,
these are produced by mortal
sorcerers, magi, witches, and
more in much the same way
all other spells are produced.
These are the curses most likely
to be temporary in nature,
though some, like the outcast’s
curse, can infect the target and
become permanent in the same
way as more famous curses.
Cursed Objects: One way to
empower a curse is to bind it
to an object. Infinitely variable,
such cursed objects do tend
to be relatively rare—it takes
a great deal of effort to make
such a thing. The most famous
example is the monkey’s paw,
which twists the wishes of its
owner into horrific reality, but
other examples include burden
stones, tiny pebbles that weigh
as much as boulders, and
necklaces
of
strangulation,
enchanted
necklaces
which,
when worn, choose a moment of stress to murder their
wearer. Such objects are also easily transferred—a cursed
ring or knife can trace a path across continents as it finds
its way to new victims.
Pacts: Another subset of powerful “curses” are those
that come about from pacts, both fulfilled and broken.
While not, strictly speaking, a curse, the function is much
the same, where the willing acceptance of terms by all
parties allows magic to burrow deeper than it otherwise
could. If a fey pact requires you to give up your voice in
exchange for three full moon’s worth of wealth, the magic
that binds the voice and provides the ensuing wealth
shares many qualities with a curse. Pacts themselves
differ from curses in that they’re usually easy to break,
though the act of breaking them swiftly and irrevocably
brings consequences—at the simplest level, a reversion
to the previous status quo as whatever wealth, ability, or
status was bargained for disappears, but it’s possible for
labyrinthine penalty clauses to cause all sorts of trouble
for the pact breaker.
Different sorts of entities might create these pacts.
Mortal wizards can do so with the appropriate rituals,
but more commonly they’re made with spirits, hags, or
stranger forces. Devils are notorious for their pacts, but the
most famous and prolific pact-makers are fey, who make
such deals as easily as they breathe and have no sense of
balance where it comes to punishing a pact breaker.
Tomb Curses and Temple Curses: Everyone’s heard the
classic tale. A group of scholars break into the tomb of
some Osiriani pharaoh, ignoring the curse inscribed on
the lintel. All are dead inside of a year. The truth is that
the act of breaking a religious or
societal taboo does seem to leave
victims vulnerable to certain
forms of curses, and sorcerers
and hierophants know how to
take advantage of such things for
defense—most commonly, these
curses descend on those who
violate the sanctity of the tomb.
Familial Curses: A particularly
heinous subset of curses are ones
that target entire families, or
that travel from one generation
to another. These curses, usually
the ones cast by capricious fey
or angry gods, might work in
several ways. They might latch
onto a single member of the
family, hounding them to death
before moving onto the next.
They might come into effect only
once a generation. Or they might
affect all members of the family
constantly, ceaselessly.
Contagious
Curses:
Some
beings have a curse within them waiting to be spread.
Werewolves and other creatures of a similar kind
famously possess a curse received from their parents—a
familiar curse at its base­—but transmissible with their
bites. These werecreatures do suffer from their own curse,
but all kind of creatures from outside this world merely
deal out curses to others. The easy spread of contagious
curses makes them dangerous, potentially at a large scale.
No ritual need be invoked, no pact made. Only fangs
piercing flesh.
Oracular Curses: One last form of curse is that
of oracles and others touched by the divine. These
individuals receive boons from gods or spirits, but they
always come with a price, some insidious curse that
drains them even as they grow ever more powerful. My
personal suspicion, though I can’t confirm it, is that these
things are a form of pact, though not one formed with
a fey or devil but with a god or the universe beyond,
subconsciously perhaps. There is power, and as always,
there is a price to pay for it.

RENOWNED CURSES
Gathered below are some of the more interesting curses
that I’ve collected.
The Portrait of Kobad IV: Kobad IV was the Satrap
of Qadira a few centuries ago, and by all accounts was
generally dreadful. It came to pass that during his rule
he mortally wronged a certain painter, an artist of little
talent but great pride. Not long afterward, the painter
produced a family portrait of the satrap, his wife, and his
children, attended by a coterie of half-visible servants.
Curiously, though each member of the satrap’s family
was easily distinguishable by dress and mannerism, their
faces were rendered as smoke.
The painting caused a definite stir in Katheer when it
was shown, and I knew there had to be something deeper.
It turns out the only stir greater than its unveiling was
the stir it caused when the satrap’s youngest son went
missing, only for his anguished features to replace the
smoke atop his portrait and for the face of one of the
servants to become smoke-wreathed itself. The artist was
duly arrested but refused to explain what he’d done, even
as the rest of the satrap’s family gradually disappeared
over the next few months. I’m given to understand that
Kobad IV, before he himself vanished, gave orders for the
artist to be buried alive. The portrait still exists, the satrap
and his family surrounded by smoke-faced servants. Last I
heard, Satrap Xerbystes II displays it in one of his palaces.
The Stolen Lands: This patch of territory in the
northeastern River Kingdoms is notorious for its curses.
Though details are scarce, it seems that even a careless
word or a mundane tragedy in this region might
cause a curse. I have accounts of at least three villages
that were entirely depopulated because of curses that
attracted vile entities or transformed the residents into
something unholy.
The Lix Family Curse: The Lix family are a Chelaxian
archbaronial family hailing from the Archduchy of
Longmarch. Theirs is an unusual sort of curse in that
it’s a matter of public record, though Chelaxian public
record isn’t exactly the easiest thing to get a hold of.
Essentially, the family made a pact with a particular
devil, and because of the pact, they and all their servants
transform into ravening beasts with black wings and
bird-skull heads on the night of the new moon. Out of
general politeness, the Lixes tend to lock themselves
up in their Westcrown townhouse or on their familial
estates during the dangerous periods, though there are
rumors that the occasional importunate or ignorant
acquaintance is invited “to dine” on the nights of the
new moon.
The interesting question is whether the Lix family
suffers their curse for breaking a diabolic pact—or
whether it’s the price they pay for something very,
very precious.
Dr. Seale’s Solutions: The Griff Courant is a small
broadsheet published in Absalom every month by a
conclave of artists, poets, and miscellaneous literary
types. It mostly contains reviews of theaters and
galleries, but it also includes an advertisement wherein
a “Dr. Seale” provides solutions to all the “problems
of humanity” in exchange for a modest fee of 20 silver
weights and “a dram of luck.”
Shockingly, this is not a scam. If one sends the money
by courier, then the following day an object appears
on one’s doorstep, precisely what’s necessary to solve
whatever problem one might have. The “dram of luck”
fee appears quite real as well—everyone who answers
the advertisement invariably suffers some misfortune
within a week. They’re run over by carriages, suffer
poisoning, or in one bizarre case, are knocked senseless
for three days by a flying book.
I’ve not yet had time to investigate Dr. Seale further,
but I expect someone at the Griff Courant must
know more.
The Stolen Codices of Razatlan: The long, slow
decline of the Arcadian nation of Razatlan brought
with it numerous opportunities for looting, and among
the treasures purloined from that withered empire
were several decorated codices, narrating Razatlan’s
founding, its wars and conquests, and its latter days.
Beautifully painted on folded bark paper, over the
centuries a few copies have made their way to Avistan.
They are also cursed, each and every one of them.
The Razatlani mage scribes who penned them included
a curse on the first page of each codex, that the secrets
within be paid for with blood. According to a diary
I was able to access, anyone who possesses one of
Razatlan’s stolen codices finds that anything they write,
whether with ink or spell or charcoal, is replaced with
their own blood, potentially killing the victim if they
don’t realize the source of their gradual weakness. Given
that the diary is written in faded blood, I’m inclined
toward belief.
The Wanting Curse: The wanting curse is a specialty
of the Hungry School of the Mwangi Jungle, whose
adherents use it as both a teaching tool and means
of extortion. The victim’s name is written out on a
piece of wood with inks made of certain plants and
then buried at the bottom of a rubbish heap. From the
following sunset, the victim can see nothing but flaws
in everything around them. Food tastes rancid, music
becomes a cacophony, a friend or loved one is seen as
unspeakably ugly or irritating. Though not inherently
dangerous, many victims grow sickly from being
unwilling to eat or drink what they believe to be rotten
food or foul water.
With outsiders, the Hungry School’s sorcerers usually
wait a while and then offer to remove the curse—for a
suitable price. Among themselves, they use the curse to
illustrate their own nihilistic philosophy, that nothing
has any true value. Supposedly, some elder witches have
labored under the wanting curse for decades.

Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You offer to broker a pact of peace. If the target accepts and
doesn’t take hostile actions against you and your allies, you
take a –1 status penalty to Deception checks to Lie to them.
If they refuse and take a hostile action against you or an ally,
they must attempt a Will save. If they accepted the offer and
then take a hostile action against you or an ally, they must
attempt a Will save and treat the result as one category
worse. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target takes a –1 status penalty to attack
and damage rolls against you and your allies.
Critical Failure The target takes a –2 status penalty to
attack and damage rolls against you and your allies.

You accuse the target of breaking its word to you and invoke
the wrath of your patron to claim what’s due, demanding the
target pay you in currency, fulfill an order, or stand down. The
demand can’t be obviously self-destructive, or the spell fails. If
the target resists, you take your payment from its life force. The
target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of its
save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and is immune to
your pact broker cantrips for 1 day.

Critical Failure As success, but if the target doesn’t comply, it
is drained 2, doomed 1, and takes 6d8 persistent negative
damage. Even if the target completes your commands later,

BOOK OF LOST DAYS
ITEM 15
UNIQUE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This massive tome’s yellowed pages curl at the edges, and the
letters on its face and spine are too worn to be read. When you
open the book, it always opens to a page that seems to perfectly
answer the question you had in mind, but reading more than a
few lines causes your head to swim alarmingly.
Activate
1
hour
(envision,
Interact);
Requirements You aren’t drained; Effect
You open the book while trying to
learn information about any topic.
The Book of Lost Days permits you
to view another’s memory, which
contains information about that
subject commensurate to rolling
a total of 40 to Recall Knowledge
about the topic, with additional
context provided on a success or critical success.
The price for this knowledge is the memory of a day in
your past, and the vitality of a day in your future. You lose
the memory of that day completely, and the total of all the
knowledge you learned on that date is added to the book’s
repository of information. The book, not you, chooses which
memories are taken, preferring days with concentrated
emotional resonance, and thus tends to steal significant life
moments. This loss affects only your memories; it has no
effect on your level, class, feats, or other character choices.
Your natural lifespan is also shortened by 1 day. The loss
of this life energy causes you to be drained 2. You can’t
reduce the drained condition for 2 days, after which you
can recover normally from the condition.
Creatures have occasionally managed to use the Book of
Lost Days not to gain others’ knowledge but to wipe their
minds clean of painful memories or deadly secrets. Their
memories aren’t destroyed but merely stored in the book,
where someone else might later retrieve them.
CALAMITY GLASS
ITEM 11
CURSED
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
SCRYING
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This mirror appears to give warnings about the future, but
subtle and malevolent hands designed the silver-framed glass
to lure heroes into bringing doom upon those they hope to save.
Activate 1 minute (envision, Interact); Frequency once per
week; Effect You activate the calamity glass and obtain a
vision related to a likely action or event within the next
48 hours. The calamity glass decides what vision to show,
though if you think about a specific event, the vision is
typically at least tangentially related.
No matter what, the mirror shows only tragedies. The
mirror’s visions are accurate but misleading, as they depict
tragedies that could be averted but in so doing might lead
to greater suffering.
For example, a calamity glass might show a family
starving as the result of harbor officials turning away
a boatload of improperly documented grain. Without
intervention, this future will come to pass.
What the mirror didn’t show is the grain was
improperly labeled and carelessly stored,
resulting in its contamination with poisonous
mold capable of killing hundreds. Purifying and
then distributing the grain would avert both the
calamity glass’s vision and the greater suffering
its curse attempted to create.
GIFT OF THE POISONED HEART
ITEM 16
RARE
CONSUMABLE
CURSED
EVIL
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk –
Activate 1 minute (command, Interact)
Those who fail to see the curse view this object as a priceless
gift, capable of restoring life to the deceased, but deep in the
heart of this diamond lies a single flaw: a fissured occlusion
of sickly, tainted red. To activate the diamond, place it on the
relatively intact body of a creature that died within the past
year. The stone shatters, restoring the recipient to life with
the effects of a successful resurrect ritual, except there is no
limit to the level of the creature that may be revived.
This gift of life comes with a terrible cost: the recipient
believes you—and anyone else who aided in the resurrection—
deliberately caused their death and revived them only in
furtherance of some nefarious scheme. Having a proxy activate
the gift of the poisoned heart is of no use, as the item’s magic
sniffs out all coconspirators and uses your attempt to avoid
the drawback to feed the resurrected creature’s paranoia.
No amount of information or persuasion can alleviate this
mistrust, as the cursed creature twists the facts endlessly
to fit their delusion. Only magic such as remove curse can
neutralize this effect, and the subject resists any attempt to
alter their beliefs by magic.
GOLDEN GOOSE
ITEM 11
CURSED
EVIL
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
This life-sized, hollow, golden goose statuette has an open,
fanged mouth and an unsettling aura of hunger. Fiends
sometimes present it as a gift to mortals whose greed makes
them susceptible to temptation. While the golden goose can
be used without malice, those who possess such a thing often
find its glittering lure erodes their morals over time.
CURSED ITEMS
Cursed items are difficult to make and even harder to destroy. These items seem useful, but they always have some
drawback. They often fuse to users, making them difficult to remove. You can find more information about cursed items
on page 90 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.

Activate Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect You feed the
goose the warm, still-bloody heart of any sapient, non-evil
creature who died within the past hour. The golden goose’s
eyes flare red as it chews the heart into pulp. Once the heart
is destroyed, the goose lays a golden egg worth 50 gp, or 100
gp if you murdered the creature for no reason other than to
feed the goose.
After 12 such eggs are laid, the next time you activate the
golden goose, it transmutes your heart to gold. This effect
functions as flesh to stone, with a DC 30 Fortitude save
to resist. If you become petrified, you turn to solid,
transparent stone. Your heart becomes a golden
egg worth 100 gp, which can be retrieved
only by shattering your body. Whether or
not you turn to stone, the golden goose
dissipates with a honk into sulfurous smoke.
MISTRANSLATOR’S DRAFT
ITEM 9
CONSUMABLE
CURSED
DIVINATION
MAGICAL
POTION
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
A pickled lizard’s tongue, tied into a
knot, floats in this oily potion. When you
drink it, you can speak and understand
all spoken (but not written) languages for
1 hour. However, if you attempt to translate
any spoken language, your translation is always
erroneous in a way likely to cause substantial confusion or
anger, typically reducing the listener’s attitude toward you by
one step. You aren’t aware of your error, and any attempt to
correct the mistake only compounds it.
RING OF SNEERING CHARITY
ITEM 7
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn ring; Bulk –
This gold ring seems to offer good fortune to the wearer when
they are charitable to those in need, but its curse was created
to tear societies apart by inflaming class resentments and
discrediting good works of true charity.
Upon donning the ring, you must attempt a secret DC
25 Will save to avoid activating its magic. If you succeed,
the ring’s curse remains dormant, and it appears to be an
exhausted item with no magic left. If you fail, the curse
awakens, and the ring fuses to you.
You are compelled to spend 10% of your wealth—and 10% of
any future wealth you obtain—on charity. However, your acts
of charity are insensitive and so insulting that they earn the
recipients’ enmity. For example, upon learning someone lost a
child, you might toss money at them “to buy a new one.” You
can’t understand why your gifts aren’t met with gratitude and
resent the unappreciative recipients, and you firmly believe
you should be able to call upon them for favors. You consider
yourself an ideal philanthropist, and you constantly try to
ingratiate yourself with other charitable organizations and
individuals by offering to guide their donations to be more
like your own.
ROSE OF LOVES LOST
ITEM 10
CONSUMABLE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
EVIL
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
No thorns are visible on this ruby-red crystal rose, which seems
to grant a boon to a loved one, but it draws three beads of blood
when first bestowed upon an unwitting recipient. Hags delight
in using the rose’s curse to ruin young lovers, but it can be found
anywhere—even buried innocently in a treasure hoard.
You activate the rose of loves lost by giving it to someone
toward whom you feel romantic attraction. This item functions
only if you feel genuine attraction and desire, and it doesn’t
function if you know the item’s curse. If the target accepts
the gift, they must succeed at a DC 27 Will save with the
effects of charm, except the duration is unlimited. Every
24 hours, the victim attempts another Will save to break
the spell. If they fail three consecutive Will saves, they
become doomed 1, as the rose inflicts a lethal wasting disease
upon the recipient. This value can’t decrease while the curse
continues. Instead, it worsens every 3 days the victim
fails to break the rose’s spell, until the victim either
dies or shakes off the enchantment. A
successful saving throw or remove curse
ends the charm and enables the victim to
begin decreasing their doomed value.
TABLET OF CHAINED SOULS
ITEM 8
CURSED
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Half-formed, unreadable runes drift across this weathered
stone tablet, which resembles a tombstone too eroded to be
legible. Created by a long-dead order of scholars dedicated to
Pharasma, the tablet of chained souls can be a powerful tool in
laying uneasy spirits to rest, but its magic exacts a heavy cost.
Activate [three-actions] envision, Interact; Effect You present the tablet
to a ghost, or lay it on a haunted site. The tablet’s words
resolve into a cryptic but accurate clue about the unfinished
business that keeps this spirit from rest. Upon reading the
tablet’s words, you are subject to a geas that requires you to
right that wrong and lay the ghost to rest. If you die without
completing the task, you become a ghost, cursed to remain
until another recovers the tablet and discharges your duty.
TALETELLER’S RING
ITEM 9
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn ring; Bulk –
Smiling faces are inscribed about this silver band. You
become a fluent weaver of fictions, gaining a +2 item bonus
to Deception checks to Lie, Deception DCs against Sense
Motive, and Performance checks for storytelling. Whenever
you’re under suspicion or being questioned by an authority
figure, you find yourself compulsively spinning absurd, tall
tales that are so unconvincing that they make you look guilty
even when you’re innocent. The ring’s bonuses vanish, and
any listener can quickly determine you’re lying. Nevertheless,
you’re completely unable to be honest in such situations.

These curses mostly follow the rules from pages 116–
117 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide, but they
also include a tempted version of the curse, which
usually grants greater power... at a steeper price. A PC
can activate the tempted version of the curse as a free
action, which has the concentrate trait. While active, the
tempted version of the curse affects the target instead of
the ongoing effect. The tempted version is active until
the target next makes their daily preparations, at which
time the curse returns to its ongoing effect and the PC
can attempt a new saving throw to remove the curse.
Activating the tempted version increases the save DC of
the curse by 1. This increase is permanent and cumulative
for each time the target activates the tempted version.
THIEF’S BURDEN
CURSE 1
RARE
CURSE
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
This ward placed on valuables aims to bog down thieves and
prevent them from fleeing.
Saving Throw DC 15 Fortitude; Effect This curse causes stolen
items to weigh you down. While the curse is in effect, you
treat any stolen items you carry as 1 Bulk heavier. This
increase in Bulk remains in effect until the curse is lifted or
the item is returned to its owner.
Tempted Curse Your pockets weigh you down as you dream
of filling them with riches. You are encumbered, but you
double your total maximum carrying capacity.
UNRAVELING SKIN
CURSE 5
RARE
CURSE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Often used to protect ancient tomes, this curse causes your
skin to shed like weathered paper, cracking and bleeding at
the slightest touch.
Saving Throw DC 20 Fortitude; Effect Seeping wounds cover
your body as this curse makes your skin brittle. Any time
you would gain the wounded condition, increase the value
by 1. Any time you take bleed damage, increase the amount
of damage by 1.
Tempted Curse Your skin falls from your body and exposes your
raw flesh beneath, but the curse holds your flesh together as
its magic increases. You gain resistance to persistent bleed
damage equal to half your level and are doomed 1.
BOASTFUL PRINCE’S SCOURGE
CURSE 7
RARE
CURSE
MAGICAL
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Used as a punishment against the vain or the arrogant, this
curse slowly transforms you into a frog in note just body, but
mind as well.
Saving Throw DC 23 Will; Effect Your features slowly morph
into that of a frog’s as you grow a prominent vocal sac. You
gain the amphibious trait and can breathe both air and water.
You are stupefied 1 as long as you are under the effect of this
curse, and you can’t reduce your stupefied value below 1.
Tempted Curse You transform fully, as animal form, giving you
the specific abilities of a frog. The duration of this casting
is until you make your daily preparations, and you can’t
Dismiss the spell. While you are under the effect of animal
form due to this curse, you have all the usual limitations of
animal form, including the fact that you can’t speak (though
you can still understand any languages you know).
SINFUL TONGUE
CURSE 7
RARE
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
This curse is typically used as punishment by good clergy.
The curse causes you to envision your wrongdoings
whenever you attempt to lie or deceive, a burden that can be
cured only by confessing your past transgressions.
Saving Throw DC 23 Will; Effect (misfortune) The weight of
guilt distracts you, making it hard for you to deceive people.
Whenever you attempt a Deception check, roll the check
twice and take the worse result.
Tempted Curse You begin to confess your sins, beginning from
youthful indiscretions and ending with the present day.
While you confess, all creatures within 30 feet must succeed
at a DC 23 Will save or gain the fascinated condition as they
listen. You must spend at least 2 actions per round, which
have the concentrate trait, listing your wrongdoings. This is
an auditory, enchantment, emotion, and mental effect. Once
you stop confessing your sins, or after 10 minutes if you
haven’t finished confessing your sins, the effect ends, and
you can’t confess again until your next daily preparations.
Your conscience is clearer having confessed, and you take
only a –2 status penalty to Deception checks.
SWARMING WORDS
CURSE 9
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
Placed upon those who use magic to cause harm, this curse
causes a shower of bugs to fall from your lips whenever you
speak, foiling your spellcasting.
Saving Throw DC 26 Fortitude; Effect The crawling within
your mouth never stops as cockroaches, ants, and other
insects nest in your body. Whenever you attempt to Cast a
Spell with a verbal component or otherwise use an activity
that has the auditory trait, you must attempt a DC 5 flat
check. On a failure, the insects counteract your activity as
they crowd your mouth and muffle the sound.
TEMPTING CURSES
There is a cruel logic to most curses, which torment their victims in ways that speak to their misdeeds. Each curse
becomes a cautionary tale of the price of bad behavior returned threefold. The thief’s pockets sag under the weight
of stolen goods. The stench of death follows the grave robber. However, not all curses start with a punishment; some
present a tempting offer instead, promising power in exchange for an ever-tightening hold, eventually making the
curse irresistible.

Tempted Curse The insects multiply into a cascade. When you
activate the tempted curse, you must spend 2 actions to cast
a 5th-level vomit swarm to free the vermin inside you. For
1 minute after unleashing the swarm, you are not affected
by the curse, but afterward, the swarming worsens. For the
rest of the day, whenever you attempt to Cast a Spell with
a verbal component or otherwise use an activity that has
the auditory trait, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check. On
a failure, the insects counteract your activity.
RAGE OF THE EXCOMMUNICANT
CURSE 10
RARE
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Placed upon heretics or those who broke faith, this curse
causes symbols of your former faith to burn you upon sight.
Saving Throw DC 27 Will; Effect This curse is always
associated with a specific deity, and is typically
experienced only by one of their former clerics or
champions. The sight of that deity’s religious symbol
burns you, dealing 1d6 damage every round you look
upon it. You can avert your eyes to avoid losing Hit
Points once you know where the symbol is located. In
addition, the curse hardens you against that god. You
gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC versus
divine spells cast by that deity’s clergy.
Tempted Curse The sight of the deity’s religious symbol
burns you with the god’s rage. You can activate the
tempted curse upon viewing the deity’s symbol. You are
quickened 1 for 1 minute and can use the extra action each
round only to Strike and Stride. For the rest of the day,
whenever you see the deity’s religious symbol, you lose
2d6 Hit Points.
FORBIDDING KNOWLEDGE
CURSE 11
RARE
ABJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
Information you never should have known lingers ever-
present in your mind.
Saving Throw DC 28 Will; Effect This curse
is
acquired
when
encountering
forbidden
knowledge. This curse is always associated with
a specific piece or topic of knowledge, such as a
demon lord’s plan to overtake a government or
the true name of a powerful wizard. Your tongue
trips when you try to tell another this knowledge,
and your hand stalls when you attempt to write
it. Any attempt at communicating it fails, even as
you can’t stop thinking about it.
Tempted Curse When you activate the tempted curse, you
must spend 2 actions to attempt to speak the triggering
knowledge. This allows you to redirect the curse’s energy
and cast silence heightened to 4th level, centered on
yourself. You are still unable to speak the knowledge
clearly, but you can convey a single word to an adjacent
creature. You gain the stupefied 2 condition for the
remainder of the day. This condition can’t be reduced until
the next time you perform your daily preparations, at
which point it ends.
ENFORCED HOSPITALITY
CURSE 13
RARE
CURSE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Cast upon the rude or inconsiderate, this curse compels you
to offer a genuine and warm greeting to each new creature
you meet.
Saving Throw DC 31 Will; Effect This curse compels you to
great those you meet as though they were old friends.
Whenever you come across a creature (or group of
creatures) for the first time, you must spend 1 action
greeting them or become slowed 1 for 1 minute, even if the
creature is obviously hostile. No matter your intention, your
greeting comes across as warm and genuine, and it grants
you a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to Make
an Impression.
Tempted Effect Your compulsion to greet newcomers
intensifies. You must greet every individual creature you
meet for the first time by spending 1 action greeting them
or become slowed 1 for 1 minute. If you meet more creatures
than you have actions, you can continue spending actions
greeting creatures across multiple turns. For example, if
you encountered six bandits, you could greet three bandits
on the first round and three bandits on the second round,
and you wouldn’t become slowed unless you took another
action before you finished greeting them. For 1 minute or
until you take a hostile action, you gain the effects of a
7th‑level sanctuary against creatures you’ve greeted in this
way (DC 31).

Each of these bargained contracts offers specific benefits
and drawbacks. While negotiation is part of these
bargains, the entities that offer such deals rarely recognize
the spirit of the agreement—only the written deal is final.
Upon close review, the wording often matches the original
proposal, leaving the mortal to wonder if the bargaining
was just for show.
A bargained contract is a magic item that
has the contract trait. The item has
no physical substance and can’t be
dispelled or altered. Nonetheless,
it comes with a pair of tokens
indicating
the
contract
has
been struck, one held by each
end of the deal. A bargained
contract can only be destroyed
if both tokens are destroyed.
If discarded, lost, or stolen,
a token tends to find its way
back to the being to whom it
belongs. Holding the token
isn’t necessary to receive the
benefits of the contract except
where specifically stated that
the token is part of the activation or
effect. A bargained contract is automatically
invested and counts toward a character’s limit of 10
invested items; part of the cost is that the contract draws
from the holder’s investiture. Entities that offer bargained
contracts can enter into any number without restriction.
Bargained contracts don’t cost money because they
are always part of a contract roleplayed out during the
story and priced in things more meaningful than coin.
Nonetheless, the GM should consider contracts as a story
reward in much the same way as they would other types
of treasure. For instance, if the GM is looking to give out
two 9th-level items, they might have one of those items
be a key to the stomach. In other words, the lack of cost
just means it can’t be bought or sold in stores, not that it
doesn’t count as part of the PCs’ overall treasure.
BOTTOMLESS PURSE
ITEM 8
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
With a handshake, you traded future wealth for a bottomless
purse of gems and other valuables. Using the purse, you can
always sell items for their normal sell value during downtime,
even if you aren’t anywhere near a settlement. You just put
them into the purse, and within a day, the proper sale price
appears in coins and gems. Once per day, from any distance,
the entity that holds your bargained contract automatically
sells a common consumable item in your possession, giving
you back only half the normal amount for a sold item.
Activate [two-actions] envision, command; Frequency once per day;
Effect You deposit up to 30 gp of gems and coins in a
separate pouch of the bottomless purse while thinking of
a common consumable item costing that amount of money.
You then upend the pouch. The item you envisioned comes
tumbling out into your hand.
CRYOLITE EYE
ITEM 6
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
You tore your eye from the socket
and offered it to whatever spirit
would take it. In return, you
received a glass eye in its place.
This eye allows you to see as normal,
and when you succeed at a Perception
check against an illusion, you get a
critical success instead. Once per day,
from any distance, the entity that
holds your bargained contract can
overwhelm your cryolite eye with
magical energy, causing images to
float over your vision that inflict the
dazzled condition on you for 1 minute.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency once
per day; Effect You look through the glass eye sealing
your bargained contract. The contract casts see invisibility
affecting you.
HAND-HEWED FACE
ITEM 7
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
At the crossroads under a new moon, you traded your face
for one that you can mold as though it were clay, sealed with
a ribbon worn around your neck to hide the seam. Your true
appearance changes to that of a generic member of your
ancestry. You can shape your facial features with your hands
and thus don’t need a disguise kit to Impersonate, and you
don’t take circumstance penalties to Impersonate someone
due to the difference in your facial features. Once per day, from
any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract
can change their appearance to match your appearance
from before you sealed the contract, or the appearance you
are currently using through Impersonate. When they do,
your face transforms to your new true appearance, that of a
generic member of your ancestry, and you become stunned 3
by the sudden backlash.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Requirements You have used
Impersonate and molded your face into a different face;
Effect You peel your current face from your skin, revealing
BARGAINED CONTRACTS
Anyone can have a taste of power—if they’re willing to pay the price for it. These bargained contracts are readily
offered to those who know how to ask. However, fey, spirits of nature, hags, and the otherwise supernaturally inclined
don’t deal in currency as simple as gold.

the true generic appearance from your bargained contract.
This allows you to duck out of sight and remove the facial
component of your disguise almost immediately, though
clothing or other elements might still give you away.
KEY TO THE STOMACH
ITEM 9
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Whether due to the inconvenience of having a physical body
or the desperation of impending starvation, you were drawn
to a person offering relief from hunger. You swallowed a key,
which remains in your stomach, that continuously satiates
you. You no longer need to eat or drink. Once per day, from
any distance, the entity that holds your bargained contract
can have the key sealing your bargained contract
absorb all items in your stomach, which prevents you
from benefiting from items that require you to eat or
drink them, such as potions and elixirs, for 10 minutes.
During this time, the entity gains the benefits of these
items instead.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency once per day;
Effect You absorb any poisons with the key sealing
your bargained contract. You gain the benefits of a
casting of neutralize poison.
LOST EMBER
ITEM 10
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Sealed with a vial containing the ashes from your
childhood home, you traded the memories of your
early life to stay focused on the present, allowing
you to avoid distractions during combat. Once per
day, from any distance, the entity that holds your
bargained contract can take one of your memories.
This functions as a casting of modify memory that doesn’t
grant you a saving throw and can’t be reversed by any means
without stealing the memory back first.
Activate [free-action] command; Frequency once per day; Trigger You
start your turn flat-footed or confused; Effect A speck of
ash from the vial sealing your bargained contract appears
out of nowhere on your tongue, bringing your senses into
focus. You suppress the flat-footed or confused condition
until the start of your next turn. You can use this free action
when you are confused, even though you normally can’t
take actions of your choice when confused.
STONE OF UNRIVALED SKILL
ITEM 17
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
You traded your senses to a hag for unrivaled expertise stolen
from various souls who were once the greatest in their field.
Your bargained contract is sealed by sleeping with a pitch-black
stone under your pillow every night. Choose one skill when
you seal this bargained contract. You become an expert in that
skill; if you were already an expert, you become a master, and
if you were already a master, you become legendary. Once
per day, from any distance, the hag that holds your contract
can take over your senses for 10 minutes, during which time
the hag hears, sees, smells, tastes, and feels everything you
would typically experience. During this time, you are dazzled
by your own disjointed senses.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency once per day; Effect You
place the stone sealing your bargained contract in your
mouth. For the next 10 minutes, you gain a +3 status bonus
to skill checks using the skill you chose for your contract.
VIAL OF THE IMMORTAL WELLSPRING
ITEM 20
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
At a wellspring, you gave your blood to a force of nature and
received a vial from the wellspring’s heart in return. Once per 10
minutes, when your dying value would increase above 3, you
instead become unconscious and are no longer dying; this doesn’t
prevent you from being killed by death effects or the doomed
condition. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that
holds your bargained contract can possess you and control
your actions, leaving you unaware of what goes on. This
possession automatically succeeds, regardless of any
countermeasures you might take. Normally this lasts for
only 1 round if during an encounter, or no longer than a
few minutes during exploration. However, the more you
rely on the power of the wellspring’s heart to survive
death, the longer it can possess you the next time it
chooses to do so, doubling the amount of time with each
use, to a maximum duration of 1 day. Once the entity
possesses you, this duration resets.
Activate [two-actions] command; Frequency once per day;
Effect You drink from the vial of water that seals your
bargained contract. You gain the effects of a 9th-level,
2-action heal spell.
SELF-EMPTYING POCKET
ITEM 9
RARE
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
You never perform to an empty crowd after promising any
profits to a phantom in a playhouse, sealed by holes that appear
in your pockets. By meeting with the attendees at your events,
you can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to Gather
Information. When you would use Performance to Earn Income,
you don’t earn any gold pieces, as the money disappears before
you can even count it.
The entity that holds your bargained contract can influence
your reception any time you perform for a crowd or Activate
the pocket. If they influence your performance favorably,
you gain a +2 item bonus to your Performance check. If they
influence your performance unfavorably, you gain a -2 item
penalty to your Performance check. If you’ve failed to earn
the entity money in quite a while, it typically influences your
performance unfavorably.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision; Frequency once per day;
Effect You exercise all of your charm on a creature, turning
a chance meeting into an impromptu performance that
commands attention. Attempt a single Performance check
against the Perception DC of the creature. On a success, the
creature is affected as though by a successful Deception
check to Create a Diversion. The entity that holds your
contract can influence this performance as well.

Pactbinder (Archetype)
Some people feel that the universe is a constant struggle.
Good against evil, law against chaos, civilization against
nature, life against death against undeath. But why fight
what you can’t change? You prefer to bargain.
As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities,
otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens,
amiable and unapproachable alike. Over the course of your
many negotiations, you’ve learned something important:
while such beings always seek a bargain tilted in their own
favor, sometimes your definition of value differs enough
from theirs that you can still come out ahead. In fact,
sometimes, those who don’t understand pacts like you do
might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa.
Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to
consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful
memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on
how it was taking something personal from you. Little did
it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal.
Of course, this practice isn’t without its own risks, as who
knows what you might become without that part of you.
All these things, you can and must consider in every
pact. In addition to pacts, you might also pursue magical
contracts. While less of a metaphysical commitment than a
pact, contracts offer similar benefits you just can’t resist—
and you can employ your skill set as a pactbinder to
manipulate the precise wording of the bargain.
PACTBINDER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy as well as either Arcana,
Nature, Occultism, or Religion
The first step toward forming a successful pact is an
understanding of the magic behind it, along with skill at
negotiation. It doesn’t hurt that you also learned how to
magically bind yourself to keep your word, enabling you to
bargain more easily. You increase your proficiency from trained
to expert in Diplomacy and in one of the following: Arcana,
Nature, Occultism, or Religion.
Binding Vow [one-action] (auditory, concentrate, enchantment, occult)
Frequency once per day; Effect You bind yourself by formally
speaking a binding vow. Supernatural power flows through
and around you as you speak it, and all those present to
hear it intrinsically know that it binds you. Breaking this
vow is anathema to you, and if you break it willingly, you
lose all pactbinder benefits until you fulfill your vow or, if
that’s impossible, participate in an atone ritual. The vow
doesn’t prevent unwilling violations and can’t be used to
try to circumvent mind-control magic, confusion, or similar
situations where you perform an action not entirely of your
own volition. A Binding Vow doesn’t end until you’ve fulfilled
it. Even if you die, the vow still binds you if you return to life.
The vow doesn’t force you to go to ridiculous extremes, such
as dying, to fulfill your vow unless you specifically swear to
go to such extremes. Trying to subvert your binding vow by
making selfish promises (such as swearing to an ally that
you’ll kill someone you already wanted to kill) is in itself a
violation of your vow, as is attempting to subvert other vows
you’ve made (such as those from other pactbinder feats or a
champion’s code).
When you make a Request or Coerce directly in service of
fulfilling your vow, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your
check against any creatures aware of your vow.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the pactbinder archetype.
SOCIABLE VOW
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication, expert in Diplomacy
You can leverage your vow in more social interactions. The
circumstance bonus from your Binding Vow also applies
to attempts to Gather Information, Make an Impression, or
Demoralize you make directly in service of fulfilling the vow.
PACT OF FEY GLAMOUR
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
ILLUSION
PRIMAL
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with fey powers, granting you the
otherworldly appearance of your dreams in exchange for
oaths of hospitality. As long as you keep your end of the
bargain, your base appearance changes indefinitely to any one
appearance you wish that’s within the bounds of possibility
for your ancestry; this effect can’t be counteracted or removed
except by violating the pact. Additionally, you can cast illusory
disguise as a primal innate spell once per hour, using the
higher of your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.
In exchange, you promise to accept any fey’s request for
hospitality, granting them food, drink, and lodging for up
to 3 days and 3 nights. You also promise not to harm any
creature to whom you’ve offered hospitality or who has shown
hospitality to you, whether or not that creature is fey, unless
that creature does harm first. If you refuse hospitality to a fey
or violate hospitality, you lose the benefits of this feat until
you atone for your transgressions, instantly reverting your
appearance to the one you had before the pact.
PACT OF DRACONIC FURY
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
ARCANE
ARCHETYPE
EVOCATION
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with a dragon, giving you the ability to
tap into the dragon’s immeasurable power in exchange for
adding to their hoard. You gain the Dragon Breath activity.
In exchange, you promise to search for objects the dragon
wants for its hoard upon request. These requests might be
extremely specific unique objects, or they might be a broad
category of objects. While the dragon agrees to pay you a fair
price for the item you retrieve, the pact requires you to give
your time and service.
Dragon Breath [two-actions] Frequency once per hour; Effect You breathe
deeply and exhale a line or cone of powerful breath, much
like the dragon with which you made the pact. If the dragon
had a cone-shaped breath weapon, your breath weapon is a

30-foot cone. If they had a line-shaped breath weapon, your
breath weapon is a 60-foot line. If they had a burst-shaped
breath weapon, your breath weapon is a 10-foot burst within
60 feet. No matter the shape, it deals 1d6 damage per level,
of the same damage type as the dragon’s Breath Weapon,
with a basic Reflex save, using the higher of your class DC
or spell DC. This action has the same traits as the breath
weapon of the dragon you made the pact with.
PACT OF INFERNAL PROWESS
FEAT 8
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
DIVINE
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life
in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when
you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free
action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose
to automatically succeed at checks to Earn Income for tasks
below your level, without rolling.
However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You
can’t be returned to life except by powerful magic such as
miracle, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract
can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the
effects of a discern location spell. They can also use 10th-level
scrying on you at will, and you automatically critically fail
your saving throw.
Special You can’t retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess
without journeying to Hell and destroying the
devil’s written contract spelling out the
terms of your pact.
PACT OF THE FINAL BREATH FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINE
NECROMANCY
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with a powerful
psychopomp—typically an olethros advocate
or yamaraj judge—granting you a reprieve
before your soul will be collected in exchange
for respect for the dead and assistance against the undead.
As long as you keep your end of the bargain, you live twice
as long as you normally would before dying of natural
causes. Additionally, the first time each day that you would
be reduced to 0 Hit Points and gain the dying condition, you
instead regain a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level
(starting from 0 HP), remain conscious, and gain fast healing
equal to your level for 3 rounds.
In exchange, you swear to treat the dead you come across
with respect, performing last rites and final dispositions
to ensure their spirits rest in peace and are less likely to
rise as undead. Furthermore, you swear to destroy undead
you come across, so long as it’s within your power to do so
without inordinate risk to yourself. Violating your part of
the pact causes its protections to immediately end. If at that
point you had already lived beyond your natural lifespan, the
psychopomps typically give you a few moments to make any
last farewells, and then you simply breathe your final breath
and pass on.
PACT OF ELDRITCH EYES
FEAT 14
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
OCCULT
Prerequisites Pactbinder Dedication
You’ve sworn a pact with an entity beyond mortal comprehension,
granting you distant visions and insights. You can cast prying
eye as an occult innate spell once per hour, using the higher of
your class DC and your spell DC to determine the DC.
In exchange, you allow the entity to peer through you
at your world. The entity’s touch creates strange dreams,
typically nightmares. Every morning, you awaken trained in an
unexpected Lore skill determined by the GM, which you retain
until the next time you rest for the night. While the entity
contacts you most often while you sleep, it occasionally peers
at you during the day, leading to disorientation and visions. You
can generally determine what’s going on during these visions,
so normally this occurrence imparts no mechanical penalty.
However, in the unlikely event that an encounter begins while
you’re experiencing visions from the entity, you might take a
circumstance penalty to your initiative roll.
Special The entity isn’t particularly attached to its pact with
you. If you want it gone, you can retrain out of Pact of Eldritch
Eyes, after which the entity withdraws its eyes to the void.

Curse Maelstrom
(Archetype)
Some folks are ridden with bad luck: the rations they
were counting on turn out to be spoiled, the ship they
were hoping to catch sinks in the harbor, or the new
home they bought is destroyed by a rampaging golem.
Most know that they are cursed, feeling an emptiness
in their soul that weighs upon them, gnawing at their
confidence and shrouding their ambitions. Sometimes,
these curse maelstroms learn to control and channel
their curse; you are one such unfortunate soul.
You have a powerful curse living deep within you.
You might have been able to restrain your curse for the
most part, but it flares up occasionally and tempts you
with the power to curse your foes, should you allow
it to exert itself. Why should you be the only one who
has to endure a cursed life when others have so clearly
earned such woe?
Living with a curse every day, you become intimately
familiar with the workings of curses, getting a sense of
when bad luck is about to befall those around you. You
might try to avoid further bad fortune—which rarely
pans out as you’d like—or you could come to terms
with your lot in life and regard your curse as something
akin to an old friend. Either way, fate cares little.
Misery loves company, so your curse can even be a
beacon for more misfortune. You might have multiple
curses all tied to you, all fighting to make your life as
hellish as possible.
CURSE MAELSTROM DEDICATION
FEAT 2
RARE
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites You are cursed or have previously been cursed.
A horrible curse has left a lingering stain on your soul, and
its effects continue to plague you even if the curse’s other
effects have ended. You can choose to suppress it, but if you
instead let it manifest, you can channel its power in your
favor. During an encounter, when you succeed at a check, the
GM can offer to have you roll again, taking the second result.
This is a misfortune effect. If you do so, you enter a curse
maelstrom state. If the misfortune effect is somehow canceled
or negated (by a fortune effect, for example), you don’t enter
a curse maelstrom state.
In addition, the curse is jealous of its place within your
soul and gladly lashes out whenever others dare to usurp
that position, granting you its power without the usual price.
If a foe places a misfortune effect on your roll and the effect
applies to your roll, you enter a curse maelstrom state, and
if you fail a saving throw against a foe’s curse effect and are
affected by the curse, you also enter a curse maelstrom state.
No matter the source, you can only enter a curse maelstrom
state during an encounter, and if you don’t end the state on
your own, it ends at the end of the encounter. Once it ends,
you can’t enter a curse maelstrom state again for 1 minute.
While in a curse maelstrom state, you can’t benefit from
fortune effects, and they also don’t cancel misfortune effects
on you; they simply have no effect. While in this state, all
creatures other than you within a 10-foot emanation take a
–1 status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks due
to the storm of bad luck swirling out of your body. You gain
the Expel Maelstrom action, which you can use to focus the
brunt of your curses onto an unlucky target.
Expel Maelstrom [one-action] (curse, necromancy, occult)
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state;
Effect You expel the maelstrom from your
body, sending the energy to reside in one
unlucky creature within 60 feet. Your curse
maelstrom state ends. The result depends on the
creature’s Will save.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and the curse’s
energy dissipates harmlessly.
Success The creature comes to house the maelstrom’s
wrath within it. It takes a –1 status penalty to all saving
throws and skill checks for 1 minute.
Failure The maelstrom strikes deep into the creature’s
soul. It takes a –2 status penalty to all saving throws
and skill checks for 10 minutes.
Critical Failure The maelstrom pitches the creature into a
single fit of utter misfortune before burrowing into its
soul. As failure, but the creature also must roll twice
and take the lower result on its next saving throw or
skill check; this is a misfortune effect.
FAMILIAR ODDITIES
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication, trained in
Occultism or Curse Lore
Perhaps due to the curse within you, curses occasionally
perceive you as an extension of themselves and readily
reveal themselves to you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to checks to Identify Magic on a cursed item or a spell that
has the curse trait.
UNNERVING EXPANSION [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
You gather your curse around you and impel it to pour
outward, expanding your maelstrom. The radius of the
emanation of your curse maelstrom state increases by 5 feet
until the end of your curse maelstrom state. The outpouring
of the curse is unnerving. You attempt to Demoralize a
creature within the emanation of your curse maelstrom;
you don’t take penalties for not sharing a language with
that creature.
SHARE BURDEN [reaction]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Trigger An ally within 60 feet would be affected by a curse
or misfortune effect, and you wouldn’t be affected but you
are an eligible target for the effect.
You draw the misfortune or curse into yourself, potentially
enabling you to enter your curse maelstrom state. Instead of
affecting your ally, the triggering curse or misfortune effect
affects you.
ACCURSED MAGIC
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
When the curse within you spills out, you can lay curses on
others and claim them for yourself with ease. You can cast
claim curse (Secrets of Magic 95). At 10th level, you can also
cast seal fate (Advanced Player’s Guide 224), and at 12th
level, you can also cast inevitable disaster (Secrets of Magic
111). You can cast these spells once per day as occult innate
spells, but only while within your curse maelstrom state.
If you couldn’t already cast occult spells, these spells use
Wisdom as your spellcasting ability, and you become trained
in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
COUNTER CURSE [reaction]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state.
Trigger You or an ally within 30 feet is targeted by or in
the emanation of a curse or misfortune effect from an
opponent or object of which you are aware.
You gather the energy of your maelstrom and fling its
unleashed power into the enemy’s curse, attempting to
neutralize it. Attempt a counteract check against the
triggering effect, using half your level rounded up as your
counteract level and the higher of your class DC and spell DC
as the counteract modifier. On a success, you neutralize the
curse or misfortune effect. If the effect was constant, such as
a misfortune aura, it returns automatically at the beginning
of the creature or object’s next turn. Whether you succeed or
fail, your curse maelstrom state ends.
TORRENTIAL BACKLASH [two-actions]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Curse Maelstrom Dedication
Requirements You are in a curse maelstrom state.
Calling upon forbidden practices, you release the curse from
within yourself, allowing it free rein to destroy everything
around you. All creatures within your curse maelstrom
emanation except you take 1d6 negative damage for each
level you have, with a basic Fortitude save. Your curse
maelstrom state then ends.
REVERSE CURSE
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Counter Curse
When you counter a curse or misfortune effect, you send it
back to destroy its originator. Whenever you succeed at the
counteract check to Counter Curse, the creature is affected
by its own curse or misfortune effect, attempting a saving
throw against its own DC if the effect allows a saving throw.
In the case of a constant ability, such as a misfortune aura,
the creature is affected only until the beginning of its next
turn, when the ability reasserts itself.
MANIFESTATIONS
Those at the center of a storm of curses often
have peculiar manifestations that mark them as
one of the unfortunate. Over time, even the places
that they inhabit will begin to show signs of their
presence: plants with bizarre growths, dust clouds
that form strange symbols in the light, and floors
that creak and groan even when no one is walking
across them.

Adventure Background
In the land of Irrisen, where the riders of bright morning,
red noon, and dark midnight serve Baba Yaga, and where
the princess Anastasia rules from a palace of ice, there is
a village called Krasnoprudny. Next to that village is a
lovely little pond, from which the village takes its name
(for Krasnoprudny means “beside the beautiful pond”).
And in that pond, there lived a vodyanoy and his seven
rusalka daughters.
For many years they lived happily enough, but then
came word of a new queen in Whitethrone, and the
rusalkas decided to venture to the capital and seek
service as handmaidens to Anastasia, because a palace
is better than a pond, even a very nice pond with a
little ledge perfect for sitting. And the old vodyanoy,
Ded Bolota (“Grandpa Bog”) by name, gave them his
blessing and waved them goodbye as they left.
But it’s lonely living in a pond all by yourself, and Ded
Bolota started to mope, and to sulk, and to drink too
much. Until an old friend of his came to visit, the elder
leshy Ded Bereza (“Grandpa Birch”). The leshy grew
worried about the vodyanoy’s state of mind. “Bolota,”
the birch tree said, “You need to get out more, you need
a hobby. There are all these mortals living by your banks,
why don’t you do something nice for them?”
And so the two put their heads together and set out
to make Krasnoprudny the most fortunate village in all
of Irrisen, a place where wishes come true. And since
neither had the faintest idea of how mortals thought, it
all promptly went to pieces.
Getting Started
Unlike several previous adventures, the journey through
the somnambulist bridge is noticeably turbulent, like a
falling nightmare. The portal unceremoniously spits the
PCs out into the air about 5 feet above a snowbank by
the side of a road, a few hours away from their intended
destination. (Unbeknownst to the PCs, at least for now,
is that someone in town made an ill-considered wish to
be left alone, and the ensuing fey magic was enough to
interfere with the transportation ritual.)
A PC who succeeds at a DC 26 Nature check to Recall
Knowledge is familiar with the main sources of the curses
in Irrisen.

WISHES IN KRASNOPRUDNY
With its particular confluence of witches and ancient spirits, Irrisen is always a region of interest when discussing
curses and pacts. The matter concerning the village of Krasnoprudny in particular is just the latest in a long string
of such files, but one that’s managed to catch my eye—while many villages have borne the curse of a winter witch for
a slight real or imagined, something feels different about this village. Curse? Enchantment? Geas? — K.H.W.

Critical Success While it’s certainly not impossible, such a
big curse afflicting an entire village sounds rather out of
character for a winter witch—they tend to be more focused.
More likely it’s some kind of fey, perhaps a poludnica (field
fey), vodyanoy (water fey), or elder leshy (forest plant fey).
Success Irrisen is a land with plenty of curses, but the two
most likely culprits are winter witches, who have a habit
of cursing people who cross them, and capricious fey, who
curse for whatever reason seems to make sense to them.
Critical Failure If there’s a curse in Irrisen, then it must
have been cast with the knowledge, or more likely the
participation, of Baba Yaga herself.
Welcoming Committee
As Krasnoprudny lies well off the beaten track, the PCs
make the last leg of their journey by means of a passing
donkey cart operated by an old peddler named Maiksim
(CG male human peddler). The trip is an uneventful
sojourn through the beautiful, frozen Irriseni countryside,
interrupted only periodically by Maiksim’s ongoing feud
with his donkey, Conqueror. Grand, gloomy pine trees
cluster thickly on either side of the slender road, little red
berries twinkling from the depths of the snow. From time
to time, the PCs spot the tracks of deer and rabbits, or
glimpse of an arctic fox going about its business. A few
nightingales sing late into the evening.
Finally, the donkey cart turns a corner, and the PCs
get their first good look at Krasnoprudny. It’s a modest
little village of maybe twenty houses, with sturdy walls
made of cut logs and sharply pitched wooden roofs. It’s
clearly not a very prosperous place, but it doesn’t look
impoverished either—the houses have carved windowsills
and cornices, and there are a few barns here and there. As
with everything in Irrisen, the village is covered in a layer
of fresh-fallen snow.
Before the party can get any closer, Conqueror the
Donkey decides that this is entirely too much work for
one day and stops pulling the cart to nibble on some
nearby shrubs (not for the first time on this trip), at which
point Maiksim loses his temper and begins swearing,
saying “Ah, devil take you, you lazy beast!”
Whereupon a very strange thing happens. Out of the
bushes, a pair of diminutive pig-featured imps trot out
and begin to abduct Conqueror in a very business-like
fashion. One of the imps quickly removes Conqueror’s
harness while the other contrives to heft the entire (loudly
braying) donkey, despite being the size of a small child.
At this point, unless the PCs intervene, the imps make
off with the donkey after a few minutes of work, leaving
behind a befuddled and donkey-less Maiksim and a
party who needs to walk the last mile to Krasnoprudny.
Any hostile attack or spell on the part of the PCs causes
the imps to drop Conqueror and run away, or else
explode into a cloud of noxious soot. This rescues the
donkey but leaves the PCs with something of a mystery
on their hands.
Alternatively, the PCs can attempt to yell at or talk to
the imps. Getting their attention requires a successful DC
24 Intimidation check to Coerce or Diplomacy check to
Make an Impression, whereupon the imps begin to loudly
and profanely complain that they were offered a donkey
and simply came to collect. A PC who succeeds at a DC
24 Religion check to Recall Knowledge can observe that
this is very much not standard imp behavior—something
or someone is nudging the imps to act this way. During
the ensuing conversation, the PCs might have a few
questions for the imps. Use or paraphrase the following
questions and answers as guidance.
Who
are
you?
“I’m
Moldy-Cheese.”
“And
I’m Mosquito-by-Ear.”
Why are you trying to take our donkey? “It’s not your
donkey!” Moldy-Cheese says. “We were offered it fair
and square.” “He said devil take it,” Mosquito-by-Ear
adds, pointing to Maiksim, “so we did!”
Why does an imp want a donkey? This seems to confuse
the two imps for a moment, and they look at one another.
Finally, Moldy-Cheese says, “I don’t know...”
“We were home, and then suddenly... we were here,”
Mosquito-by-Ear says. “And then we just knew we had
to take this donkey.”
This more or less exhausts the useful information that
the two imps have, although if the PCs manage to learn
about the imps’ arrival in Golarion, they can attempt a
DC 26 Arcana or Occultism check to Recall Knowledge
about summoning. On a success, the PC is able to decipher
the imps’ comments as meaning they were summoned not
by a specific mage, but by some kind of automatic process
(a spell, ritual, or curse)—an extremely powerful process
if it can just casually summon fiends, but also, from the
available evidence, not a terribly bright one.
In any case, the PCs can deal with the imps as they
please—they can bribe them with a few moldy apples or
threaten to kick them until they leave—either way, the imps
disappear—and the PCs can proceed into Krasnoprudny.
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 9th-level
characters.
The adventure begins with the PCs arriving in
Krasnoprudny, in Irrisen, the land of eternal winter.
They quickly discover that something very odd is
going on when some imps try to steal their donkey.
Investigating the village makes it clear that the
entire place is laboring under an odd sort of curse—
where casual exclamations and idioms become real.
The source of the trouble is probably the nearby
pond and the creatures living there. Ultimately, the
PCs will have to convince a pair of proud, prickly
primal beings that their benevolent efforts have
gone astray, all without offending them enough to
get the village flooded.

Exploring Krasnoprudny
Having been duly welcomed into the strangeness afflicting
Krasnoprudny, the PCs can now explore the town and
encounter the various strange curses afflicting the local
population. When Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza cast their
magic over the town, they made it so that wishes came
true—except the two fey weren’t terribly precise in their
spell (faerie alcohol may have been involved), and so
it responds to oaths, exclamations, idioms, and casual
daydreams as much as to actual requests.
THE GREAT PORRIDGE FLOOD OF KRASNOPRUDNY
As the PCs are passing by the first cottage, they hear
a sudden shriek from inside. A moment later, the door
bursts open, and a veritable flood of buckwheat porridge
comes pouring out onto the street, carrying along with it
furniture, pots, pans, one loudly yowling cat, and a very
unhappy old woman.
The woman is Baba Donya (CG female Kellid human
grandmother), who was in the process of cooking a
supper for her son’s family, who are presently out tending
to the crops. She made an off-hand comment to her cat
Frosya that she wished she could make enough porridge
for everyone, whereupon the fey spell took effect and
Baba Donya’s prized wooden spoon set to work, with the
effects that the PCs can see before them.
Each PC must attempt a DC 26 Reflex save immediately
upon the outpouring of porridge, with failure resulting in
the PC being knocked prone and taking a –2 circumstance
penalty to their next Athletics check to Swim in the
porridge. Afterward, assuming the PCs choose to help,
they have three tasks at hand.
• 	 Rescuing Baba Donya: The PCs can save Baba Donya
with two successful Athletics checks to Swim to get
her to safety, the first one with a DC of 24 to reach
Baba Donya, then a second at DC 26 to get back out
of the porridge.
• 	 Rescuing Frosya the Cat: Baba Donya will be in
a panic until her beloved pet is rescued. Doing so
requires a PC to succeed at a single DC 24 Athletics
check to Swim, but also requires succeeding at either
a DC 18 Athletics check to Grapple the cat safely or
a DC 23 Nature check to persuade Frosya to come
with the PC. On a failure, the cat deals 1d6 slashing
damage worth of scratches to the PC, but they
can try again. On a success, the panicked cat also
scratches them for 1d6 slashing damage, but they
manage to save her. On a critical success, Frosya is
either so restrained or placated that she comes along
without dealing any damage to the PC.
• 	 Stopping the Spoon: The spoon has only 1 HP, but it
also has an AC of 29 and a Reflex modifier of +19
due to its small size and rapid movement. If it rolls
a success on a Reflex save, it gets a critical success
instead. The spoon is easy enough to spot, given that
it’s dancing madly across the surface of the flood,
more porridge appearing with every twist and twitch.
Inventive PCs may well think of other solutions to
the above problems, such as telekinesis or flying magic.
Use the above DCs as guidelines to give an idea of
how difficult they should be. If the PCs fail to disable
the spoon, or ignore the situation, then the magic gives
out before anyone is seriously harmed, but the map for
Encounter A is entirely made up of difficult terrain owing
to being knee-deep in rapidly cooling porridge.
Once the PCs rescue both Baba Donya and Frosya and
resolve the spoon situation, they will likely want to talk
to her, as she’s the first local they meet. Use or paraphrase
the following questions and answers as guidance.
Who are you? “Anadona Mahrosovna, but everyone
calls me Baba Donya. And this is Frosya,” the old woman
says. The cat regards the PCs with typical feline disdain
and attempts to clean the porridge off its fur.
What happened?! “Ach, my own fault, I forgot myself,”
Baba Donya says, trying to get porridge out of her shawl.
“Wished I could feed everyone, my spoon heard me, and
well there you go. Crying shame too, I liked that spoon.”
Does this happen often? / What’s going on? “Started
a month or so ago, when Pashka turned himself into a
WHAT SORT OF FAIRY TALE?
The default atmosphere of this adventure tends a
bit lighthearted, with the cursed wishes creating
inept imps, a localized flood of porridge, and
murderous matryoshkas. However, depending on
the tone you want to set, considering playing up
the darker side of fairy wishes gone wrong. The
porridge flood and other similar wishes might have
destroyed homes, leaving the buildings in town
damaged or destroyed and the townsfolk in fear
of the next calamity. You can play up the strange,
unsettling, and wrong feeling about the town and its
people, who might have lost a bit of their humanity
as the wishes twisted their souls in ways mortal
spirits weren’t meant to shift. Alternatively, the
PCs could encounter a macabre scene, such as the
classic monkey’s paw scenario of a wish for a dead
loved one to return causing them to come back as
a murderous corpse and kill the rest of their family.
Ultimately, the fey creating this effect meant
well and didn’t intend to ruin people’s lives, but the
way they understand the world, they might still not
have been able to tell the difference even as things
grew terribly dark. After all, the mortals were the
ones who kept making these wishes, perhaps they
simply desired excitement and danger? The choice
of how to depict the cursed town is up to you; make
a decision that feels right for your group and be sure
to discuss content and boundaries if you make the
results of the curses into something truly macabre.

goose—took us all the whole day to figure out how to
turn him back,” says Baba Donya. “Now, you say the
wrong thing, and pfah! You’re a goose, or your best spoon
turns magic, or worse. Watch your words, children, the
magic’s listening.”
Do you know what’s causing the magic? “Pfah, it’s
probably Unclean Powers. Rusalkas, leshys, vodyanoys,
one of those. Not cruel enough for a Poludnitsa, too
strong for a domovoi or kikimora.”
Are there a lot of those around here? “Enough. They
all love their games and their gifts, and this smells like
someone’s idea of a bet. Troublesome neighbors. They
live in the forest, though where, I couldn’t tell you.”
If the PCs helped her, before they leave, Baba Donya
gifts them the remains of her favorite spoon, which
still has some magic in it—it functions as a wand of
wall of water, except that instead of a wall of water, it
produces a wall of buckwheat porridge. Unfortunately,
the temporary conjured porridge from the wall doesn’t
provide any nourishment.
A. THE TROUBLE WITH DOLLS
SEVERE 9
After the PCs’ encounter with Baba Donya and Frosya,
they can continue exploring the village. They meet a few
other people, several suffering the effects of curses. For
instance, one young woman is unable to do anything
except sing, her throat growing hoarse and her eyes wide
as if pleading for help, while a doughty farmer is pestered
by bluebirds flitting about and pecking away at him.
No one appears to know much more than Baba Donya.
Everyone suspects the fey, but no one knows which fey
caused the curse or where they might be.
A little later though, perhaps as the PCs sit down for
lunch in the middle of the town, or just before they leave
town to explore the woods, they hear a loud, childish wail,
and a young boy around nine years old comes running in
their direction, pursued by what at first glance appears to
be an exceptionally large wooden bumblebee.
This is Volkya (CN male Kellid human child) and on closer
inspection, the bumblebee is actually a fist-sized matryoshka
doll, brightly painted to look like a rosy-cheeked Irriseni
maiden. Volkya made the mistake of wanting the doll to be
less boring and is now reaping the consequences as the doll
animated and attempted to “play” with the child.
The PCs might attempt to help the boy in some way,
perhaps by swatting at the doll or trying to distract it. If
not, Volkya runs and hides behind whichever PC looks
biggest and brawniest. In either case, read or paraphrase
the following.
The floating doll turns to regard you menacingly with its
painted features—as menacingly as a six-inch-tall wooden
matryoshka can manage. Certainly there is something
unfriendly in its serene, painted eyes.
It suddenly pops open, and out of it emerges another
doll. Though common sense would insist that the new doll
should be smaller, this one is somehow bigger, more than a
foot tall. Its painted dress is a little different, and the finely
drawn hair is different as well.
Then this doll opens up, and an even bigger doll emerges.
And then again. And again. And one last time for good
measure, releasing a ten-foot-tall matryoshka as big around
as a barrel. The six dolls stared at you for a moment with
unseeing eyes and then charge.
Volkya uses this opportunity to run
away, but the PCs have a fight on
their hands.
Creatures: The three smallest
matryoshkas (6 inches tall,
2 feet tall, and 4 feet
tall) zip about the
IF WISHES WERE FISHES...
Encourage your players to speak in-character while
in Krasnoprudny and pay close attention to anything
that the fey magic might interpret as a wish. Drop
little curse effects into the party’s adventures—
nothing with mechanical heft, but small, cosmetic
effects, and never exactly what the PCs want. If one
character calls another a pig, for example, then the
luckless recipient might have to add a few oinks to
their dialogue for the next portion of the adventure.
If someone wishes they had a horse, they might
promptly slip on a child’s wooden toy.
Ambitious GMs might even employ a “ringer”—
arrange with a suitable player to make a particularly
choice statement at some point in the adventure,
which can then lead to a preplanned effect. At the
same time, keep an eye on your players’ tolerance. If
they’re getting into the swing of things and poking
the curse, excellent, but remember that the goal is to
annoy and befuddle the characters, not the players!

battlefield, dealing 1 bludgeoning damage, 1d4
bludgeoning damage, and 1d6 bludgeoning
damage, respectively, to a random
character automatically each round
and ending their turn in that
character’s space. Much like the
magic spoon, they each have
1 Hit Point, AC 29, and +19
Reflex, and if they roll a success
on a Reflex save, they get a critical
success instead.
The three biggest matryoshkas (6 feet, 8 feet, and
10 feet tall) are a different matter altogether. They hop
around the battlefield, trying to swallow the nearest PCs.
They tend to use their Fan of Splinters ability whenever
they can get three or more characters in the blast.
6-FOOT AND 8-FOOT MATRYOSHKAS
CREATURE 8
Variant weak animated furnaces (see sidebar)
Initiative Perception +13
10-FOOT MATRYOSHKA
CREATURE 9
Variant animated furnace (see sidebar)
Initiative Perception +15
Development: Once the PCs have reduced the
matryoshkas to kindling, Volkya reappears and gushes
enthusiastically, proclaiming them to be amazing heroes
and expressing a deep-rooted wish to be just like them.
Unless the PCs make some effort to detach him, he proceeds
to follow them for the rest of the adventure—which means
that he can lead the PCs straight to the Grandfathers.
Chances are the PCs have a few questions for
Volkya. Use the following examples to determine how
he responds.
Who are you? “My name’s Volkya! What’s your name?”
What happened? “I just said that I wished these dolls
weren’t so boring,” the boy says, nudging a piece of wood
with a foot. “That was amazing. Can you do it again?”
Do you know anything about what’s going on? “It’s the
cursed tree,” the boy says with somber assurance.
What cursed tree? “So, there’s this pond just outside
the village. Just a month ago, poof, there was a giant tree
there, this big old birch, that wasn’t there before. So it’s
a cursed tree!”
The Grandfathers
The PCs must be guided by or receive directions from
Volkya to get to the pond. If the PCs manage to get
Volkya killed or otherwise don’t have his help, they can
also find the pond by canvassing the countryside for the
source of the curse for 1 day and succeeding at a DC 31
Nature or Survival check to track the fey down, but this
is likely both difficult and time-consuming.
As the PCs arrive, read or paraphrase the following.
A glistening pool stands in the middle of a tiny
clearing, the crystal-clear waters rimmed by
ice and frost. A few trees grow along the edge
of the pond, chief among them a tall, white-
barked birch tree. The burble of a spring fills
the air, probably coming from the cluster of
mossy rocks on the far side of the pond.
“Your turn,” a high, whispering voice
says, sounding like the susurrus of the
tree’s branches.
“I’m thinking, I’m thinking,” a gurgling sort of voice
answers—it might almost be the spring speaking.
Then they become clear. It’s like one of those magic pictures
where the eye suddenly realizes that the cluster of rocks and
the birch tree are two old men hunched over a deck of cards—
one tall and thin and with a beard of leaves, one short and
squat, surrounded in a small cloud of algae.
Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza are playing a simple card
game called durak (also known as fool). The PCs can
introduce themselves without any trouble, and if they
thought to bring a gift of some kind or if they call
the spirits “grandfather” or “uncle,” they gain a +1
circumstance bonus to their first Diplomacy or Deception
check against the fey.
The two spirits merrily welcome the PCs, and cheerfully
admit to putting the spell on Krasnoprudny—Ded
Bereza asks if the villagers are enjoying their newfound
fortune, and Ded Bolota grumps about ingratitude if the
PCs hint that it might not have been well received. The
fey also explain the logic behind the curse’s creation if
asked, relating the backstory from the beginning of the
adventure. At this stage, the PCs’ course of action is fairly
clear—they need to get Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza to
lift the curse.
MAGICAL MATRYOSHKAS
The matryoshkas function as variant animated
furnaces (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 18), with the 6-foot
and 8-foot matryoshkas also having the weak
adjustment. All three matryoshkas have the following
adjustments as well.
•	 Add the fey trait.
•	 The door attack is instead a body attack, and the
use of Improved Grab and Swallow Whole means
the matryoshka popped open and either caught the
character partly or wholly inside itself, respectively.
•	 The 6-foot and 8-foot matryoshkas are Medium, not
Huge, although they can Swallow Whole characters of
up to Medium size (popping open and then engulfing
a character). The 10-foot matryoshka is Large and can
Swallow Whole characters of up to Large size.
•	 Replace all fire damage the furnace deals to piercing
damage dealt by wooden splinters. Fan the Flames
thus becomes Fan of Splinters.

If the PCs try to explain the situation to the two fey
though, a problem arises. No matter how delicately or
diplomatically they make their case, Ded Bolota grumbles
that he can’t just go around lifting spells from villages for
no good reason. Its un-fey-like! People would talk! He
couldn’t look Ded Moroz (Grandfather Frost, a powerful
Irriseni fey of winter) in the face!
At this point, a clever PC might notice the cards, recall
what they were told earlier about fey loving games, and
suggest a bet or game instead. If no PC does so, either
prompt them with a DC 24 Nature check or have Ded
Bereza suggest it. A quick game, something with stakes. If
the PCs win, the curse is lifted. If the PCs lose, well... what
would they like to wager? The fey will accept a gift (any
permanent magic item of 9th level or higher will do), a
single character’s service for a year and a day, or any other
half-reasonable suggestion that the PCs might make.
ANTE UP!
When Ded Bolota and Ded Bereza
play their fey version of durak,
fey magic links the PCs to their
cards via their own wits and
skills. The fey play with four
unusual suits, each of which
allows for different skills. To
win, the PCs must each take turns
selecting a suit to try to score Victory
Points using the Play the Fool activity.
The DC for the skill checks is initially
24, but for each Victory Point the PCs
gain using a given suit, the DC increases
by 2, as the fey’s hands grow more formidable
in that suit, to a maximum of DC 30 after gaining 3
Victory Points from that suit. If the PCs succeed at the
DC 30 check (or critically succeed at a DC 28 check),
they’ve exhausted that suit entirely. The PCs win if they
gain 8 Victory Points before the fey do.
Alternatively, if your group would enjoy it, you can
break out a deck of cards and resolve things in person
by playing durak in real life. In durak, it’s best to have
relatively even teams, so the GM takes the role of
Ded Bolota, one player becomes Ded Bereza, and the
remaining players are themselves.
Some PCs may attempt to use skills, spells, or other
abilities to give them an edge in the game or even outright
cheat. You can reward clever use of a character’s abilities
by giving that PC or one of their allies a +1 or +2 bonus to
their check, especially if they expend resources such as spell
slots or items to do so; however, the grandfathers have seen
most tricks in the book, and while they appreciate a bit
of creative flair, they grow annoyed at excessive cheating.
Generally, a PC should get a bonus in this way only once; if
they attempt it a second time, one of the two says, “I really
wish you’d cut that out,” and the wish-granting curse
renders further attempts to bend the odds futile.
PLAY THE FOOL
EXPLORATION
MANIPULATE
You play a card in the mystical
game of fey fool with Ded Bolota
and Ded Bereza, empowering
your attack with your own
skills, based on the suit you selected.
Choose the suit of spring, summer,
fall, or winter. For spring, attempt an
Acrobatics, Nature, or Performance
check. For summer, attempt an
Arcana, Diplomacy, or Society check.
For fall, attempt an Athletics, Deception,
or Religion check. For winter, attempt an
Intimidation, Occultism, or Survival check. The
outcome depends on your check result.
If a PC has Games Lore or a similar type of Lore skill, they
can roll this skill check instead of the required one; if they do
so, the DC is 5 lower. Only one PC can roll Games Lore in this
way during the competition, and they can do so only once.
Critical Success You gain 2 Victory Points.
Success You gain 1 Victory Point.
Failure The fey gain 1 Victory Point.
Critical Failure The fey gain 2 Victory Points.
Conclusion
If the PCs manage to get Ded Bolota to lift the curse,
all supernatural effects are instantly reversed, and the
PCs are hailed as heroes when they return to town. The
village isn’t able to offer them any more rewards, but
the PCs are stuffed with as much food as they can eat
(though it’s probably mostly buckwheat porridge).
If the PCs are unsuccessful, then in the course of
the following weeks and months, Krasnoprudny is
gradually abandoned, as the villagers decide to leave
before someone is killed. They take what they can with
them, but they are nevertheless leaving their homes and
their fields behind. The fey take years to realize what
they did wrong.
FEARSOME FEY
Some PCs might consider fighting the fey, but
succeeding at a DC 21 Nature check confirms that
this would likely end in the PCs’ death. The two fey
are very powerful, and in their realm would likely
grind the PCs into the snow if provoked. In the event
that the PCs nevertheless decide to attack, use
the stats for a rusalka for Ded Bolota (Pathfinder
Bestiary 2 229) and an arboreal archive with the
fey trait for Ded Bereza (Bestiary 3 21) with suitable
cosmetic alterations. This is even more difficult than
an extreme encounter, but it’s distantly possible
that an incredibly lucky and skillful team of PCs
might win. While the fey meant no harm, killing
them also ends the curse.

Land of Second Souls
Incident Location: Raven’s Call, Tomalán, Arcadia
Incident Type: Ouroboros
Reporting Archivist: Julien Imkaros
I left Xopatl and traveled south for some time, eventually
reaching the nation of Tomala'n. The border town of Raven’s
Call seemed like any other Arcadian town I have seen:
the people were kind, the architecture
practical, oddly comforting in its
familiarity. It was only when I spoke
with the locals I truly understood the reason for
your request.
I asked a local woman walking with a young boy
about the town. Yulana and Idelgo answered graciously,
each sharing information in equal parts.
My questions ventured into the history of
Raven’s Call, and Yulana
stated her grandfather
could better answer. I
expected to follow her to
find the elder, but the
young boy began to speak.
His words were eloquent
and there was wisdom
behind his eyes. I was
startled—almost terrified!—thinking
the man was cursed to live his final days as a child. My
shock and confusion must have been apparent, as the two
quickly apologized and explained the situation.
Idelgo was indeed Yulana’s grandfather. He passed
away over two decades ago. Idelgo explained he was born
again from the Tree of Rebirth in central Tomala'n. A
kind family cared for him until he was able to speak
and requested to be brought back to Raven’s Call. The
newly young Idelgo was reunited with Yulana about six
years ago.
The two kindly shared more information about the
southern reaches of Arcadia and their unique relationship
with the afterlife. Everyone who dies has a second
chance, not unlike the lives samsarans lead. Rather
than an endless wheel of reincarnation, however, the people
of these lands have only the one extra opportunity. Once
someone dies a second time, they seem to move on as
anyone else would.
It’s not as simple as waking up and continuing on. The
Tree of Rebirth constantly drips blood from its flowers,
which locals collect in large containers. After some time,
an infant swims to a vat’s surface, crying for assistance.
This is how Idelgo was born again. Local families and
orphanages raise these children until they’re old enough to
recount their past life. The locals then reunite the children
with their families or help them set up new lives elsewhere
if they prefer.
This is just one way to be reborn here. Sometimes one
returns as a ghost with all their faculties, fading
away some decades later. Other times,
a person wakes up and continues
their life, reaching ages in the
hundreds or even thousands
of years. After she died,
Idelgo’s wife simply walked
into the village one day, already a
young woman. There seems to be
no exact science or pattern for
these rebirths.
I considered the possibility
that the region is blasphemous, but
I’ve been told psychopomps frequent the
area, keeping an eye on things, as if Pharasma is
maintaining death here. So far, the psychopomps
have done nothing to alter the rebirth cycle here, so
I must assume the Lady of Graves has no misgivings
with the situation.
This is what I’ve learned so far. I will continue to explore
more of the region and send additional reports. While I’m
upset at your contacting me, I have to admit you were
right. This region is definitely worth investigating further.
REBORN SOUL
BACKGROUND
RARE
You were given a second opportunity at life by mysterious
forces in the Lands of Second Souls. You remember your
life before your death and now live with an extra lifetime
of knowledge.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You become trained in two Lore skills, which you and your
GM choose from Lore skills associated with your past life. At
3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you receive skill increases,
which you can apply only to these Lore skills. In certain
situations analogous to your past life, fragments of memories
resurface, potentially helping or distracting you. The GM can
offer you a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks with either
of these Lore skills or on other skill checks that echo your past
life. If you accept but fail the check, you’re stupefied 1 for 1
minute by the mental distraction of your past-life memories,
or stupefied 2 for 1 minute on a critical failure.

The Sacral King
Incident Location: Tower of the Forgotten and
surrounding districts, Goka, Tian Xia
Incident Type: Keystone
Reporting Archivist: Krayne
I hate you. I want you to know this, because it took me three
months of trekking over every wretched swamp in Wanshou to
confirm your theory.
Moving on. I went to Goka to recuperate and I heard of
a strange little detail that seems up your alley. There’s an
old man wandering around the Oldport District, a beggar
who claims to be the reincarnation of the Eternal Emperor
of Lung Wa. So what, you’re asking? Well, he’s got half the
district convinced he might be right, or at least going along
with the joke and humoring him. His name is Hao Qian, and
no one seems to know where he came from. About 12 years
ago, Qian stood in front of the temple and announced he was
the reincarnation of the Eternal Emperor, that he’d hidden
his past too long, and henceforth he would conduct the sacred
rites with the dignity due to an emperor.
Lots of people laughed, but ever since, Qian’s been doing
exactly that. These days, he does tours of the temples to perform
the proper rites and sacrifices, he holds audiences with anyone
who wants to see him, and he periodically issues proclamations
or decrees—I think his last one was to declare an embargo on
Po Lian goods until they acknowledge his sovereignty.
I went to see him, and I’ve got to say, the man’s convincing.
He speaks with a perfect court accent, the kind you don’t hear
often, and he’s got a grasp on imperial etiquette that suggests
at the very least he knew somebody at court. Some local tailor
made a set of (cheap) imperial robes for him, and Qian’s
talked a printer into making some “official”Lung Wa paper
currency, which Qian will sign in exchange for actual money.
Part of me thinks Qian has stumbled onto the perfect
scam, but he’s the most ungodly difficult person to snoop on I
have ever met. When I initially tried, I nearly got run over by
a wagon on three separate occasions. Second time, I went over
the rooftops, stepped on a rotten board, and broke my ankle.
Third time, I nearly got hit by a gods-cursed lightning bolt!
I never saw him do anything but I got a definite impression
that continuing to shadow Qian would be bad for my health—
it was like the streets themselves were looking out for him.
Maybe it’s a scam and Qian just also happens to be a
sorcerer, or I just got really unlucky. Maybe there’s something
more here, some connection between the ceremonies Qian
conducts and the areas of the city he frequents—maybe
even the whole territory of what used to be Lung
Wa. After all, millions of people worshipped the
Eternal Emperor for several centuries, and now,
no emperor. Where does all that power go?

CHAMPION
ORACLE
Prerequisites trained in Occultism or Religion
By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed
rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small
section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its
borders, you can cast detect magic, guidance, and sigil as innate
divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Make
an Impression on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey,
monitor, or spirit traits.
Special You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror
themselves on the other—if you’re depressed, gray rain and
clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate
mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems
afflicting the land.

This forces us to question the very nature of time itself:
does it operate consistently with anomalous exceptions, or
does it instead have a variable multiplicity—and if so, what
determines the flow of time? Does time flow at all, or is it
simply an illusion created by our own inability to process
information nonlinearly? Every uniform theory of time has
proven to be lacking.
Magic interacts strangely with the timestream. With
considerable power, it’s possible to manipulate time
to a certain extent, but never enough to fully explain
the range of observed phenomena, nor the variability.
Unfortunately, we’re at a loss, as our ability to gather
data is limited to what we can find by interacting with
and investigating areas where time goes wrong, so-called
“anomalies.” As experiments go, they’re nearly impossible
to recreate. Is each phenomenon we’ve documented some
sort of unique cosmic glitch or micro-fracture?
Take, for instance, Crystilan. An arcane dome wrapped
around the city of Xin-Edasseril with its inhabitants
frozen in time for millennia, caused by malfunctions in the
process of creating a runewell. The Society takes issue with
any attempts to recreate this phenomenon, citing concerns
about the power of runewells, despite its foremost
potential to provide crucial insight into a fundamental
mystery surrounding the fabric of our reality. Typical.
Stranger still are the temporal phenomena in motion. To
stop time is one thing, difficult but not nearly impossible.
To see it move, repeat, and change is another. And how
does any of this interact with the poorly understood
Dimension of Time?
TWISTS IN THE
ENDLESS RIVER
Time loops, causal paradoxes,
and other temporal anomalies
Of all the phenomena we’ve studied over the years, none cause so much headache as
Golarion’s myriad temporal anomalies. Each operates under its own rules, forcing
us to discern the nature of each individually, and often under dangerous conditions.
The fact that temporal anomalies can manifest their effects before they’ve even occurred, in direct defiance of
our common understanding of causality, further cements their status as one of the Archive’s most troublesome
sources of incidents.

MOMENTS IN AMBER
Time stops are, blissfully, rather straightforward to
understand compared to other temporal phenomena.
Any anomaly that deals with stopping time takes affected
areas out of play, so to speak—that is, briefly removed
entirely from reality. Stuck. Those in stopped time can’t
affect anything outside their own person and vice versa.
For instance, the Cryo Lake Incident, constituting a large
body of water in the Crown of the World. Though still
liquid, the lake remains eternally frozen in time with
remarkably clear water providing a near-unmarred view
straight down to the bottom, well over 100 feet down.
Possibly 200. The most chilling aspect is the presence
of creatures frozen within, unidentifiable and entirely
unique. While freezing may preserve the bodies of
deceased creatures, it’s undoubtedly clear those trapped
in the lake are alive, albeit unable to move. Attempts to
carve into the lake to test the ice proved impractical—
like Crystilan and most similar phenomena, moving
the object out of the time stream renders it impervious
to interference.
The so-called Gray Mannequin bears some similarities.
They have the appearance of an elven wizard, clad in
ceremonial robes, forever removed from the strings of
fate, perfectly preserved against the ravages of time. Were
we to hazard a guess as to their condition, it would likely
be an incident involving a powerful magical spell gone
awry. Anything so powerful can malfunction. Perhaps
a use of time-stopping magic, interacting strangely
with an unrelated fluctuation in magical energy. Or an
experiment. It is unknown whether they can perceive or
process information or dream.
The Gray Mannequin has gone through some... let’s
say, turbulent processing. Questions about whether
to attempt to resuscitate the individual were stymied
by their unknown origins and hazards present in the
resuscitation process. Though the Archive’s duty was to
retrieve and store them (having first been noticed as a
museum exhibit), even errant members of the Society
who caught wind of the case seemed hesitant about
unleashing a potentially powerful spellcaster with
unknown motives into the world. We were given the go-
ahead to study the individual while the Society quibbled
about what to do.
DOORS IN TIME
We’ve documented plenty of reports from around the
world about “time doors,” entrances to another time,
whether it be two days ago, an eon ago, or, rarely, even
the future, as with the Luminous Archway. Most turn
out to be hoaxes of some kind, or at least impossible
to verify one way or another—anyone who enters the
door vanishes and never returns, leaving it impossible
to determine whether they reappeared in another
timeline, were annihilated by temporal guardians,
or simply went somewhere else. I still remember the
unearthly nature of those lacerations. It’s our working
assumption that functioning time doors have to do
with the folding of reality, like a hot needle piercing
layered cloth, as I understand it. Strikingly similar to
the various dimensional entryways to other planes, but
on the temporal axis, rather than locational. How does
this affect our present? Is it predetermined, or do we
simply experience the resulting outcomes? It’s difficult
to justify when we have no methods of retrieval; we lost
Archivist Galan to what we believed to be a time door in
Caliphas. He wandered right in. No traces.
Objects such as the Orichalcum Sparrow suggest
travel through such doors may cause some permanent
alteration to the existential makeup of the subject. Due
to the nature of its construction, it’s unclear whether it
represents pre‑Earthfall construction or is rather from
a point in our future. While the nature of time doors is
of great interest to us, it’s impossible to proceed with
gainful research until we’ve devised more robust testing
parameters, though this limitation doesn’t stop some of
the more enthusiastic archivists from throwing stones
through the doors when they think no one’s looking.
FUTURE FLASHBACKS / MENTAL TRAVEL
Many who experience temporal anomalies come away
with lasting conditions, likely due to our minds coping
with the lingering paradox of experiencing multiple
divergent realities, but just as possibly some portion of
our soul’s essence becoming changed, much in the way
that interacting with powerful magic can alter our very
beings. Quite intriguing. The most common manifestation
of this phenomenon are future flashbacks, vivid memories
of events not yet experienced. These mental flashbacks
can take many forms, and, ironically, many are actually
visions of potential future events.
Archivist Vyi, who became an archivist after being
at the center of the Double Trouble Incident, is our
exemplary case study. Frustratingly, the inconsistency
of these visions makes rigorous examination difficult.
Sometimes they’re of past events that she nevertheless
didn’t experience, while others are predictions for the
future. The real trouble’s that mental flashbacks that
depict possible future events rarely abide by the same
rules, a pattern for these sorts of anomalies. Attempts
to change the future depicted in these visions vary, with
some outcomes being avoided, and, in some, our very
meddling caused them to come to fruition. However,
it’s useful to note that should nothing be done, these
flashbacks often occur as envisioned, and evidence from
before 4606 suggests that all such cases before the Age
of Lost Omens—if the visions weren’t a hoax in the first
place—always came to pass without outside action.
LOOPS AND REPETITION
Archivist Laufent and I were sent to investigate a
case she charmingly named “Tomorrow is Fireday.”

The anomaly in question involved a town trapped in
a self-stabilizing time loop that caused
every day to be the day before
Fireday. It wasn’t simply that
we repeated every day,
nor that every day was
Oathday, but more like
a determinate amount
of
time
disappeared
regularly to cause this
phenomenon—a
very
different circumstance
from the Near-Midnight
Incident. The temporality
of the town was vastly offset
from the rest of the world, and,
much like Xin-Edasseril, the town
housed valuable historical information, of
which Archivist Laufent gladly dedicated herself
to documenting.
Further investigation into the origin led
to the discovery of a small timepiece of
indeterminate design. It initially appeared
to have been crafted in Imperial Shu, but it
bears unmistakably Thassilonian engravings. The
disappearing time appears to have been used to continue
the operation of the object, almost like an energy
source. Once removed from its pedestal, of a much
older design—possibly even dating back to the Shory
Empire—a sputtering sound occurred for about half a
minute. The loop then ceased to function.
Field testing of the timepiece revealed that depressing
one of the buttons would “consume” time in a small
area, logically following from the circumstances of the
village. Were it not for the weeks we had been missing
with no contact, we would’ve tested it more extensively.
The object was sealed in the vault for further study,
while other archivists were sent to monitor and research
the pedestal, which was stored separately under three
layers of wards.
As far as time loops are concerned, none is more
representative than the Near-Midnight Incident. An
approximately 12-minute closed time loop spontaneously
began in Absalom, localized somewhere near the Grand
Lodge, culminating in an explosion that marked the
recursion point of the loop. Fortunately, the vaults
seemed to be at the edge of the included radius, allowing
archivists to observe and eventually neutralize the
phenomenon, with some difficulty, as memories did not
carry over between loops. Luckily, exposure to previous
temporal anomalies (of any type) seemed effective in
priming the body to sense the seams; most experienced
archivists realized a loop was happening, even if they
couldn’t remember what happened. Some experienced
echoes, specifically Archivist Vyi, who has always been
sensitive to visions.
The event was that a small idol, being carried through
Absalom after being identified, was carelessly dropped,
causing an emergency self-preservation function to
activate. Archivists in the vaults recognized
the situation, deduced the center
of the incident, and hastily
convinced a Society member
upstairs to run full-sprint,
catching the object a
mere split second before
it shattered upon the
ground. While difficult to
ascertain the exact number
of loops we experienced,
the ringing headache I was left
with after the incident suggests it was
decidedly more than a handful.
Outstanding File: The Deathless Case
Time loops are frustrating in that their
manifestations rarely abide by the same
rules, true for most classes of temporal
anomalies, but abnormally true for loops
specifically. There has long been a strange
rumor in Quain that I knew, I just knew, could not be
false, which concerns a town in the Wall of Heaven.
We set out through the mountains, which swayed like
reeds in the mist. There was no path to follow. Just the
persistent feeling of being led somewhere. The nature
of being an archivist means we follow every childhood
inclination to believe in outrageous stories—fairy tales
often have more than a modicum of truth behind them.
The temple we found was truly a sight, jutting
proudly from the stone. As if expecting us, a contingent
of monks guided us through the doors. They led us into
a palace-sized complex with designs coming straight
from the Yixing Imperial Era, centered around a strange
persimmon tree that seemed to exist in multiple times at
once, a fact which, though we could see it with our own
eyes, was difficult to swallow nonetheless.
Quite a few of our questions went unanswered, but
we were able to discern the primary mechanic of this
phenomenon: those who lived here could not die. Upon
passing, naturally or otherwise, the inhabitants of this
temple would invariably revert to the form of a newborn
infant, born again with no memory of their previous
life. Complete blank slate. The adults and elders seemed
to eat no food at all, subsisting entirely off of the latent
energy in the air, but a humble vegetable garden and a
handful of goats were kept to provide sustenance for
the recently “born.” It’s our working theory that these
individuals have internalized time loops that cause this
rebirth, though it’s entirely possible that the temple itself
is a loop site. Testing proves difficult, as not a single
member of the temple wished to leave. Case recorded
and shelved for followup.

AWAKEN ENTROPY
SPELL 6
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1
minute
All things age, all things die, and at the end of days even the
universe will grow quiet and still. You awaken the cosmic
principle of entropy, accelerating time in an area—flesh
falters, plants shrivel, and even stone begins to crumble.
Any creature that enters or begins its turn in the area must
succeed at a basic Fortitude save or take 8d6 negative
damage, or 8d6 force damage if the creature normally
doesn’t take negative damage, such as if the creature is
a construct or undead. Even beings such as fiends with
unlimited lifespans can be worn away by entropy.
The first time you Sustain the Spell on each subsequent
turn, the entropic zone grows stronger in addition to having
its duration increased. The radius of the burst increases by
10 feet (to a maximum of 40 feet), and the size of the damage
dice increases by one step (from d6 to d8, then to d10, and
finally to d12).
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.

SPELL 3
DIVINATION
INCAPACITATION
PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 round
You behold the many timelines that weave around a creature,
and in so doing, you make one more likely to occur. The
target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success You can make neither heads nor tails of the
target’s timeline, and the target is unaffected.
Success The target must commit to a single action that it
will take at some point during its next turn: “Stride toward
Valeros,” “Cast shield,” “Strike at Amiri with my jaws.” That
action is now locked in, and the creature must attempt it,
even if the situation has changed—if the creature stated
that it would Strike at Amiri with its jaws, it must try to do
so. If the creature is entirely unable to fulfill the action it
committed to—for instance, if it had only 1 action left and
Amiri was out of the range of its jaws Strike—it loses the
last action of its turn as it reels in a temporal paradox. The
creature can choose to lock in a 2- or 3-action activity if
it prefers to do so, but if it does, it loses all the associated
actions if it can’t perform the activity on its turn. If the

situation changes oddly (perhaps the creature is forcibly
teleported away and has no idea which direction is “toward
Valeros” any longer), the GM determines what happens.
Failure As success, but the creature must commit at least
two of its actions for the next turn—“I will Stride toward
Valeros and then Strike with my claws.” All of these
actions are similarly locked in and can’t be changed, but
the creature can take them in any order.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature must commit all
of its actions for the next turn.
Heightened (7th) Instead of affecting a single target, the
spell affects all enemies within a 30-foot emanation.
LOOSE TIME’S ARROW
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 6 creatures
Duration until the end of your next turn
You pluck the time stream like a bow—pull one string back,
release, and watch a creature fly. All affected targets are
quickened. They can use the extra action only to Step or Stride.
MORASS OF AGES
SPELL 4
AURA
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 5-foot emanation
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You surround yourself in temporal eddies that draw out time
for those around you, making every step feel like an eternity
endured. A creature in the emanation, or that later enters
the emanation, must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature
makes this save only once and uses the same effect for the
duration of the spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you
can choose to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet, to a
maximum of 60 feet.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the
creature.
Failure Squares in the emanation are difficult terrain for the
creature, and the creature is slowed 1 when it starts its
turn in the emanation.
Critical Failure As failure, plus the creature also becomes
restrained. The creature can attempt to Escape against
your spell DC to remove the restrained condition.
QUICKEN TIME
SPELL 5
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You speed up the time stream in an area, stretching and
pulling it until time flows swift and wild. Any creature that
begins its turn in the area is quickened and can use the extra
action each round to Stride or Strike. Unfortunately, speeding
up time is much more difficult than slowing it down, and the
effect is uneven and jittery, making accuracy between times
painfully difficult; creatures inside the area are concealed to
those outside it, and vice versa.
STAGNATE TIME
SPELL 5
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You examine the time stream in a particular area, then
proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening
and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like
a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the
area must attempt a Will save.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is slowed 1 this turn.
Critical Failure The creature is slowed 2 this turn.
SUMMON IRII
SPELL 8
RARE
CONJURATION
INCARNATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 100 feet
Duration until the end of your next turn
You cast your spell, whisper your words of power, and find
that an irii is already here—indeed, they have always been
here, and always were, and always will be. The temporal being
occupies the space of a Medium creature and has a Speed of
60 feet and a fly Speed of 60 feet. When you Cast this Spell,
choose whether it summons a fate irii or a fortune irii.
•	 Fate The fate stands before you with its stained-glass
wings and animal-headed gaze, floating eyes circling
about it; Arrive (divination, fortune, lawful, prediction)
Decree the Immutability of Time While within 30 feet of
the fate, you and your allies who roll below 10 on a d20
for an attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill
check get a 10 instead; Depart (divination, misfortune,
prediction) Observe the Inevitability of Destiny Each
enemy within a 30-foot emanation must attempt a Will
save. If a creature fails its save, until the end of its next
turn, any time it rolls above 10 on a d20 for an attack
IRIIS
These denizens of the Dimension of Time are
powerful guardians who ward the timeline against
outside meddling, even as they war with each
other over their divergent philosophies of time. An
irii can be either a fate, with the view that time is
immutable, or a fortune, with the opinion that time
is fluid. Among practitioners of temporal magic,
iriis are famed for their ability to see consequences
before they occur, sidestepping them at their leisure.

SUSPENDED RETRIBUTION
SPELL 6
CURSE
DIVINATION
MENTAL
PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw basic Reflex; Duration 1 minute
All life dances one step from the precipice, one heartbeat
from disaster. You open your eyes wide and see doom
waiting in the wings, then invite it to step forward. A
spectral omen of disaster appears above the target’s head—
traditionally, this is a downward-pointing sword, but some
spellcasters report seeing a hangman’s noose or a grinning
skull instead. When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the
following triggers.
•	 The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.
•	 The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.
•	 The target Casts a Spell.
•	 The target uses a specific skill you name.
•	 The target uses a specific ability you name.
If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of
doom activates—the sword strikes down, the noose loops
around the target’s neck, the skull bares its fangs—and the
target takes 70 mental damage with a basic Reflex save. The
target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen
and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions,
which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against
doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not
be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the
spell ends.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 10.
TEMPORAL TWIN
SPELL 3
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets one willing ally
Duration until the end of your next turn
You pull a fleeting duplicate of your ally from the recent past.
The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice
within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the
target took since the end of your last turn, such as making
a Strike or Interacting to pull a lever. Because the other
basic single actions don’t produce much of a result on their
own, this is typically used for Strike and Interact, though
occasionally it could be useful to have a temporal twin Stride
through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard.
The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate,
makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such
as choosing a target for a Strike and making the attack roll.
If the ally doesn’t have a reaction to spend, temporal twin
fails. Use the duplicate’s location for determining flanking,
cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering
what your ally did, and if you don’t remember the details, the
GM might not allow you to cast temporal twin.
This action can’t be used for anything but a basic single
action (Core Rulebook 469), nor can it use limited resources.
The action can have a different target than the original action
but must be very similar in form. For example, if the original
action were to Interact to pull a lever, the time duplicate
could pull a different lever, but couldn’t turn a doorknob or
pick up an item from a table.
Being pulled through time to create a twin destabilizes
the target’s timeline. Once an ally has been the target of
temporal twin, they’re temporarily immune for 1 day.
TIME POCKET
SPELL 3
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets one item of 1 Bulk or less that a willing
creature is holding
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You fling the target item forward in time and link it to the
future of the creature holding it. The item disappears. When
the spell ends, the item reappears with the creature that
was holding it when you Cast the Spell. If the creature has
enough hands free to hold the item, it appears in their hands.
Otherwise, it falls to the ground in the creature’s space.
You can Dismiss the spell, and it automatically ends if you’re
reduced to 0 Hit Points or cast time pocket again.
TIME SENSE
CANTRIP 1
DIVINATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [one-action] verbal
When you Cast the Spell, you gain a perfect sense of time. You
can learn exactly what time it is, down to the second. You can
instead choose to gain a perfect sense of the calendar if you
have knowledge in that area—if you’re trained in Nature, you
can learn exactly how long it is until sunrise and how many
days until the next solstice. If you’re trained in Astronomy
Lore, you can learn precisely when any known predictable
astronomical conjunction will begin and end, and so on.
You can gain a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception
check, saving throw, or skill check you take on the same turn
you cast time sense that requires extremely precise timing. If
you choose to gain this bonus, you can’t gain it again for 1 hour.

Time Mage (Archetype)
Magic leaves its brand on those who practice it. The
veteran pyromancer bears the scorch marks of lessons
learned. The archdruid grows to resemble plants or
animals in their domain or grove. The professional
reanimator can never quite cover up the stench of their
grim work.
The mark left by the practice of time magic is less
obvious but no less indelible. With other disciplines, the
marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned,
creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of
power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers
no such limitations of cause and effect. Distortions and
anachronistic thoughts echo back throughout a time
mage’s entire life, providing a nonlinear perspective that
others can find distracting or even alien. The threat of
creating a paradox is ever looming. Many a reckless time
mage has inadvertently erased themselves from existence,
glimpsed a future they now have no choice but to enact, or
attracted the attentions of temporal creatures, such as iriis
or siktemporas.
For these reasons, most mages merely dabble in time
magic, learning a spell or two here and there. Despite
the dangers, a brave few embrace the discipline, for it
offers the allure of changing what was and controlling
what will be.

TIME MAGE DEDICATION
FEAT 6
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites You have a spellcasting class feature.
You might be a novice in the temporal arts now, but in
the future, you’ll hold time in the palm of your hand.
As some of your future knowledge leaks back
to your present self, you gain the delay
consequence domain spell (Pathfinder Lost
Omens Gods & Magic 118). It costs 1 Focus Point
to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool
of 1 Focus Point that you can recover by using the
Refocus activity to revisit moments from your past and
contemplate futures yet to come. If you already knew
delay consequence from a feat or ability that allows you to
gain your choice of domain spell, such as Domain Initiate,
then when you take this feat, you can retrain that option
to gain a different domain spell instead as your personal
timeline rearranges itself. You also gain time sense (page
183) as an innate cantrip usable at will. This innate spell
and your focus spells from the time mage archetype are
of the same tradition as the spells you used to meet the
archetype’s prerequisites.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the time mage archetype.

FEAT 7
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication, master in Perception
The flows and ebbs of time are obvious to you, as are the
tangles that form when it’s distorted. You’re automatically
aware if any creature that you observe is under the effects
of the slowed or quickened conditions. You have a general
idea when you’re in the vicinity of time-manipulating
phenomena, though this grants you no particular insight
into the specific effects of the anomaly. Particularly subtle
temporal anomalies might still escape your notice, requiring
a Perception check, as determined by the GM. If you’re
legendary in Arcana, Nature, or Occultism, or Religion,

haste, loose time’s arrow (page 182), quicken time (page 182),
slow, and stagnate time (page 182) to your spell list. You
can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren’t
normally on your tradition’s spell list.
WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN [free-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication
Rather than conjuring creatures from elsewhere in the
world or the planes, you can temporarily pull a much
different version of yourself from an alternate timeline—for
instance, instead of summoning a generic or random troll
with summon giant, you summon a troll version of yourself
from a timeline where you’re a troll. If your next action is
to Cast a Spell that summons a creature, that creature is
another version of you. This creature remains the type of
creature you summoned and has largely the same abilities
(plus the following adjustments), but it clearly resembles
you, likely sharing some distinguishing features, such as
mannerisms, speech patterns, tattoos, or clothing. The
summoned creature gains a +1 status bonus to any skill
check in which you’re trained, a +2 status bonus if you’re an
expert, a +3 status bonus if you’re a master, or a +4 status
bonus if you’re legendary. The creature also takes a –2
penalty to all skills in which you’re untrained.
INTO THE FUTURE [one-action]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication
You know your spell will be needed not now but in a few
moments, so you cast your magic into the future. If your
next action is to Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to
cast, the spell’s effects occur 1 round later, at the beginning
of your next turn, rather than immediately. Targets and
choices about the spell must be determined when the spell
is cast, and requirements, such as line of sight and line of
effect, must be valid both when the spell is cast and when
its effects occur. Consequences for the action of Casting
the Spell itself, such as an Attack of Opportunity reaction
or ending a foe’s fascinated condition by taking a hostile
action, aren’t delayed.
PURGE OF MOMENTS [three-actions]
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication
Frequency once per hour
All things eventually end, a truth that you can put into
practice by accelerating your passage through time to shake
off harmful effects. Five rounds of apparent time occur for
you. No one, including you, can act during this time, but
effects on you run their course, including beneficial effects,
negative effects, afflictions, conditions, and persistent
damage. Roll saving throws, flat checks, damage, and any
other rolls for those effects normally as if the time had
passed. Excessive use of this technique is responsible for
more than a few premature gray hairs among time mages.
TIMELINE-SPLITTING SPELL [three-actions]
FEAT 18
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
DIVINATION
MANIPULATE METAMAGIC
Prerequisites Time Mage Dedication
Frequency once per day
You invest in two futures, then choose the one to make a
reality. You Cast two Spells that each take 1 or 2 actions
to cast. These can’t be the same spell heightened to two
different levels. You expend the resources for both spells,
such as spell slots, Focus Points, and material components.
Determine the immediate results for both spells, including
attack rolls, saving throws, damage, and any other dice rolls.
Then, choose which of the two spells takes effect, using the
previously made rolls. The other spell’s resources are still
expended, but the spell has no effect as the magic disappears
the other timeline.
TIME MAGE FOCUS SPELL
PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE
FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
Cast [one-action] verbal
You trace several possible routes, quickly resetting the
timeline until you find the safest one. Choose three spaces
you could reach with two Stride actions. Each must be at
least 20 feet from the other two. You Stride twice to one
of the spaces, determined randomly by the GM from among
the paths you chose. If some of the paths contain a hidden
danger, such as a trap that you would trigger by walking
into the trap’s affected area, the GM doesn’t consider this
path when randomly determining which one you take,
but if all options have a hidden danger, the GM randomly
chooses between all three paths. This movement doesn’t
trigger reactions.

Chronoskimmer
(Archetype)
The flow of time is an unstoppable force. Most are
carried downstream inexorably, like a leaf floating on a
river. You, however, somehow fell out of the flow of time,
if only for an instant, but in doing so gained a perspective
that few others have.
Now you stand on the banks of the river, watching
the flow, choosing where to dive in, or even defying the
current, at least for a short while, as you skim its surface
and skip from moment to moment. As a chronoskimmer,
time is yours to exploit.
You have the means to see the timelines of all creatures,
including your own. You can use this insight to manipulate
the flow of time for creatures, much like you can pluck the
leaf from the river and place it elsewhere. Manipulating
timelines can be dangerous, however, and the Dimension
of Time isn’t wont to allow these transgressions against
time to stand forever. The threat always looms of time
dimensionals coming to correct your actions or of you
becoming removed from time forever.
CHRONOSKIMMER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
RARE
ARCHETYPE
You became partially unstuck from time and have learned
how to manipulate your place in flow of time. When you
roll initiative, you can choose one of three options: either do
nothing and roll initiative normally, stabilize your timestream,
or destabilize your timestream and send it into intense
fluctuations. If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you
don’t roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10
+ your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your
timestream, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a success, your
initiative is equal to 19 + your initiative modifier, and on a
failure, your initiative is equal to 1 + your initiative modifier.
Both stabilizing and destabilizing your timestream are
fortune effects.
Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with an
opponent’s initiative roll, you go first. Your manipulation of
time grants you access to a number of abilities, some of which
require a saving throw. The DC for these abilities is either your
class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, and is called your
chronoskimmer DC.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you’ve
gained two other feats from the chronoskimmer archetype.
TURN BACK THE CLOCK [reaction]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail a skill check or saving throw.
After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal
timeline so you can try again. You reroll the triggering check
with a +1 circumstance bonus as you apply your experience
from your last attempt. You must use the new result, even if
it’s worse than your first roll.
GUIDE THE TIMELINE [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline
to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you
choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally
makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take
the higher result; this is a fortune effect. If you choose a foe,
the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack
roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result
unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer
DC; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of your choice, the
target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
REVERSING CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
You dive into the fray before rewinding yourself to safety.
Stride up to your Speed. If you end your movement within
melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee
Strike against that enemy. You then teleport back to the
square from which you began your Snapback Charge. You can
use Reversing Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or
Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.
SUPERIMPOSE TIME DUPLICATES [one-action]
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You call alternate versions of yourself, either from a different
timeline or perhaps yourself from a different point in your
current timeline, to aid you in combat. Until the start of your
next turn, these alternate selves flicker in and out in your
vicinity, providing flanking for you against all enemies within
your reach. Flanking with your time duplicates is the same as
flanking with an ally and so is subject to effects like all-around
vision or the deny advantage class feature.
BORROW TIME [free-action]
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per minute
Trigger Your turn begins.
You reach ahead and make use of time that’s yet to be. You
become quickened and can use the extra action to Step, Stride,
or Strike. You gain this extra action immediately and can use
it this turn. At the end of your turn, you become stunned 1.
STEAL TIME [two-actions]
FEAT 10

COMBAT PREMONITION
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
By narrowing your sense of the future, you can improve that
of your allies. When you roll initiative, instead of stabilizing or
destabilizing your own timestream, you can grant your allies a
flash of insight into their future. Choose two allies. Those allies
roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is
a fortune effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the
worse result; this is a misfortune effect. The two effects are
tied together: if you would avoid the misfortune effect
for any reason, or if any of your allies would negate
their fortune effect, your Combat Premonition
does nothing.
ESCAPE TIMELINE [free-action]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per day
Trigger Your turn begins.
You step outside of the flow of time
momentarily,
allowing
you
to
avoid
dangers. Your physical form stops existing
momentarily, and you can’t be targeted or
affected until the start of your next turn—
you simply don’t exist at that moment in
time. Your turn ends immediately, advancing
1 round for all timed durations and effects,
such as conditions and afflictions. You still attempt
saving throws, flat checks, or any other checks at
the end of your turn as normal, but you don’t take
any damage due to these checks (though you take
any non-damaging effects as normal). At the start
of your next turn, you reenter the flow of time and
reappear in the same space where you left time
last round. If the space isn’t clear, you arrive in the
nearest open space.
SPACE-TIME SHIFT [free-action]
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Chronoskimmer Dedication
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger Your turn begins.
You travel just a few moments into the future to
immediately arrive at your destination. Your Strides
are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing
you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach
with your Stride instead of traversing normally to
the location. Your augmented Strides have the
teleport trait and don’t trigger reactions
that can be triggered by move actions or
upon leaving or entering a square. You also
augment your Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim actions in this way
if you have the corresponding movement type.
RESET THE PAST [free-action]
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Frequency once per day
You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal
techniques—by revising your past so you never used it in the
first place. Select one of your chronoskimmer feats that has
a frequency of once per day (or more frequent) that you’ve
already used. You can use the feat again, as if you hadn’t used
it already.

Simultaneously blessed and cursed, oracles have
extraordinary power to control their mystery, but the
effort is too much for their bodies—mortals weren’t
meant to hold such power. Thus, using their powers also
curses them, wracking their body with pain, rotting them
from within, or even aging them well beyond their years.
To an oracle, learning to balance the use of their powers
against the strain of using them is integral to their survival
and their well-being. Power always comes at a price.
The following new mystery is available to oracles and
follows the standard rules for oracle mysteries on page 72
of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
TIME
Whether by accident, fate, or purposeful meddling, you
exist slightly outside of time. While initially unmoored by
moments, the countless march of milliseconds builds up to
drift you further and further out of sync with your natural
timeline, often in contradictory directions. You might
view this as a blessing, perhaps as a sign you’re somehow
beyond mortality or you can’t be contained within reality’s
limitations, or you might view it as a cruel curse that causes
your own life to slip by adrift even as you gain power over
time. Many oracles of time are without faith and either
come to rely upon their own instincts to survive or else
turn to strange rituals and forbidden magic in an attempt
to break free of time’s grasp. Those oracles who worship
deities most often worship Pharasma, goddess of fate who
sees all possible futures for all who ever lived, or Alseta,
goddess of transitions and the passage through time.
Mystery Benefit Time passes more swiftly for you than it does
for those around you, enabling you to cover more distance
in what others perceive as the same amount of time. You
gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. At 6th level,
this increases to a +15-foot status bonus; at 10th level, this
increases to a +20-foot status bonus; at 14th level, this
increases to a +25-foot status bonus; and at 18th level,
it increases to a +30-foot status bonus. Your disjointed
movement makes it harder for creatures to hit you as you
move. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks
made against you from reactions or free actions while
you’re moving.
TIME (ORACLE MYSTERY)
Oracles are gifted spellcasters as mysterious as the powers they harness. Although they wield divine magic, their powers
aren’t achieved through worship, but by tapping into a power greater than any one deity. Nothing is more mysterious
than causality, no river stranger than time, so it’s no surprise that some oracles come to access the incomprehensible,
absolute power that keeps all of creation moving from undeniable beginning to inevitable end.

CURSE OF TURBULENT MOMENTS
Time passes differently for you than everyone else. You
experience fluxes that might manifest as minor day-to-day
changes in your apparent age, such as a gray lock of hair or
a disappearing wrinkle, or as occasional ghostly temporal
afterimages that slightly trail your movement.
Minor Curse As you draw upon your mystery, time’s passage
becomes more disjointed, aging, regressing, or warping you
out of sync. You become enfeebled 1. In addition, you take
a –2 penalty to saving throws against effects that would
make you fatigued or slowed.
Moderate Curse Time distorts further, increasing your
muscular atrophy, age regression, or warping while making
effects pass you by at an increased rate. The value of your
enfeebled condition increases to 2 and the penalty from
your minor curse increases to –3. Your status bonus to AC
against attacks made against you from reactions or free
actions while you’re moving increases to +2. In addition,
spells affecting you last less time; their duration is reduced
by half, to a minimum of 1 round. This doesn’t reduce the
spell’s duration for other targets affected by the same spell.
Finally, all non-permanent conditions affecting you that
have a duration measured in rounds, minutes, or hours have
their duration reduced by half, to a minimum of 1 round.
Any afflictions (such as poisons, diseases, and curses)
affecting you have their maximum duration, onset time,
and time for each stage reduced by half. Spells, conditions,
and afflictions that last “until your next daily preparations”
last for 12 hours or until your next daily preparations,
whichever comes first. This doesn’t change the duration
you’re temporarily immune, the rate at which you can use
abilities that have a frequency, or any other features based
on the passage of time.
Major Curse (11th) You become so out of sync with time that
it’s hard for you to act, but when you do act, you do so
with incredible speed. You become slowed 1, the value of
your enfeebled condition increases to 3, and the penalty
from your minor curse increases to –4. Time passes so
much faster for you that your steps appear as a blur of
motion to others. You gain a +4 status bonus to initiative
rolls. Whenever you move, you’re concealed while you’re
moving and until the start of your next turn. As normal for
concealment where your location is still obvious, you can’t
use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. Your status bonus to
AC against attacks made against you from reactions or free
actions while you’re moving increases to +4.
REVELATION SPELLS
The following revelation spells are associated with the
time mystery.
TEMPORAL DISTORTION
FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON
CURSEBOUND
ORACLE
TRANSMUTATION
Mystery time
Cast [one-action] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will
You share some of your own temporal distortions with a
foe, altering their mind and body unpredictably as they’re
thrown backward or forward in time. Roll 1d4. On a 1, the
foe becomes clumsy; on a 2, it becomes enfeebled; on
a 3, it becomes stupefied; and on a 4, you choose which
condition applies.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is either clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, or
stupefied 1 for 4 rounds, depending on the result of the d4.
Critical Failure As failure, but the time warp is stronger,
increasing the condition’s effects but making it run its
course faster. The condition’s value is 3, and the condition
lasts for 2 rounds.
TIME SKIP
FOCUS 3
UNCOMMON
CURSEBOUND
ORACLE
TRANSMUTATION
Mystery time
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature other than yourself
Duration 1 round
You manipulate time around your ally, pushing them forward a
few moments in time. The target is quickened on its next turn
and can use the action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.
Heightened (+1) You can one additional willing creature other
than yourself within range.
MANIFOLD LIVES
FOCUS 6
UNCOMMON
CURSEBOUND
DIVINATION
EMOTION
MENTAL
ORACLE
Mystery time
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You cast a creature’s mind back through time, forcing them
to take other paths and make other choices, experiencing
countless alternate lives in an instant. The creature
becomes overwhelmed with regret over paths untraveled,
lives unlived, and times unrealized. The creature takes 6d6
mental damage and must attempt a Will save. After the
effect is resolved, the target is then temporarily immune for
1 day.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and is stupefied 2
for 1 round.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is stupefied 2 for 1
minute. While affected, the creature must attempt another
save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it’s slowed 1 for that
turn as it sobs uncontrollably.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and for 1
minute, it’s stupefied 4 and slowed 1 as it sobs uncontrollably.
Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d6.

Adventure Background
In the city-state of Goka, a restaurant boat named the
Golden Fortune has exhibited strange behavior. People
who visit the restaurant leave and can’t remember what
happened. Those same people seem robbed of their
ambitions and hopes afterward.
This is the restaurant’s third relaunch, and owner Rui
Longlai was getting desperate, so he incorporated some
unconventional and risky elements to the standard business
opening rituals hoping to draw influential customers who
would spread word of his business. Right before opening,
Rui cast a ritual to summon a morrowkin, which he thought
would nudge potential customers’ futures to lead them to
the Golden Fortune. Unfortunately, the creature drains
the potential future from his customers instead. The other
ritual he performed was a unique ceremony to summon an
artifact called the Knife of Trouble Elimination. The knife
was meant to let a person repeat a moment from their past
until they could find the source of their problems and cut
it out of their life.
The knife activated on its own when the morrowkin
first appeared, creating a loop of time in which someone
could figure out how to stop the morrowkin. The knife
can only give any group of people a limited number of
tries, however. The PCs investigating will need to fight the
morrowkin several times as they gather clues about how to
finally beat it and return time to normal.
Getting Started
The somnambulist bridge created by the Dark Archive
folio deposits the PCs on a riverside dock near the Balance
Bridge in Goka, the greatest metropolis in Tian Xia.
Goka’s docks buzz with busy energy as the sun sets. People load
and unburden their ships with haste in preparation of trade.
Eventually, the anomaly becomes clear. An extravagant
restaurant boat, the words Golden Fortune inscribed on its
red‑lacquered hull between two carved windows in the shape of
peonies, flickers erratically within a strange field of abjuration
magic, likely an Archive containment protocol of some kind to
ward off passers-by. Though fishers and dockworkers pass by
the Golden Fortune, not seeming to even notice the ship, some
people are disembarking, clearly unsteady and disoriented as
they cross through back onto the dock.
TOMORROW’S FEAST
The Golden Fortune
Golden Fortune case reported in Goka is one that’s caught my eye for some time, though I confess not for the most
unbiased of reasons—it’s been far too long since I visited my father’s hometown, and I’m sure my uncles would appreciate a
visit. Nevertheless, our archivists detected signs of a strange anomaly around one of its many restaurant boats: a stuttering
region that swallows people and spits them out later, stumbling and disoriented. — K.H.W.

Talking to people getting off the Golden Fortune yields
few results. No one can describe their experience, having
lost their memories when stuck in the time loop. A PC who
succeeds at a DC 28 Perception check can verify that the
customers aren’t lying—they truly remember nothing.
A1. DINING DECK
EXTREME 10
Read or paraphrase the following as the players set foot
on the boat. After Loop 0 (see the sidebar on page 192),
modify the text below appropriately.
The ramp leads to the main deck of the boat, where guests are
taking their seats at opulent darkwood tables and chairs with
intricate carvings. An amethyst geode flickers as a middle-aged
man with a bushy salt-and-pepper beard makes his way to the
entrance, adjusting his maroon robes. “Welcome to the Golden
Fortune! I’ve never seen you in these parts before, but it’s never
too late to make new friends! My name is Rui Longlai, the host
and owner of this fine restaurant. Please, let me find you a seat
so you can prepare for the finest dinner experience in all Goka!”
Loop 1: Rui says that the PCs seem somewhat familiar,
but if the PCs mention that they’ve had this exchange
before, he can’t place it.
Loop 2: Rui is sure he’s seen the PCs. He’s hazy on the
details but helpful to players who want to investigate.
Loop 3: Instead of his normal welcome, Rui says,
“Thank you for being here. I’ve made a terrible mistake
and I need your help to repair the damage. Please come
with me. I know we don’t have much time.” He then
accompanies the PCs below and can find all three books
in area A2 without searching, can recount the information
in Rui Longlai’s Journal without reading it, and can read
through the other books, automatically gaining a new
clue every 10 minutes.
Once the PCs set foot into the anomaly, which
completely covers the Golden Fortune and extends 30 feet
from the boat, they can’t leave it; the space is distorted
and impassable. After speaking with the PCs, Rui pulls up
the ramp and the ship leaves port. The PCs have an hour
to talk with Rui, taste the restaurant’s cuisine, explore the
areas of the boat they can, and gather information from
the guests. On Loop 0, before the PCs are aware of either
the time loop or time limit, they will likely only be able to
converse with the people on the deck and enjoy their meal.
There are two servers carrying food and drinks back and
forth between the deck and the kitchen. Hwarang Hahn
(CN human server) is energetic and disarms customers
with his good looks and fast wits, though while he charms
them and takes their orders, he also tries to take their
valuables from their pockets. He is in league with Fa and
Kuen (area A4), who are hiding out from the authorities,
so when PCs start asking questions, he assumes they are
here for the brothers and warns them, setting them on edge
for a fight. Hwarang feels the PCs are far too formidable
to be prospective targets for pickpocketing, but they might
notice him surreptitiously lifting something from another
passenger as they search the dining deck.
Banjau (CG half-orc server) is a Matanji half-orc very far
from her native Nantambu. The soft-spoken server found a
retreat from the pressures and expectations of her family,
enjoying a simple life here serving food to her customers.
Banjau has been a part of several of Rui’s re-launches (this
is the third). She doesn’t know anything about Hwarang,
Fa, and Kuen and prefers it that way (“they seem like
they’ve experienced life’s roughest parts”).
PCs who investigate the exterior of the boat or the water
around it for 10 minutes can attempt a DC 27 Nature check.
On a success, they notice water around the boat isn’t moving
in sync with the boat’s movement. A PC who succeeds at a
DC 27 Diplomacy check to Gather Information (taking 20
minutes, far less than the usual time because of how few
people are around) can tell that no one’s noticed anything
wrong. The passengers are excited for the journey and wait
in anticipation for their meals; PCs who succeed at the
check, or who simply order and experience the meal, also
pick up some of the information above about the servers.
Loop 1: In the first and subsequent loops, the passengers
seem a bit on edge, and the PCs realize they might have
more information to give with a Gather Information
check. On a success, the PCs learn that one passenger
named Maika Khogal has information from loops leaking
into her head. She says things like “you’re better than the
last ones” or she’ll call a PC by someone else’s name (one
of the previous explorers who came on the ship). She’ll
also tell the PCs, “The talismans protect your potential,”
though she herself doesn’t understand what that means.
Rui doesn’t let the PCs in the kitchen or belowdecks,
saying he plans a big reveal and that it’s worth the wait.
Since Rui’s life force and consciousness power the time loop
and determine the affected area, it’s virtually impossible
to go belowdecks without his permission, which a PC
attempting to sneak below immediately notices as strange.
Loop 1: Rui lets the PCs into the rest of the ship on a
successful DC 25 Diplomacy check. If the PCs fail, but
don’t critically fail, they can try again after 20 minutes,
and a third time after another 20 minutes.
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Team of four 10th-level
characters.
Tomorrow’s Feast takes place in Goka, a major port
metropolis on the western coast of Tian Xia. The PCs
are trapped in a time loop aboard a restaurant boat,
the Golden Fortune, that ends with their almost
certain death at the hands of a fearsome temporal
creature. Thankfully, the time loop can give the
team multiple chances to uncover the information
they’ll need to defeat the creature once and for all,
putting an end to the many, many maiden voyages
of the Golden Fortune.

Loop 2: As Loop 1, but the Diplomacy DC is only 22.
Loop 3: He begs the PCs to investigate immediately
and comes along with them.
Exploring Belowdecks
Starting from Loop 1, Rui begins to regain
his memories. While he resists letting them
explore, it becomes easier to convince
him to let them belowdecks. The
characters only have an hour before
the morrowkin returns, forcing
them to return in a subsequent
loop to continue investigating.
All
doors
belowdecks
are
unlocked unless stated otherwise.
Event 1: The Morrowkin

Extreme 10
After an hour has passed in any
time loop, read the following.
As the last glow of the setting sun
leaves the bay, it’s replaced by the
flash and bang of fireworks in the
sky, launched from the nearby
luxury Dragonhead district. Startled
by the sudden noise, a woman drops
a copper cup of baijiu, which clangs
against the table, then the ground. Suddenly, a strange
humanoid form with no distinct features appears on
the dining deck, bathed in scintillating purple light.
Images of haunted faces ripple slowly across its
body. Though it has no mouth, it speaks as it
raises its hands toward the guests.
“We’ve come for your futures,” it hisses.
If the PCs aren’t on the deck when the
event occurs, they hear the fireworks,
the crashing cup, and screaming as the
morrowkin swiftly dispatches those
in its way before chasing the PCs into
the belly of the Golden Fortune.

Disgusted by Food The morrowkin eats dreams and potential, not
food. A creature that spends an action to brandish food at the
morrowkin automatically makes the creature sickened 1 (or
increases its sickened value by 1, to a maximum of sickened 6),
decreasing the morrowkin’s AC, attack rolls, saves, skills, and
ability DCs accordingly, as normal for the sickened condition.
The morrowkin can’t retch to reduce its sickened condition.
Endless If reduced to 0 Hit Points or incapacitated for more
than a few rounds, the morrowkin vanishes. In 1 minute,
it reappears refreshed completely as if the previous battle
never happened, with full HP, with all effects on it cleared,
and with its Swallow Future ability ready to use again.

Drain Potential (misfortune, negative) The morrowkin
tries to drain the motivation from its target, who
must attempt a DC 31 Fortitude save. If the target
fails, it is doomed 1 (doomed 2 on a critical failure)
and must roll twice and use the worse result on
all checks for 1 minute. Creatures wearing a
hope talisman are unaffected.
Swallow

inhales and draws forth the future
deeds of all creatures
around it. All creatures
within a 30-foot
emanation of the
morrowkin take
6d8+18 mental
damage and must
attempt a DC 39 Will save. The morrowkin can’t
Swallow Future again for 1 minute. Creatures
wearing hope talismans can choose to let their
hope talisman break in order to ignore the effect
after seeing the result of their Will save.
Critical Success The creature takes no damage.
Success The creature takes half damage and is
doomed 1.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is doomed 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and
becomes doomed 4 (likely causing it to die immediately).
Tomorrow’s Fury [two-actions] The morrowkin makes claw attacks
against any number of targets within reach. The claw
attacks count against the morrowkin’s multiple attack
penalty, but don’t apply the penalty until after all attacks
have been made.
LOOPS
This adventure takes place in a small area that the
players pass through on multiple time loops. When
there are changes in an area during a loop, there will
be a “Loop” entry followed by a number to indicate
which loop the PCs are in. The PCs’ first time on the
ship is “Loop 0,” so “Loop 1” refers to the second time
they are on the ship. After Loop 3, if the PCs are
defeated again, they are ejected from the time loop
with their potential futures devoured; while this is
not fatal, they leave the ship listless and apathetic,
unable to continue their adventures.

Defeating the Morrowkin: PCs who have the Knife of
Trouble Elimination (see Finding the Knife, page 195), have
awakened the knife’s magic (see Awakening the Knife, page
194), and learned how to wield it (see Learning the Knife,
page 194) have access to the Untether from Time action,
the only thing that can defeat the morrowkin for good.
The PCs know when they meet the requirements through
an intrinsic sense from the knife. When three tethers have
been severed, the morrowkin is unmade and pulled out of
the time stream—see Defeating the Morrowkin (page 195).
Untether from Time [one-action] (attack, fortune, magical) Requirements
You are wielding the Knife of Trouble Elimination, the Knife
of Trouble Elimination has been temporally empowered,
and the morrowkin has 160 or fewer Hit Points; Effect You
focus your eyes to see the tethers of time located around the
morrowkin, then slash in a strange, twisting pattern with the
Knife of Trouble Elimination to sever the creature’s connection
to time. Make a melee attack roll against AC 28. On a success,
you sever a tether of time (two tethers on a critical success).
Death in the Anomaly: The PCs will very likely be killed
by the morrowkin on their first (or a later) encounter with
it. Virtually the only chance of avoiding this is if the PCs
can repeatedly defeat the creature dozens of times in a row
during Loop 0 to make enough time to learn how to use the
knife and keep Rui Longlai alive long enough to allow them
to investigate belowdecks. This shouldn’t happen unless the
PCs are much more powerful than expected for their level.
Once all the PCs have died in a loop, they’re brought back to
area A1 (page 191), having just stepped aboard the Golden
Fortune at the beginning of the loop. Once the PCs have
realized that their defeat against the morrowkin is imminent
(or that they’ve accomplished all they can in the current
loop), feel free to summarize the remainder of the loop so
players can get straight to resuming their investigation in the
next loop. Loop 3 is the PCs’ last chance; if they die a fourth
time, the morrowkin devours their future destinies, leaving
them little more than hollow shells of their former selves.
When the players return to the start of the loop, they’re
returned to full HP, but any expended resources the PCs
brought with them (such as spell slots or consumables)
remain expended. Any items that the players gained from
within the anomaly, such as any talismans or even the knife,
return to their normal places at the start of the loop.
A PC who succeeds at a DC 25 Occultism check realizes
that something about the Golden Fortune’s temporal
anomaly will allow them to return back to when they
boarded the vessel, though only three times. Regardless
of the check results, PCs gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Perception and skill checks to investigate for clues starting
in Loop 2, and a +2 circumstance bonus in Loop 3, as the
knife assists them.
A2. RUI LONGLAI’S OFFICE
This makeshift office contrasts the splendorous facade of the
rest of the boat: simple and functional. Crates of research
materials are strewn about and book stacks line the shelves.
Rui’s office is full of paperwork and research. It is clear
during a search that he splits his time evenly between
running his restaurant and studying ritual magic. The office
is disheveled, arranged in a way that only Rui can make
sense of. PCs who succeed at a DC 27 Perception check or
a DC 22 Society check find one of the relevant books in
20 minutes (10 minutes on a critical success); on a failure,
they waste the 20 minutes. If multiple PCs search together
and each succeed, they each find a different relevant book.
Once the characters have found a book, they automatically
find it again in a subsequent loop without spending
precious minutes searching. Once the PCs find all three
books, they can tell they’ve searched through everything in
the office and found all the volumes of interest.
The three relevant books in the office are Rui’s journal,
Unleashing Potential (author unknown), and Solving Your
Problems by Cantu Ji. Each book has three clues, and it
takes 20 minutes of reading to find each clue, in the order
presented, so reading a book for an hour gets the PC
all of its clues. A PC can halve the time to learn a given
clue to 10 minutes with a successful DC 29 Perception
check (Rui Longlai’s journal), DC 29 Occultism check
(Unleashing Potential), or DC 29 Arcana check (Solving
Your Problems); on a critical failure, it takes 40 minutes
to learn the clue, and on a critical success, it only takes 5
minutes. Only one PC can study a given book at a time.
Rui Longlai’s Journal
Clue 1: Rui details that this is his third relaunch of the
Golden Fortune. He’s spent most of the family fortune
chasing his dream of running a successful restaurant. Each
launch, Rui gave an overhaul of the decor, the menu, and the
staff. After some initial hype, business quickly dwindled and
he felt compelled to reinvent the restaurant.
Clue 2: Rui discusses feeling that he needs more than
good food and grand decor for a successful restaurant. He
wants influential people to visit and spread the word, of
which Rui has had very little success in his past tries. He has
spent much time collecting and studying rituals, looking
for those that can subtly attract wealthy customers.
Clue 3: The two rituals that Rui decides are most fruitful
are “Tomorrow’s Feast” and “Problem Cutting.”
The relevant entry for Tomorrow’s Feast follows.
You make a lot of food for a guest and then he arrives and fixes
your future! How simple! I’ll get help from Jiudu and have the
feast ready in the private room tomorrow.
The relevant entry for the Problem Cutting entry follows.
I’m not sure about this one... I don’t need to spend all this time
doing the same things over and over, do I? I’ve made the knife
but I’ll use it if the Feast doesn’t work, I guess.

Unleashing Potential
Clue 1: The first half of the book is all philosophy. In
frenzied handwriting, it discusses how one unleashes
potential by borrowing from others. Any character trained
in Occultism or master in Perception recognizes that the
intent behind the words is not as benign as it seems.
Clue 2: The book discusses the summoning of a creature
known as the morrowkin, a creature whose sole purpose
is to “borrow” the future of others by making a feast for
dozens. It collects a large wellspring of energy and grants it
to its summoner before returning home. Characters trained
in Arcana or Occultism, or who are a master in Perception,
recognize conspicuous amounts of missing information.
Clue 3: The ritual itself is detailed properly, but a
character who is of master proficiency in Arcana or
Occultism recognizes something is wrong with the feast.
The runes in the example in the book indicate the feast is
not for a dozen guests, but is of those guests. A PC who is
trained in Deception recognizes that this “mistake” in the
diagram is an intentional deception. Regardless of the PCs’
training, they realize that since the morrowkin is sustained
by the metaphysical feast, it might be vulnerable to mortal
food, allowing them to understand how to spend an action
to sicken the morrowkin via its Disgusted by Food ability.
Solving Your Problems
Clue 1: This book discusses how magic isn’t a tool to solve
your problems but rather to give you what you need to
solve them yourself. It gives several examples of how the
author just needed extra time to think about her problems
from different perspectives to make lasting progress.
Clue 2: The book describes how to summon the Knife
of Trouble Elimination, an artifact that allows one to keep
looking at their problems. Once the root of the problems is
found, the wielder can cut it out as if it never existed and
carry on with their life.
Clue 3: The ritual for summoning the knife describes
many different components (they can be found in A5),
while also revealing that the knife requires a final step to
become properly empowered.
Awakening the Knife: PCs who read through all of Rui
Longlai’s journal and Solving your Problems realize that
Rui never completed the final step to awaken the knife.
Once the PCs have located the knife, they can complete
this ritual, which requires 30 minutes, a drop of blood,
and a successful DC 27 Occultism check or DC 29 Arcana,
Nature, or Religion check. As the knife’s existence is tied to
the temporal anomaly, once it is empowered in any loop, it
remains empowered across all time loops.
A3. PRIVATE DINING ROOM
LOW 10
The door to this room is locked with a combination
lock and a series of layers that make breaking through
laborious, requiring a DC 27 check and 10 minutes to
Pick a Lock (or a DC 29 check and 10 minutes to Force
Open). Successfully Picking the Lock also allows the PC to
reverse‑engineer the combination, enabling them to open
the door normally on subsequent loops.
A ritual circle takes up the center of this room, its perimeter
outlined by several silver talismans. Ornate dining tables
are pushed to the side. The scent of burnt sandalwood and
medicinal herbs hangs in the air.
This private dining hall is where Rui and his friend Jiudu
Xien (N female ghost gnome accountant) first performed the
ritual to summon the morrowkin. Rui completed his part of
the ritual a bit before Jiudu, then left the room for some last-
minute preparations elsewhere. Once Jiudu completed the
ritual, the morrowkin was summoned and made her its first
victim, devouring her potential and fate before she could
fight back. The remnants of her spirit lurk here.
Loop 1: Jiudu immediately attacks the PCs, fighting
with desperation. After 3 rounds of fighting or if she is
brought down to half of her Hit Points, PCs can spend
an action to attempt a DC 29 Diplomacy check to get her
to talk. Once she begins talking, Jiudu tells the PCs that
her last memories were of performing the ritual when
everything went suddenly black, after which she awoke
as a ghost. When asked about the ritual, Jiudu says she
thought something seemed off about it, yet she decided to
go through it anyway to help her old friend.
Loop 2: As the previous loop, but Jiudu requires only a
DC 27 Diplomacy check to convince and can be persuaded
from the first round with any amount of HP remaining.
Loop 3: Jiudu appears but has become aware enough of
the time loop that her starting attitude toward the PCs is
already friendly.
JIUDU XIEN
CREATURE 11
Elite ghost mage (Bestiary 6, 167)
Perception +19; darkvision
Learning the Knife: While Jiudu was not aware that
Rui had created a Knife of Trouble Elimination, she does
know of the ritual that created the morrowkin and how it
might be defeated. Once she has become friendly with the
PCs, she teaches them that a special maneuver, performed
with a sufficiently empowered object, could be used to cut
the morrowkin out of the timestream. PCs who spend 30
minutes performing a training drill with Jiudu learn the
Untether from Time action.
Hope Talismans: The talismans on the floor are hope
talismans, used to bind the morrowkin’s spirit in the early
part of the ritual. There are as many hope talismans as
there are PCs.
Bypassing Jiudu: Jiudu’s research into temporal magic
taught her many best practices for time travelers, such as
establishing a “personal passphrase” told to no one—that
way, if someone ever utters her personal passphrase to her,
she knows it is her future self, or someone sent at her future
self’s direction. The first time the PCs successfully speak

with Jiudu, she teaches them the line “Six plovers grace
Shelyn’s comb” to give to her past self. If the PCs speak
this line to Jiudu in a subsequent loop, she recognizes
them as being sent by her future self and will immediately
stand down from combat—while “future” self is slightly
inaccurate, this still allows the PCs to bypass this fight on
subsequent loops if they need to revisit the dining room.
A4. KITCHEN
LOW 10
The tantalizing smell of simmering seafood stock permeates
this compact kitchen. Baskets of vegetables line the walls.
Fa and Kuen are busy cooking in this kitchen. The
brothers are assassins on the run, working this
job until the heat dies down. They were told
of this opportunity by the server Hwarang,
who often works with the pair on jobs. Rui
hired the two on the spot after seeing their
excellent knife work. While Fa and Kuen
are excellent cooks, they’re not used to
the time management needed to run a
professional restaurant kitchen.
Hwarang warns the pair if he sees
the PCs asking too many questions,
thinking they are authorities looking for the brothers.
Even without this warning, Fa and Kuen immediately
attack anyone who comes into the kitchen without Rui,
suspecting they are there to arrest them. They surrender
and submit to being taken to jail when they are at a
quarter of their Hit Points total. Characters can succeed
at a DC 30 Diplomacy or Society check to convince the
brothers they aren’t there to arrest them. The brothers
don’t know anything about the ritual, only caring what
happens in the kitchen.
During a fight, the slippery floors in the kitchen make
the ground difficult terrain.
Loop 3: There is a faint blue glow coming from the
storage room. Fa and Kuen do not seem to perceive it.
FA AND KUEN
CREATURE 9
Elite assassins (Bestiary 6, Gamemastery Guide 211)
Bypassing the Brothers: The brothers attempt to fight
and kill the PCs only because their faces have been seen.
If the PCs bang on the door before they come belowdecks
and claim to be the authorities here to make an arrest,
the brothers instead jump out of a porthole and attempt
to swim to escape (not knowing that they can’t leave the
anomaly), as their identities are still secret. Be sure that Fa
or Kuen complain that the PCs didn’t identify themselves as
authorities the first time they surrender after combat with
the PCs, and the other brother blurts “Yeah, then we could
have made a break for it,” or something similar. This will
allow the PCs to bypass this fight on subsequent loops if
they need to revisit the kitchen (or storage room).
A5. STORAGE
This small storage space is crammed with food, spices, and
cooking implements, as well as several poorly organized crates.
Space has been made to accommodate two hammocks.
This is where Fa and Kuen sleep at night rather than going
home. Rui thinks it is unconventional but also
thinks that it shows dedication to
their craft, so he allows it.
Finding the Knife: Hidden in a
crate containing a dangerous jumble
of sharp cooking implements (sloppily
packed from Rui’s last restaurant) is the
Knife of Trouble Elimination, though it
seems like just another knife. Even Rui
can’t remember which one it is. Once the
PCs have found the knife, they can find it
immediately in later loops.
Loop 1, 2: Temporal energy starts to form in this room,
and the knife can be detected with a successful
DC 25 Occultism or Arcana check, taking 10
minutes to attempt the check, or 5 minutes if
also using detect magic.
Loop 3: The Knife of Trouble Elimination has become
unstable as it attempts to hold the time loop open. The
whole room glows with a faint blue light and the knife
becomes easy to locate from the crate.
DEFEATING THE MORROWKIN
The morrowkin is pulled through a black hole in the fabric of
reality, hissing about all the fates it wanted to devour as it goes.
The tear heals as quickly as it formed.
A few breaths later, the Knife of Trouble Elimination shudders
for a moment before letting raw temporal energy spiral forth.
Reality is rewritten as scenery goes back into place, people
return to their positions, and damage is reversed. The knife
fades away into nothing. Everything is as it once was... except
for Rui Longlai, who has aged at least thirty years.
The Knife of Trouble Elimination used Rui Longlai’s life
to hold the loops open. Rui is aware of this and doesn’t
complain, since he wanted to save the people who were
suffering from his mistake. The owner of the Golden
Fortune is in great spirits, saying he realizes there are no
shortcuts in life. He thinks he can finally run the restaurant
the right way. He thanks the PCs profusely for the help and
encourages them to visit the restaurant again in the future.
All PCs are restored to the state when they first stepped
into the temporal anomaly. Only the PCs and Rui remember
anything about the morrowkin. Unleashing Potential
disappears, as do all other traces of it, and the PCs see
the passengers disembark from the boat disoriented but
alive—the same ones they first saw disembarking when
they arrived on the dock.

Studies into the metaphysical nature of mindscapes suggest
they nearly always grow in the Astral Plane. Account 87
from Archivist Kanvarati details sightings witnessed
during a ritual of astral projection: blob-like structures
with hazy edges coursing within the Silver Sea, seemingly
at their own speed. Details are light, due to distance, the
altered state imposed by the ritual, and the fact that they
are sensed partially with the mind rather than the eyes.
Kanvarati likens them to bubbles rushing past in a stream,
bursting when they expire.
You’ll notice obvious comparisons to the dreamscapes
that crop up within the Dreamlands; indeed, Archivists
Ralt and Harachi are forever bickering about whether
mundane dreams can be called a form of “naturally
occurring mindscapes.” The primary differences appear
to be the far smaller number of mindscapes and the
more deliberate nature of their creation. (Though as the
Tenemor event demonstrated, they can spring up without
conscious effort from an architect possessed of sufficient
psychic power and emotional conflict.) Anyone can dream,
but few can form mindscapes, much like anyone can bang
out a beat on a table, but few can write a symphony.
INSIDE THE MINDSCAPE
External structures tell a small part of the story—the true
experience of a mindscape is within it.
LANDS OF THOUGHT
AND IMAGINATION
Mindscapes, Mental Realms,
and the World of Dreams
It’s with some unease we plumb the powers of the mind. The common senses have
served us over years of observing and cataloging the external world, but accessing
the internal senses doesn’t come as naturally. They’re subjective, inconsistent. It’s
clear the potential of mentalism is vast—possibly limitless—though we can’t say for sure. Mindscapes, as
the name suggests, mimic an environment but spring from the power of a mind rather than the machines
of nature. They can seem as vast as a house, a town, even a forest. They can have incredible fidelity or be
as plain as a plank of wood.

I will note that archivists well versed in mindscapes—
as much as we appreciate them—remain quite rare. Much
of our information comes from accounts of students
under Master Pramyat Mindap. Given the level of secrecy
and potential retaliation from Grand Sarret these sources
shall remain nameless for their safety.
We have records of mindscapes with many levels of
detail, though it’s useful as a baseline to classify them
as immersive or not: an immersive mindscape is one in
which creatures are entirely contained, truly separated
from the world. An immersive mindscape has terrain,
people, weather, structures. Some can feel accurate down
to the blade of grass or text in the books. Rare, but quite
impressive. Someone brought into a mindscape can shape
it with their own mental power, whether aware or not. On
one of our few encounters within a mindscape, I was at
least possessed of enough knowledge of the phenomenon
to shift a moth’s wings from dun to golden, even without
a particular acumen for working mental magic. Our more
adept colleagues were building bridges of bare stones,
walking fully through walls, and flying over trees. Still, a
moth’s wing is more than nothing.
Simpler mindscapes suffice in other circumstances.
Ones termed “binary” mindscapes simply link two minds,
echoing the mindscape’s inhabitants in the Astral Plane
rather than transporting them there entirely. The effect is
akin to the angled mirror illusion in theater, showing the
viewer the illuminated stage of the real world overlayed
with the proverbial offstage scene being reflected into
their view. As interesting as this sounds, in practice these
are often used for mind-against-mind squabbles (or
“psychic duels”) rather than higher pursuits. We’ve been
told these are quite spectacular to those within them,
explosive as a festival dance or fireworks display. From
the outside, this intense experience of perceiving both
the mindscape and outside world simultaneously looks
like a person dosed with basidrond spores attempting to
negotiate small talk about the weather. (That comparison
might not make sense to most people. Hmm.)
A mindscape can shift as suddenly as, quite literally,
changing one’s mind. Emotions are like the weather
within a mindscape and bleed into the environment
easily. Thoughts of a loved one may manifest trite
markers like singing birds and sweet fragrances on the
breeze, or might be more personal, rooted in specific
memories. For example, their beloved’s face might
appear on faces in a crowd within the mindscape. (This
was no doubt a bit embarrassing for Archivist Welmine,
as his infatuation was with his immediate supervisor,
but at least informative!) Those with notable psychic
ability recount a persistent feeling, more direct unease
piped into their minds, appearing more direct and less
metaphorical. A mindscape can be a tangle, a maze, an
oubliette, and these signs can arm those pulled into them
with the means to understand and possibly even escape or
undermine the mindscape. Mental discipline is needed to
maintain a steady mindscape—if the architect considers
that important.
SELF-IMAGE IN FLUX
It must be remembered that the self in the mindscape,
while feeling entirely real, is an astral self. The mindscape
draws from the self-image for its facsimile of each
inhabitant. Usually, that simply means you look like
you, feel like you, act like you. Sometimes, the self-
image has variations from complete accuracy: slightly
more attractive or unattractive, clothing that fits better,
and occasional major variations in parts of the body the
person rarely sees or senses, like the back of the chest or
soles of the feet. The biases of the mindscape’s architect
greatly affect everything within, sometimes altering the
appearance of inhabitants. A hated foe or rival might
have a monstrous look to them or even—and we hesitate
to call it this—dramatic lighting to invoke fear or hate.
Noticing these changed details can inform someone
they’re in a mindscape. They or others might notice
minor discrepancies. The most obvious is usually a
mirrored appearance; the person is most familiar with
their appearance through seeing it in a mirror, so a friend
notices their mole is on the other side of their face or the
part in their hair is reversed. Changes can be intentional
if one is aware they’re in a mindscape. Especially within
psychic duels, appearances can change on a whim.
We suspect the minds of the tenants fill in some
details within a mindscape, so the architect doesn’t have
to craft every flower petal and grain of sand. That the
architect can make a perfect facsimile in one step seems
impossible, though research on this point is scarce.
It’s exceedingly difficult to differentiate who invented
what in a mindscape, as sensation and thoughts blur
between individuals. Accounts we’ve uncovered show the
participants doubtful about their experience as a whole,
which layers even greater doubt on every detail. As the
metaphysical makeup of a mindscape resembles that of
a dream, it’s possible the mindscape relies on the same
mechanisms to present a believable world.
Some mindscapes are intended for only one resident.
We term these insular mindscapes for simplicity. They’re
most often used as personal realms for their architects,
whether said architect deliberately created a sanctuary
for study, contemplation, isolation, or other means,
or has inadvertently made a mindscape and become
trapped within it. Outsiders rarely see the inside of these
mindscapes, but our data points to most being little more
interesting than private studies, libraries, or clubhouses.
They can sometimes be a bit more... shameful. Places
where the architect goes to flout traditional mores and
make fantasies come true. The exploits within might be
embarrassing if revealed, but the activity is harmlessly
conducted within one mind. Unless, of course, something
within escapes, which is a possibility with any such
creation. But we’ll discuss that later.

CONFINED IN A MINDSCAPE
Disappearances can be attributed to mindscapes, as was
explicitly the case in five files we’ve run across and no
doubt several more unsolved cases. Two of those cases
show a creator trapped in their own mind (and with
companions in one case), and the other three were
malicious imprisonments.
These imprisonments sort into two categories: ones
meant to conceal the fact it’s a prison and ones engineered
specifically to anguish the prisoner. A hidden prison might
look and feel pleasant—the captive may even be happy—
useful to capture someone who’s a danger but not due to
malice. Though no less a prison, it may be more just than
a grimy cell or the gallows. This form is also typical of
self-exile into a mindscape.
The torturous version comes from great malice, an ire
sharpened and crafted into a painful jail, saved for the
most loathed enemies or the cruelest psychics.
We’ve seen many instances of involuntary self-
imprisonment in mindscapes, and with both varieties of
confinement. The archivists involved in one case in southern
Garund reported a youth within his own mindscape was
made a victim of fears so specific to him the imagery
didn’t look like anything particularly frightening to them.
Certainly, it was a punishment rooted in his own anxieties.
A term in a mindscape can be quite long. The greatest
ones endure indefinitely, outlasting their architect and
potentially excluding someone from the world for eons.
The trapped being’s body can die and waste away, leaving
only psychic residue. In the mindscape, this looks—and
smells—like a true corpse. A timeless mindscape, in which
time doesn’t pass, avoids this problem, though eternal
imprisonment is rarely considered a boon by the prisoner.
We were quite fortunate that Venture-Captain Yuul’s
encounter with a mindscape didn’t trap her eternally.
This mindscape, an unending one named the Monastic
Archive, proved its danger by sucking Yuul into memories
of her youth, and only good fortune and cunning by her
fellow Pathfinders secured her freedom. It has become
the mindscape most studied by the Pathfinder Society.
(Frustratingly, these records don’t always get reproduced
and sent to the Dark Archive as they should.) This type
of triggered trap doesn’t typify mindscapes, but nothing
typifies them. They simply can’t be taken for granted any
more than the whims of a person’s mind can be.
BENEVOLENT PURPOSES
Most intentions we’ve mentioned so far are neutral or
malicious. Positive uses are rare, likely due to the expense
and time involved. (Sad to say, experience teaches us most
endeavors people willingly put effort into go toward
harming others.) If mindscapes were more common, I’ve
no doubt they’d come in useful for talking therapy, to
illustrate feelings in a safe realm. Archivist Kanvarati and
others speak glowingly of the calm and self-reflection
they’ve found in their explorations. I personally found
satisfaction and a thrill of creativity in being able to
change my environment (recall the moth?).
Communication through mindscapes also has exciting
potential, surpassing language in the same way a good
piece of art can. The apkallus—which, in case the reader
is unfamiliar, are falcon-headed, winged historians of
Axis—prefer to communicate mentally and mindscapes
make a great tool. I’m keen to meet these beings, though
Archivist Grispinn found them quite didactic and fond
of explaining verbally, in great detail, what was evident
from the scene occurring in the mindscape.
UNENDING VISTAS
We’ve largely kept this discussion to the more common
varieties of mindscapes, but again, the potential seems
limitless. Mass mindscapes call upon the thoughts of a
great many minds to create a sort of shared hallucination.
There is no one author of such a mindscape nor are there
the limits of such an author! In particular, the thoughtforms
of people tend to behave with more nuance, detail, and
knowledge. The drawback here is consistency, as not all
the imaginations stoking the mindscape agree. The same
(imaginary) person might have a vastly different attitude
depending on whose influence is waxing at the time.
A reader acquainted with Archivist Senthene might
wonder about the “pervasive mindscape” hypothesis,
which holds that everything is a mindscape and everyone
and everything an invention of some strange being. If
mindscapes exist, the theory goes, then it’s reasonable to
assume our reality is a mindscape from a high enough
vantage point. A reach to be sure. Is it possible, though?
With what we’ve seen, we’d be surprised but not shocked.
EXTERNALIZED THOUGHTFORMS
We mentioned mental creations of mindscapes escaping
into the greater reality. Of course they do; we’ve come to
expect no less by this point. Creatures born of pure thought
are what we term thoughtforms or thoughtform creatures.
You may think, “what about tulpas?”­—a question I tire
of before it’s even asked these days. Suffice to say, tulpas
can spawn in this way but aren’t the only thoughtform
creatures. Tulpas are defined by a certain sapience and
psychic ability. Most thoughtform creatures are feral
things—emotions or tossed-off thoughts made manifest.
If you’d care to imagine your most careless thoughts, the
ones you think better of uttering, coming to life, you’ll
have some idea what you could involuntarily create.
Once free, these things tend to lose their connection
to the mindscape. If the mindscape is eliminated, the
creature persists autonomously. They must be hunted
down. Archivists excel at this task, of course, as much as
anyone can. Fortunately, the base nature of the creatures
makes them predictable and easy to trick. Even a mighty
thoughtform wields its power clumsily. Tulpas, again, are
another matter. They can be nearly as savvy as a person
born of flesh and aren’t to be taken lightly.

Mindscape Statistics
Similar to a plane or dimension, a mindscape has statistics.
The rules for planar traits and stat blocks begin on page
136 of the Gamemastery Guide. The stat block for more
limited binary mindscapes is on page 202.
IMMERSIVE MINDSCAPE
MINDSCAPE
FINITE
METAMORPHIC
SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY
An immersive mindscape forms in the Astral Plane and is
shaped purely from the thoughts of its creator. Created of
powerful psychic magic, it brings creatures fully into it in their
astral forms. Their bodies might remain behind, inactive, or be
totally drawn in, depending on the nature of the mindscape.
Typically, the mindscape appears to the senses to be a real
place, and the inhabitants believe they’re physically there.
Though a mindscape is always mutable with subjective
gravity, its nature can be veiled, causing inhabitants
to be unaware of these properties. Veiled
mindscapes typically appear to have normal
gravity and morphic traits. Overcoming
this appearance to alter the mindscape’s
structure or use subjective gravity requires
realizing it’s false.
Variations A mindscape’s alignment trait
is usually neutral but might be altered by
the creator’s emotions. A mindscape might
have unbounded scope and its time might be
altered, typically to flowing time or timeless.
These aren’t possible with the basic construct
mindscape ritual.
MINDSCAPE RITUALS
CONSTRUCT MINDSCAPE
RITUAL 5
RARE
ILLUSION
Cast 1 day; Cost precious clay, wood, or other modeling
materials worth spell level × 20 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (master); Secondary
Checks Arcana or Occultism, Crafting
Duration 1 day
You create an entirely mental environment called an
immersive mindscape. It can have any appearance you and
the secondary casters imagine and hold in your minds as you
execute the ritual. A mindscape is typically veiled, disguising
its nature as a mental construct, but you can choose to make
it overt. Even a veiled mindscape has some signs it’s not a
real place that can be revealed through close inspection or by
spending a long time there. Most mindscapes are incapable of
physically harming those inside. Even though the mindscape
you create is limited in dimension, it appears to have a
convincing environment around it, such as a sky and clouds.
Critical Success You create a mindscape approximately a
half-mile in length and width, and 50 feet in height (large
enough to contain a typical village). The GM might allow
you to make it larger if it has little detail, such as a grassy
plain. You and any secondary casters of your choice can
enter it and you can leave a doorway that you and any
creatures you designate can pass through.
Success As critical success, but the mindscape is approximately
25 feet in length, width, and height (like a modest house).
Failure You can’t hold the image together and it falls apart.
Critical Failure Your secret desires horribly warp the
mindscape into a distorted mirror of what you intended.
Heightened (6th) The duration is 1 week.
Heightened (9th) The duration is 1 year, and the area on a
critical success is 1 mile in length and width.
Heightened (10th) The duration is unlimited, and the area on
a critical success is 1 mile in length and width. The cost
increases to 2,000 gp.
MINDSCAPE DOOR
RITUAL 3
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
Cast 1 hour; Cost incense and focusing diagrams
worth a total value of the target’s level (minimum
1) × 1 gp, for each target; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (expert);
Secondary Checks Arcana or Occultism,
Deception or Diplomacy, Perception
Range touch; Targets yourself and up to 5
willing creatures
You project the targets into an immersive
mindscape or cause them to exit one. You
must be aware the mindscape exists, though
you don’t need to know specifics. The casters
must be in physical contact with one another in
a circle for the duration of the casting and all targets
must be selected from these casters. Your bodies
typically remain behind in stasis when you enter a
mindscape, though some mindscapes pull you entirely into them
upon entrance. If you enter a mindscape, you can leave only by
using another mindscape door ritual, finding an exit within the
nature of the mindscape, or when the mindscape ceases to exist.
When exiting a mindscape, you typically return to your bodies or
to the location where you entered the mindscape.
If the mindscape’s creator wants to prevent anyone from
entering or exiting, the DC of the primary check is the creator’s
Will DC if that would be higher than the ritual’s normal DC.
Critical Success You transport the creatures as you intended
and can leave a portal that lasts for an unlimited duration. It
typically looks like an ordinary door or passage appropriate
to the mindscape. Any target of the spell can enter or exit
through this portal as they would an ordinary door. If you
wish, you can make the door passable by anyone.
Success You transport the creatures as you intended.
Failure You fail to enter or exit the mindscape.
Critical Failure Something goes horribly wrong. The GM decides
whether mental feedback deals 9d6 mental damage to
all ritual casters (DC 26 basic Will save) or 1d4 casters are
unwillingly pulled into the mindscape (or ejected from it).
Heightened (8th) The ritual targets up to 100 willing creatures,
the critical failure damage increases to 20d6, and the critical
failure save DC increases to 40.

Taking place entirely in a mindscape, psychic duels can
occur when foes come into conflict in an area rife with
mental magic, through the magic of a bizarre artifact, when
two creatures’ minds connect within a dream, or when a
psychic duelist instigates a duel (page 203). Psychic duels
play out much like the duels described on pages 166–167
of the Gamemastery Guide. The main differences are the
participants conduct their duel in mental space and their
mental state and emotions determine the outcome. (A duel
taking place in the physical world with occult spells uses
the rules for spellcasting duels, not psychic duels.) While
engaged in a psychic duel, the participants are paralyzed
in the real world and can mentally act only in the psychic
duel mindscape.
Though other kinds of duels have a judge, a psychic duel
is governed by the workings of the mind. This means most
psychic duels last until a participant yields or is knocked
out (or all participants on one side in the case of a group
duel). However, the duel can also end if the participants
share an event they would consider a satisfying end to
the duel. For instance, they might decide the goal of the
duel is to demonstrate mastery of illusion spells, with the
first to fully fall for an illusion losing the duel. Because
the duel takes place on a mental battlefield, a creature that
is mindless or immune to mental effects is incapable of
joining a psychic duel.
Terms of the Duel
Because of the entirely mental nature of a psychic duel,
participants can easily establish more ground rules for
their duel through simple consensus, such as the following
example options.
•	 All psychic manifestations are nonlethal.
•	 Participants can cast no spells but battle form spells.
•	 A participant can escape the duel by attaining a certain
goal, ending it early as a draw. This is especially
common in a duel between a powerful psychic and
someone with weak psychic capabilities.
•	 Participants can leave the duel immediately if their
physical body is disturbed or harmed.
PSYCHIC DUELS
Two challengers flood their minds with a vision of a psychic battlefield. Imagination explodes into psychic attacks.
Fireballs bloom into explosions of color, imaginary swords open wounds bleeding iridescent butterflies, unreal
monstrosities escape from nightmares to lash out with their thousand fangs. A defender’s shield of psychic glass shatters
into fractal shrapnel and the combatant faints, overwhelmed. The victor’s mind snaps back to the ordinary world as
their foe crumples to the ground.

Initiative and Dueling
Actions
Each duelist rolls initiative normally and proceeds in
that initiative order, like a spellcasting duel rather than a
combat duel. Each duelist can roll a Deception, Diplomacy,
Intimidation, or Occultism check instead of Perception. If
the participant is trained at the skill they rolled for initiative,
they gain the psychic center of that skill—a mental state
corresponding to the skill. The GM might allow Lore skills
for initiative in a psychic duel; these give the Occultism
psychic center unless the GM determines otherwise.
All participants gain the Psychic Defense reaction, which
they can use while psychically centered. Its specific effect
depends on the user’s psychic center and using it expends
the state. Each participant also has the Recenter action,
which lets them change or assume a psychic center.
PSYCHIC DEFENSE [reaction]
CONCENTRATE
MAGICAL
Trigger Your opponent uses a psychic manifestation against you.
Requirements You’re in a psychic duel and are psychically
centered.
You gain the benefit matching your psychic center against the
triggering manifestation. Then your psychic center is expended.
Armor of Insight (Perception) Sensing the incoming attack, you
make your mind resist psychic harm. You gain resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1) to mental damage
against the triggering effect. This resistance is doubled if
you’re a master in Perception and tripled if you’re legendary.
Empathic Orbit (Diplomacy) Displaying empathy, you sow
doubt in your attacker to diminish their resolve for psychic
combat. The opponent is stupefied 1 until the end of their
next turn or stupefied 2 if you’re legendary in Diplomacy.
Ire’s Spear (Intimidation) Blazing anger surges in your
mind, causing backlash to anyone who harms you. If the
manifestation damages you, the opponent takes damage
equal to the counteract level of the manifestation it used
against you. This damage is doubled if you’re a master of
Intimidation or tripled if you’re legendary.
Rational Labyrinth (Occultism) Analytically breaking down
the attack, you realign your mind’s defenses into a puzzle
designed to confound it. You gain a +2 status bonus to your
Will save or Will DC, or a +4 status bonus if the effect has the
emotion trait.
Sensory Phantasm (Deception) Using your guile, you send
psychic illusions through your mental link to your foe,
making yourself harder to pinpoint. You’re concealed against
the opponent until the end of its next turn.
RECENTER [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
Requirements You’re in a psychic duel and are trained in the
skill matching the psychic center you are changing to.
You adopt the psychic center matching the emotion of your
choice. If you were already psychically centered, you lose your
old psychic center when you adopt the new one.
IMAGERY OF A PSYCHIC DUEL
Upon entering the psychic duel, a creature’s psychic
avatar appears in the minds of the duelists. This
mental manifestation looks vaguely like them but
might be altered based on their mental abilities and
the statistics they used for initiative. For instance,
a creature that rolled Deception might appear
cloaked, shadowy, or diabolic. Over the course of
the battle, this avatar changes appearance multiple
times, adapting to the flow of the duel. A vicious,
powerful attack might cause the attacker to look
more fearsome or increase the splendor of their
imaginary attire; a failure might make them shrink
or become translucent. Armor might change form to
defend against varied manifestations.
Psychic manifestations, too, flex to meet the
psychic battlefield. Players should describe the
actions they use in imaginative ways unbound by
the laws of the physical world. Weapons can grow,
shrink, twist, and fly. Spells can become a riot of
color and noise, directing sensation straight into the
target’s mind. Participants transform into animals
or warriors that reflect their ferocity or cunning.
Enchantment and illusion spells are particularly
mutable since they’re more directly tied to the mind
and senses. Since the participants are mentally
linked, their thoughts can bleed over, making an
illusion pull imagery directly from the target’s mind
to show them a vision of a loved one or a bit of their
past.
The varied forms of Psychic Defense illustrate
this easily. Just a few examples appear here, but
anything that makes sense to a participant’s
imagination might appear.
Armor of Insight: Suck an attack into a fractal
vortex of color, speed acres of distance away from
your foe, transform into an unbreakable mountain,
deflect an attack by creating a prism of light that
breaks the attack into a rainbow of colors.
Empathic Orbit: Transform into the pleading
visage of someone the foe inadvertently harmed,
remove your face to reveal a crying version of your
foe’s own face, broadcast one of your memories that
can elicit sympathy.
Ire’s Spear: Roil a crashing storm, mirror the
manifestation upon your attacker, emit a red-faced
roar that shatters eardrums, froth rabidly to form a
river of blazing spittle.
Rational Labyrinth: Call up a foe’s memory
of being lost, block access to your mind with
mathematical equations, levy a requirement for
legalistic precision upon your foe’s thoughts.
Sensory Phantasm: Duplicate your form infinitely,
transform into a grotesque corpse to avert your
foe’s gaze, cast a falcon’s hood over your foe’s head,
emit distracting strobes of light.

Attacks and
Defenses
Any action taken in a mindscape
is converted into a thoughtform
called a psychic manifestation. An
attack or spell has essentially the effect
one would expect it to, though its form
is far more mutable in the mindscape.
Though taking place in the mind, a
psychic duel still consumes any resources
used by its combatants, such as HP and
spell slots. A skilled warrior brought into a
psychic duel isn’t a helpless weakling; their
martial arts training carries over into the
thoughtforms they use in the duel. Statistics and
actions change in a psychic duel as follows.
Always Use Will Defense: Because a psychic duel pits
mind against mind, you use Will for all saving throws
and your Will DC as your Armor Class. In cases where a
different DC (not a save or AC) would be used for defense,
the GM determines which statistic to use, typically
replacing only ones based on physical ability modifiers.
Any Damage Becomes Mental Damage: Any damage
dealt in a psychic duel is converted to mental damage. Any
immunities, resistances, and weaknesses a creature would
normally have to the psychic manifestation’s form still apply,
for instance, applying fire resistance to a psychic fireball.
Apply the higher of a creature’s weakness or resistance to
the damage as normal. Weakness or resistance to mental
damage applies only once against a given manifestation, no
matter how many types of damage it deals.
Change Strike Damage: Though Strikes use their
normal ability scores to represent thoughtform versions
of the attacker’s prowess, any physical ability modifier
to damage is replaced with the attacker’s highest mental
ability modifier. A creature stat block typically doesn’t list
a breakdown of its Strike damage, but the GM can find
the difference between its Strength modifier and highest
mental ability modifier to adjust the damage.
Range Doesn’t Matter: Spells and attacks with a range
can target anyone inside the mindscape without penalty,
even if outside their maximum range or range increment.
Spells and abilities that affect a specific area or emanate
from you must still follow those restrictions. Melee attacks
only target foes within your reach.
NATURAL PSYCHIC SPELLS
Any creature in a psychic duel can cast two spells, both
heightened to half the participant’s level, rounded up.
They can cast the daze cantrip at will and get a second
spell that can be cast once during the duel. They choose
from the following when they roll initiative: fear, phantom
pain, or a common summoning spell (typically summon
animal, summon construct, summon fey, or summon lesser
servitor SoM for a 1st-level spell). If the creature can’t cast
spells, they gain these as innate occult spells until the end
of the psychic duel. If they can already cast spells, they
add these to their other spells and temporarily gain any
spell slots necessary to cast them (even if they
can’t cast spells of that level yet) that can be
used only for the additional spell. Natural
psychic spells use the higher of the
caster’s spell DC or class DC for their
spell DC, and that number – 10
for spell attack rolls.
GEAR AND COMPANIONS
When you enter a psychic duel, psychic
echoes of your gear travel with
you. An eidolon, familiar, animal
companion, or the like typically
appears as a psychic echo based on
your perception of it. However, the
GM might determine a particularly intelligent companion
joins its own mind into the psychic duel.
Movement and Location
Changing location is usually easy within a psychic duel, as
a participant can move at the speed of thought. It typically
takes only a single action to move to any location the
participant wants and range of attacks and spells rarely
matter much. You can usually run a psychic duel without
a grid. Functions of positioning and movement still matter,
but have a more flexible appearance. For instance, a
participant can Hide, but this likely means shaping the
imaginary environment around them to create a visual
screen, glowing phenomenon, or even psychic static.
Likewise, spells that immobilize or grab a creature can
prevent the easy movement detailed above.
BINARY MINDSCAPE STATISTICS
Psychic duels take place in a binary mindscape,
which is much like a very simple plane or
dimension. The stat block for a binary mindscape
is as follows and uses planar traits (Gamemastery
Guide 136).
BINARY MINDSCAPE
MINDSCAPE
FINITE
METAMORPHIC
SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY
A binary mindscape is formed of only two linked
minds and most often created to provide the arena
for a psychic duel. It’s typically simple in structure,
with basic details that become even more indistinct
at the edges of the duelists’ imaginations.
The alignment and time traits typically match
those of the plane on which the participants’ forms
are. A participant with particularly strong psychic
abilities might be able to warp the alignment to their
own or adjust the time trait (typically to timeless). In
a voluntary duel, adjustments like these need to be
agreed upon by all participants.

Psychic Duelist
(Archetype)
The mental landscape of the psychic duel rises to meet
your steps and reshapes at your touch. You understand the
binary mindscape links two minds, making its foundation
only as strong as the wills of those involved. Two psychic
castles in a siege—patch every loose brick in your walls
and single out every flaw in your foe’s defenses.

duels. Each time you enter a psychic duel, choose one of the
following benefits for the duration of that duel.
•	 Mind Mace You gain a status bonus to mental
damage with spells you cast equal to the spell’s
level.
•	 Psychic Fist You can use your standard ability modifier
for Strike damage instead of your highest mental

MENTAL
OCCULT
Prerequisites Psychic Duelist Dedication
Frequency once per day
You attempt to enter a psychic duel with a creature within 100
feet. The target can attempt a Will save against the higher of
your spell DC or class DC. If it enters the duel willingly, use the
result for a critical failure.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The two of you enter a psychic duel, but it ends
automatically at the end of your next turn. As normal for
a psychic duel, the duel ends if one participant is knocked
out, as well as under any other conditions to which both
participants agree. If you’re in initiative when you Instigate
the Psychic Duel, you keep the same initiative positions.
You can each choose a psychic center for any skill in which
you’re trained, as you would if you were using that skill to
roll initiative for the duel.
Failure As a success, except instead of ending at the end of your
next turn, the target can attempt a new save to end the duel
at the end of each of your turns, starting with your next turn.
Critical Failure As a success, except the duel doesn’t end
until it reaches one of the normal end conditions for a
psychic duel.

Mind Smith (Archetype)
“The mind makes it real.” Though uttered in many parts
of Golarion, nowhere is this more literal than perhaps
among mind smiths—those with a mysterious mental
talent that allows them to manifest their mind into a
physical object. Some gain this power through magical
training from an ancestor or mentor, while others earn
it as a gift or reward from some greater being, or by
inexplicable chance. Whatever the source, you have
mastered the ability to form a mental image into a
corporeal figment solid enough to affect the physical
world. You trained the power to aid you in battle by
shaping itself into a potent weapon, bound by only the
reaches of your own imagination.
MIND SMITH DEDICATION
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
You’ve learned to imagine a shape in your mind, to envision it
so strongly it takes form in the material world. You gain a single
melee weapon of your choosing, called a mind weapon. Your
mind weapon is a martial melee weapon. The overall shape and
design of your mind weapon can be of your choosing but it has
one of the following four basic statistics:
•	 A one-handed weapon that deals 1d4 damage and has the
agile and finesse traits
•	 A one-handed weapon that deals 1d6 damage and has the
finesse trait
•	 A one-handed weapon that deals d8 damage
•	 A two-handed weapon that deals 1d10 damage and has
the reach trait
Each day during your daily preparations, you can decide if
you want your weapon to deal bludgeoning damage and be
in the club weapon group, deal piercing damage and be in the
spear weapon group, or deal slashing damage and be in the
sword weapon group. Your mind weapon is an extension of your
mind—it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage
your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back
against the weapon’s corporeal form and becoming mental
damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken.
You can project your mind weapon using an Interact action,
just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold,
carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it
quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for
you to project again. If you’re disarmed of your mind weapon,
it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact
action starting at the beginning of your next turn.
Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a
mind smith’s keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a
bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and
inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can’t be a magic
item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the
value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe
fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your
keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon,
and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other
weapons or runestones for the usual cost. Any runes inscribed
on the keepsake apply to your mind weapon when you create
it. If your keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1
week of downtime imprinting a new object with your weapon’s
mental properties, though this new keepsake won’t have any of
the runes that were inscribed on the prior keepsake.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the mind smith archetype.

MALLEABLE MOVEMENT [free-action]
FEAT 2
ARCHETYPE
SKILL
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication, expert in Athletics
Trigger You Leap.
You shift the shape of your weapon to help you Leap farther
and faster. You shift your weapon into a long flexible pole,
climbing hook, or similar aid, adding an extra 5 feet to the
distance you’re able to Leap. As normal, this can’t increase the
distance of your Leap beyond your Speed.
GHOST BLADE [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
Frequency once per hour
You alter your weapon’s phase so it can more easily strike
incorporeal creatures. Your mind weapon gains the effects of a
ghost touch property rune for 1 minute.
JUST THE TOOL [one-action]
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You temporarily change your weapon’s shape to assist you in
the field. You morph your weapon into a single simple tool,
such as a shovel or crowbar, to help with a mundane task. You
can’t replicate entire tool kits with this ability. You can use this
action again to change your mind weapon back to a weapon.
MENTAL FORGE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
Your experiences in combat shape your mind’s capability to
strengthen and shape your weapon to match the way you
move in combat. Choose two of the following weapon traits to
give your mind weapon: grapple, modular (B, P, S), nonlethal,
shove, or trip. Once chosen, these weapon traits can’t be
changed unless you spend 1 week retraining your fighting
style to swap one property for another from the list.
MIND SHARDS [two-actions]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
CONCENTRATE
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind
weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind.
You concentrate and unleash a 15-foot cone that deals 3d6
mental damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Will
save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After
the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you
can’t use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards’ damage
increases by 1d6 at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.
MALLEABLE MENTAL FORGE
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mental Forge
You open your mind to further weapon customization. During
your daily preparations, you can choose any two weapon
traits from the Mental Forge feat to place on your weapon
for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations (whichever
comes first), replacing the traits you chose from the Mental
Forge feat. Each day you can swap the choices with any other
options on the list.
MIND PROJECTILES
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You have learned to stretch your mind’s influence further,
releasing projectiles with a swing of your mind weapon. You
can make ranged mind weapon Strikes; these are ranged
Strikes with a maximum range of 30 feet that deal 1d6
damage of the same type as your mind weapon. Your ranged
mind weapon Strike gains all the benefits of your mind
weapon’s runes as long as they still apply to a ranged weapon.
For example, if your weapon had +1, striking, and spell storing
runes, you would get a +1 item bonus to hit with your ranged
mind weapon Strike, and it would deal the additional damage
from the striking rune, but it wouldn’t be able to unleash a
spell from the spell storing rune, as that rune can be etched
onto only melee weapons.
RUNIC MIND SMITHING
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You focus your mind on thoughtforms of fundamental magical
forces, shaping them into a property rune that you mentally
etch onto your mind weapon. During your daily preparations,
choose one rune from the following list of weapon property
runes: corrosive, disrupting, flaming, frost, shock, and
thundering. You enhance your weapon with the chosen rune
until your next daily preparations. This rune counts toward
your maximum limit of runes as normal.
METALLIC ENVISIONMENT
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Mind Smith Dedication
You always account for every weakness, allowing your mind
to imagine just the right physical form to take advantage
of your opponents. Choose between cold iron or silver; all
your mind weapon Strikes are treated as the chosen type
of metal.
ADVANCED RUNIC MIND-SMITHING
FEAT 16
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Runic Mind Smithing
Your mind can hold onto more complicated patterns than ever
before. You can etch the greater forms of any runes on the list
from the Runic Mind Smithing feat and add them to the list of
options you can choose during your daily preparations, as well
as the anarchic, axiomatic, holy, or unholy runes.
In addition, once per day, you can spend 10 minutes of
uninterrupted focus to swap your daily prepared rune from
Runic Mind Smithing to another rune from the same list. Once
this swap is made, that second rune remains on the weapon
until your next daily preparations.

Sleepwalker (Archetype)
Many think of mental realms and mindscapes as rare and
elaborate constructions, forgetting that everyone creates
their own mental realm when they sleep, one where
even the strangest occurrences seem perfectly normal.
Anything is possible inside these dreamscapes, but few
sapient creatures have the will and insight to take control
and truly explore their unconscious mind.
Sleepwalkers dedicate themselves to unlocking the
secrets of the sleeping mind, taking control of their
dreams and walking through the slumbering vistas of
others. Some are nefarious manipulators, whispering
to the slumbering for personal gain. Others use their
powers for good, seeking evildoers and those who
corrupt dreams to nightmares. As their power grows,
a sleepwalker’s appearance gradually becomes slightly
indistinct, as though they were blurred around the
edges, and those who encounter them find it difficult to
recall exact details about their appearance.
SLEEPWALKER DEDICATION
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites expert in Occultism
You’ve learned to manipulate states of consciousness, beginning
with your own. You can send yourself into a half-awake,
daydreaming state and gain the Daydream Trance action.
Daydream Trance [one-action] (enchantment, mental, occult) You
fall into a half-sleeping trance. This lasts for 1 minute or
until you fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You
can voluntarily end your trance by taking a single action,
which has a concentrate trait, and succeeding at a Will save
against your own class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
Once your trance ends, you can’t enter a Daydream Trance
again for 1 minute. While you’re in your trance, you gain the
following effects:
•	 You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. This bonus
increases to +2 against mental effects. If you’re
legendary in Occultism, the bonus against mental
effects increases to +3.
•	 You take a –1 penalty to Perception checks and
initiative rolls.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat until you
have gained two other feats from the sleepwalker archetype.
INFILTRATE DREAM
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
OCCULT
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
Entering a dream is as natural to you as stepping through a
doorway. If you’re adjacent to a sleeping creature, you can enter
a lucid dreamlike state, a process taking 10 minutes, to mentally
walk into their dreamscape. While in the target’s dream, you
witness its contents, plots, and emotional experiences as an
observer, though nothing within the dream can perceive or
interact with you. Your target becomes temporarily immune
to Infiltrate Dream for 1 week. You can’t enter the dreams of a
creature that doesn’t have a conscious mind or doesn’t dream.
While within the dream, you can attempt an Occultism
check against the target’s Will DC to interpret symbolism and
learn information about a single topic. If the target has no
knowledge of the topic, you learn they don’t know about the
topic unless your result is a critical failure.
Critical Success You learn a piece of information directly
relevant to the topic unless the target would want to hide
it. If so, you learn something related to the topic but not a
direct answer.
Success You receive a hint or clue about the topic. This clue
will not be inaccurate, but it’s cryptic, vague, or may be
understandable only with additional information.
Critical Failure The dreams mislead you, and you learn an
erroneous piece of information.
VISION OF FORESIGHT [one-action]
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
FORTUNE
OCCULT
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
Requirements You’re in a Daydream Trance
You use your daydreams to predict the success of actions,
rapidly envisioning the possibilities. Once before the end of
your next turn, you can call upon these predictions before you
roll a saving throw or skill check. You can roll the saving throw
or skill check twice and take the better result.
DREAM MAGIC
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose
dream message or sleep upon taking this feat; you learn this
spell as a 4th-level innate occult spell. If you choose sleep,
you can cast the spell only while in a Daydream Trance. You
become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and
your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
Special You can take this feat twice, gaining the spell you
didn’t select initially the second time.
WAKING DREAM
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
While in your trance, you can blur the line between dreams
and reality for others. You gain the waking dream focus spell,
which you can use only while you’re in a Daydream Trance.
You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can
Refocus by taking a nap for 10 minutes. You become trained
in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting
ability for these spells is Wisdom.

Just before going to sleep, you can perform a 10-minute ward
to protect the slumber of up to eight creatures within 30 feet
of you. All creatures affected by the ritual gain a +4 status

haunting, or other effects influencing dreams (such as those
provided by this archetype) until your next daily preparations.
They heal double the usual amount of Hit Points from resting.

ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
OCCULT
Prerequisites Sleepwalker Dedication
You can transmit a sense of dreamy nonchalance. If you do
something especially strange or dangerous while you’re in
your Daydream Trance, such as entering a restricted area
or fighting someone in the street, any creature that isn’t one
of your allies must attempt a Perception check against your
class or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a success, it realizes
something is amiss, and on a failure, it believes nothing is out
of the ordinary. The creature can attempt a new check if you
start doing something else strange, but not if you continue
on the same course of action it already failed to notice
was peculiar.
Any hostile action by you or your allies against an
affected creature automatically ends the effect for that
creature. The GM might allow the creature a new check if
someone else brings your actions to its attention, such as if
someone you’re attacking calls out for help. When your trance
ends, affected creatures retain their memories of events
but likely still view them as unremarkable; unless they are
prompted to relate the events, they might not report them.

Adventure Background
When the Lone Archivist began to take special interest in
the casefiles he would later steal from the Archive, he knew
he’d need a private way to return to them, one that neither
the greater Dark Archive nor the Pathfinder Society would
know of. The PCs should know this network well by now:
the somnambulist’s bridge.
Not magically inclined himself, K.H.W. visited a friend of
his, a Magaambyan scholar named Elaro (LN male anadi
lore-speaker). The two first met during the Six Clouds
Incident, when K.H.W. was a young archivist stationed in
Nantambu. Elaro, many years his senior, would go on to
serve as a mentor and magical consultant for the archivist
on several cases of note, using his burgeoning research into
dreamscapes to help the archivist return to his memories
of past cases and examine them for new angles or details.
Upon hearing his friend needed a way to discreetly
return to the actual sites of certain unsolved cases, Elaro
found a way to modify his research to create a dream-based
transportation system. The bearer would dream a memory
so powerfully that they physically returned to the location
the memory was formed. However, the makeshift system
was unstable, degraded after a single use, and only enabled
a traveler to visit locations in a set order. Now that the PCs
have solved the other cases, clearing the somnambulist’s
bridge’s links to those regions, the bridge is empty,
returning to its default destination: the city where Elaro
created it. It stands ready for one last trip.
Getting Started
When the Dark Archive folio opens to the casefile for
this adventure, the PCs can easily note that a single flat,
turquoise bead is affixed to the page with a dab of adhesive,
matching the mask the Archivist’s note describes. The
bead glows slightly, visible through satchels or clothing,
as the PCs make their transit through the somnambulist’s
bridge. On the other side, they’re welcomed by the sounds
of a bustling market, burbling canals, and glass chimes
tinkling in the warm breeze of Nantambu.
The party can either explore the city or head straight
for the Magaambya to begin their search for the owner
of the armadillo mask. A PC can attempt a DC 25 Gather
THE LAST DREAM
For as many mysteries as there are covering our world, the spaces within the self can hold even stranger revelations. In
Nantambu, guided by the professor with the armadillo mask that matches this bead, I once had the opportunity to peer into
my own self. I saw something there, in that space within my memories... one day, I hope to return to it. —K.H.W.

Information check around town to learn more; a success
turns up rumors that there once was a scholar with an
armadillo mask, an anadi, who specialized in the study
of dreams and memory at the Magaambya, but he passed
away a few years ago. Luckily, his grandson Kedari
yet resides in Nantambu, and is likewise a student at
the Magaambya.
A PC who succeeds at a DC 28 Society check can learn
that the mask matching the bead was likely made by a
Magaambyan scholar of attendant rank, who likely then
kept the mask throughout their academic career. The
mask has a strong divination aura.
VISITING THE MAGAAMBYA
The party can locate
Kedari (NG
male anadi conversant) in one of the
Magaambya’s libraries, perusing scrolls
with his classmate and fiancé, Ieme
(CN male human conversant). The
stranger-shy Kedari adopts his humanoid
form quickly at the sight of unexpected
visitors. At first, when inquired about his
grandfather, Kedari denies knowing
anything about his research, but his
evasive attitude changes once the
party shows him the bead.
Kedari’s jaw goes slack. “I don’t
believe it! I thought Grandpa was
covering my eyes with Grandmother
Spider’s web the entire time.” Looking
at the bead, Kedari pulls a turquoise
armadillo mask from his pack. “The magic
still pulses, how amazing... may I?” He reaches out for the
bead, which fits perfectly into a notch on the mask’s ear.
Once the PCs hand the bead over, Kedari will happily
answer any questions they have to the best of his abilities.
How did the bead end up with us? “According to
Grandpa, he used to work with some detective or hunter
or something like that, this Avistani-Tian man. He never
spoke much about the man, but he’d always tell stories
about scouring his research to help with a cursed tree or
demonic animal or what have you... honestly, the stories
would change a bit every time he told them. Anyway,
after the last job they did—something about haunted
rain, where he nearly lost his neck—he and the man went
out drinking around Nantambu to celebrate. He said he
gave the man that bead as a thanks for saving his neck all
those times over the years.”
What research did your grandfather do? “He worked on
what the Cascade Bearers call a Memory Realm.” Kedari
draws a circle with his hands as he describes. “The Uzunjati
branch prefer to call it the Storybook. Functionally, they
are the same. Think of it like... a demiplane that everyone
has inside them, made out of their memories.”
Can you help us access this man’s memory
realm? Kedari becomes extremely excited at the
idea of continuing his grandfather’s research.
“Actually, with this bead, I can! It’s been a while
since I read Grandpa’s research, but that bead is
almost certainly what he used to access the man’s
memory realm in the first place. I’ll need to modify
the ritual a bit, though...” Kedari looks to Ieme,
who nods supportively. With confidence,
the scholar snaps his fingers. “Let’s get
started! I’ll write up a list of books
we’ll need to retrieve.”
THE PROJECTION RITUAL
By cross-referencing the theories
in his grandfather’s research with
magical runes etched within the
bead itself, Kedari and Ieme extrapolate
the ritual that Elaro likely used to help the
Lone Archivist access his own personal memory
realm. Given the close association of dreams and memory,
Kedari deduces the entrance to any memory realm can be
located in the Dimension of Dreams, as long as sufficient
emotional guidance is provided at the moment of casting,
here in the form of the bead Elaro gave K.H.W. many
years ago. However, modifying the ritual will require a
few extra steps, which the PCs can help out with.
PCs can assist in the research effort with a successful DC
30 Arcana or Occultism check or a successful DC 28 Lore
check related to the Astral Plane or another planar subject.
Other PCs can search the city of Nantambu for rare dream
spider silk, a crucial component for the modified ritual,
which they can locate with a successful DC 30 Diplomacy
or Society check or a successful DC 28 Mercantile Lore
or Guild Lore check to locate a well-connected seller.
Once the PCs locate a vendor, Kedari is more than happy
to provide the funds necessary to purchase the silk from
his Cascade-Bearer stipend, as the ritual represents an
important piece of research into his family’s magical
theories. A PC can attempt only one check; if two or more
PCs succeed, then their aid empowers the ritual crossing,
granting all PCs a +1 status bonus to their checks in the
ABOUT THIS ADVENTURE
Recommended Level: Party of four 12th-level
characters.
The adventure begins with the PCs traveling
to Nantambu, where they must seek the aid of
a magical specialist to aid them in entering the
Storybook, a personal mindscape created by the
Lone Archivist. Breaking through the mindscape’s
defenses, they find themselves in a strange location
where they will have to sift through and confront
the Archivist’s memories to gain access to the last
secret of the Dark Archive.

Chase encounter to enter the Storybook (see Racing Down
Memory Lane, below).
The research takes until midnight, after which point
Kedari is ready. To reduce variables during the experimental
ritual, Kedari arranges for the casting to take place in a
private laboratory under layers of the Magaambya’s
finest magical wards. The scholar spins a web of magic,
connecting each PC to the armadillo mask, which flares in
dreamlike colors before the PCs fall into a gentle slumber.
RACING DOWN MEMORY LANE
MODERATE 12
Kedari’s ritual feels similar to the transits through the
somnambulist’s bridge, but somehow more complete—as
natural as falling asleep after a long day. When the shift is
complete, the party stands in a dreamlike, temperate forest
before the rotting walls of a two-story library. Books pile at
the foot of collapsed bookcases and shelves, their covers
marred by rain and mildew. Only a pair of darkwood doors
stand, frameless, among the trees and ruin.
The party comes across the entrance to what must be the
memory realm. With an appropriate DC 28 Society check
or DC 25 check with an appropriate Lore skill, such as
Pathfinder Society Lore, a PC can identify the doors as
the pair that once stood at the entrance to the Vaults of
the Grand Lodge in Absalom. As soon as the doors are
opened, the mindscape mounts a defense to keep out
intruders; read or paraphrase the following.
The doors swing forward easily with a creak. The forest grows
cold and dark behind you, storm winds rising to buffet you
inside even as the library’s interior blurs and shifts. Though
you’ve never been here, you can’t shake how familiar it all feels.
This encounter uses the Chase subsystem described on
page 156 of the Gamemastery Guide. If the party doesn’t
collectively acquire the number of Chase Points listed in
the obstacle by succeeding at the indicated skill checks
in one round, they only barely manage to outpace the
obstacle, taking the damage listed in the Penalty section.
BIRCHFROST KAIJU
OBSTACLE 12
Chase Points 4; Overcome DC 28 Acrobatics or Athletics to
dodge the Beast’s legs and falling trees, DC 30 Intimidation
to Demoralize the beast, DC 26 Arcana or Occultism to
counteract the jawbone
Cold, muggy mist drifts on the shores of the Lake of Mists
and Veils, though pieces of Yllaldo Castle are strewn through
the forest. The jawbone of Nolimarthos protrudes from the
water, and a deafening drone fills the air. When it ends, the
Birchfrost Beast emerges from the lake, growing in size with
each terrible blast of sound until it blots out the sun and the
ground shudders.
Penalty The Birchfrost Kaiju’s thundering steps deal 6d6
bludgeoning damage (DC 34 basic Reflex save) to all PCs.
IMPOSTORS AT THE OPERA
OBSTACLE 12
Chase Points 5; Overcome DC 28 Diplomacy or Intimidation
to get the two sides to back down, DC 30 Perception or
Society to identify or draw out the impostor
The Fullbloom Opera House is lovely this evening, the Lady
of the Harvest hanging on stage. “Heroes, your arrival is most
timely!” Jaynt or Vir (whoever the PCs sided with when they
played Shaking the Helping Hand) calls from the stage—but
there are two of her. “That impostor has sown seeds of doubt
into the minds of my allies. You must assist me!” says one from
stage left, while on stage right, the other decries, “Lies, smoke,
and mirrors! I’m the real one, and it’s YOU who have come to
destroy us from within!”
Penalty Having incorrectly identified the impostor, mirror
versions of the PCs appear behind them and plunge daggers
into their backs, dealing 2d6 piercing damage plus 2d6
precision damage.
MOTHER AND GRANDFATHER
OBSTACLE 12
Chase Points 3; Overcome DC 32 Stealth or Athletics to escape
from the confrontation, DC 30 Religion or Nature to ward
off the magic
The Womb of the World’s temple is strangely cold and covered
in snow. Ded Bolota looms tall in one corner, birch leaves and
snowflakes swirling threateningly around him, while Mother
Mitera rises in the other, held within an enormous wicker
avatar grown of moonflower vines. The two plant bodies begin
to brawl and launch bolts of natural magic as the waves of the
Obari Ocean crash.
Penalty The clash from the two creatures deals 3d6 cold damage
plus 3d6 poison damage (DC 34 basic Fortitude save).
FLASHBACK LOOP
OBSTACLE 12
Chase Points special (see below); Overcome special (see below)
Time surreptitiously loops. Return the PCs to the Birchfrost
Kaiju obstacle, describing it the same way as the first time.
The Overcome skills are the same, but their DCs are all one
lower, and the number of Chase Points required is also 1
lower. If the PCs clear this, return to the Impostors at the
Opera obstacle, then the Mother and Grandfather obstacle,
and then the chase ends. However, if at any point a PC
realizes this is a time loop, the Knife of Trouble Elimination
appears before them, and any PC can sever the loop to
automatically clear the obstacle and end the chase.
The Scattered Storybook
The crack in the kaleidoscope of memories widens, wind and
light bursting through before drawing in. The memories that
once stretched their ethereal claws now scream in anger,
reaching out as the ground drops and falls away, down,
down, down into the depths of a void.
Your back hits a door. It swings open. You stumble in. For
a moment, the world is suspended and weightless before
gravity reasserts itself towards the nearest surface: a perfectly
smooth, flat plane of vivid colors.

A strange, dreamlike space, littered with objects jutting out
of the plane or floating at odd angles with impossible gravity,
extends in all directions. The “ground” beneath you is marked
with a geometric symbol, split faintly into four parts that
extend in each cardinal direction—if such things even matter
in this strange realm.
THE CENTRAL GATE
Having made it through the mindscape’s defenses, the PCs
have landed in the exact center of the Storybook proper,
where all four sections of the mindscape intersect. Various
objects jut at odd angles out of the “ground,” which,
despite seeming like open space, is solid, like a pane of
glass made from pure color.
PCs who succeed at a DC 30 Arcana or Occultism check
realize that of the various symbols on the ground, one—
the blue circle with a white center—is some kind of gate
that will lead deeper into the mindscape, if only it could be
assembled completely. Upon succeeding at this check, they
also realize the mindscape can be rearranged if the correct
anchor objects are found, which are likely located in each
area marked by the segments of the symbol on the ground.
Rearrangements: The realm is divided in four
rectangular sections that can both rotate and swap with
each other. As the mindscape can shift freely and often,
consider using four separate flip-mats, print-outs, or other
types of map at your game table that you can rearrange
as the mindscape shifts; if playing digitally, consider
preparing multiple map files or layers. Controlling a
section of the Storybook requires that a creature have
the “anchor” for that section—a metaphysical object
that enables the creature to Reshape the Mindscape. A
creature can have only one anchor, though it can willingly
relinquish the anchor if it chooses. An anchor leaves any
creature that falls unconscious.
RESHAPE THE MINDSCAPE [two-actions]
CONCENTRATION
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have the anchor for a given section of the
Storybook.
You impose your will on the Storybook to alter its structure.
Choose one of the following effects, which applies to the
section of map for which you have the anchor.
Rearrange You swap the position of your section of map with
another. To use this ability, you and the anchor-holder for
the other section must agree to the transposition.
Redirect You create a momentary redirection of gravity
toward one of the four edges of the map, causing creatures
to fall in that direction until they hit the edge of the map
or an obstacle, or until they cross into a new section of
map with normal gravity. Creatures who fall more than 40
feet within the Storybook are affected by a feather fall
effect, as they have time to subconsciously reject the false
reality of the mindscape.
Reorient You rotate the section of map by 90 degrees, either
clockwise or counterclockwise.
A. THE CHILDHOOD BEDROOM
LOW 12
This cozy bedroom clearly belongs to an inquisitive child.
Sturdy shelves next to the four-poster bed contain storybooks
and friendly informational volumes on the wonders of Golarion.
Creature: A metaphorical manifestation of K.H.W.’s
childhood curiosity has taken the form of a shining child
and inhabited this bedroom. The sight of strangers excites
the astral creature, who attempts to get the PCs to tell him
a story. While the shining child has no intention of letting
the PCs leave alive, if a PC tells him a good story and
succeeds at a DC 29 Performance or Society check, the
shining child is so engrossed he forgets he can Reshape the
Mindscape and doesn’t use this ability during the ensuing
combat. If the PCs don’t tell a satisfactory story (or refuse
to attempt one), the shining child attacks anyway.
ELITE SHINING CHILD
CREATURE 13
Pathfinder Bestiary 6, 292
Initiative Perception +25
Reshape the Mindscape The shining child controls the anchor
for section A.
Treasure: Defeating the shining child causes a mystical
tome, the anchor for this section of the mindscape, to
emerge from the bookshelf by the bed. When a PC takes
possession of the tome, it fuses into their body, granting
them the ability to Reshape the Mindscape on section A
of the map.
B. THE IRONWORKS
Three valves protrude from the wall above a polished dial and
mechanical wheel. A few feet away, the pipes empty into a
round glass flask.
The valves and machinery here represent K.H.W.’s comfort
with his fellow archivists, knowing that every part of
their larger endeavor is operating well. The anchor for
this section of map—a dial polished to a mirror sheen—
can be easily removed from the machinery, but doing so
releases steam that deals 6d6 fire damage (DC 32 basic
Reflex save) to any creature within a 20-foot emanation
of the wheel when the dial is removed.
Treasure: The mirror in the face of the dial is the anchor
for this section of the map. When a PC takes possession of
the mirror, it fuses into their body, granting them the ability
to Reshape the Mindscape on section B of the map.
C1. THE TREE OF TIME
This large fig tree quickly cycles through its life phases:
sprouting new leaves, blooming, bearing fruit, and withering.
Only a list of virtues, carved in Tien into its bark, remains
unchanged as the tree morphs.

This tree is a memory of one that K.H.W. loved when he
was growing up in Goka. Any PCs who speak Tien can
decipher the virtues listed as: loyalty, patience, honesty,
frugality, and humility. If a creature speaks these virtues
in Tien to the tree, all creatures adjacent to it recover Hit
Points as if they had a full night’s rest as magic accelerates
their natural healing. The tree’s power is then spent for
1 day.
C2. THE CLOCK
MODERATE 12
Light shines from a large, heavy grandfather clock that ticks
steadily as it hovers in midair. The clock’s hands seem to spin
faster and faster as you stare at it, yet they never seem to
reach midnight. The longer the hands spin, the stronger a
strange worry within you grows: time ceaselessly marches on.
This clock represents K.H.W.’s fear of lacking the time
needed to uncover truth. Within the clock is a source of light:
a lantern. However, the clock also has a deadly surprise.
Hazard: Bladed cogs and clock hands attempt to slice any
creature that opens the clock to shreds.
FLENSING BLADES (2)
HAZARD 12
Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide 81
Treasure: The lantern, the anchor for this section, can
be extracted from the clock once the hazards are disabled.
When a PC takes possession of the lantern, it fuses into
their body, granting them the ability to Reshape the
Mindscape on section C of the map.
D. THE FATHOMLESS DEPTHS
MODERATE 12
A rectangular space has seemingly been cut out of the floor
here, creating a pool of water so deep the bottom is beyond
sight. A tightrope connects the shore to a platform in the
center, where a chalice pours forth water endlessly.
Creature: To help it lure creatures into its depths, the
pool conjures a rusalka—a creature K.H.W. has been
scared of since he first moved to Avistan as a child.

Hazard: As a manifestation of the Archivist’s fear of the
unknown (as well as his more literal fear of the ocean), the
pool seeks to tempt creatures into the pond and trap them.

Description The pool sucks in creatures that fall into it, making
them sink into its endless depths.
Disable DC 32 (master) Diplomacy or Deception to quell the
fear and calm the pool or DC 35 Intimidation to give the
pool something worse to fear; three successes required.
Downpour [reaction] Trigger A creature falls into the pool; Effect
More water pours forth from the chalice. Creatures in the
pool become clumsy 1, and they can’t decrease their clumsy
condition so long as they remain in the pool. The trap then
rolls initiative.
Routine (3 actions) Water from the chalice increases the
depth of the water by 10 feet for each action. Each time this
happens, creatures in the pool are pushed 10 feet down and
take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. As the pool has no bottom,
creatures in it can fall down indefinitely; they must Swim
up to avoid drowning, but the water is especially choppy,
so the Athletics DC is 25. The pool never overflows. Each
successful check to Disable reduces the pool’s actions by
1, and once the pool is completely Disabled, the water
becomes still and the Athletics DC to Swim becomes 10.
Reset The trap resets once there are no moving creatures in it.
Treasure: The chalice, the anchor for this section, is
clearly visible as the source of the flood. When a PC takes
possession of the chalice, it fuses into their body, granting
them the ability to Reshape the Mindscape on section D
of the map (and removing the ability from the rusalka, if
they’re still alive).
THROUGH THE CENTRAL GATE
When the PCs have control of all four anchors and
have used them to Reshape the Mindscape, rotating and
rearranging the four areas to complete the blue gate at the
center, the following inscription around the circumference
of the gate becomes clear.
Truth
From here springs forth curiosity, brilliant and joyous
Alone I pursue knowledge, befriending unsettling dreams
Grueling is the work, yet its rewards remain supreme
When the inscription is aloud, the center of the gate
opens and the PCs can proceed through.
E. CENTER OF THE MIND
SEVERE 12
Beyond the gateway, the colors of the memory realm fade away
and everything falls through a black void, drifting further apart.
All around, flashes of mysteries from every corner of Golarion
illuminate the darkness—an unidentified object appearing
in the night sky, a strange dagger trading hands across the
land, a massive claw visible in a thunderstorm. A collection of
rocks comes into view below, floating among the memories.
Red strings connect each memory to another, forming a web
of connections, but all the strings eventually wind their way
toward a humanoid figure, bound in the center of the mindscape.
Use the map on page 212 for this area. Each PC lands
safely on a different chunk of land and will likely try to
make their way towards the figure on the central island.
Though worn and frayed, the ropes that span from island
to island are sturdy enough to cross with a successful
DC 30 Acrobatics check to Balance. If a character slips,
they fall 100 feet before landing (taking falling damage
as normal) in the location they started as space loops
vertically around them in this strange mindscape.
Creature: On the central rock, the figure—a
middle-aged man with unkempt hair and a short beard,
wrapped in red cords—turns his attention from the
kaleidoscope of memories that bloom in the dark, a look
of rapt and wistful attention in the eyes below his bushy
brows. He speaks willingly, and his responses to some of
the PCs’ likely questions are below:
Who are you? / Are you “K.H.W.”? / Are you the
archivist who wrote this folio? “…No. Somewhat?
I’m... an imprint of him, an echo left here in this realm
to guard something. A secret. Something left here
for safekeeping.”
Then, can you tell us about K.H.W. / the Dark Archive?
The Echo is happy to talk to fellow delvers of the
unknown, asking the PCs what they’ve seen and giving
comprehensive (if slightly rambling) answers if asked
about the minutiae of any mystery encountered by the
Dark Archive. Feel free to reveal any of the information in
the incident reports, casefiles, or GM-facing information
in the adventures throughout this book. However, he finds
that any information about deeper secrets of the Dark
Archive, and even the Lone Archivist’s real name, have
been redacted from his mind. If pushed to remember, he
becomes increasingly disoriented and hostile.
What kind of secret do you mean? The Echo unfurls
a hand, and a single crumpled page appears in it. The
page is torn along one edge and clearly matches those of
the Dark Archive folio. “I’m not sure. I can see there’s
writing here, but I can’t make it out. I imagine it’s
been redacted from my view, just like the memories I
can’t remember.”
Can you give it to us? Read or paraphrase the following
to begin the final encounter of the adventure.
A wistful expression crosses the Echo’s face. “Indeed... I’m
supposed to entrust the secret to whoever can make it here, to
the center of this realm.” He looks out at the various memories
in the void, flitting through an infinite variety of strange
creatures and phenomena. The Echo closes his hand, the
crumpled page disappearing as quickly as it appeared, and the
red strings throughout the mindscape twang and snap as he
lurches himself free and drops to the rock below. The snapped
strings all wind toward the Echo, wrapping onto the curious
spindle in one of his hands and attaching to the dull blade in
his other. “But once I do, my business here will be done, my
dream of the Archive over… and I’m not ready for the dream
to end.”

The Echo opens with his Spindle’s Web ability, which
he uses as often as he can. He prefers to attack at middle
range with his rope dart, using his Astral Thread Control
to attack vulnerable pairs of PCs. Once he has fewer than
half his Hit Points, he relocates frequently; as the call of the
void doesn’t target him, he often moves across the red ropes
or teleports to other islands to gain a tactical advantage
against the PCs and ensure the island he’s on still has mental
essence if he needs to heal himself. He knows his existence
will unravel as soon as he surrenders the crumpled folio
page to the PCs, and so fights until destroyed.

Destabilized Form When the Echo has fewer than 140 Hit
Points, his form destabilizes, large chunks disintegrating
from his face, limbs, and torso. White moths constantly
stream from the missing spaces, creating a 10-foot emanation
that deals 6d6 mental damage with a DC 34 basic Will save.
As long as the aura persists, he can dissolve into moths and
re-form at another location within 15 feet as a free action
at the beginning of each of his turns; this has the occult,
conjuration, and teleportation traits.
Attack of Opportunity [reaction] The Echo has reach 15 for the purpose
of determining when Attack of Opportunity triggers and
when making Attacks of Opportunity.
Speed 25 feet

Astral Spindle Implement The Echo carries a drop spindle
that constantly spins red astral thread, which is both his
thaumaturgic implement and weapon. If his rope dart is
lost or broken, he can re-form it with an Interact action. If
he critically succeeds at a rope dart Strike, overwhelming
thoughts and figments flow down the thread into the target’s
mind. The target becomes confused for 1 round.
Astral Thread Control [one-action] Frequency once per round;
Requirements The Echo’s previous action was a successful
thrown rope dart Strike; Effect The Echo flicks his wrist and
makes a follow-up thrown rope dart Strike at a different
target within 30 feet of the first target, using the same
multiple attack penalty as his previous Strike. Regardless of
whether his attack hits, he then retrieves the weapon.
Contingency Oathday-Nine-Rova [free-action] Frequency once per day;
Trigger The Echo’s turn begins and he’s stunned, slowed,
confused, controlled, immobilized, grabbed, paralyzed,
restrained, or otherwise can’t act; Effect The Echo has set
up numerous contingencies in the event he’s compromised.
Talismans on his body shatter, counteracting the triggering
effect. The Echo can use this free action even if he can’t act.
Reconstitute from Thought
[one-action]
(necromancy,
healing)
Requirements The Echo is standing on one of the eight large
islands of the map, and the island hasn’t darkened; Effect The
Echo throws his rope dart into the island and uses it to absorb
mental essence from the mindscape, repairing himself. He
regains 45 Hit Points and the island turns a desaturated gray
for 1 day, preventing future absorption and disabling the call
of the void hazard on that island (see below).
Spindle’s Web [two-actions] The Echo’s spindle revolves faster and faster
until it’s a blur, lashing red threads in every direction. The
threads deal 7d6 slashing damage and 7d6 mental damage
to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation, with a DC 34 basic
Reflex save. If a creature fails its save, the threads awaken
the mindscape anchor within it, affecting it differently based
on which anchor that creature used to gain access to the
center of the mindscape. (If there is a PC who didn’t absorb a
mindscape anchor, for instance because there are more than
four PCs in the party, then use the anchor of the PC closest to
them.) The Echo then can’t use Spindle’s Web for 1d4 rounds.
•	 Lantern The lantern outlines the creature with searing
faerie fire that deals 2d6 persistent fire damage.
•	 Mirror The mirror reflects the creature to another location,
teleporting them to a clear space within 25 feet of their
current location.
•	 Chalice The chalice drains life force, granting the Echo
temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt.
•	 Tome The tome floods the creature’s mind with information;
the target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Hazard: A manifestation of K.H.W.’s curiosity, now
turned to malevolent ends, lures those who approach the
void below the islands ceaselessly into its depths.
CALL OF THE VOID
HAZARD 12
UNIQUE

Stealth DC 25 (expert) to notice a slight tugging feeling
Description A supernatural compulsion to leap into the
unknown exerts itself on anyone who approaches the ledge.
Disable DC 34 Occultism or DC 36 Arcana to expel the magical
compulsion from the current island and from any of the red
ropes directly attached to it, darkening the rope in color. The
Echo also automatically disables the hazard from any island
he’s standing on, and any of the red ropes directly attached to
it, when he Reconstitutes from Thought on that island.
Leap into the Unknown [reaction] (enchantment, mental); Trigger A
creature enters a square adjacent to the ledge of an island
or steps onto one of the red ropes; Effect The call of the
void tugs at the mind of intruders, compelling them to leap off
the ledge. The creature must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or
DC 32 Acrobatics check to Balance or else drop off the ledge.
If the creature falls off, it drops 100 feet, loops through the
closed space of the mindscape, and lands in the square it fell

from, taking falling damage as normal (usually 50 bludgeoning
damage). The call of the void then rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The call targets all creatures adjacent to a
ledge or on one of the red ropes and tugs at their minds. A
creature who has already fallen this round is immune.
Reset The call of the void persists as long as the Echo exists,
though it doesn’t activate until the Echo has rolled initiative.
The hazard resets each day.
Conclusion
As the final blow is struck, the Echo
collapses in a storm of white moths
that scatter in every direction, leaving
cracks in the fabric of the mindscape itself.
Soon, the PCs are ejected, landing wherever it
was that they first opened the somnambulist’s bridge
to travel to Nantambu. When the air clears, all that’s left
is the crumpled paper the Echo refused to hand over: the
Lone Archivist’s last secret.
If a PC unfolds the paper, they find an iron key in
the shape of the Dark Archive’s symbol that turns,
ever so slightly, in their hand, pointing someplace
distant like the needle of a compass tugging north.
The paper bears the following note.
I know there’s a chance no one ever reads this. Even so:
If you hold this page, you are first among the successors to
the Dark Archive. You’ve passed the test I set here—but more
vitally, before that, you untangled the threads I couldn’t. As I
can’t share this astonishing success with you in person, please
let me say well done, and that you have my eternal gratitude.
As I wrote in my first letter, there’s no true substitute for
experience. Your path here has provided plenty of that, but
I hope it also brought you the joys this work can hold: the
comfort of camaraderie, the satisfaction of success.
I have one final gift for you: the key to my vault, where I’ve
stored enough secrets to fill a thousand casefiles. Follow it, and
it will show you the way—to Absalom, to the vault, and to me.
I said I wouldn’t be the last archivist. Thank you for
proving me right. The unknown beckons.
Until we meet, my fellow Dark Archivists,
—K.H.W.
Continuing the
Adventure
After completing the final adventure, the PCs will have
crossed Golarion and uncovered many of its mysteries—
but each new impossible discovery expands the potential
that your party of 12th-level archivists can explore!
Unsolved Cases: While the PCs have explored the eight
main mysteries of the stolen files, there remain many
other incident reports to explore. Consider using one as
the lead-in to your party’s next adventure!
Finding the Archive: The PCs now have a key that
opens K.H.W.’s last vault, which they know is somewhere
in or around Absalom. The vault is the perfect jumping-off
point for further investigations into the unknown,
whether it’s a creature or artifact getting loose, another
open file to explore, or even the adventure of finding the
vault, and its last secrets, in the first place.
Rival Archivists: The PCs’ adventures across Golarion,
or their new possession of the vault key, might attract
the attention of secret societies, cults, or stranger groups.
Agents of these factions might approach—or hunt—the
PCs during their next adventure for digging too deep!

magical consumables such as scrolls and talismans. When a
character creates consumable items, they can make them in
batches of four. CR 559–571, APG 252–259

establishes an agreement between multiple parties and

that make them stranger and more mysterious. 58–61

stars. Believed to be home to beings far beyond the
comprehension of mortals and even deities.

esoterica (trait) The esoterica trait is present in many
thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the
various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects
you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait
require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them.
Normally, you’re assumed to always have your esoterica with
you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not
have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you. 33

the Inner Sphere. It allows for travel within the Inner Planes.

evocation (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the evocation school of magic, typically

mode. CR 234

ancestry. Fetchlings were once human, but generations of life
on the Shadow Plane have transformed them.
fey (trait) Creatures of the First World are called fey.
finite (trait) Planes with this trait consist of a limited amount
of space.
fire (trait) Effects with the fire trait deal fire damage or either
conjure or manipulate fire. Those that manipulate fire have no
effect in an area without fire. Creatures with this trait consist
primarily of fire or have a magical connection to that element.
First World A plane that overlaps the Material Plane and is
said to be a “rough draft” of existence. It is home to vibrant
landscapes and fey.
force (trait) Effects with this trait deal force damage or create
objects made of pure magical force.
fortune (trait) A fortune effect beneficially alters how you
roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune
effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would
apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and
a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two
cancel each other out, and you roll normally. CR 449
gargantuan (size) CR 473–475
Garund One of Golarion’s continents. Its northern portion
makes up the southern half of the Inner Sea region.
general (trait) CR 255
good (trait) Good effects often manipulate energy from

servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature with
this trait is good in alignment. An ability with this trait can
be selected or used only by good creatures.
haunt (trait) CR 520–529
hazard Hazards are non-creature dangers that adventurers
encounter on their journeys, including environmental hazards,

healing (trait) A healing effect restores a creature’s body,

defined by its hero-gods and cyclopean sages.
illusion (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the illusion school of magic, typically
involving false sensory stimuli. CR 298
incapacitation (trait) CR 301
incarnate (trait) A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in
theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn’t conjure
a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned,
the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish
Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate
creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another
movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then
takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of
specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the
word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits.
A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your
interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies
as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but
ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates
that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines
what the incarnate does. It might become more inclined to
do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings.
The incarnate isn’t fully a creature. It can’t take any
other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes,
spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target
or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for
the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it
doesn’t block movement. If applicable, its effects use your
spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.
Inner Sea Region The collective name for the continent of Avistan
and the northern portion of Garund, surrounding the Inner Sea.
invested (trait) CR 531
Irrisen A nation in northwestern Avistan. Known for its
constant winter and rule by the winter witches.

an item bonus or penalty to certain checks. CR 270–295,

	 cursed items 160–161
	 cryptid gear 62–63
	 secret society gear 82–83

school of magic.
Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition

mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any
save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits
matching damage types it no longer deals. 13
misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters
how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one
misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune
effects would apply, the GM decides which is worst and
applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would
apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and
you roll normally. CR 449
move (trait) An action with this trait involves moving from one
space to another. CR 473–475
necromancy (trait) Effects and magic items with this trait are
associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically

Damage from a nonlethal effect or weapon knocks a creature
out rather than killing it. You can use a nonlethal weapon to

rare (trait) This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult
to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is
available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the
game, typically through discovery during play. CR 13
reach (weapon trait) This weapon is long and can be used to

	 apocryphal domain spells 142–144
	 deviant spells 104–107
	 mindscape rituals 199
	 cult rituals 145–147
	 temporal spells 181–183
spirit (trait) Spirits are ephemeral creatures defined by their
spiritual essence. They often lack a material form.
splash (trait) CR 544
subjective gravity (trait) On planes with this trait, all bodies
of mass can be centers of gravity with the same amount of
force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it.
summoned (trait) A creature called by a spell or effect gains the
summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other
creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a
cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or
higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the
summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon
spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the
standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks
your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate
with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines
the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the
summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn
or other creature generated from a summoned creature
returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of
spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear
what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned
creatures can be banished by various spells and effects.
They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points
or if the spell that called them ends.
Sustain a Spell [one-action] (action) CR 304
Sustain an Activation [one-action] (action) CR 534
sweep (weapon trait) CR 283
talisman (trait) A talisman is a small object affixed to armor,
a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be
wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached
to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently.
CR 565–570, APG 256
teleportation (trait) Teleportation effects enable you to
instantaneously move from one point in space to another.
Teleportation doesn’t usually trigger reactions based
on movement.
tempting curses Special curses that can be tapped more deeply
for power, though at a price. 162–163
tethered (weapon trait) This weapon is attached to a length
of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has
left your hand. If you have a free hand, you can use an
Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after
you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been
disarmed (unless it is being held by another creature).
thaumaturge (class) 30–47
	 implements 36–42
	 multiclass archetype 49

thaumaturge class.
thrown (weapon trait) CR 283

the Inner Sea region, past Casmaron.

characters of nearly any ancestry in place of a heritage
specific to a single ancestry. APG 28–29
visual (trait) A visual effect can affect only creatures that can
see it. This applies only to visible parts of the effect, as
determined by the GM. CR 301
Vudra A vast peninsula in southeastern Casmaron. It is home
to the Vudrani people.
water (trait) Effects with the water trait either manipulate
or conjure water. Those that manipulate water have no
effect in an area without water. Creatures with this trait
consist primarily of water or have a magical connection to
that element.

RULEBOOK
RULEBOOK
Enter the Paranormal!
From the fringes the unknown beckons, and the eight lost files of the
Dark Archive arm you to explore, understand, and confront it. Unleash
the untold power of your mind as the new psychic class or leverage
supernatural secrets and mystic implements as the thaumaturge! As
you pore over each casefile, you’ll find paranormal player options
like divine magic wielded by secret cults, eldritch pacts with powerful
entities, and archetypes to skip through time. If you’re a GM, you’ll
find options to turn your creatures into rumored cryptids, new rules for
unexplained powers and mental battles, and more. Each file concludes
with a short adventure to immerse players in the unknown, spanning
every corner of the Age of Lost Omens campaign setting!
