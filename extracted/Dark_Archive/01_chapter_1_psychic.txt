MIOS
Mios was once a simple coach driver in
Ustalav. When they were bitten by a
werewolf, Mios thought their fate was
sealed. After trying every superstition
they knew, they somehow remained
human on the next full moon. They
resolved then and there to protect innocents
from the creatures lurking in the dark, lantern in hand.
THALEON
An impulsive artist from Rahadoum—
where religion is forbidden—Thaleon
was empathic even as a young elf.
When a sandstorm assailed his
home, his emotions awakened latent
psychic magic. Now, he wanders, each
feeling or experience a new shade of color
on his mental canvas.

THE ARCHIVIST’S
TRAINING MANUAL
CLASSES AND MULTICLASS ARCHETYPES
Two new classes, the psychic and the thaumaturge, dive into the paranormal. The psychic manifests occult
magic from the depths of their mind, while the thaumaturge masters esoteric secrets and mystic implements.
This chapter introduces both classes, as well as their multiclass archetypes for those who wish to dabble.
The Dark Archive has a use for all manner of agents, from
bookish scholars to athletic soldiers, upstanding priests to
clever specialists. Each necessary, each skilled. Yet we deal
with the unknown, and two agents touch the unknown
most directly: the psychic and the thaumaturge.
This is perhaps more literally true with the psychic.
While we know much of magic, the psychic’s power
comes not from generations of ancient blood or the
grace of a being beyond existence, but from nothing
more than their own mortal mind. I wonder whether
all that separates the novice psychic, straining to lift a
feather, from the master who restructures reality with
a thought is not actually their raw power, but that the
master simply believes (or realizes) that fewer limits
apply to them.
Where the psychic may embody the unknown, the
thaumaturge opposes it. Never have I seen archivists go
so quickly from first contact with an unknown beast, to
identifying what folk wisdom or bit of relic will repel it,
to putting it down with swift efficiency. Yet, for all they
oppose of the paranormal, they’re wise enough to use it
themselves. Thaumaturges sprinkle grave dirt or monster
blood on their weapons or use a broken talisman to link
cause and effect because they know that in many cases,
the best way to oppose the unknown is by wielding the
unknown itself.
Working together, a psychic and a thaumaturge have all
the tools to succeed in the Archive’s work. The psychic’s
magic is well suited to perceive and defend against
the formless entities we so often encounter, reaching
into these beings’ minds or shaping force around their
discorporated forms. The thaumaturge’s broad knowledge
and mastery of rumors, trinkets, and superstitions makes
them practically an archive unto themself, with a tool
for any occasion. When dispatched as a team, a psychic
and a thaumaturge complement each other well: the
physical skill-at-arms of a thaumaturge covering for the
more cerebral psychic, and the psychic’s self-sufficient
magic always at reach even when a thaumaturge has long
expended their last talisman.
It is my hope that this training manual gives you all the
information you need to decide which path suits you best
as you begin your journey to catalog—and if necessary,
oppose—the unknown.

Guided by the personal combination
of their subconscious and conscious
mind, a psychic calls forth occult magic

more on the moment than on daily spell
slots, wielding unique, versatile cantrips
and unleashing their mind to use strange and
powerful abilities.

Amp You or one target of the spell are surrounded by a spiral of
torn space. This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the
emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in
the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes 1d6 slashing
damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic
Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically
fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls prone.
The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You
can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.
16TH LEVEL
CONSTANT LEVITATION
FEAT 16
PSYCHIC
Your power has unbound you from the earth below. You’re
affected by a constant fly spell, and when your Psyche is
Unleashed, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed.
TARGET OF PSYCHIC IRE
FEAT 16
AMP
EVOCATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic
energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal
amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more
actions to cast and targets a creature.
Amp Choose one target of the spell. Psychic phenomena turn
themselves on the target—typically, objects fling themselves
at the creature. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns,
it takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each spell level of the
psi cantrip this amp was added to, with a basic Reflex save.
The target remains marked by psychic ire for 3 rounds. The
effect persists even if you fall unconscious or leave the area.
WANDERING THOUGHTS [free-action]
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
TELEPORTATION
Frequency once per round
Requirements You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell.
When your Psyche is Unleashed, each burst of magic you cast
also folds space around you, and you travel through one of
those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.
18TH LEVEL
ALL IN YOUR HEAD [reaction]
FEAT 18
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Trigger You’re about to attempt a Fortitude save or a
Reflex save.
Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your
veins—you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect
you if you don’t believe in it. You attempt a Will save against
the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You
don’t gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on
this save.
CRANIAL DETONATION [free-action]
FEAT 18
DEATH
MINDSHIFT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per round
Trigger You successfully reduce one or more non-mindless
enemies to 0 Hit Points with a spell.
As your overwhelming psyche fells a creature, you use its
flickering consciousness to detonate psychic energy from the
creature’s head. Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and
its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave
in a 15-foot emanation around that enemy. Each creature in any
of the emanations takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic
Reflex save. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points,
its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and
potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take
damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.
DEEPEST WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
PSYCHIC
You’ve glimpsed the furthest recesses of your mind. If you have
spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused,
you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus, even if you spent
your Focus Points on spells other than psychic abilities.
20TH LEVEL
BECOME THOUGHT
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
TRANSMUTATION
You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure
thought. This has the following effects.
•	 You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5
to mental damage and weakness 10 to any effect that deals
damage by targeting the spirit, such as spirit blast.
•	 You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes
a single action, which has the concentrate trait, has the
effects of illusory disguise, and lasts until you change your
appearance again.
•	 Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to
life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on
your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to
reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the
vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
MIND OVER MATTER
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
Your mind’s limits are only what you imagine them to be. You
gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
TWIN PSYCHE
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
You’ve segmented your psyche so it can operate in tandem.
When you Unleash your Psyche, you can double its duration.
UNLIMITED POTENTIAL [one-action]
FEAT 20
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per minute
The laws of magic can limit your mind only if you think you
need them, and you’ve grown past the need for such limits. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has
no duration, you don’t expend the prepared spell as you cast it.

PSYCHIC
The mind can perceive truths hidden to fine-tuned instruments, house more
secrets than any tome, and move objects and hearts more deftly than any lever. By
delving into both the conscious and subconscious aspects of your inner self, you
have awoken to the might of psychic magic, allowing you to cast spells not through
incantations or gestures but by the power of your will alone. While the thin line between
your mind and reality means that a single errant thought could have unintended consequences for
yourself and your companions, you know that anything is possible, if you can imagine it.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain the listed
proficiency ranks in the following
statistics. You are untrained in
anything not listed unless you gain
a better proficiency rank in some
other way.
PERCEPTION
Trained in Perception
SAVING THROWS
Trained in Fortitude
Trained in Reflex
Expert in Will
SKILLS
Trained in Occultism
Trained in a number of additional skills
equal to 3 plus your Intelligence
modifier
ATTACKS
Trained in simple weapons
Trained in unarmed attacks
DEFENSES
Untrained in all armor
Trained in unarmored defense
SPELLS
Trained in occult spell attack rolls
Trained in occult spell DCs
HIT POINTS
6 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number
of HP by this number at 1st level and
every level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
INTELLIGENCE OR CHARISMA
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Intelligence or
Charisma, as determined by your
choice of subconscious mind.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You rely on your collection of psychic cantrips as a mainstay, choosing
where and when to amplify them for maximum effect. You weave your
more conventional spells into the fray where more complex magic is needed,
unleashing your mind’s full potential in a blaze of power when the time is right.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You navigate situations guided by the source of your subconscious power. If
your power springs from your personality, you might maneuver with empathy
and sociability; if it’s more cerebral, you might provide a steady logical front.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You keep your mind’s eye open for the many paranormal threats that those
who are less sensitive might not detect. Typically, you either scan for magic
or investigate for psychic impressions, veiled thoughts, and wandering spirits.
IN DOWNTIME...
You strive to learn more about the depths of the mind, seeking out new spells
and phenomena to uncover, knowing that as you gain a deeper understanding
of yourself, you can access more of the power within. You test the limits of your
adaptability by retraining to fit your evolving understanding of your potential.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Show a preference for learning, meditation, dreams, or other intangible
manifestations of thought over the immediacy of the physical world.
•	 Learn new things about yourself, just when you thought you knew it all.
•	 Think of your psychic magic as so much a part of you that you use it even
when normal methods suffice, perhaps preferring to communicate via mental
messages or levitating an object to a companion at the opposite end of a table.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Are awed by your mental abilities, especially when your psyche is unleashed.
•	 Have difficulty understanding that the magic you perform with your mind
comes from the same source as more conventional spellcasting.
•	 Wonder if you might be a monster in disguise, possessed by spirits, chosen
by the gods, or have some other unusual reason for your strange powers.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a psychic. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
PSYCHIC SPELLCASTING
You access the vast well of power that resides within your
own mind, calling forth psychic magic with nothing but
thought and will. You can cast occult spells using the
Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell
components when casting spells you know from your
psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute
any verbal components with a special mental component
determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This
represents how you exert your mind toward your intended
effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate
trait to the spell you’re casting. You also substitute any
material components with somatic components, though
these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head
compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your
spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory
manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.
Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must
know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell
repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast
each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells
per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can
cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell
attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your
enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting
a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by
your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and
spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your
subconscious mind.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
This increases the spell’s level to match the spell slot. You
must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you
want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have
specific improvements when heightened to certain levels.
The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain
spells freely.
Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special
type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a
cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is
automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—
this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell
slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your
cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic,
your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of
your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the
course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class
feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for
cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.
SPELL REPERTOIRE
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn one 1st-level occult spell
of your choice and three occult cantrips of your choice.
You choose these from the common spells from the occult
list or from other occult spells to which you have access.
You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using
a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your choice of
conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your
repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-level spell and
two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you
cast as psi cantrips (see below).
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in
level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you
add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level.
At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd
level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When
you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of
a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened
version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds
additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells
of higher levels.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire,
such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it
wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want
to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each
time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap
out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same
level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out
spells by retraining during downtime.
PSI CANTRIPS AND AMPS
The magic of your mind manifests as psi cantrips, which
you can modify by spending Focus Points. Like other
cantrips, you can cast psi cantrips as often as you like,
and they are automatically heightened to half your

level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to
the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of
your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give
you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can’t
swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later
level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.
At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by
your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip
and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult
spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips.
You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress
in your career as a psychic.

You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However,
unlike other spellcasters, you don’t gain focus spells that
cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points
to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps—
specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your
psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp
heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it
by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can
also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to
substitute a psi cantrip’s normal amp effect for another
one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use
any, each time you cast a psi cantrip. Unless otherwise
noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip.
You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations,
and you can regain Focus Points by spending 10 minutes
using the Refocus activity to explore your mind, whether
via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you
the mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your
thoughts and feelings with yourself or another. If you’ve
spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or fuel psychic
abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2
Focus Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of
2. If you’ve spent Focus Points on focus spells or abilities
other than those from the psychic class (for instance, to cast
a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain
only 1 Focus Point.
UNLEASH PSYCHE
When one thins the barrier between their inner mind and
the outer world, one can unleash true psychic power.
However, the mind wasn’t meant to tap its full strength for
long, leading to backlash once your unleashed psyche ends.
UNLEASH PSYCHE [free-action]
PSYCHIC
Trigger Your turn begins.
Requirements You’re in an encounter, you Cast
a Spell on your previous turn, and you aren’t
stupefied.
You call on the depths of your mind and let
psychic power flood through. Your Psyche
remains Unleashed for 2 rounds or until your
fall unconscious, whichever comes first. You
can’t voluntarily quell your unleashed psyche.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, the following
effects occur.
• You’re constantly surrounded by the visual
manifestation of your psychic magic.
•	 When you cast a damaging spell, you gain a status
bonus to its damage equal to double the spell’s level.
This applies only to spells that don’t have a duration
and that you cast using psychic spellcasting.
•	 You can use actions that have the psyche trait.
After your unleashed psyche subsides, your mind must
recover from the strain of channeling its full power. You
can’t use Unleash Psyche again for 2 rounds, and
you’re stupefied 1 for 2 rounds.
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND
A psychic’s power is born in the depths of their
psyche, far from the surface. Your subconscious
mind might represent the way your power comes to you
naturally, or it may be a framework you use to safely
access the infinite potential of your mind. Either way,
your subconscious mind fundamentally shapes how you
access and wield psychic magic. Choose a subconscious
mind from the options starting on page 15, or options
from other sources to which you have access. This choice
will determine your key ability, special spellcasting
components you use, and an action you can take while
you have Unleashed your Psyche. The following options
are presented in this book.

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many psychic
class features.
Amp: Amps are special thoughtforms that modify
the properties of your psi cantrips. You can apply an
amp only to a psi cantrip, which is called the amped
cantrip. Applying an amp to a psi cantrip costs 1
Focus Point and is part of the actions needed to Cast
the Spell. The singular focus required to amp a psi
cantrip means that unless otherwise noted, you can
apply only one amp to a given psi cantrip, and you
can’t apply both an amp and a metamagic ability
to a cantrip at the same time. If both an amp and
the amped cantrip deal damage of the same type,
combine their damage for the purpose of resistances
and weaknesses. Feats with the amp trait provide
different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place
of their normal amps. If an amp has its own effect, its
level is the same as the amped cantrip’s.
Amp Heightened: Many amps have heightened
entries similar to spells. Add the amp’s heightened
effects when you cast the cantrip at that level or
higher. These are in addition to any heightened
effects of the cantrip, though some adjust the
cantrip’s normal heightened entry (typically in the
case of damage increases).
Mindshift: An action with this trait can always be
altered to use the raw power of your mind. When
you take this action, you can choose to replace any
damage it deals with mental damage, give it the
mental trait, and replace any save it requires with
a Will save. The action loses any traits matching
damage types it no longer deals.
Psyche: Your psyche must be unleashed to use
abilities that have the psyche trait, and they end
automatically when your unleashed psyche subsides.
Emotional Acceptance (Cha, page 15): Throwing
yourself headlong into your emotions is what lets you
access your power.
Gathered Lore (Int, page 15): Tutors taught you specific
axioms and lessons to help you harness your mind.
Precise Discipline (Int, page 16): Meticulously aligning
your thoughts brings your mental power into reality.
Wandering Reverie (Cha, page 16): Your imagination
fuels your magic through instinct and free association.
CONSCIOUS MIND
Whatever the subconscious source of a psychic’s power,
all find that a specific external manifestation of their
magic comes most easily to them. This conscious outward
expression adds several additional spells to your spell
repertoire and grants you three psi cantrips. Two of these
cantrips are common spells, though you gain an extra
benefit with them that other spellcasters don’t get, and
the last is unique to your conscious mind. You also get
two more unique psi cantrips at higher levels. Choose a
conscious mind from the options starting on page 16, or
options from other sources to which you have access.
The following options are presented in this book.
The Distant Grasp (page 16): Manipulate physical
objects with telekinesis.
The Infinite Eye (page 18): Observe the world and
weaponize your knowledge.
The Oscillating Wave (page 19): Redistribute thermal
energy to create blazing heat and bone-chilling cold.
The Silent Whisper (page 20): Tap into the thoughts of
those around you to soothe or influence.
The Tangible Dream (page 21): Weave your imagination
into creations of force and light.
The Unbound Step (page 23): Bend and traverse space
with teleportation and phasing.
PSYCHIC FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
psychic class feat.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
SIGNATURE SPELLS
3RD
You’ve learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell
of that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to
learn heightened versions of signature spells separately;
instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve
learned a signature spell at a higher level than its
minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions
without learning those separately. If you swap out a
signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature
spell of the same spell level at which you learned the
previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change
a signature spell to a different spell of that level without
swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining
a spell normally does.
SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in
a skill in which you’re already a master.

ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with,
you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4
levels thereafter.
CLARITY OF FOCUS
5TH
Your deepening connection to your mind grants you
more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of
Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn’t
change the number of Focus Points you regain when you
Refocus. As normal, this ability can’t increase the size of
your focus pool above 3 points.
PRECOGNITIVE REFLEXES
5TH
Minor precognition ensures you can react to threats
slightly before they occur. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
EXPERT SPELLCASTER
7TH
Self-reflection has brought you greater knowledge of
yourself and, with it, psychic power. Your proficiency ranks
for occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
GREAT FORTITUDE
9TH
Your mind holds your body to a subconscious mental
image of yourself. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to expert.
EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION
11TH
Minor applications of clairvoyance let you know when
danger is near. Your proficiency rank for Perception
increases to expert.
WALLS OF WILL
11TH
Your practiced mind resists external influence. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When
you succeed at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
WEAPON EXPERTISE
11TH
Training and magic have improved your weapon
technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and
unarmed attacks increases to expert.

PERSONAL BARRIER
13TH
Subtle telekinetic fields dampen and deflect incoming
blows. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense
increases to expert.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
13TH
As you touch a weapon, you glimpse the hands that made
and wielded it, teaching you how to inflict greater injuries.
You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed
attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases
to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.
MASTER SPELLCASTER
15TH
You’ve gained access to the deepest corners of your own
mind. Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls
and spell DCs increase to master.
FORTRESS OF WILL
17TH
Your trained mind is as a fortress that none can breach.
Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary.
When you critically fail a Will save, you get a failure instead.
When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you
take half damage.
INFINITE MIND
19TH
Anything you can imagine is now within the realm of
possibility. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your
repertoire; you gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use
to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You
don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other
spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-level slots with abilities
that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells
without expending spell slots. You can take the Mind over
Matter psychic feat to gain a second slot.
LEGENDARY SPELLCASTER
19TH
As your training reaches its peak, you understand not just
your own mind, but the collective unconscious from which
all psychic power stems. Your proficiency ranks for occult
spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.
Subconscious Mind
The core of how you cast spells comes from the subconscious
portions of your mind. Because you cast spells using the
power of your subconscious mind, you replace verbal
components of spells with thought components. Thought
components add the concentrate trait to the spell like
verbal components do, but they don’t require you to speak.
Details of each subconscious mind’s thought components
appear in its entry. You select your subconscious mind at
1st level, and it determines the following.
Key Ability You gain an ability boost to your key ability score
and use this ability modifier to determine your spell attack
rolls and spell DCs.
Psyche Action This is a unique ability you can use while your
Psyche is Unleashed.
EMOTIONAL ACCEPTANCE
The mind’s truths come not in learned words or mathematical
formulas but in deeper feelings and sensations. Emotions
unlock the door to your power—you might consider your
heart the source of your strength, or you might find that the
infinite complexity felt in a moment expresses your power
more efficiently than any string of mystic words ever could.
Your thought components are emotions. You might
summon the sense of freedom to buoy you through the air
or let fear grip your heart even as you plant it in another’s
mind. Emotion components tend to impart abstract or vivid
effects to your visual and auditory spell manifestations as
well as more intangible flashes of emotion, such as swirls of
joyous color or a sense of growing melancholy.
Key Ability Your key ability score is Charisma.

PSYCHIC
Your unleashed psyche gives you closer connections to the
emotions of your allies, letting you project reassurance and
strength that replenishes their mind and body. Choose one of
the two benefits to grant one ally within 30 feet that you can
see. That ally is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
•	 The ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws against
mental effects until your psyche ends.
•	 The ally regains Hit Points equal to 2 + double your level.
GATHERED LORE
Many psychics are self-taught, frantically improvising how
to best control their abilities before their power overwhelms
them. Not you. Tutored by a mentor or classically trained
at a facility for psychic development, you’ve learned
techniques and teachings for best harnessing the mind,
cataloging each expression of psychic power with a specific
teaching, anecdote, or phrase.
Your thought components are mantras you associate with
a given spell, which you mentally repeat as you cast. You
might silently utter a teaching of resilience as you spin force
into a barrier or hear the first three notes of a traveling song
as you slip through space. Mantra components often produce
runes or symbols from your learnings that are unique to each
spell you cast, causing your spell manifestations to resemble
those of conventional spellcasters to a much greater degree
than those of other psychics.
Key Ability Your key ability score is Intelligence.
Psyche Action Recall the Teachings

DIVINATION

PSYCHIC
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every
lesson you’ve ever learned. You search your mind for the right
teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity
when it’s most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you
count as having prepared to Aid all allies within 30 feet of you.
If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time,

you roll an Occultism check for Aid as you recall a lesson to
help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables,
or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually
grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.
PRECISE DISCIPLINE
Determine intended outcome. Align thoughts. Identify
and resolve distractions. Manifest. Intentional focus is the
key to unleashing your abilities, whether that’s because
your power naturally tends to precise, discrete effects, or
because you’ve adopted strict discipline to ensure your
mind can change the world only when you intend it to.
Your thought components are calculations you make to
determine the forces you need to call upon. Perhaps you
mentally weigh the mass of an object against the force of
gravity to levitate it or you might determine exactly how
much energy is needed for an object to combust. Calculation
components tend to impart ordered visual and auditory
effects to your spell manifestation, such as regular tessellations
of light, mathematical spirals, or harmonic tones.
Key Ability Your key ability score is Intelligence.
Psyche Action Calculate Threats
CALCULATE THREATS [one-action]
MENTAL
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Your subconscious automatically calculates vectors and forces
when your mind is unleashed, showing you the likely path of
incoming attacks to avoid. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus
to AC and Reflex saves until the beginning of your next turn.
WANDERING REVERIE
The subconscious is by definition buried below the surface.
Thus, only by stripping away the clamor and interference
of everyday thought can you bring this more fundamental
part of your mind to bear. Whether through sleep,
self-hypnosis, or special exercises to empty your mind,
you’ve found a way to access a deeper, more chaotic state
of free association that better channels your psychic power.
Your thought components come from your imagination,
images, and sensations your mind freely associates. You
might have a passing daydream of small creatures bringing
you an object as you telekinetically attract it or you may
blink to find you’ve teleported to your desired location. Spell
manifestations from imagination components have surreal
or indistinct qualities, and the exact details fade quickly from
observers’ memory, as sensations from a dream.
Key Ability Your key ability score is Charisma.
Psyche Action Fade into Daydreams
FADE INTO DAYDREAMS [one-action]
ILLUSION
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Your flights of imagination spill into the real world, causing you
to become indistinct, hazy, or cloaked in figments. You become
concealed until the start of your next turn. This concealment
can’t be used to Hide, as normal for concealing effects that
leave your location obvious.
Conscious Mind
Specific spells you learn come from your conscious
mind, which shapes the raw psychic power from your
subconscious into the forms and phenomena that you
intentionally cast. You select your conscious mind at 1st
level, and it determines the following.
Granted Spells You automatically add the spells listed here to
your spell repertoire, in addition to those you gain through
psychic spellcasting. At 1st level, you gain a 1st-level spell,
and you learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain
the ability to cast psychic spells of that level, learning the
2nd-level spell at 3rd level, the 3rd-level spell at 5th level,
and so on.
Standard Psi Cantrips These are two common cantrips you
automatically gain at 1st level. While these are the same
cantrips used by other spellcasters, you cast them as psi
cantrips, enabling you to amp them for greater effect. Your
mastery of psychic magic also grants you a passive benefit
that applies every time you cast these cantrips, even when
you haven’t amped them. These benefits apply only with
cantrips you gain from your conscious mind; you would
cast a cantrip you gained with your psychic spellcasting
class feature, for example, as normal even if it appears in a
different conscious mind.
Unique Psi Cantrips These psi cantrips are unique to your
conscious mind. You automatically gain the surface psi
cantrip at 1st level, automatically gain the deeper psi cantrip
at 6th level, and automatically gain the deepest psi cantrip
at 10th level.
THE DISTANT GRASP
Motion characterizes the physical—a boulder falls,
creatures move, the world turns. You believe the truest
form of mind over matter is therefore to move things as
well, wielding telekinesis as an arm that can grasp the
furthest and finest of objects.
Granted Spells 1st: kinetic ram (page 105); 2nd: telekinetic
maneuver; 3rd: levitate; 4th: fly; 5th: telekinetic haul; 6th:
poltergeist’s fury (page 106); 7th: telekinetic bombardment
(page 107); 8th: falling sky (page 105); 9th: implosion
Standard Psi Cantrips mage hand and telekinetic projectile
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: telekinetic rend; deeper: vector
screen; deepest: dancing blade
Mage Hand
Your mage hand can carry up to 1 Bulk instead of only
light Bulk. If the spell is heightened to 3rd level or higher,
its maximum Bulk is 2. If the spell is heightened to 7th
level or higher, its maximum Bulk is 3. It also gains the

a creature and move it about. Target a creature of Medium
size or smaller with the amped spell instead of an object.
You attempt to Shove the target in a direction of your

circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the spell ends.
Starting the round after you Cast the Spell, the first time
each round you Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Shove
the creature again.
Amp Heightened (4th) You can attempt to Disarm the creature
instead of attempting to Shove it. If you knock an item out of
the creature’s grasp in this way, the mage hand immediately
grabs it. Any effect of the mage hand on the creature ends,
and the spell now carries the item, just like you had picked
it up with an unamped mage hand.
Telekinetic Projectile
Your telekinetic projectiles can fly much further away.
Increase the range of telekinetic projectile to 60 feet. It
also gains the following amp.
Amp You fling objects with even more force, driving your
opponents backwards in a hail of objects. On a success,
you push the target 5 feet away from you, and on a critical
success, you push the target 10 feet away from you in
addition to dealing double damage.
Amp Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6 instead of
by 1d6.

Your mind creates a violent axis of motion in a nearby space.
You deal your choice of 1d6 bludgeoning or 1d6 slashing
damage to all creatures in the area, with a basic Fortitude
save. A creature large enough to be in more than one of the
bursts takes damage only once.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
Amp Your thoughts expand in scope and power. The bursts
deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage,
instead of the usual damage. A creature that critically fails
its save is also stunned 1.
Amp Heightened (+2) Both types of damage increase by 1d6
instead of just one. Add a third non-overlapping 5-foot burst
to the area.

Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area one 5-foot square
Duration until the start of your next turn
You set up a transparent, rippling screen of telekinetic
energy that seizes small, fast-moving projectiles. Creatures
can pass through the screen, but ammunition from physical
ranged attacks—such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and
other objects of similar size—is automatically trapped in
the screen, clattering to the ground once the spell ends.
Attacks with bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take
a –2 circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths
pass through the screen. Massive ranged weapons and spell
effects that don’t create physical objects pass through the
screen with no penalty.
Heightened (5th) The screen is 10 feet wide.
Heightened (6th) The screen is 10 feet wide and can interfere
even with massless attacks, like magical blasts or gouts of
flame. The screen imposes a –2 circumstance penalty to the
attack rolls of spell effects even if they don’t create physical
objects. It also protects against area effects that pass
through the screen, granting standard cover to creatures
on the opposite side of the screen from the center or origin
point of an area.
Amp Your screen persists for longer, and you can detonate
it in an explosive counterattack. The duration of the spell
increases to 1 minute. You can Dismiss the spell. If there
are any projectiles trapped in the screen, you can cast
telekinetic projectile to fire them at one creature as part of
Dismissing the spell. Measure the range for the telekinetic
projectile from where the vector screen was, instead of
from you.
DANCING BLADE

UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You telekinetically animate a weapon that’s unattended or on
your person. It brandishes itself at a foe of your choice as if
wielded by an invisible duelist. When you first Cast the Spell,
the weapon automatically flies to the target and Strikes. It
moves along with its target, always remaining within reach.
Each time you Sustain the Spell, the weapon either Changes
Partners or Strikes. The weapon’s attacks use and contribute
to your multiple attack penalty.
•	 Change Partners Change the weapon’s target to a
different creature within 30 feet. The weapon flies to its
new target.
•	 Strike (attack) The weapon attacks its target using your
spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals damage
equal to 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, of a
type determined by the weapon (if the weapon has the
versatile trait or can otherwise deal multiple types of
damage, you choose each time you attack).
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
Amp The weapon’s attacks increase in strength, and your
control is fine enough for advanced technique. The damage
dice for the weapon’s Strike change from d6s to d10s. When
you Cast or Sustain the spell, you can choose from the
following options in addition to the standard ones.
•	 Guard Rather than attacking, the weapon grants a +2
circumstance bonus to AC against melee attacks to the
creature it’s following. The bonus lasts until the start of
your next turn or until the weapon Changes Partners,
whichever comes first.
•	 Push (attack) The weapon attempts to Push its target,
using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check
to determine the results of the Push.

THE INFINITE EYE
The true strength of the mind lies in the knowledge
it contains, with each new observation contributing
to the totality of its experiences. To grow your
experiences—and with them, your power—you devote
yourself to observing as much as possible, casting
your senses through space and time with clairvoyance
and precognition.
Granted Spells 1st: true strike; 2nd: augury; 3rd: organsight
(Secrets of Magic 120); 4th: clairvoyance; 5th: prying
eye; 6th: true seeing; 7th: true target; 8th: unrelenting
observation; 9th: foresight
Standard Psi Cantrips detect magic and guidance
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: glimpse weakness; deeper:
omnidirectional scan; deepest: foresee the path
Detect Magic
You have the kind of fine control that other spellcasters
can only dream of. When you cast detect magic, you’re
aware of any creature in the emanation affected by a
spell or carrying a magic item, and you determine the
main location of magic within any magical hazard in
the emanation (with the normal restrictions on detecting
illusions). This typically manifests as an alteration
to your vision, such as seeing a soft aura around the
creature or hazard. Sensing these phenomena doesn’t
make it clear which spell is on a creature, nor which of
its items are magical. Your detect magic also gains the
following amp.
Amp Your pulse of detection magic helps you gain a sense of
nearby magic’s strengths or weaknesses. When you detect
the presence of magic on an enemy or hazard, you gain a
+1 status bonus to saves against magic originating from
that enemy or hazard for 3 rounds. If you find magic from
multiple sources with a single casting of detect magic, you
get the bonus against all of them.
Amp Heightened (7th) The status bonus to saves against magic
increases to +2.
Guidance
You have eyes everywhere, allowing you to guide people
from a great distance. The range of guidance increases to
120 feet. It also gains the following amp.
Amp You can project a flash of insight to your ally in the nick
of time to save them from failure. Amped guidance doesn’t
cause a creature to become temporarily immune to guidance,
and a creature can be targeted by amped guidance even if it
is temporarily immune to guidance.
You can cast an amped guidance spell as a reaction
triggered when your ally fails or critically fails an attack
roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check, and the
bonus from guidance would change the failure to a success
or the critical failure to a normal failure. The bonus from
guidance applies retroactively to their check.
Amp Heightened (6th) The bonus from the spell increases
to +2.

You glimpse a loose scale, a seam in a foe’s armor, or a similar
weakness, aiding your allies in landing a precise hit. The
first ally that hits the target with a successful Strike deals
additional precision damage equal to 1 + this spell’s level, and
then the spell ends.
Amp The additional precision damage is 1d4+1.
Amp Heightened (+2) The additional precision damage
increases by 1d4+1.

Cast [one-action] verbal
Area 30-foot emanation; Targets 1 ally and 1 enemy
Duration until the start of your next turn
You quickly view your surroundings from a variety of angles,
your senses constructing an overall mental picture. You can
choose to Seek the entire emanation of the spell.
Regardless of whether you Seek, target one ally and one
enemy in the area; if a target is concealed or hidden from you,
you automatically succeed at the flat check to target it with this
spell. You prepare to Aid the target ally on an attack roll against
the target enemy. If you take this Aid reaction, you use your
spell attack modifier and proficiency rank on your check to Aid.
If you critically fail the roll to Aid, you get a failure instead.
Amp Your scans are so minute that you can project your foe’s
likely strengths and weaknesses. You learn which of the
target enemy’s saving throws is highest and which is lowest,
and you and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to attacks and damage against the creature.
If you take the Aid reaction you prepared for and succeed
at your roll, these bonuses increase to +2 on the attack
you’re Aiding. On a critical success, they increase to +3, or
to +4 if you have legendary proficiency in spell attack rolls.

DIVINATION
PSYCHIC
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 ally and 1 enemy
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You see just a split second into the future and glean how an
enemy will move, making it easier for your allies to strike
it mid-action. Make a Perception check against the target
enemy’s Will DC or Deception DC, whichever is higher. The GM
may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it’s higher; for
instance, using the Warfare Lore DC of a military captain. The
target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Critical Success The target ally gains a reaction that lets it
make a melee Strike against the target enemy, triggered if
the enemy leaves a square within the ally’s reach. If the ally
already has an ability that lets it make melee Strikes as a
reaction, such as Attack of Opportunity, the ally can forgo

gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status
bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.
Success As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if
it forgoes the reaction is +1.
Failure The spell has no effect.
Amp The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success
(but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you Sustain
the Spell, you can choose an additional ally to target,
granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.
THE OSCILLATING WAVE
At the heart of all things is energy. Though it may change
its form or resting place, it is eternal, fundamental, the
purest of building blocks. Your powers let you shift
energy—either concentrating it in a single point to
explosive end or freezing objects by plundering it away—
in an endless oscillation of temperature.
Granted Spells 1st: burning hands; 2nd: heat metal (Advanced
Player’s Guide 220); 3rd: fireball; 4th: fire shield; 5th: cone
of cold; 6th: flame vortex (Secrets of Magic 106); 7th: fiery
body; 8th: polar ray; 9th: meteor swarm
Standard Psi Cantrips produce flame and ray of frost
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: thermal stasis; deeper: entropic
wheel; deepest: redistribute potential
Conservation of Energy
Energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or
changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove
energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force.
The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell
from your conscious mind or a psi cantrip, decide whether
you’re adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy,
you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these
spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral
state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you
add or remove energy on your next spell.
Adding Energy: The ability gains the fire trait, any
damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants
is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage
types it no longer deals.
Removing Energy: The ability gains the cold trait, any
damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants
is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types
it no longer deals. Fiery body grants ray of frost instead of
produce flame when cast this way.
Mindshift: When you use an action that has the mindshift
trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of
making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing
energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.

Produce Flame
You can drastically increase the heat against adjacent
targets. When using produce flame as a melee attack,
increase the damage dice of the initial damage (but not the
persistent damage) from d4s to d6s. Your produce flame
also gains the following amp.
Amp You project pure heat that causes a target to combust.
The initial damage changes to 1d10 fire damage (not adding
your ability modifier) plus 1 fire splash damage. When
using amped produce flame as a melee attack, increase the
damage dice of the initial damage from d10s to d12s. You are
not harmed by splash damage from amped produce flame.
Amp Heightened (+1) Instead of using produce flame’s normal
heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10
(1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The
persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.
Ray of Frost
Your ray of frost reaches even further. The range increases
to 180 feet. Your ray of frost also gains the following amp.
Amp You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what you
plunder to replenish yourself. The ray deals 1d10 cold damage.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the
target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose
any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

FIRE
PSYCHIC
Cast [reaction] verbal; Trigger You deal cold or fire damage to an enemy.
Duration 1 minute
You stockpile thermal energy in a magical wheel-like construct
that lets you burn opponents with cold or freeze their bodies
with heat. When you Cast the Spell, the wheel has one mote
of thermal energy, and when you use a cold or fire effect or
deal cold or fire damage, the wheel spins, siphoning off a bit of
energy and gaining another mote. The wheel can’t gain motes
more than once on a given turn, and the maximum number of
motes is equal to entropic wheel’s level.
When you Cast a Spell that deals fire damage, the target
also takes cold damage equal to the number of motes in the
entropic wheel. When you Cast a Spell that deals cold damage,
the target also takes fire damage equal to the number of motes
in the entropic wheel. This applies only to the initial damage
of the spell, not to any persistent damage or ongoing effects.
Amp You gain two motes instead of one when you Cast the
Spell and each time the wheel gains another mote.

Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 2 adjacent 5-foot squares
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can
shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either
area take 4d4 damage with a basic Fortitude save. Choose one
of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other
to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature
that fails its save also becomes clumsy 1 from numbness if it’s
in the area of stolen heat or enfeebled 1 from heat stroke if it’s
in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the
start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both
squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its
save against; it’s unaffected by the other area.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
Amp You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander
scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10-foot
bursts. They still must be adjacent to one another and can
overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only
one of your choice. The spell’s damage increases to 6d6. The
conditions last for 1 minute.
Amp Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 2d6 instead of 1d4.
THE SILENT WHISPER
Every mind murmurs constantly, and the static from those
nearby reverberates in your head like wind through leaves.
What better focus for your magic then, than the very
thoughts of those around you? Your versatile telepathic
abilities let you soothe and communicate with your allies
or control your enemies.
Granted Spells 1st: mindlink; 2nd: touch of idiocy; 3rd: heroism;
4th: telepathy; 5th: synaptic pulse; 6th: sending; 7th: visions
of danger; 8th: uncontrollable dance; 9th: telepathic demand
Standard Psi Cantrips daze and message
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: forbidden thought; deeper:
shatter mind; deepest: contagious idea
Daze
You can daze from a great distance. The range increases to
120 feet. Your daze also gains the following amp.
Amp Your spell cracks the target’s mental defenses, leaving
it susceptible to further psychic attack. The spell’s damage
changes to 1d10. If the target fails its Will save, until the end
of its next turn, it gains weakness 1 to mental damage and
takes a –1 status penalty to Will saves. On a critical failure, the
weakness is 3 (in addition to the target being stunned 1). The
weakness applies before daze deals damage.
Amp Heightened (+2) The spell’s damage increases by 2d10, and
the weakness on a failure or critical failure increases by 1.

Message
Your message is not so easily bound by obstacles. The
spell can travel up to 120 feet to reach the target, bending
around walls and obstacles; this means you don’t need
a straight line of effect or line of sight to cast message
as long as you know the target’s space and there is an
unblocked path of 120 feet or less that can reach them. It
also gains the following amp.
Amp Your telepathic message allows you to coordinate your
actions while you pass on information. The target of the
message can immediately spend its reaction to Step or Stride.
Amp Heightened (4th) The target of the message can choose to
Shove, Strike, or Trip with its reaction instead.

You place a psychic lock in a foe’s mind that prevents it from a
specific action. Choose “Strike,” “Stride,” “Cast a Spell,” or a specific
action you know the creature to have (such as “Breath Weapon”
against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next
turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 1d6

Nothing is so contagious as a thought. You place either a
pleasant thought or a terrifying one in a creature’s mind. You
can then plant the same thought in a second creature’s mind.
You can’t choose a creature that’s already been a target of this
casting of contagious idea, nor can you choose yourself. The
second target can be beyond the range of the spell, but it must
be within 30 feet of the first target.
•	 Pleasant Thought The target is soothed, gaining 5
temporary Hit Points that last for 1 minute.
•	 Terrifying Thought The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and is temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is frightened 1 and is then temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Failure The target becomes frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target becomes frightened 3.
Heightened (+1) The temporary Hit Points for a pleasant thought
increase by 1.
Amp You can choose to spread the thought from the second
target to a third target, in the same manner as spreading
it from the first target to the second. A pleasant thought
grants twice as many temporary Hit Points (10, plus an
additional 2 for each level heightened).
THE TANGIBLE DREAM
You pull colors and shapes from the depth of your
mind, projecting impossible creations into the world as
tapestries of astral thread or sculptures of force and light.

Dancing Lights
Your dancing lights can float wherever you like. After
creating the lights, they can move more than 10 feet from the
other lights, and more than 120 feet from you. Your dancing
lights also gain the following amp.
Amp Your lights whirl together, dazzlingly and hypnotically.
When you amp the spell, you create a flashing display
comprised of all four lights in an unoccupied 5-foot square.
If you move the lights when you Sustain the Spell, the lights
must remain together. The spell gains the visual trait. Each
creature in a 5-foot emanation around the lights when you
Cast the Spell must attempt a Fortitude save.
Success The creature is dazzled until the start of your next
turn and then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Failure The creature is dazzled until the start of your next
turn and must attempt a new save against the spell
whenever it starts its turn adjacent to the lights.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is also fascinated
by the lights until the start of your next turn.
Shield
Your shield spell can be deployed on behalf of others.
When you cast shield, you can choose a target ally within
30 feet to gain the benefits of the spell instead of you. The
option to Shield Block with the spell is up to you and uses
your reaction, not the target’s. Your shield also gains the
following amp.

Amp You create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses. The
duration increases to sustained up to 1 minute. The shield still lowers at the start
of each of your turns, but you can raise it again when you Sustain the Spell.
When you Shield Block with this spell, one of the three layers breaks and you
cease to gain the bonus to AC, but the spell doesn’t end. You can keep using the spell
until the final layer breaks; once it does, the spell ends and you can’t cast shield or
amped shield again for 10 minutes. You can choose to break additional layers when
you Shield Block with this spell to improve your defenses. If you break two layers
instead of one, increase the Hardness to 1-1/2 × the normal amount (7 at 1st level, 15
at 3rd level, 22 at 5th level, 30 at 7th level, and 37 at 9th level). If you break all three
layers, increase the Hardness to double the normal amount.
IMAGINARY WEAPON
CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON
ATTACK
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
FORCE
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
You create a simple weapon of force. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target’s
AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of bludgeoning or slashing damage equal to 1d8
plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage
and can choose to detonate your weapon to push the target 10 feet away from you.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.
Amp You form multiple force weapons to lash out at multiple foes. You make two
imaginary weapon Strikes, each against a different target. Your multiple attack
penalty doesn’t increase until you’ve made both Strikes.
Amp Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d8 instead of 1d8.
ASTRAL RAIN
CANTRIP 3
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
FORCE
PSYCHIC
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area one 5-foot cube
Saving Throw Reflex
You fling a mass of furious thoughts into the air, where they expand into numerous
blades or other shapes that rain down. Any creature that’s in the area or enters the area
before the start of your next turn takes your choice of bludgeoning or piercing damage
equal to 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Reflex saving throw.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
Amp The area changes to a 5-foot burst, and you can Sustain the Spell up to 1 minute. The
first time each round that you Sustain the Spell, you can move the burst up to 20 feet.
HOLOGRAM CAGE
CANTRIP 5
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
ILLUSION
LIGHT
PSYCHIC
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Area 1 cube 20 feet on each side
Duration 1 minute
You weave light into a cube of vivid and fantastic patterns. The walls shed bright light
for 10 feet (and dim light for the next 20 feet) and completely block line of sight;
creatures within the cage can’t be seen by creatures outside of it, though they can
see each other, and creatures outside of it can’t see into it. You can Dismiss
the spell, and if you Cast the Spell again, your previous hologram cage ends.
Heightened (7th) The range of the spell increases to 80 feet, and you can
expand the cube to be 25 feet on each side.
Amp Force walls make the cage’s barrier physical as well as visual. Each
10-foot-by-10-foot section of the cage’s wall has AC 10, Hardness
equal to double the spell’s level, and HP equal to quadruple the
spell’s level. The spell is disrupted if any of its walls would pass
through a creature when you cast it.

THE UNBOUND STEP
The mind can flit from thought to thought; why too
shouldn’t you? You focus on motion in a higher order of
spatial dimensions, not just the typical three, allowing for
versatile abilities that alter positioning.
Granted Spells 1st: thoughtful gift (Advanced Player’s Guide
226); 2nd: enlarge; 3rd: rally point (page 106); 4th: dimension
door; 5th: strange geometry (Advanced Player’s Guide 226);
6th: collective transposition; 7th: momentary recovery (page
106); 8th: maze; 9th: bilocation (page 104)
Standard Psi Cantrips phase bolt (page 106) and warp step
(page 107)
Unique Psi Cantrips surface: distortion lens; deeper: ghostly
shift; deepest: tesseract tunnel
Phase Bolt
Your phase bolt temporarily sends the target’s cover out of
phase if it hits. On a success, reduce the target’s circumstance
bonus to AC (if any) by 1 until the beginning of your next
turn. Your phase bolt also gains the following amp.
Amp Your bolt leaves phase completely, becoming invisible
and intangible until it’s already embedded in the target—
giving the impression it simply teleported itself into place.
The target is flat-footed against the attack. Additionally, the
bolt ignores an amount of Hardness or resistance to piercing
damage equal to half the spell’s level. On a critical success,
the target can’t be affected by teleportation effects until the
start of your next turn.
Amp Heightened (+1) The bolt’s damage increases by 2d4
instead of 1d4.
Warp Step
You warp space more compactly, granting you a +10-foot
status to your Speed instead of a +5-foot status bonus when
you warp step. The spell also gains the following amp.
Amp Space contracts with hardly a thought, letting you Cast
the Spell as a single action.
Amp Heightened (4th) You twist space so completely you don’t
need to travel the interposing distance. You can choose to
instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line
of effect with a range equal to your double your Speed (after
applying the status bonus from warp step). This grants the
spell the teleportation trait.
DISTORTION LENS
CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
PSYCHIC
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Area one 5-foot square
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a magical lens that distorts space as best suits you.
You create the lens in a space in range, even suspended in midair.
If your or an ally’s ranged attack passes through the lens, the
attack gains an additional 10 feet of range; if an enemy’s ranged
attack would pass through the lens, it requires an additional 10
feet of range to move through, though the enemy knows before
using its ability whether the interference puts the target out
of range. An ally whose space overlaps the lens can increase the
range of its ranged attacks, but an enemy whose space overlaps
the lens doesn’t reduce the range of its ranged attacks.
The first time each round you Sustain the Spell, you can
choose to relocate it to another square within range. The lens
disappears if you cast distortion lens again.
Heightened (+3) The lens increases or decreases the range of
abilities by an additional 5 feet.
Amp The lens can interfere with creatures as well as attacks.
Once during a Medium or smaller ally’s move action, the ally
can move into and out of the lens’s square without that square
counting against the total distance moved. Conversely, the
lens is difficult terrain for your enemies.
GHOSTLY SHIFT
CANTRIP 3
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
PSYCHIC
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Your body becomes insubstantial as you partially phase out.
You gain resistance 2 to all damage (except force).
Heightened (+2) The resistance increases by 1.
Amp Your insubstantiality is complete enough that you can pass
through other creatures, causing painful interference effects
when you do so. Once each round when you Stride, Burrow,
Swim, or Fly, you can pass through one creature’s space during
that action without needing to attempt a check to Tumble
Through, though you can’t end your turn in its space. When
you pass through a creature’s space in this way, you deal 2d6
force damage to that creature, with a basic Fortitude save.
Amp Heightened (+2) Increase the damage dealt by phasing
through a creature by 1d6.
TESSERACT TUNNEL
CANTRIP 5
UNCOMMON
CANTRIP
CONJURATION
PSYCHIC
TELEPORTATION
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You race from point to point, tearing open a tunnel in space.
You create a portal in your current space and then Stride,
creating another portal in the space you end your Stride. Until
the beginning of your next turn, any creature that enters the
first portal can immediately transport itself to the exit portal
as part of its move action, which adds the teleportation trait to
its movement.
You can have only one tesseract tunnel open at a time; creating
another causes the first to immediately close. You can use
tesseract tunnel while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming
instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
Amp Physical movement is no longer necessary to connect two
points in space. When you cast tesseract tunnel, you simply
create a tunnel that ends in a square within a range equal to
your Speed; you can choose to immediately teleport to the
space at the far end of the tunnel. Furthermore, the tunnel
can be traversed in both directions, instead of only from
entrance to exit. Finally, the spell’s duration changes to 1
minute. You can Dismiss the spell.

Psychic Feats
At every level that you gain a psychic feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL MIND
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
By unraveling memories and connections passed down from
your progenitors and buried within your unconscious mind,
you learn to convert your inherent magic into psychic power.
You can cast any innate spells you know from an ancestry feat
or heritage using your psychic spellcasting components. When
you do so, the spell’s tradition becomes occult, if it wasn’t
already, and you can use your psychic spellcasting ability
modifier instead of Charisma to determine your spell attack
roll and spell DC.
COUNTER THOUGHT [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell with the mental trait.
Requirements You have an unexpended spell slot you could
use to Cast a Spell with the mental trait.
When a foe Casts a Spell that has the mental trait and you can
see its manifestations, you can use your own mental magic to
disrupt it. You expend one of your spell slots to counter the
triggering creature’s casting of a spell with the mental trait.
You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell;
this spell slot must be one for which you could Cast a Spell
with the mental trait. You then attempt to counteract the
triggering spell.
MENTAL BUFFER
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
Your mind deflects some amount of harm from attacks that
induce pain or manipulate your mind directly. You gain
resistance to mental damage equal to half your level (minimum
1). This resistance increases to equal to your level while your
Psyche is Unleashed.
PSYCHIC RAPPORT
FEAT 1
PSYCHIC
Your telepathic sensitivity intensifies when you’re affected
by mental magic, making it easier for you to link to other
creatures. After you Cast a Spell with the mental trait, until
the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks, and to
Perception checks to Sense Motive.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
PSYCHIC
You expand what your mind can accomplish. Add two
additional occult cantrips to your repertoire.
MENTAL BALM
FEAT 2
AMP
EMOTION
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Your spells release soothing mental waves. Use this amp in
place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry. You can use this amp
only on a psi cantrip that targets or affects you or one or more
of your allies and doesn’t target or affect any enemies.
Amp You or one ally within 30 feet gains a +2 status bonus to
Will saves against emotion effects for 1 minute. You can also
have the amped psi cantrip attempt to counteract one effect
imposing the frightened condition on yourself or the chosen
ally, or an effect imposing the stupefied condition that has
a duration of 1 hour or less. If you successfully counteract
the effect, you remove only the frightened and stupefied
conditions, not any other part of the effect.
PSI BURST [one-action]
FEAT 2
CONCENTRATE
EVOCATION
MINDSHIFT
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per round
With a passing thought, you direct violent psychic energies at
a nearby creature. Target one creature within 30 feet. It takes
1d4 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. At 3rd level
and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
WARP SPACE
FEAT 2
AMP
PSYCHIC
You use your magic to bend space, causing your spell to strike
from a strange vector. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s
normal amp entry. The amped psi cantrip must have a range.
Amp Choose a square within 30 feet to which you have line of
effect and line of sight. Determine your spell’s line of effect
and line of sight from there, as well as whether creatures
have cover against the spell. The spell can exceed its normal
range as measured from you, as long as it’s within its normal
range from the square you chose.
4TH LEVEL
ASTRAL TETHER [one-action]
FEAT 4
ABJURATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
You spin out a thread of psychic energy that connects you to
an ally, using it as a conduit for your abilities. Choose a willing
creature within 60 feet and connect to it. Whenever you would
gain a benefit from a psychic amp, you can have the amp affect
the tethered creature instead. You can do so only if the amp
grants a distinct benefit, not if it alters the amped spell.
The tether can’t be severed physically but breaks if the
distance between you and the tethered ally ever exceeds 60 feet,
if you become unconscious, or if you use Astral Tether again.
HOMING BEACON
FEAT 4
AMP
PSYCHIC
As your spell strikes a target, you plant a beacon in the target’s
mind that announces its presence to those nearby. Use this
amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry. The amped
cantrip must be one that has one or more targets and must
either require a spell attack roll or have a saving throw.

Amp Choose one creature hit by the spell (if the spell has a
spell attack roll) or that fails its save against the spell (if
the spell requires a save). A psychic beacon emits from the
creature’s location, making it easier to notice the creature
as the mind and attention of onlookers is subtly drawn to
it. For 1 minute, if the target would be invisible, it’s instead
merely concealed, and if it would be concealed, it’s no
longer concealed.
PSI STRIKES [free-action]
FEAT 4
MINDSHIFT
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to Cast a Spell or to
Unleash your Psyche.
You siphon residual psychic energies from your spell into one
weapon you’re wielding or one of your unarmed attacks and
when you unleash your mind, the energies flare to match. The
attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage until the end of the
current turn. If your Psyche is Unleashed, this benefit instead
lasts until your psyche subsides.
THOUGHTFORM SUMMONING
FEAT 4
PSYCHIC
You can create a prototypical creature from the depths of your
imagination instead of calling one from elsewhere. Whenever
you summon a creature, you can choose to instead create a
psychic construct of that creature. This grants it resistance to
physical damage equal to half its level, weakness 5 to force
and mental damage, and the ability to pass through enemies’
spaces without needing to Tumble Through (though it can’t
end its turn in an occupied space).
VIOLENT UNLEASH [free-action]
FEAT 4
EVOCATION
MINDSHIFT
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger You Unleash your Psyche.
The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies
with a violent shockwave. You deal 2d6 force damage to all
creatures in a 20-foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This
explosion is taxing, making you stunned 1.
At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage
increases by 1d6.
6TH LEVEL
INERTIAL BARRIER
FEAT 6
ABJURATION
AMP
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell leaves behind barriers that reduce shock and motion.
Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal amp entry.
Amp You or one target of the spell gains resistance to physical
damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level until the start of your
next turn.
PARALLEL BREAKTHROUGH
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
You expand your mind beyond your area of psychic specialty.
You gain a 1st-level psi cantrip for a conscious mind other
than your own; this can be either the unique surface cantrip
or one of the common cantrips and the accompanying amp.
If you choose a common cantrip, you also gain the special
benefit granted by that conscious mind when casting the
cantrip without an amp. You don’t gain any other benefits of
that conscious mind, such as additional spells known.

SIXTH SENSE
FEAT 6
DIVINATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your psychic abilities also allow you to detect the lingering thoughts of spirits and
similar entities. While you’re exploring but not Searching, the GM rolls a secret check
for you to find haunts that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on
the Ethereal Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence, such as celestials,
fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits inside solid objects,
provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, Seeking, and
on the automatic secret check from Sixth Sense. You can still notice spirits only on a
successful check, and you can’t see them if they’re more than 5 feet inside an object.
When you notice a creature with your Sixth Sense, you also learn its location,
making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.
STEADY SPELLCASTING
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your concentration when you Cast
a Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat
check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
STRAIN MIND [free-action]
FEAT 6
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You cast a psi cantrip.
Requirements You have 0 Focus Points.
You strain your body beyond its limits to use an amp even when your mental power
is depleted. You add an amp that costs 1 Focus Point to the spell. Instead of
paying the normal Focus Point cost, you lose Hit Points equal to four
times the spell level of the amped psi cantrip as you bleed from your
nose or suffer some other visible sign of strain.
8TH LEVEL
BRAIN DRAIN [two-actions]
FEAT 8
DIVINATION
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature’s mental energy to replenish
your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a Will save
against your spell DC.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is stupefied 1 for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to
your normal maximum. You can’t use Brain Drain again until after the next time
you make your daily preparations.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is stupefied 2.
DARK PERSONA’S PRESENCE [free-action]
FEAT 8
AURA
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
FEAR
MENTAL
PSYCHIC
Trigger You Unleash your Psyche.
When you Unleash your Psyche, all your rage and pain—the portion of your psyche
dedicated to cruel retribution—come along with it.
The force of your dark persona’s negativity batters constantly against all creatures
in a 30-foot emanation when you Unleash your Psyche and for as long as your
Psyche is Unleashed. A creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC
the first time it enters the emanation, or if it’s in the emanation when you take this
action; it doesn’t need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and
returns. A creature frightened by your Dark Persona’s Presence can’t decrease its
frightened value below 1 while within the emanation.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target is frightened 1.
Failure The target is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target is frightened 3.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, your dark persona cares
only for destruction. You can Cast a Spell only if it can directly
damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental
condition or penalty on one.
MENTAL STATIC [reaction]
FEAT 8
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
NONLETHAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Trigger You roll a critical success on a Will save against a
mental effect from a creature.
Your thoughts sting back when a lesser mind tries to invade
your own. You deal mental damage equal to your level to the
triggering creature. If you so desire, you can also send the
creature a single mental image to coincide with the damage,
such as a watchful eye or the dread of floating in an infinite sea.
REMOVE PRESENCE
FEAT 8
AMP
ILLUSION
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell reaches into the mind of a creature and removes you
from it. The amped cantrip must be one that has one or more
targets and must either require a spell attack roll or have a
saving throw. Use this amp in place of the psi cantrip’s normal
amp entry.
Amp Choose one target of the spell or one creature in its area.
If that enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you become
undetected by that creature, disappearing from its senses for 1
minute or until you use a hostile action. This is similar to being
invisible, but effects like see invisibility don’t reveal you—you’re
affecting the target’s mind, not its vision. True seeing can still
see through this illusion if the counteract check succeeds.
THOUGHTSENSE
FEAT 8
DIVINATION
MENTAL
OCCULT
You can detect the flickers of mental activity let off by all
thinking creatures. You gain thoughtsense as a vague sense
that has a range of 30 feet—like all vague senses, it’s only
about as precise as an average human’s sense of smell, meaning
you generally can predict only if a creature is present. Your
thoughtsense detects only thinking creatures, so a creature
that is unthinking or otherwise immune to mental effects (such
as many constructs and oozes) can’t be perceived using your
thoughtsense, regardless of how precise it is.
While your Psyche is Unleashed, your thoughtsense upgrades
to an imprecise sense, letting you use it to Seek out creatures.
WHISPERING STEPS
FEAT 8
AMP
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your spell leaves a lingering connection between you and a
creature—one through which you can nudge the creature’s
mind this way or that. The amped cantrip must take 2 or more
actions to cast, target one or more creatures, and either require
a spell attack roll or have a saving throw. Use this amp in place
of the psi cantrip’s normal amp entry.
Amp Choose one enemy who is a target of the spell. If that
enemy fails its save or the spell hits it, you whisper in the
creature’s mind, forcing it to Step in a direction of your
choosing; as this is forced movement, you can’t force the
creature to Step into hazardous terrain, off a ledge, or
the like. After it Steps, the creature becomes temporarily
immune to this amp for 24 hours.

DREAM GUISE [one-action]
FEAT 10
ILLUSION
OCCULT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements wandering reverie subconscious mind
You Stride into a willing ally’s space, at which point both of
your appearances shift into a shared third appearance, usually
one that looks like a mix of the two of you. Then, either you
or your ally Steps. You each maintain the merged appearance.
Creatures who are observing this know what happened,
but still must Seek or otherwise engage with the illusion to
attempt to disbelieve it and determine which of you is which.
Otherwise, they can’t tell the difference and have an equal
chance to target each of you (DC 11 flat check). This illusion
ends as soon as either you or the ally you’re merged with acts.

Requirements precise discipline subconscious mind
You bring discipline to your mind and magic, ensuring that you
don’t under-perform. Until the end of your turn, instead of rolling
dice for damage, count each damage die as average damage
rounded up (3 for d4, 4 for d6, 5 for d8, 6 for d10, and 7 for d12).
SCOUR THE LIBRARY [one-action]
FEAT 10
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Requirements gathered lore subconscious mind
Seeing an enemy’s attack, you quickly consult multiple scraps
of lore in your mind, synthesizing them into the perfect plan.
Make a check to Recall Knowledge (using an appropriate skill)
about one creature within 60 feet. On a success, in addition to
the normal benefits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your
next attack roll against that creature and to your AC against
the creature’s next attack. On a critical success, the bonuses
are +2.
SIGNATURE SPELL EXPANSION
FEAT 10
PSYCHIC
Your direct mental grasp of your power lets you cast more spells
with greater freedom. You gain two additional signature spells,
each of which must have a minimum level of 3rd or lower.

FEAT 12
DIVINATION
FORTUNE
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per day
Trigger A spell you cast has no effect because you critically failed all your spell
attack rolls or because all targets critically succeeded at their saving throws.
You see your spell fail to take hold to disastrous end, then snap back to reality—it was
all a precognition, and you know to try a different spell. Your spell is expended, but
you can Cast a Spell that requires the same number of actions as the triggering spell
or fewer to cast. The second spell must be a different spell than the first.
NO!!! [reaction]
FEAT 12
PSYCHIC
Trigger A non-minion ally within 60 feet is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
The shock of seeing your ally near death breaks whatever limits exist in your mind,
sending your power spilling forth. If your psyche is currently unleashed, you can
immediately use a psyche action that takes 1 action or less to use. If your psyche is
not currently unleashed, you Unleash your Psyche, which remains unleashed until
the end of your next turn. You can ignore Unleash Psyche’s requirement of needing
to have Cast a Spell on your previous turn, but you still can’t Unleash your Psyche if
you’re stupefied or for 2 rounds after your psyche subsides.

14TH LEVEL
CONSCIOUS SPELL SPECIALIZATION
FEAT 14
PSYCHIC
You become more adept with the spells that are always in your mind.
You gain an additional spell slot of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels. You can
use these spell slots to cast only a spell granted by your conscious mind.
At 18th level, you also gain an additional 5th-level spell slot, with the
same restrictions.
DEEP ROOTS
FEAT 14
PSYCHIC
Your mind-control spells send burrowing mental roots that tear at your
target’s mind when they’re removed or run their course. When you Cast
a Spell that imposes the controlled condition or otherwise forces the
target to take certain actions (such as command), you can choose one
target that critically failed its save. When that target finishes fulfilling
any commands issued by your spell, or when the spell is dispelled or
counteracted, the target takes 1d6 mental damage per level of the spell.

Amp You or one target of the spell are surrounded by a spiral of
torn space. This is an aura, and you choose the radius of the
emanation, up to 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn in
the aura or enters the aura during its turn takes 1d6 slashing
damage for every level of the amped psi cantrip, with a basic
Reflex save against your spell DC. If the creature critically
fails, the torn space throws it off balance and it falls prone.
The aura lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You
can choose whether the aura affects the creature emitting it.
16TH LEVEL
CONSTANT LEVITATION
FEAT 16
PSYCHIC
Your power has unbound you from the earth below. You’re
affected by a constant fly spell, and when your Psyche is
Unleashed, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed.
TARGET OF PSYCHIC IRE
FEAT 16
AMP
EVOCATION
OCCULT
PSYCHIC
Your magic saturates your surroundings with hateful psychic
energy. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip’s normal
amp entry. The cantrip must be one that takes 2 or more
actions to cast and targets a creature.
Amp Choose one target of the spell. Psychic phenomena turn
themselves on the target—typically, objects fling themselves
at the creature. At the beginning of each of the target’s turns,
it takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage for each spell level of the
psi cantrip this amp was added to, with a basic Reflex save.
The target remains marked by psychic ire for 3 rounds. The
effect persists even if you fall unconscious or leave the area.

TELEPORTATION
Frequency once per round
Requirements You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell.
When your Psyche is Unleashed, each burst of magic you cast
also folds space around you, and you travel through one of
those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.
18TH LEVEL
ALL IN YOUR HEAD [reaction]
FEAT 18
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Trigger You’re about to attempt a Fortitude save or a
Reflex save.
Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your
veins—you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect
you if you don’t believe in it. You attempt a Will save against
the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You
don’t gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on
this save.
CRANIAL DETONATION [free-action]
FEAT 18
DEATH
MINDSHIFT
PSYCHE
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per round
Trigger You successfully reduce one or more non-mindless
enemies to 0 Hit Points with a spell.
As your overwhelming psyche fells a creature, you use its
flickering consciousness to detonate psychic energy from the
creature’s head. Each enemy you reduced to 0 Hit Points dies and
its head explodes. Each exploding head generates a shockwave
in a 15-foot emanation around that enemy. Each creature in any
of the emanations takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic
Reflex save. If this damage reduces an enemy to 0 Hit Points,
its head also explodes, potentially damaging more creatures and
potentially causing more detonations. A given creature can take
damage only once from a single use of Cranial Detonation.
DEEPEST WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
PSYCHIC
You’ve glimpsed the furthest recesses of your mind. If you have
spent at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused,
you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus, even if you spent
your Focus Points on spells other than psychic abilities.
20TH LEVEL
BECOME THOUGHT
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
TRANSMUTATION
You shed some of your material form, becoming a being of pure
thought. This has the following effects.
•	 You gain resistance 10 to physical damage but weakness 5
to mental damage and weakness 10 to any effect that deals
damage by targeting the spirit, such as spirit blast.
•	 You can change your appearance on a whim. This takes
a single action, which has the concentrate trait, has the
effects of illusory disguise, and lasts until you change your
appearance again.
•	 Once per year, when you die, you automatically return to
life the next day as long as one living sentient creature on
your plane remembers you; the memories enable you to
reconstruct yourself from their thoughts. You appear in the
vicinity of the creature that remembers you most strongly.
MIND OVER MATTER
FEAT 20
PSYCHIC
Your mind’s limits are only what you imagine them to be. You
gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
TWIN PSYCHE
FEAT 20

You’ve segmented your psyche so it can operate in tandem.
When you Unleash your Psyche, you can double its duration.
UNLIMITED POTENTIAL [one-action]
FEAT 20
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
PSYCHIC
Frequency once per minute
The laws of magic can limit your mind only if you think you
need them, and you’ve grown past the need for such limits. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell of 5th level or lower that has
no duration, you don’t expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
