THAUMATURGE
The world is full of the unexplainable: ancient magic, dead gods, and even stranger
things. In response, you’ve scavenged the best parts of every magical tradition and
built up a collection of esoterica—a broken holy relic here, a sprig of mistletoe
there—that you can use to best any creature by exploiting their weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. The mystic implement you carry is both badge and weapon, its symbolic
weight helping you bargain with and subdue the supernatural. Every path to power has its restrictions
and costs, but you turn them all to your advantage. You’re a thaumaturge, and you work wonders.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain the listed
proficiency ranks in the following
statistics. You are untrained in
anything not listed unless you gain
a better proficiency rank in some
other way.
PERCEPTION

CLASS DC

HIT POINTS
8 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number
of HP by this number at 1st level and
every level thereafter.
KEY ABILITY
CHARISMA
At 1st level, your class gives you an
ability boost to Charisma.
DURING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS...
You use your implements and diverse arsenal of mystic tools and tricks to assist
in combat, always presenting the right bane to exploit enemies’ weaknesses or
shield your allies against the supernatural.
DURING SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS...
You understand and nudge the social connections between people, much as
you strive to understand the larger ties between mysteries and concepts. This
helps you to find common ground when negotiating between the mundane
and supernatural or even to play one side against the other.
WHILE EXPLORING...
You investigate unexplainable phenomena around you, taking appropriate
precautions to ward yourself and your allies against paranormal threats.
Where necessary, you create your own path through the unknown.
IN DOWNTIME...
You research deeper into the supernatural mysteries you discovered on your
last adventure to see how they can be applied in the future. You dust off
relics, cultivate herbs, or forge trinkets, updating your collection of scavenged
supernatural tools after each new threat you encounter. You return or call in
favors with other people, strange creatures, and mystical forces.
YOU MIGHT...
•	 Prepare for the worst while improvising as necessary, impressing your allies
when you’re able to handle anything that fate throws at you.
•	 Assume everything is connected on a deeper level, rather than be content
with what you find on the surface.
•	 Obsess over a certain supernatural phenomenon, attempting to tie
everything back to it.
OTHERS PROBABLY...
•	 Look to you to learn the weaknesses of a supernatural threat when one
rears its head. Even when your explanations are invented on the fly, they
just seem to work.
•	 Rely on you to come up with a solution when the situation seems hopeless.
•	 Mistake you for a common wizard or magician.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a thaumaturge. Abilities gained
at higher levels list the level at which you gain them next
to the features’ names.
ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
ESOTERIC LORE
Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales
you’ve exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught
you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become
trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be
used to Recall Knowledge regarding haunts, curses, and
creatures of any type, but that can’t be used to Recall
Knowledge of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you
use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks.
You also gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at
7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at
15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.
FIRST IMPLEMENT AND ESOTERICA
Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance:
your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a
powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement
from the options presented on page 36 (amulet, bell,
chalice, lantern, mirror, regalia, tome, wand, and weapon).
You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and
you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an
implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold.
If you acquire a new object of the same general implement
type, you can switch your implement to the new object
by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As
you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to
three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored
within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to
suit your situation.
While your implements are your primary tools in your
dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of
always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry
various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with
paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices:
your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps
of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly
from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your
esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and
are well practiced in brandishing your implement and
esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with
the same hand you’re using to wield an implement.
Exploit Vulnerability
You know that every creature, no matter how obscure, has a
weakness. By identifying and empowering the right object,
you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters.
You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.
EXPLOIT VULNERABILITY [one-action]
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Frequency once per round
Requirements You are holding your implement.
You scour your experiences and learning to identify something
that might repel your foe. You retrieve an object from your
esoterica with the appropriate supernatural qualities, then
use your implement to stoke the remnants of its power into a
blaze. Select a creature you can see and attempt an Esoteric
Lore check against a standard DC for its level, as you retrieve
the right object from your esoterica and use your implement
to empower it. You gain the following effects until you Exploit
Vulnerabilities again.

Critical Success You remember the creature’s weaknesses, and
as you empower your esoterica, you have a flash of insight
that grants even more knowledge about the creature. You
learn all of the creature’s resistances, weaknesses, and
immunities, including the amounts of the resistances and
weaknesses and any unusual weaknesses or vulnerabilities,
such as what spells will pass through a golem’s antimagic.
You can exploit either the creature’s mortal weakness or
personal antithesis (see below). Your unarmed and weapon
Strikes against the creature also become magical if they
weren’t already.
Success You recall an important fact about the creature,
learning its highest weakness (or one of its highest
weaknesses, if it has multiple with the same value) but not
its other weaknesses, resistances, or immunities. You can
exploit either the creature’s mortal weakness or personal
antithesis. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes against the
creature also become magical if they weren’t already.
Failure Failing to recall a salient weakness about the creature,
you instead attempt to exploit a more personal vulnerability.
You can exploit only the creature’s personal antithesis. Your
unarmed and weapon Strikes against the creature also
become magical if they weren’t already.
Critical Failure You couldn’t remember the right object to use
and become distracted while you rummage through your
esoterica. You become flat-footed until the beginning of your
next turn.
You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of
two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that
type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational,
ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a
custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually
isn’t as dire as a creature’s existing weakness.
Mortal Weakness After identifying a creature’s weakness,
you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune
your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon
Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with
Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your
weapon deals doesn’t change. This damage affects the
target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other
creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures
with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack
of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed
moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to
silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but
you wouldn’t apply this damage to any other monsters with
a weakness to silver.
Personal Antithesis You improvise a custom weakness on
a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a
piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for
instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken
chain that once held a captive. This causes the target
creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness
against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half
your level.
IMPLEMENT’S EMPOWERMENT
The power of your implement can also be turned to
the more common task of combat, its power adding to
and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical
empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic
patterns with an implement you’re holding to empower
the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per
weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires
full use of your hands. You don’t gain the benefit of
implement’s empowerment if you are holding anything in
either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other
implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least
one implement to gain the benefit.
THAUMATURGE FEATS
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
thaumaturge class feat.
SKILL FEATS
2ND
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
GENERAL FEATS
3RD
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat.
LIGHTNING REFLEXES
3RD
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many
thaumaturge class features.
Esoterica: The esoterica trait is present in
many thaumaturge feats and class features that
incorporate the various talismans, supernatural
trinkets, and other objects you carry with you.
Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you
to be in possession of your esoterica to use them.
Normally, you’re assumed to always have your
esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances,
you might either not have them on hand or have
your gear stripped from you.
Temporary Items: Several feats allow you to
prepare temporary items. Much like the infused
items created by alchemists, these temporary items
last only a short time before becoming useless.
Temporary items are clearly not up to the same
quality as other items, so they typically can’t be
sold. If an ability doesn’t list how long a temporary
item lasts, the item lasts until the next time you
make your daily preparations. Any effect created by
a temporary item also ends at that time if it hasn’t
already (unless it’s a permanent effect).

SKILL INCREASES
3RD
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
ABILITY BOOSTS
5TH
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
ANCESTRY FEATS
5TH
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
SECOND IMPLEMENT
5TH
You’ve added another implement of power to your toolkit.
You choose a second implement, which must be a different
type of implement than your first. You gain the initiate
benefit of your new implement.
While you’re holding an implement in one hand, you can
quickly switch it with another implement you’re wearing to
use an action from the implement you’re switching to. To
do so, you can Interact as a free action immediately before
executing the implement’s action. This allows you to meet
requirements of having an implement in hand to use its
action. For example, if you had your lantern implement in
one hand, a weapon in the other, and a chalice implement
you were wearing, you could swap your lantern for your
chalice to use its reaction.
THAUMATURGE WEAPON EXPERTISE
5TH
You’ve learned the secret ways your weapons work
most effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons and martial weapons increase to expert.
IMPLEMENT ADEPT
7TH
You have deepened your connection to one of
your implements, unlocking its adept power.
Choose one of your implements and gain
the adept benefit for that implement.
RESOLVE
7TH
You’ve steeled your mind with resolve.
Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to master. When you roll
a success on a Will save, you
get a critical success instead.
WEAPON SPECIALIZATION
7TH
You’ve learned how to inflict greater
injuries with the weapons you know
best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks
in which you are an expert. This
damage increases to 3 if you’re a
master, and 4 if you’re legendary.
INTENSIFY VULNERABILITY
9TH
You’ve learned to use your implement to further assault
a creature whose vulnerabilities you’re exploiting. You
gain the intensify vulnerability benefit of all of your
implements, as well as the following action.

CARDS AND ASTROLOGY
The thaumaturge class draws inspiration from
symbolism pertaining to both real-world and fantasy
beliefs about divination via cards or reading the
stars. The class references the following Golarion-
specific divination deck and zodiacs.
The Harrow is a divination deck similar to tarot
on Earth, but with six suits of nine cards each. The
suits each have a symbological correspondence with
one of the six ability scores. For example, the suit of
hammers has a connotation of strength, and the suit
of books is related to learning and intelligence.
The Cosmic Caravan is an astrological zodiac
especially common among Varisians but used
throughout various regions in the Inner Sea,
imagining the 13 different signs as members of a
traveling caravan as well as locations and people
encountered on the journey.
The Dragon Empires Zodiac is popular across the
continent of Tian Xia, particularly with the oracles of
Po Li, who use it to help craft laws. It contains 12 signs,
comprising the five types of imperial dragon as well as
other creatures and archetypes of import in Tian Xia.

Implements
Choose your implements from the following nine
implements, as well as any additional implements from
other sources to which you have access.
AMULET
Amulets are items carried for good luck and protection.
Your amulet might be a magical diagram, a religious
symbol, a preserved body part such as a rabbit’s foot, or
a lucky coin. Amulet implements are associated with the
harrow suit of shields and the astrological signs of the
bridge and the ogre.
Initiate Benefit
The protective aspects of your amulet can shield you
and your allies from harm. You gain the Amulet’s
Abeyance reaction.
AMULET’S ABEYANCE [reaction]
ABJURATION
MAGICAL
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Trigger The target of your Exploit Vulnerability would damage
you or an ally within 15 feet of you.
Requirements You’re holding your amulet implement and are
benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability.
You forcefully present your amulet to turn away harm. You
or a target ally within 15 feet gain resistance to all damage
against the triggering damage. The resistance is equal to 2 +
your level.
Adept Benefit
7th
Your amulet offers continued protection. When you use
Amulet’s Abeyance, you or your ally chooses one type of
damage dealt by the triggering attack and gains resistance
5 against that damage type until the start of your next
turn. At 15th level, this lingering resistance increases from
5 to 10.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your amulet repels the creature’s attempts to harm you.
You gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against the
target of your Exploit Vulnerability.
Paragon Benefit
17th
Your amulet provides sanctuary even against wide-scale
attacks. When you use Amulet’s Abeyance, you target yourself
and all allies within 15 feet. Each target gains both the initial
resistance against the triggering damage and the lingering
resistance from your amulet’s adept benefit; the allies gain

the lingering resistance even if they would not have taken
any of the initial triggering damage. If the foe’s attack deals
multiple damage types, each target can separately choose the
damage type to gain lingering resistance against.
BELL
Bells symbolize the power that sounds and emotions hold
over others, soothing with one tone and startling with
another. Bells, drums, finger cymbals, and other percussion
instruments are most typical, but these implements can
be any type of portable musical instrument that is played
with one hand. Bell implements are associated with the
astrological signs of the daughter and the blossom.
Initiate Benefit
You can use your bell implement to create three different
kinds of music, each of which weakens a foe in a different
way. You gain the Ring Bell activity.
RING BELL [reaction]
AUDITORY EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MAGICAL MANIPULATE MENTAL THAUMATURGE
Trigger The target of your Exploit Vulnerability makes a Strike
or Casts a Spell that would affect you or one of your allies.
Requirements You are holding your bell implement, and the
triggering creature is within 30 feet of you.
Your implement sings out abruptly, disrupting your foe. The
piece played depends on whether the trigger was a Strike or
Spell, and it applies to the triggering Strike or Spell, except
where noted otherwise.
•	 Distracting Cacophony The trigger is a spell. You create a
musical crash of sonic energy that assails the target and
breaks its concentration. The target must succeed at a
Fortitude save against your class DC or become stupefied
1 until the end of your next turn (stupefied 2 on a critical
failure). The target doesn’t have to attempt a flat check
to avoid losing the triggering spell, but the discordant
ring does lower the spell attack roll or spell DC of the
triggering spell from stupefied.
•	 Disrupting Harmony The trigger is a Strike. You create a
strangely discordant harmony that sinks into your foe’s
mind and throws its movements off. The target must
succeed at a Will save against your class DC or become
your choice of enfeebled 1 or clumsy 1 until the end of your
next turn (enfeebled 2 or clumsy 2 on a critical failure).
Adept Benefit
7th
Your bell resonates powerfully, causing the effect to
last longer. The conditions from Ring Bell last 3 rounds
instead of 1 round.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your reinforced bell can reach into the most basal part
of the target’s mind, priming it to be vulnerable to the
bell’s effects. When you successfully Strike the target of
your Exploit Vulnerability, your bell implement plays a
haunting tone and the creature takes a –2 status penalty
on saves against your Ring Bell for 1 round, or a –3 status
penalty on a critical hit. This effect has the auditory,
emotion, and mental traits.
Paragon Benefit
17th
With your mastery of your bell, you can affect many foes
with ease. All the condition values from Ring Bell increase
to 2 (or 3 on a critical failure). Ring Bell can trigger off
the Strike or spell of any enemy, not just the target of your
Exploit Vulnerability; however, in that case, the condition
lasts only until the start of your next turn.
CHALICE
Chalice implements are vessels that fill with liquid,
associating them with healing, nourishment, and life.
Your chalice might be a traditional cup or goblet, but
it could also be a small amphora, a polished gourd,
or even a hollowed-out skull. Chalice implements are
associated with the astrological signs of the mother and
the newlyweds, as well as the sea dragon.
Initiate Benefit
While holding your chalice, you can drink from it or feed
its liquid to an ally to improve their health. You gain the
Drink from the Chalice action.
DRINK FROM THE CHALICE [one-action]
MAGICAL
MANIPULATE
NECROMANCY
THAUMATURGE
Frequency once per round
Requirements You are holding your chalice implement.
You drink from the liquid that slowly collects in your chalice or
administer it to an adjacent ally. The drinker chooses whether
to take a small sip or to drain the contents.
• Sip A sip grants the drinker an amount of temporary Hit
Points equal to 2 + half your level that last until the end
of your next turn.
• Drain (healing, positive) Drinking deep instead heals the
drinker 3 Hit Points for each level you have. After the
chalice is drained, it’s left with only its slowly collecting
dregs; the chalice can’t be drained again, though it can
still be sipped from. If 10 minutes pass without anyone
drinking from the chalice, it refills itself and can be
drained again. If the drinker has negative healing, it can
still heal in this way, and the effect has the negative trait
instead of healing and positive.
Adept Benefit
7th
The life essence shed from blood empowers your chalice.
If you or an ally within 30 feet takes piercing or slashing
damage from a foe’s critical hit or takes persistent bleed
damage, Drinking from the Chalice before the end of your
next turn grants that injured creature greater restoration
to make up for its lost vitality. On a sip, the temporary
Hit Points granted to the creature increase to 2 + your
Charisma modifier + your level. When drained, the chalice
heals the creature 5 Hit Points for each level you have.

Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your reinforced chalice can collect a creature’s life force
to become empowered. If you succeed at a Strike against
the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, you increase the
effect if someone Drinks from the Chalice before the end
of that turn. Add an additional half your level to the
temporary HP if the drinker sips, or add your level to the
HP regained if the drinker drains the chalice. This effect
isn’t cumulative if you hit with more than one Strike.
Paragon Benefit
17th
When you or an ally drain the chalice, the overwhelming
vitality it’s collected helps you overcome many ailments.
Reduce the drinker’s clumsy, enfeebled, frightened,
stupefied, and stunned values by 1. (This reduces the
stunned condition only if it has a condition value, not
when it has a duration.) The drinker also reduces its
drained value by 1, but it can reduce its drained condition
by Drinking from the Chalice only once per day.
In addition, the chalice attempts to counteract all
poisons, diseases, and curses afflicting the drinker, using
half your level rounded up as the counteract level and your
class DC – 10 as the counteract modifier. If the chalice
fails to counteract a given affliction for a drinker, it can’t
attempt to counteract that affliction again until midnight.
LANTERN
Lantern implements shine the light of revelation to part
shadows and expose truth. You might use a common glass
lantern, torch, paper lantern, or other similar light source.
Lantern implements are associated with the harrow suit
of stars and the astrological signs of the lantern bearer
and the archer.
Initiate Benefit
While you hold your lantern, its burning light leaves
secrets no place to hide. You can light or extinguish your
lantern as a free action once each turn with nothing but
a thought, which has the concentrate trait. The lantern
shines bright light out to 20 feet and dim light out 20 feet
further; this has the evocation, light, and magical traits
(the counteract level against magical darkness is equal to
half your level rounded up).
The lantern’s magical light attempts to reveal the
unseen. You and your allies in the lantern’s area of bright
light gain a +1 status bonus to visual Perception checks
to notice anything that is also within the bright light, and
a +1 status bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge against
creatures within the bright light, as the light exposes
their true natures. During exploration, even if you aren’t
Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find
traps, environmental hazards, haunts, and secrets (such as
secret doors). The GM rolls each time a given hazard or
secret comes within 20 feet of you and within the lantern’s
bright light. These effects have the divination, magical,
and revelation traits.
Adept Benefit
7th
In addition to the initiate benefits, when you hold your
lantern, its light reveals the invisible and the ethereal.
The bright light increases to 30 feet, with dim light
out 30 feet further. While you’re holding your lantern,
invisible and ethereal creatures within the bright light
become visible as rippling distortions, though they’re
still concealed. This doesn’t give you any special ability
to affect a creature on the Ethereal Plane, but it ensures
you’re aware of the creatures’ presence.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your lantern’s light flares and burns bright, leaving no
shadows in which secrets and enemies can hide. Against
the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, the status
bonuses from the lantern’s initiate benefit increase to
+2. The creature takes a –2 status penalty to Deception
checks and Stealth checks as long as it’s within the
lantern’s light. The creature can’t be concealed while
it’s in the lantern’s light, though it still can potentially
become hidden or undetected using cover or means
other than the concealed condition.
Paragon Benefit
17th
In addition to the other benefits, your lantern reveals
all things as they truly are. The bright light increases to
40 feet, with dim light out 40 feet further. While you’re
holding your lantern, the GM rolls a secret counteract
check against any illusion or transmutation that comes
within the lantern’s bright light, but only for the
purpose of determining whether you and others can see
through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against a
polymorph spell, you can see the creature’s true form,
but you don’t end the spell). Use half your level rounded
up as the counteract level and your class DC – 10 as
the counteract modifier. On a failed counteract check,
the lantern can’t attempt to counteract that illusion or
polymorph effect again until midnight. You can choose
to leave any illusion or transmutation you discover
intact, instead of counteracting it.
MIRROR
Mirror implements represent misdirection, illusion, and
sleight of hand, bending and shifting a perspective and
the way you look at things. While larger mirrors hold
the same mystic connotations, thaumaturges always
choose small, portable, handheld mirrors as implements
so they can use them easily while adventuring. Mirror
implements are associated with the harrow suit of
keys, and the astrological signs of the stranger and
the swallow.
Initiate Benefit
You learn how to use your mirror to project another
version of yourself whose realness is a matter of
perspective. You gain the Mirror’s Reflection action.

MIRROR’S REFLECTION [one-action]
ILLUSION
MAGICAL
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You’re holding your mirror implement.
You reflect an illusory image of yourself into another
unoccupied space within 15 feet that you can see. You
are treated as being in both spaces until the start of your
next turn. For example, you can attack, Seek, and provide
flanking—even with yourself. You occupy both spaces.
Your mirror self mimics your actions exactly, but any
effects you generate come from only one of your positions;
you decide which each time you act. For example, if you
made a melee Strike against a creature within reach of the
reflection, you’d mime the actions of the Strike, but only the
reflection would actually make the Strike. Anything that
targets or would affect your reflection affects you and uses
your statistics. Something that would target or affect both
of you affects you only once. For example, a fireball that
included both of you in its area would require only one save
from you and damage you no more than once. When you
move, you choose which square to move from, but the mirror
effect ends (see below).
Some events force you to determine which image is the
real you, and then end the effect and cause your mirror self
to disappear; this happens automatically at the start of your
next turn. It also happens if you choose to move out of your
space. Other benefits of this implement add more events
that can end the reflection. The effect also ends when you
fall unconscious, at which point you decide which version is
truly you.
Adept Benefit
7th
Your mirror self shatters into punishing shards when
damaged. While Mirror’s Reflection is in effect, when an
enemy adjacent to one of your spaces damages you, that
version of you explodes into mirror shards. This ends
Mirror’s Reflection (establishing the remaining version
of you as the real one) and deals slashing damage to
all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around where your
mirror self was. The damage is equal to 2 + half your
level or the damage of the triggering attack, whichever is
lower. You’re immune to this damage.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Reinforcing your mirror lets it play tricks on your enemy’s
senses as it bends light this way or that. You become
concealed to the target of your Exploit Vulnerability
as your mirror warps its perceptions. As normal for
concealment where your overall location is still obvious,
you can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak.
Paragon Benefit
17th
You’ve become so skilled at reflecting yourself that
you can combine making a reflection with your other
movements to act right away. When you use Mirror’s
Reflection, you can have one of your selves immediately
Interact, Seek, or Strike.
REGALIA
Regalia implements represent rulership, leadership,
and social connections. While they differ in shape
depending on regional customs and markers used to
signify authority, common regalia implements are
scepters, jeweled orbs, and heraldic banners. Regalia
implements are associated with the harrow suit of
crowns and the astrological signs of the patriarch and
the sovereign dragon.
Initiate Benefit
While you hold your regalia, you gain an air of authority
and bolster the courage of allies who believe in you.
Your regalia aids you when you attempt to convince
others. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception,
Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks. Allies who can see
you can use Follow the Expert to follow you even if
you’re only trained in a skill and not an expert, due
to the competence you clearly exude. When they do,
the circumstance bonus they gain from Following the
Expert is +1.
When you are holding your regalia, you gain an
inspiring aura that stokes the courage of you and all
allies in a 15-foot emanation who can see you, granting
them a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear. At
the end of your turn, at the same time you would reduce
your frightened value by 1, you reduce the frightened
value of all allies within your inspiring aura by 1. Your
aura has the emotion, mental, and visual traits.
Adept Benefit
7th
Your regalia’s power increases, and so do the abilities it
grants. The circumstance bonus you gain to Deception,
Diplomacy, and Intimidation increases to +2, as long as
you have master proficiency in each skill. When others
use Follow the Expert to follow you, you grant them
a +2 circumstance bonus if you are trained, +3 if you
have expert proficiency, or +4 if you have master or
legendary proficiency.
The courage your aura instills grows stronger. The +1
status bonus now applies to all saving throws against
mental effects, rather than only against fear, and you
and allies in your aura gain a +2 status bonus to damage
rolls. At 11th level, this increases to a +3 status bonus
to damage rolls, and at 17th level, this increases to a +4
status bonus to damage rolls.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your regalia implement makes you seem more
confident and inspiring with each success. Whenever
you successfully Strike the target of your Exploit
Vulnerability, choose an ally that you can see. That ally
gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls against
the creature until the beginning of your next turn. If the
attack roll was a critical hit, the circumstance bonus
increases to +2.

Paragon Benefit
17th
Your regalia grants you the true gravitas of rulership, tying together the
hearts and minds of your allies and making it impossible for you to leave a
bad impression. If you roll a critical failure on a check to Coerce, Make an
Impression, or Request, you get a failure instead. When others use Follow the
Expert to follow you, you grant them a +3 circumstance bonus if you are trained
or +4 if you are an expert or above.
Allies in your inspiring aura aren’t flat-footed from being flanked unless you
too are flanked. If one of your allies in the aura is clumsy, enfeebled, frightened,
sickened, or stupefied, the status penalty your ally takes from the condition is 1
lower than the condition’s value as long as the ally remains in the aura, unless
you too are affected by the same condition.
TOME
Tome implements embody lost knowledge and otherworldly insights. While a
weathered book is most common, tome implements can have as many different
form factors as there are ways to store knowledge, from carved clay tablets to
bundles of knotted cords. Tome implements are associated with the harrow suit
of books and the astrological signs of the stargazer and the underworld dragon.
Initiate Benefit
While you hold your tome, lines of text appear on the open pages, revealing
useful information. While you hold your tome, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to all skill checks to Recall Knowledge.
During your daily preparations, you can gain the trained proficiency rank in
two skills of your choice until you prepare again. You retain the benefit as long
as the tome is on your person, even if you aren’t holding it. At 3rd level, you’re
an expert in one of the skills and trained in the other, and at 5th level, you’re an
expert in both skills. Since these proficiencies are temporary, you can’t use them
as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.
Adept Benefit
7th
In addition to the initiate benefits, your tome inscribes insights into creatures
that you can use to strike them down. While holding your tome, at the start of
your turn each round, attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature
of your choice that you’re observing. If this check succeeds, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature
before the start of your next turn.
When you gain temporary skill proficiencies during your
daily preparations, one is at expert proficiency and the
other at master proficiency. At 9th level, you have master
proficiency in both.
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your tome’s power not only reads a creature’s present but even
records its future actions. When you use Intensify Vulnerability,
roll a d20 and set the result aside. At any time until the start
of your next turn, you can use the d20 result you set aside for an
attack roll to Strike the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, instead of
rolling a new d20; this is a fortune effect.
Paragon Benefit
17th
In addition to the other benefits, your tome’s information alerts you to
ambushes and attacks from your foes. While holding your tome, you can
always roll a skill check for initiative against creatures or haunts using Esoteric
Lore. If you do, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to your initiative roll.

The initiate benefit’s circumstance bonus to Recall
Knowledge from holding your tome increases from +1
to +2. When you succeed at the Recall Knowledge check
granted by the tome’s adept benefit, the bonus applies to all
attack rolls you make before the start of your next turn, not
just your next one. Lastly, when you gain temporary skill
proficiencies, both are legendary.
WAND
Wand implements are short, lightweight batons, usually
made of wood but often incorporating other materials. Due
to their association with spellcasters, wand implements are
connected to magic and its practice, as well as the direction
and manipulation of energy. Wand implements are associated
with the astrological signs of the thrush and the sky dragon.
Initiate Benefit
Your wand slowly collects ambient magic, which you can
project at a foe in a barely controlled display of charged
energy. When you gain this implement, choose whether
your wand is attuned to cold, electricity, or fire. You gain
the Fling Magic activity.
FLING MAGIC [two-actions]
CONCENTRATE
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You are holding your wand implement.
You fling magical energy at a target within 60 feet, dealing
damage equal to 1d4 + your Charisma modifier to the target, with
a basic Reflex save against your class DC. The damage is of the
type you selected when you gained your wand implement. At 3rd
level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4.
You can expend more energy than usual to boost the effect
of Fling Magic, dealing d6s of damage instead of d4s. After you
do so, the wand takes 1d4 rounds to recharge, during which
you can’t boost the wand’s damage but can continue to Fling
Magic normally. If you critically hit with a Strike, your wand
recharges immediately as it draws in power from the clash.
Special This activity has the trait corresponding to the
damage type you selected.
Adept Benefit
7th
You gain versatility and additional benefits when you
fire your wand. The range of Fling Magic increases to
120 feet. Choose a second damage type from the list;
whenever you Fling Magic, you can select between either
of the two damage types you have chosen. Fling Magic
has an additional effect if the target fails its save and takes
damage, depending on the type.
•	 Cold: The target becomes chilled, taking a –10-foot
status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.
•	 Electricity: The target is shocked, becoming
flat‑footed until the end of your next turn.
•	 Fire: The target catches flame, taking 1d10 persistent
fire damage (or 2d10 on a critical failure). If you
have the wand paragon benefit, this increases to 2d10
persistent fire damage (or 4d10 on a critical failure).
Intensify Vulnerability
9th
Your empowered wand surges with ever-more-powerful
magic. When you Fling Magic to damage the target of
your Exploit Vulnerability, you deal additional damage to
the creature equal to 1 + the number of damage dice.
Paragon Benefit
17th
Your mastery of your wand grants you increased versatility,
range, and area. The range of Fling Magic increases to 180
feet. You gain the ability to choose between all three damage
types (cold, electricity, and fire) each time you use Fling
Magic. When you Fling Magic, you can choose to target a
single creature or to affect all creatures in a 20-foot burst.
WEAPON
Weapon
implements
are
the
most
direct
and
confrontational,
representing
battle,
struggle,
and
potentially violence. You can choose only a one-handed
weapon as an implement, which allows you to channel
energies into your weapon as well as hold your other
implements once you gain them. Weapon implements
are associated with the harrow suit of hammers and the
astrological signs of the rider and the swordswoman.
Initiate Benefit
Your weapon trembles slightly in your hand, seeking out
your foe’s weakness to it and interrupting their actions.
You gain the Implement’s Interruption reaction.
At 5th level, when you gain thaumaturgic weapon
expertise, your instinctive knowledge of your weapon
implement also grants you the weapon’s critical
specialization effect.
IMPLEMENT’S INTERRUPTION [reaction]
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
THAUMATURGE
Trigger The target of your Exploit Vulnerability uses a
concentrate, manipulate, or move action, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
Requirements You’re holding your weapon implement and are
benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability against a creature. The
creature must be within your reach if you’re wielding a melee
weapon, or within 10 feet if you’re wielding a ranged weapon.
Your weapon senses a moment of weakness and guides your
hand to strike down a foe. Make a Strike against the triggering
creature with your weapon implement. If your attack is a
critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action. This Strike doesn’t
count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple
attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
Adept Benefit
7th
When your implement lashes out at your foe, even a
close miss brings the weapon close enough to do harm.
When you use Implement’s Interruption and fail (but
don’t critically fail) the Strike, you deal 1 damage of
the weapon’s normal type, possibly applying any bonus
damage due to the target’s weakness.

9th
Your weapon is drawn to your enemy’s vital spots, almost
of its own accord. You gain a +2 status bonus to attack
rolls against the target of your Exploit Vulnerability.
Paragon Benefit
17th
The way your implement connects to your foe makes its
interruptions incredibly disruptive. You now disrupt the
triggering action on a hit with Implement’s Interruption,
rather than needing a critical hit.
Thaumaturge Feats
At every level that you gain a thaumaturge feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
AMMUNITION THAUMATURGY
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
You’re so used to handling your implement, weapon, and
esoterica in the heat of combat that adding a few bullets or
arrows to the mix is no extra burden. You can Interact to reload
a weapon using the hand holding your implement.
DIVERSE LORE
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Your wandering studies mean you’ve heard rumors or theories
about almost every topic... though admittedly, your sources aren’t
always the most reliable. You can take a –2 penalty to your check
to Recall Knowledge with Esoteric Lore to Recall Knowledge
about any topic, not just the usual topics available for Esoteric
Lore. Additionally, when you succeed at your check to Exploit
a Vulnerability, compare the result of your Esoteric Lore check
to the DC to Recall Knowledge for that creature; if that number
would be a success or a critical success, you gain information as if
you had succeeded at the Recall Knowledge check.
DIVINE DISHARMONY [one-action]
FEAT 1
DIVINE
ENCHANTMENT
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
From your collection of religious trinkets, you pull out opposing
divine objects—such as the religious symbols of two deities
that are hated enemies—and combine them in a display that
causes discordant clashes of divine energy that are especially
distracting to the faithful. Roll your choice of a Deception or
Intimidation check against the Will DC of a creature you can
see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature
is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a cleric, celestial,
monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might
determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an
alghollthu, is unaffected.
Critical Success The creature is flat-footed to your attacks until
the end of your next turn.
Success The creature is flat-footed against your attacks until
the end of your current turn.
FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Whether by following occult rituals, piecing together scraps
of arcane theory, or some other method, you’ve called forth a
creature that now serves as your constant companion in your
studies of the supernatural. You gain a familiar.
HAUNT INGENUITY
FEAT 1
DIVINATION
DIVINE
THAUMATURGE
Your cunning knowledge grants you the ability to notice the
emotional echo of a soul that passed on, leaving a haunt in
its wake. Even when you aren’t Searching while in exploration
mode, the GM rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts that
usually require you to be Searching.
You can disable haunts that require master proficiency in a
skill as long as you’re at least trained in the skill. If you have
master proficiency in the skill, you can disable haunts that
require a proficiency rank of legendary instead.
ROOT TO LIFE [one-action] OR [two-actions]
FEAT 1
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
NECROMANCY
PRIMAL
THAUMATURGE
Marigold, spider lily, pennyroyal—many primal traditions connect
flowers and plants with the boundary between life and death, and
you can leverage this association to keep an ally on this side of
the line. You place a small plant or similar symbol on an adjacent
dying creature, immediately stabilizing them; the creature is no
longer dying and is instead unconscious at 0 Hit Points.
If you spend 2 actions instead of 1, you empower the act
further by uttering a quick folk blessing to chase away ongoing
pain, adding the auditory trait to the action. When you do
so, attempt flat checks to remove each source of persistent
damage affecting the target; due to the particularly effective
assistance, the DC is 10 instead of the usual 15.
SCROLL THAUMATURGY
FEAT 1
THAUMATURGE
Your multidisciplinary study of magic means you know how to
activate the magic in scrolls with ease. You can activate scrolls
of any magical tradition, using your thaumaturge class DC for
the scroll’s DC, rather than a particular spell DC. If a spell is on
the spell list for multiple traditions, you choose which tradition
to use at the time you activate the scroll. You can draw and
activate scrolls with the same hand holding an implement,
much like you can for esoterica.
2ND LEVEL
CALL IMPLEMENT [one-action]
FEAT 2
ARCANE
CONJURATION
MANIPULATE
TELEPORTATION
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You have a free hand.
You can tug on the bonds of ownership between yourself and
your implement, causing it to find its way back to you. You
look down and find that your implement has mysteriously
appeared in your free hand, as long as the implement was
within 1 mile and on the same plane of existence. If your
implement is attended by another creature, that creature can

prevent the implement from teleporting away if it succeeds at
a Will save against your class DC. If the creature succeeds, you
can’t attempt to Call that Implement again; you must track the
creature down to get the implement back.
ENHANCED FAMILIAR
FEAT 2
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites a familiar
By applying the best of multiple traditions of magic, you’ve
found a more efficient way for your familiar to store its energy.
You can select four familiar or master abilities each day,
instead of two.
ESOTERIC WARDEN
FEAT 2
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
When you apply antithetical material against a creature
successfully, you also ward yourself against its next attacks.
When you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability,
you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC against the creature’s
next attack and a +1 status bonus to your next saving throw
against the creature; if you critically succeed, these bonuses
are +2 instead. You can gain these bonuses only once per
day against a particular creature, and the benefit ends if you
Exploit Vulnerability again.
TALISMAN ESOTERICA
FEAT 2
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
You know how to assemble the supernatural objects in your
esoterica into a number of temporary talismans. Each day
during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans
with an item level no higher than half your level. You must
know each talisman’s formula. A talisman created this way is
a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make
your daily preparations.
You know the formulas for all common talismans in the Core
Rulebook of your level or lower. You remember your talisman
formulas through oral tradition or mnemonics, so you don’t
need a formula book for them.
TURN AWAY MISFORTUNE [reaction]
FEAT 2
ABJURATION
ESOTERICA
FORTUNE
MANIPULATE
OCCULT
THAUMATURGE
Trigger You would attempt a roll affected by a misfortune effect.
You perform a superstition, such as casting salt over your
shoulder to ward off bad luck. Turn Away Misfortune’s fortune
trait cancels out the misfortune effect, causing you to roll
normally. As normal, you can apply only one fortune ability
to a roll, so if you Turned Away Misfortune on an attack roll,
you couldn’t also use an ability like Halfling Luck to alter the
roll further.
4TH LEVEL
BREACHED DEFENSES
FEAT 4
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
You can find the one weak point in a creature’s scales, wards,
or armor to get past its resistances. When you succeed at
Exploit Vulnerability, you learn about the highest of the
creature’s resistances that can be bypassed (for example, if
the creature has resistance to physical damage except silver),
if the creature has one. If you prefer, you can choose the
following benefit instead of one of the usual two benefits from
Exploit Vulnerability.

Breached Defenses You can choose this benefit only if you succeeded at Exploit
Vulnerability and learned the creature has at least one resistance that can be
bypassed. Choose one such resistance. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes bypass
the chosen resistance.
INSTRUCTIVE STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 4
THAUMATURGE
You attack your foe and analyze how it reacts. Make a Strike. On a hit, you can
immediately attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about the target. On a critical hit,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check to Recall Knowledge.
PAIRED LINK
FEAT 4
DIVINATION
ESOTERICA FORTUNE
OCCULT
THAUMATURGE
You break a trinket such as a lodestone or jade pendant in two, creating a sympathetic
link between the halves that bridges distance. During your daily preparations, you
perform a short ceremony where you gift one of the two halves to a willing ally.
On that ally, you can cast spells and use thaumaturge abilities that have a range of
touch at a range of 30 feet instead, and the ally can cast spells that have a range of
touch on you from a range of 30 feet. These effects last as long as you and the ally
have their half; if either half leaves either of your possession for even a moment,
or if you establish a link with a new ally during your next daily preparations, the
link breaks.
THAUMATURGIC RITUALIST
FEAT 4
UNCOMMON
THAUMATURGE
Your studies into the supernatural have resulted in an especially strong knowledge
of rituals. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to perform a ritual.
You learn two uncommon rituals with a level no higher than half your level; you must
meet all prerequisites for casting the ritual to choose it. You can cast these as the
primary caster, but you can’t teach them to anyone else or allow someone else to
serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well.
At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual
with a level no higher than half your level and for which you meet the prerequisites.
6TH LEVEL
ONE MORE ACTIVATION
FEAT 6
THAUMATURGE
You’ve forged a deeper bond to your invested items, allowing you to activate them
more than usual. Once each day, you can Activate an Item you’ve invested even
after you’ve used that activation the maximum number of times for its frequency.
You can do so only if the item’s level is half your level or lower, the activation has
a frequency of once per day or more frequent, and you haven’t already used the
activation this round.
SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 6
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Scroll Thaumaturgy
Your esoterica includes scraps of scriptures, magic tomes, druidic markings, and the
like, which you can use to create temporary scrolls. Each day during your daily
preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell
of any tradition. The spell must be common, or you must otherwise have access to
it. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you
make your daily preparations if you haven’t used it by then. It can’t be used to Learn
the Spell.
At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-level spell.

SYMPATHETIC VULNERABILITIES
FEAT 6
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability, mortal weakness or
personal antithesis
When you apply your will to invoke a vulnerability, the result
is more powerful, and the vulnerability ripples out in a web
from your main target to affect a broader range of creatures.
This has one of two effects, based on the type of vulnerability
you invoked.
While you have mortal weakness applied, your Strikes
also apply that weakness against any creature that has that
weakness, not just creatures of the exact same kind. For
instance, if you used mortal weakness against a red dragon
to apply its weakness to cold to your Strikes, those Strikes
would also apply to the weakness to cold of fire elementals
or any other creature with a weakness to cold.
While you have personal antithesis applied to a
non-humanoid creature, you can apply your custom weakness
to all creatures of the exact same kind. For example, if you
used personal antithesis against an imp, the custom weakness
would apply to other imps but not to other non-imp devils.
8TH LEVEL
CURSED EFFIGY [one-action]
FEAT 8
CURSE
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
Requirements Your last action was a successful Strike against
the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, and the Strike dealt
physical damage.
After your attack, you grab a bit of blood, cut hair, or other
piece of the creature’s body. You incorporate the material
into a premade doll, paper figure, or other effigy to create a
sympathetic link that makes it harder to resist your abilities. As
long as you are Exploiting Vulnerability against that creature,
it takes a –2 status penalty to its saving throws against
thaumaturge abilities or items that use your thaumaturge
class DC.
ELABORATE TALISMAN ESOTERICA
FEAT 8
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Talisman Esoterica
As you continue to collect talismanic esoterica, you improve
your ability to create temporary talismans. You can create four
temporary talismans each day instead of two.
Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th
level or higher, allowing you to create six talismans each day
instead of four.
INCREDIBLE FAMILIAR
FEAT 8
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar
By taking the best parts of each magical tradition, you’ve
found a way to grant your familiar even more abilities than
other familiars. You can select a base of six familiar or master
abilities each day, instead of four.
KNOW-IT-ALL
FEAT 8
THAUMATURGE
Having heard every rumor or story in the book, you know
that if you’ve heard of something in the first place, you’ve
probably heard about it at length. When you succeed at a
check to Recall Knowledge, you gain additional information
or context about the given topic. When you critically
succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, at the GM’s
discretion, you might gain even more additional information
or context than normal.
10TH LEVEL
SHARE WEAKNESS [one-action]
FEAT 10
ESOTERICA
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability, mortal weakness
Requirements You are Exploiting a creature’s Vulnerability
using mortal weakness.
You select an object from your esoterica that has great
personal value to you, such as a locket or treasured ring,
and you grant it to an ally, establishing a personal link that
allows your ally to affect an enemy as if they were you.
The ally’s Strikes apply the weakness from your mortal
weakness the same way your Strikes do. This benefit
ends when your Exploit Vulnerability ends or you Share
Weakness again.
THAUMATURGE’S INVESTITURE
FEAT 10
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Charisma 16
Magical equipment and gear are the tools of your trade, and
you know you need as many as possible to help you against
the supernatural. You gain the Incredible Investiture skill
feat, increasing your limit on invested items from 10 to 12.
The limit increases to 14 if you have Charisma 18, 16 if you
have Charisma 20, 18 if you have Charisma 22, and 20 if you
have Charisma 24.
TWIN WEAKNESS [two-actions]
FEAT 10
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites mortal weakness or personal antithesis
Requirements You’re holding an implement and a weapon,
you are using Exploit Vulnerability with mortal weakness
or personal antithesis, and the target creature is within
reach of both your implement and weapon.
As you make an attack augmented by your esoterica, you
also press your implement against the creature, applying its
weakness as your implement’s energies sear the creature’s
flesh. Make a melee Strike against the target of your
Exploit Vulnerability. On any attack roll result but a critical
failure, you also press your implement against the creature,
automatically dealing the additional damage from Exploit
Vulnerability. This is in addition to any damage from your
Strike, including the weakness the Strike applies from Exploit
Vulnerability. This counts as two attacks when calculating
your multiple attack penalty.

ELABORATE SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Scroll Esoterica
You’ve picked up more scraps of magic texts, improving your makeshift scrolls. In addition
to your daily scrolls from Scroll Esoterica, add a scroll with a 3rd-level spell. At 14th level,
add a scroll with a 4th-level spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a 5th-level spell.
INTENSIFY INVESTITURE [free-action]
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Your bond to your invested items enables you to put more of yourself into them. If
you next action is to activate an invested item that has a saving throw DC, you can
use your thaumaturge class DC instead of the item’s DC if it is higher.
SHARED WARDING
FEAT 12
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Esoteric Warden
You ward your allies from the attacks of your foes whenever you apply those
protections to yourself. When you gain a status bonus to AC and saves from Esoteric
Warden, you can choose to grant the same benefit to all allies within 30 feet.
THAUMATURGE’S DEMESNE
FEAT 12
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
ARCANE
THAUMATURGE
You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to
ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more
than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area,
you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.
Once you’ve chosen your demesne, it’s automatically protected by an arcane
private sanctum spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your
level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a
spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three
unseen custodians, as a successful unseen custodian ritual (Advanced
Player’s Guide 245), and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel,
as a successful elemental sentinel ritual (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 150).
14TH LEVEL
ESOTERIC REFLEXES
FEAT 14
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites an implement that grants a reaction
Your bond to your implements is so strong that you can use their reactive abilities
almost by instinct. At the start of your turn, you gain an additional reaction, which
you can use for only the reactions granted by your implements.
GRAND TALISMAN ESOTERICA
FEAT 14
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Talisman Esoterica
You’ve completed your journey in studying esoteric talismans, gaining the ability to
place multiple talismans on an item. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an
item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a Talisman, you can
specially treat one item you’re working on, allowing it to have two active talismans
at once. This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item
with this ability.

TRESPASS TELEPORTATION [reaction]
FEAT 14
CONJURATION
OCCULT
TELEPORTATION
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Exploit Vulnerability
Requirements You are benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability.
Trigger The target of your Exploit Vulnerability is within 120
feet and uses a teleportation effect.
You can hunt your foe to the ends of creation. You teleport along
with the enemy, appearing the same direction and distance from
it as you were before it teleported (or the nearest unoccupied
space if your destination is occupied). Any allies affected by
Share Weakness or Ubiquitous Weakness, if you have those
abilities, can spend their reaction to teleport along with the
enemy if they’re within 120 of the enemy and choose to do so.
16TH LEVEL
IMPLEMENT’S FLIGHT
FEAT 16
PRIMAL
THAUMATURGE
TRANSMUTATION
By weakening your relation to the ground and strengthening
your relation to the sky, you’ve learned to soar through the
air, your implement carrying you as surely as any broomstick
or pestle. As long as you’re holding a thaumaturge implement,
you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.
SEVEN-PART LINK
FEAT 16
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Paired Link
Many traditions hold the number seven as significant. By
exchanging pieces of a seven-part set of esoterica, you create
a magical web by which your allies can affect each other at a
distance. When you use Paired Link during your daily preparations,
you can exchange linking esoterica with up to six willing allies,
keeping one piece for yourself. In addition to the normal effects of
Paired Link, if a linked ally casts a spell with a range of touch, they
can target linked allies within 30 feet with that spell.
SEVER MAGIC [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ABJURATION
ARCANE
ESOTERICA
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You’re holding an implement.
You apply a frayed thread, a pinch of fulu ash, or a similar undone
charm to your weapon, and swing to break a spell. Make a Strike
against an enemy. If you hit and deal damage, you attempt to
counteract a single spell active on the target (your choice). Your
counteract level is equal to half your level (rounded up), and
your counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC – 10.
18TH LEVEL
GRAND SCROLL ESOTERICA
FEAT 18
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Elaborate Scroll Esoterica
You’ve completed the third and final step in your assimilation
of scroll esoterica, granting you daily scrolls of incredible
power. In addition to your daily scrolls from Scroll Esoterica
and Elaborate Scroll Esoterica, add a single scroll with a
6th-level spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-level spell.
IMPLEMENT’S ASSAULT [three-actions]
FEAT 18
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
THAUMATURGE
Requirements You’re holding an implement.
Your implement supercharges your weapon to shoot an impossible
volley or carve through your foes. Make a Strike with your weapon
against each enemy within 30 feet of you. You don’t increase your
multiple attack penalty until after making all the attacks. If your
weapon is a melee weapon and any of the attacks are outside
your reach, you Release the weapon before the Strikes, and it
returns to your grasp after all of them. If your hands are full when
the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
INTENSE IMPLEMENT
FEAT 18
THAUMATURGE
You have an exceptional link to your third implement. You gain
the adept benefit for your third implement.
20TH LEVEL
UBIQUITOUS WEAKNESS
FEAT 20
MANIPULATE
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Share Weakness
You’ve nurtured your bonds with your comrades, allowing you
to share the benefits of your esoterica. When you use Exploit
Vulnerability and choose mortal weakness, select any number
of allies within 30 feet of you. Their Strikes apply the weakness
from mortal weakness the same way your Strikes do. This benefit
ends when you stop benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability. Since
this effect depends on magically strengthening your bond to
your allies, only allies with whom you’ve developed a rapport
over the course of one or more days gain the benefit.
UNLIMITED DEMESNE
FEAT 20
ARCANE
CONJURATION
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites Thaumaturge’s Demesne
You can move your demesne here and there, bringing it wherever
your journey takes you. Your demesne expands to a maximum of
10,000 square feet. Once per day, you can call your demesne forth,
which takes 1 minute. This has the effects of resplendent mansion,
except that it conjures your demesne from its previous location,
with all the benefits of Thaumaturge’s Demesne in addition to the
those of the spell. You must be able to claim the new area, with
the same restrictions as Thaumaturge’s Demesne.
WONDER WORKER
FEAT 20
THAUMATURGE
Prerequisites legendary in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
The thaumaturge’s path culminates with the working of wonders.
Once per day, you can align your esoterica to cast a spell of 8th
level or lower that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions to cast. The spell must
be common or one to which you have access. You can choose a
spell of any tradition for which you’re legendary in the associated
skill (Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occultism for occult, or
Religion for divine). Use your thaumaturge class DC in place of any
necessary spell DC and your thaumaturge class DC – 10 in place of
any necessary counteract modifier or spell attack modifier.
