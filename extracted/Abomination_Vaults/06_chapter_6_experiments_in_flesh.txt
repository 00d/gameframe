CHAPTER 6:
Experiments in Flesh
Under Belcorra, the Abomination Vault’s sixth level
was split between support for the arena above and the
laboratories that created new and terrible monsters.
The two activities weren’t all that separate since
the most powerful of the monsters created in the
laboratories fought in the arena, where the survivors
joined Belcorra’s growing ranks of monsters to assault
Absalom. Conversely, failures in the arena became
fodder for further experiments in the laboratories.
When Belcorra died, the overbearing control of a
bone devil named Tarkannah initially kept inﬁghting
on this level at a minimum, but many creatures chafed
at Tarkannah’s control. The seugathi ﬂeshwarper
Jafaki organized a coup and murdered the bone devil,
taking control of the entire ﬂoor. Since this rebellion,
Jafaki has maintained the level as the seugathis’
domain, believing their resources are better spent
on the relentless reﬁning of experiments rather than
expanding territory.
Due to Jafaki’s relatively relaxed disposition toward
administration, creatures on this level tend to look
after themselves. Many are more recent arrivals who
have come seeking the seugathis’ skills and are willing
to risk experimentation for the chance of becoming
stronger. Creatures who haven’t been slated for
ﬂeshwarping yet spend most of their time drinking
and relaxing in a large, central chamber that has
long served as a tavern called the Warped Brew. The
urdefhan Vischari manages the Warped Brew, keeping
cooks, bartenders, and even a band on retainer.
Laboratories Features
This level feels more cramped than the lofty arena
level above because of its lower ceilings, which average
10 feet high in halls and 15 feet high in rooms, unless
otherwise indicated. None of the rooms on this level
have light, as the denizens can all see in the dark.
The stone doors throughout this level have sturdy
iron hinges; most can be simply pushed open, which
the seugathi do to move around. The smell of acrid
chemicals lingers throughout this level, except near the
Warped Brew Tavern (area F11), where the smell of
spilled fungus beer replaces it instead.
The map for this level appears on page 106.

F1. CENTRAL SHAFT
LOW 6
The wide spiral staircase continues downward, leveling out
long enough to pass by a single door leading east and a
hallway leading west to a double door. The space between
them has a rounded, cloudy window overlooking a large pool
in a natural cavern. A dim orange glow emanates from far
below and, with it, a sulfurous stench.
The spiral stairs lead up to the ﬁfth level (area E1)
and down to the seventh level (area G1). The stairs
and the walkway connecting them have a narrow iron
handrail to prevent a fall 40 feet down to area G1.
The window is magically transparent stone.
As it’s part of Gauntlight’s support and thus part
of the artifact, it can’t be damaged. It also can’t be
manipulated like the transparent stone elsewhere in
the dungeon, as it lacks control glyphs.
Creatures: Jafaki knows that controlling this main
staircase is the best way to keep Urevian’s troops
from invading his territory; it’s also the ideal place to
capture new research subjects. A seugathi is on guard
here, along with a grothlut chained to the handrail.
The grothlut can move anywhere along the walkway
in the northern half of the room.
The seugathi watches for attacks from below, so
heroes descending from above might catch them off
guard (moaning and gibbering from monsters on
the landing above aren’t unusual and don’t alert the
seugathi). If the seugathi knows someone is coming,
they cast see invisibility from their wand, suppress
their mindfog aura, and feign friendliness just long
enough to put the newcomers at ease. They then try to
take the intruders prisoner, ﬁghting to the death to do
so if necessary.
The grothlut moans and charges forward when it
detects intruders of any kind but loyally follows the
seugathi’s commands.

Reinforcements: Jafaki doesn’t replace these guards.
If this landing remains unguarded for more than 5
days, Urevian sends a cautious barbazu from area
G3 or G5 and two dreshkans from area G4 or G15 to
secure it.
F2. GRIME DEPOSITS
Rust and grime ﬁll this octagonal chamber. A wide hallway
leads to the south.
A circular shaft in the ceiling leads up 25 feet
through the stone to area E2. If the heroes haven’t
triggered the pit trap there, the shaft’s top is covered
with the rusty grate that collapses when moved.
F3. ROCKY CAVE
MODERATE 6
The mossy walls of this pebble-strewn cavern extend
upward to a ceiling thirty feet high. A wide, rounded
window ﬁfteen feet above the ﬂoor overlooks this cavern.
Dripping water echoes from the east. The moss on
the walls is edible and, in fact, surprisingly tasty.
Creatures: Belcorra bound several earth elementals
here, more to keep wandering guests out of her nature
preserve (area F4) than for any other reason. The
elementals spring from the walls and ﬂoor 1d4 rounds
after any creature enters this cavern. They have ethereal
shackles visible on their limbs, representing their bound
nature; the shackles prevent them from leaving this
cave, but they can lurk just within the walls and ﬂoor.
An elemental reduced to fewer than 5 Hit Points retreats
into the stone and doesn’t return for several days.

Side Quest: A hero who’s an expert in Arcana or
Occultism realizes that the elementals’ binding is
weak and can be undone. This reversal ritual must be
performed in sight of the binding location; the stairs
leading up to area F2 or the window in area F1 make
good locations for the ritual since the elementals
can’t attack anyone there. The ritual takes 4 hours,
consumes 60 gp of gems, and requires a hero to succeed
at a DC 25 Arcana or Occultism check. The character
attempting the check must be an expert in the skill
being used. Up to four other characters can act as
secondary casters. Each secondary caster can attempt
a DC 23 secondary check (Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook
408) using Arcana, Nature, or Occultism but must be
trained in the skill used. The unbinding can use fewer
than four secondary casters (and need not include

any). If the ritual succeeds, the elementals return to their home plane. The
living landslide grants a boon to one of the heroes who participated in the
unbinding (most likely the primary caster). That character gains the crystal
sense ability of a sod hound for 1 week.
Treasure: The sod hounds buried six gemstones worth 15 gp each, given
to them as payment for their service. Heroes who Search the area ﬁnd the
stones with a successful DC 27 Perception check; the hero with the crystal
sense ability locates them automatically.
F4. DEEP POOL
MODERATE 6
A rocky shoreline drops steeply into a large pool beneath several stalactites.
Five square shafts in the stony ceiling lead upward. To the south, a barrier of
transparent stone protects winding raised ledges that run along each side of the
cavern. A short bridge, similarly encased in transparent stone, crosses over the
pool to connect the two ledges.
This area functioned as Belcorra’s underground nature preserve. She
kept a pair of hydras here, as hydra blood has many applications in
alchemy, magic, and ﬂeshwarping. The pool averages 15 feet deep, and
tiny subterranean streams refresh its waters.
Creatures: Jafaki maintains the preserve and two hydras (descendants
of the original pair) for the same reasons Belcorra did. He induced them
into a chemical stupor to extend their lives, lower their food intake, and
reduce the amount of trouble they cause. When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, the
hydras are sleeping with just their heads above the water’s surface.
If the heroes approach this chamber carefully with at least half the party
successfully Avoiding Notice from the hydras, the creatures remain asleep.
Any actions that signiﬁcantly disturb the water—such as someone falling
into the room from above—rouse them.
Due to their forced alchemical hibernation, each hydra takes 3d4 rounds
to fully wake up; in the meantime, it’s slowed 2. Each time a hydra takes
damage, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 3.
The hydras defend their territory to the death but don’t pursue prey
beyond the conﬁnes of the cave.
HYDRAS (2)

F5. THE DEEP END
MODERATE 6
The southern end of this cavern is entirely ﬂooded. A walkway encased in
transparent stone runs along the eastern wall, ten feet above the water’s surface.
The hydras once kept their nest at the far end of the pool, where the
depth dips down to 25 feet. They’re afraid of the recent arrival here,
however, and now don’t venture into this part of the pool.
An overhang above the deepest part of the pool is pierced by a well
capped by a sturdy iron grate. The grate’s bolts appear to have been
broken from underneath, so the grate lifts off with only a little effort.
With a successful DC 20 Athletics check, anyone in the water can Climb
up into area F9.
CHAPTER 6 SYNOPSIS
The Abomination Vaults’ sixth level
served to support the gladiator
games in the arena above but also
included extensive laboratories
for creating increasingly bizarre
and powerful creatures. A small
team of seugathis pursue their
ﬂeshwarping experiments while
resisting encroachment from the
devils below. The heroes encounter
these worm‑like monsters, but they
also ﬁnd a strangely civilized tavern
in the midst of the dungeon.

A hero who Searches the walkway and succeeds at
a DC 20 Perception check ﬁnds a suspicious masonry
square near ﬂoor level. When pushed like a button,
this secret door to area F8 swings open.
Creature: Urevian sent a sarglagon to spy on Jafaki
and his plots several weeks ago. The sarglagon is
paranoid and unwilling to take risks that might overtly
expose their presence; therefore, they spend most
of their time fouling the water under the well if any
creatures come to ﬁll the bucket. If the heroes approach,
the devil believes they’ve been discovered by Jafaki’s
allies and desperately attacks. Unwilling to admit defeat
to Urevian, the sarglagon ﬁghts until slain. They carry
one of ﬁve pieces of Urevian’s pendant, used to open the
door into the contract devil’s domain (area G10).

F6. DISSECTION CHAMBER
LOW 6
Metal shelves and operating tables hint at this room’s
original purpose. Clean bones and bits of rusted metal lie in
piles throughout the rest of the room.
Jafaki has dumped garbage in this medical bay for
decades. Three shafts in the ceiling lead up to area E4.
The lids at the top open easily from within the shafts.
A hero Searching through the detritus discovers a
large key with an elaborate, four-prong design among
the various bits of junk in this room. The key opens
one of the locks in the plinth room (area F7).
Creatures: Two ochre jellies lazily squelch around
this chamber, feeding on trash thrown here. They
move to creatures they sense, expecting food; if the
characters don’t immediately offer some sort of food,
the jellies attack, ﬁghting until destroyed.

Treasure: Amid the jumble of items scoured clean

daggers, a pick, several caltrops, professional ﬁshing
tackle, a spyglass, 14 pitons, and 30 feet of chain.
F7. PLINTH ROOM
This chamber’s east and west walls feature sharply angled
alcoves bearing stone carvings too defaced to indicate what
they originally depicted. Two angled plinths stand here,
one in the alcove to the east and another in the alcove to
the west. A single door leads north; the south wall opposite
it bears the outline of a door but no handle or latch.
This mostly destroyed room once held relief art
extolling the majesty of Belcorra and Nhimbaloth. All
that remains are two plinths, one on both sides of the
room, that each bear a unique lock. The door to the
south and the one beyond it don’t open normally; each
is functionally a solid stone wall 2 feet thick unless
unlocked.
The eastern plinth features a lock with a round
keyhole; turning the proper key in this lock opens or
closes the northernmost door in the passage to the
south (the outline visible in this room) with a grinding
noise. The western plinth has four holes clustered
together in a metal plate; turning the proper key in
this lock opens or closes the southern of the two doors,
also with a loud grinding noise. Without the proper
keys, a character who’s a master in Thievery can
activate one of these tricky locks with ﬁve successful
DC 30 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock.
Three copies of each key exist scattered around this
level. The round key can be found on a shelf in the
old medical supply room (area E5) and in the prisoner
processing chamber (area F10). The four-pronged key
can be found on the ﬂoor of the old dissection chamber
(area F6) and in Vischari’s safe (area F16). Jafaki also
carries a copy of each key.
F8. OBSERVATION GALLERY
TRIVIAL 6
Fifteen feet below the ceiling, this gallery traverses all but
the east side of a large, bloodstained room with a ﬂoor
ﬁve feet lower than the gallery. A window made of cloudy,
transparent stone provides an excellent view of the nearby
room while blocking direct access to it. Two rounded
observation areas overlook the room from the north; a
small room to the south has a small table, an old chair, and
stairs leading up.
Belcorra used this walkway to observe one of her
champions closely as she pitted them against various
opponents or they settled disagreements through ritual
combat. A magical enchantment in the two rounded
observation vestibules transmit sound from the testing
ground into this observation gallery, but not vice
versa. The table features some pieces of chalk and

a few writing slates, upon which the seugathis take
notes when observing creatures in the testing grounds.
The stairs near the southwest corner lead up to
area E21.
The northwest door has no visible latches, but the
wall next to it features two distinct keyholes: one is
a round indentation, and the other is a circular piece
of stone with four separate holes. They function
identically to the keyholes in area F7.
The wall at the eastern end of the observation
gallery bears faintly glowing magical glyphs. These
glyphs simultaneously affect all the transparent stone
ringing the gallery and operate as described in area E9.
Two secret doors lead out of this room to the
north (to area F5) and southeast (to area F20). A
hero Searching the right area who succeeds at a DC
20 Perception check locates them. Both secret doors
operate the same way: a masonry square near ﬂoor
level depresses like a button and causes the secret door
to unlatch and swing open.
Creature: A seugathi researcher observes the
destrachan in the testing grounds and takes notes on a
writing slate. Upon noticing the intruders, the seugathi
becomes eager to see how the destrachan performs in
combat; they retreat as soon as possible to the east end
of the gallery to turn the wall ethereal. Once the wall
is no longer solid stone, the destrachan’s echolocation
allows it to recognize the heroes’ presence and join in
combat as the seugathi directs, together presenting a
severe-threat encounter for 6th-level characters.

F9. TESTING GROUNDS
MODERATE 6
This twenty-foot-high chamber’s stone ﬂoor is heavily
stained with blood. A wall of transparent stone separates
this room from an observation gallery that rings
its north, west, and south sides. The northeast
corner features a short stone well, while the
room’s south end has a steep, ascending
staircase. The room juts out a side
hall to the east that ends at a
charred circle in the stone
with a double door nearby.
This chamber was intended
for grudge matches between
gladiators;
however,
it
saw
equal use in testing aberrant
monsters’  capabilities. Since Jafaki seized control of
this level, the room has served only as testing grounds.
The room is 20 feet high from ﬂoor to ceiling, and
the ﬂoor is 5 feet below the observation gallery. Two
iron ladders bolted to the north wall ascend the 5 feet
to the transparent stone, but they don’t allow access to
the gallery unless the characters use the glyphs in area
F8 to render the stone ethereal.
A sturdy iron grate caps the well in the north. It
was built to provide food—normally in the form of
defeated combatants cut into chunks—to the hydras in
the pool. The grate appears ﬁrmly fastened to the stone

but easily comes off if tried. The sarglagon in area F5
has broken away the grate’s bolts for easy access to
the seugathis’ chambers, but it has yet to muster the
courage to venture into this room.
The steep staircase to the southeast leads up to the
gladiators’ mead hall (area E25). The charred circle in
the eastern wing is the other end of the teleportation
circle in the mead hall.
Creature: Upon arrival, the characters ﬁnd a
destrachan systematically shattering crystal chunks
with its destructive harmonics at the command of a
seugathi in the observation gallery. Hungry for fresh
meat, it attacks the heroes immediately, particularly
if they arrive with dramatic clanging through the
teleportation circle. The destrachan ﬁghts to the death
and pursues any foes that ﬂee. The seugathi in the
observation gallery, if present, takes notes throughout
the combat.

MODERATE 6
Anchored shackles and fetters line the north and west walls,
and bloodstains obscure the stone ﬂoor. At the east and
south, two sets of double doors lead out of the room; two
steep staircases beside each of them lead further below.
While Belcorra lived, jailers brought prisoners up the
stairs and shackled them to the walls before processing
their paperwork on a desk that has long since been
removed. These captives were then shufﬂed into the
arena, ready to meet their death for the entertainment
of Belcorra’s cheering guests. This room became a
frequent battleground during the brief the turf war
between Jafaki and Urevian. When some degree of
peace settled over these levels, Jafaki’s creations still
held this room. A single ﬂeshwarp remains on guard.
Three steps down the northern stairs, a solitary key
lies forgotten beneath a crusty chunk of dried viscera.
A hero who Searches the stairs and succeeds at a DC
15 Perception check locates it. The key has a round
shaft tipped with several teeth of varying length. It
opens one of the locks in area F7.
The stairs descend to area G12. The hallway on the
other side of the south double door gently slopes 10
feet down to the arena.
Creature: A single irnakurse guards this room. The
seugathis don’t realize it, but the devils have inﬂicted
an infernal malediction to gradually weaken the
creature. It’s now constantly restless and tense, but
it remains determined to slaughter anyone who isn’t
accompanied by a seugathi.

F11. WARPED BREW TAVERN
MODERATE 6
Polished wooden tables, chairs, and a long wooden bar
mark this chamber as a tavern. The smell of spilled beer
and fried morsels pervades the room. In the southeast
corner, an elevated stage overlooks the seating. Doors lead
out of this room along all four walls, including a double
door to the west that looks to be the main entrance.
Once an elaborate dining hall for Belcorra’s
gladiators and guests, this area has, over the years,
taken on the function of a tavern for ﬂeshwarped
creatures, those waiting to undergo ﬂeshwarping, and
a few rare visitors. It has had its current name—the
Warped Brew Tavern—for more than a century. Due
to Jafaki’s general lack of discipline, many of this
level’s denizens come here to drink, gamble, argue
about who’s next to go under the seugathis’ knives,
and listen to Shadow Malice, the resident band.
The door to the southwest opens onto a steep
stairway that leads up to area E9. When the poltergeists
there started ﬂinging debris down the stairway, the
patrons stopped using it, except as a garbage disposal.
The stairway is greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: Five creatures are usually found in the
tavern: a female drider named Lallizanx ﬂipping
through a book ﬁlled with crudely drawn drow erotica,
two morlocks playing a card game called towers,
a morlock tending the bar, and another morlock
complaining to the bartender about having to wait so
long for her ﬂeshwarping. There’s a 1 in 4 chance that
the tavern’s band, Shadow Malice, is on stage when
the heroes arrives; instead of randomly determining
this, you can also decide whether the band is playing.
Lallizanx is ostensibly the bouncer, but cares little
about what happens in the tavern. The morlock
patrons hope to be chosen for ﬂeshwarping in the near
future, and even the morlock bartender looks forward
to becoming like the powerful dreshkans who come
here from time to time.
Everyone here assumes that intruders from the
surface, like the heroes, have come to start a ﬁght. If
the heroes quickly display peaceful intentions, these
patrons keep a close eye on them but resume their

who persistently bothers her, insisting that they leave her
alone. The morlock bartender gives only a halfhearted
attempt to prevent the heroes from leaving by either of
the doors behind the bar; she doesn’t consider her pay
sufﬁcient to stand in the way of well-armed intruders.
The morlock patrons all idolize the band Shadow
Malice and bring them up in conversation.
If a ﬁght breaks out, the tavern’s urdefhan manager,
Vischari, comes from area F16 in 3 rounds to join the
battle. Vischari and Lallizanx ﬁght to the death to
protect the tavern they consider their home turf, while
any morlock reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points ﬂees.
If the members of Shadow Malice are present, they
retreat to area F18 rather than risk injury.

Side Quest: If the heroes seem curious
about Shadow Malice (regardless of
the band’s presence), the morlocks all
start chanting the band’s name and
“Challengers!” in Undercommon. It
might seem like the morlocks intend
to set up the heroes to ﬁght against
the band, but they call for a battle of
entertainment, not of weapons. The
cries bring Shadow Malice onto
the stage, if the band’s not already
there, and Ryta, the band’s
vocalist, explains the rules.
“You want to challenge us? Then let’s get to it. We’ll each
face oﬀ one-on-one. Each pair squares oﬀ with some kind
of show: music, acrobatic tricks, displays of strength,
whatever. Then we perform as two groups—mine then
yours—and let the crowd tell us who’s the best overall!”
The challenge has an individual and a group phase.
The individual phase pairs each hero with one of
Shadow Malice’s four members (if the party has
more than four heroes, some must sit out this phase).
A band member provides the best solo performance
they can on their instrument of choice, then the paired
hero can attempt a DC 22 check with a relevant skill,
such as Performance, Acrobatics, Athletics, or any you

deem appropriate to impress a crowd. (This DC is the
Performance DC of the band member, which is 22 for
all of them). Record each hero’s degree of success.
The second part is the group phase.
Shadow Malice performs a high-energy
musical number, then passes over their
instruments for the heroes to use (if the
heroes don’t have any instruments of their
own). Unlike the individual contests, this phase
requires a Performance check. If the heroes
balk, Ryta grins and says, “This stage is for
performers, friends.” To compete, one hero
must attempt a DC 22 Performance
check. This hero is the lead
performer. Any number of
other heroes can Aid at this
check. In addition, the lead
performer’s Performance
check gets a +2 bonus
for each hero who got
a critical success in the
individual phase, a +1 bonus for
each hero who got a success in the
individual phase, and a –1 penalty for each hero who
got a critical failure in the individual phase. Unlike
the normal rules for bonuses, these bonuses to the
Performance check are cumulative with each other.
If the lead performer succeeds at this ﬁnal
Performance check, Ryta acknowledges that the
heroes are Shadow Malice’s superiors on the stage
and resolves to leave them alone. Word gets back to
Vischari about the heroes’ success, and the tavern
manager treats them with a modicum of respect. On
a critical success, Ryta gives the heroes the group’s
instruments, insisting that the instruments belong
in the hands of such talented performers. The other
members of Shadow Malice grumble at this decision
but sullenly comply.
If the lead performer fails at this ﬁnal Performance
check, Shadow Malice sees the heroes as being out of
their depth and resolves to attack the heroes right on
the stage. The band members’ statistics are described
in area F18. Anyone remaining in the tavern simply
watches the ﬁght, considering it a bloody part of the
show. On a critical failure, the patrons join the ﬁght
after the ﬁrst round, which means the heroes should
likely make a hasty retreat before getting overwhelmed.
Treasure: The gambling morlocks have a total of 15
gp, 181 sp, a gold tooth worth 5 gp, and a perfectly
fossilized tuna skeleton on the table. Behind the bar,
there’s 28 gp and 74 sp in the cash box and a vial with
sloughing toxin (page 214) that the bartender can use
to poison troublesome patrons.
XP Award: If the heroes participate in the challenge
against Shadow Malice, award them the usual
30 XP for completing a side quest. If the
heroes win, award them an additional
80 XP.
F12. KITCHEN
This dirty kitchen features a lit stove
replete with oil stains, gristle, and the
strong aroma of smoke. Alcoves to the
north contain meat hooks and overﬂowing
baskets of fungus.
Many creatures that frequent the Warped
Brew are evil carnivores who relish the
ﬂesh of the living, so the meat hooks
often have intelligent creatures dangling
from them. There are three such
creatures here now. All still live but are
unarmed, weakened from their captivity, and
desperate to avoid being placed on the menu.
The creatures include a deep gnome named
Glashdrumdur, a drow named Falxi Orshendiel, and a
skulk named Jedzeli. The heroes ﬁnd all three of them
tightly bound, hanging from meat hooks, and unable
to free themselves.
Glashdrumdur: This grumpy deep gnome warrior
(Pathﬁnder Bestiary 75) has been here the longest
and is currently unconscious. If roused, he’s quick to
swear vengeance against the ﬂeshwarped raiders who
captured him. After even a few moments of reasoned
reﬂection, he acknowledges he’s outclassed and prefers
to leave the Abomination Vaults behind. He has little
to tell the heroes.
Falxi Orshendiel: This young drow rogue (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 137) is chaotic neutral. The most alert when the
heroes ﬁrst arrive here, he quickly asks for his freedom.
He knows the seugathis have considered transforming
him into a drider or feeding him to the patrons here,
and he desperately wishes to avoid either fate. He
explains that he hails from a small drow settlement
deeper underground called Yldaris, but he’s unwilling
to give much detail about Yldaris to strangers. He says
only that the city welcomes traders and that the heroes
should visit, peacefully, if they come to the area. Falxi
and two other drow were scouting farther from their
settlement than usual when urdefhans attacked them;
he was knocked unconscious and somehow ended
up here. Though selﬁsh, Falxi isn’t evil (nor are the
other inhabitants of Yldaris). If the heroes let him go,
he eventually returns to Yldaris and might meet the
heroes in area I6. The heroes’ encounter with Falxi

should suggest that Yldaris is a safe place to visit, and
set the stage for a peaceful encounter with drow living
in the lower levels.
Jedzeli: This unfortunate skulk (Pathﬁnder Bestiary
2 243) hangs limply on her hook, her right hand visibly
missing. She constantly mumbles and murmurs about
“the man in colored rags who takes hands.” Other
attempts at conversation with her prove unintelligible.
Before Ysondkhelir discovered the psychic human girl,
Dorianna Menhemes, he amused himself by tormenting
Jedzeli’s dreams. With a successful DC 22 Perception
check, a hero who has interacted with Dorianna notices
some disturbing similarities with the way Jedzeli mutters
about the “man in colored rags.” Helping Jedzeli reclaim
her sanity is a long and difﬁcult road outside the scope
of this adventure, but Glashdrumdur offers to look out
for her if the heroes set them both free.
Treasure: While nothing in this kitchen is suitable
for consumption by anyone but perhaps a goblin, a
large jar labeled “deadly nightshade” lies at the bottom
of one of the mushroom baskets. The jar contains four
doses of belladonna poison.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each
prisoner they set free and help to reach an exit to the
Abomination Vaults.
F13. LEVEL 6 PORTAL CHAMBER
This circular chamber is plainly used for storage, as
it has several large casks stacked along its rounded
walls. Dull silver ﬁlls the faded runes carved into the
stone walls.
This room contains an inert teleportation circle like
the ones in areas E18 and G2. As with those rooms,
this teleportation circle must be reactivated with the
awaken portal ritual before it can be used.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for activating
this portal.
F14. STORAGE ROOM
Spare chairs and shelves piled with grimy bottles and
poorly cleaned dishes ﬁll this storage room.
F15. MOLDY SUPPLIES
Fuzzy yellow moss covers the shelves of this room and
their contents.
Hazard: Yellow mold had started to grow here,
leaving the store room unusable. After months of
being left alone, the mold has grown all over the walls
and poses a danger to anyone entering this room.

Treasure: A forgotten moderate healing potion in

time to become oddly lumpy. Although the potion is
unpleasant to consume, it’s no less efﬁcacious for its
semi-congealed consistency.

F16. TAVERN OFFICE
LOW 6
This messy oﬃce features a battered wooden desk with
paperwork and ink stains scattered over its surface. The
only exit is a door to the south.
This ofﬁce belongs the manager of the Warped
Brew Tavern, an urdefhan named Vischari. The papers
include supply lists, startling recipes for serving
different kinds of fungus, and employee pay rates. The
chaos of the ofﬁce belies Vischari’s orderly mind—she
knows where everything is here.
Creature: Vischari used to make the trip from
the urdefhan stronghold deeper in the Abomination
Vaults to enjoy the atmosphere in the Warped Brew
a few times a year. On one visit, she realized that the
seugathis planned to capture and experiment on her
the next time she visited the establishment. Rather
than leave the tavern she’d come to enjoy, Vischari
elected to make herself indispensable by murdering the
tavern’s current owner and taking over its operation.
She’s proven to be a competent manager, so the
seugathis have kept their threats to operate on her to
a minimum.
Vischari knows that anyone disrupting the Warped
Brew’s operations threatens her livelihood, so she readily
attacks surface dwellers who barge in uninvited. If she
already knows the heroes, such as if they bested the
tavern’s band, she is merely brusque at insisting on her
privacy here, insisting that they leave before she guts
them and serves them in stew.

Necrotic Decay (divine, necromancy, negative) When
Vischari dies, her invisible ﬂesh rots away and sublimates
into a foul-smelling gas that ﬁlls a 5-foot emanation
around her body. This gas deals 7d6 negative damage to
creatures in this area as their ﬂesh curdles and rots (DC
24 basic Fortitude save).

Immobilizing Blow ʚʖ (incapacitation) Vischari makes a
ﬁst Strike that shuts down her target’s motor control.
The target must make a DC 25 Fortitude save. If the
Strike was a critical hit, treat the target’s save result
as one degree worse. The target is then temporarily
immune for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target is stunned 1.
Failure The target is paralyzed for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target is paralyzed for 1 minute.
At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new
Fortitude save to reduce the remaining duration by 1
round or end it entirely on a critical success.
Wicked Bite Ȱɵ Requirements Vischari damaged a
creature with a jaws Strike on her last action; Eﬀect
Vischari maintains contact, turning the creature’s ﬂesh
translucent around the site of the injury. Vischari
chooses one of two options, each of which requires the
target to attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save. If her jaws
Strike was a critical hit, the creature suﬀers both eﬀects,
using the same save result for both.
•	 Drain Blood Vischari drinks some of the creature’s
blood. On a failed save, the creature is drained 1
and Vischari regains 10 HP (on a critical failure, it’s
drained 2 and Vischari regains 20 HP).
•	 Drain Vitality (necromancy) Vischari draws out some
of the creature’s vital essence. The creature becomes
enfeebled 1 for 1 hour on a failed save (or enfeebled 2
for 1 hour on a critical failure).
Treasure: A dented safe under Vischari’s desk is
locked with a simple lock, but Vischari—perhaps
unwisely—keeps the key in the lock so she can access
it easily. The safe holds neat stacks of coins (34 gp,
179 sp, and 57 cp) and an odd key with an elaborate
four-prong design, which is one of the keys that opens
a lock in area F7.
F17. PRIVATE DINING
Placed against the east wall, a disgusting buﬀet table holds
a buﬀet of smelly fried morsels, gloppy dipping sauce, and
spiny mushrooms.
This food is provided for the members of Shadow
Malice. Although not poisonous, this buffet isn’t
likely to appeal to the palates of surface dwellers.
Doors exit to the north and south; the one to the
south has the words “Performers Only” written on it
in Undercommon.

MODERATE 6
Oversized furniture, certainly intended for rooms larger
than this one, has been jammed into this small room. An
acrid smell, like burning paint, ﬁlls the air.
Shadow Malice’s members hang out in this
room when not on stage. The smell comes from a
cracked and barely functioning hookah, but the band
members nevertheless use it with whatever substances
they ﬁnd.
Creatures: The four members of Shadow Malice are
Gulzash, Kragala, Nox, and Ryta. If encountered here,
they simply insist that the heroes leave them alone. If
the heroes seem up for a challenge but aren’t overtly
hostile, Ryta challenges them on the Warped Brew’s
main stage in area F11, in the performance challenge
described there.
If things come to blows with Shadow
Malice, Gulzash swings his battle lute
while Nox ﬁghts with their kukri.
Kragala and Ryta prefer to cast
spells to harass enemies from
a distance but can ﬁght
in melee if it becomes
necessary: Kragala clubs
foes with her drumsticks and
Ryta gnaws her enemies. Any
band member reduced to
fewer than 15 HP ﬂees, taking
their cherished instrument with
them to seek a safer gig somewhere else.

Props for the stage are stored here when not in use.
Gulzash usually sleeps on the folded curtain.
Treasure: The velvet curtain is in very good
condition and worth 10 gp, although it weighs 5 Bulk
and smells vaguely of xulgath stink. Folded up within
it is a clandestine cloak. Anyone Searching the room or
taking the curtain as loot discovers the cloak.
F20. LOWER OBSERVATION DECK
MODERATE 6
This long chamber is rounded on both ends with a door
to the north and a curved wall of transparent stone to the
south. A faint stink wafts from an exit in the west wall.
This observation area permits an intimate view
of the arena ﬁghts. Since viewing the spectacle is a
bit better from the higher arena balconies, usually
trainers or ﬂeshwarpers watched the ﬁghts here to get
a close and detailed view of the action.
Creatures: A seugathi servant observes the shanrigol
behemoth in the arena and takes notes in a large tome.
Their two dreshkan bodyguards stand ready to defend
them from any trouble. The seugathi fanatically
protects their research, screeching for the dreshkans to
enter melee while the seugathi wields a sword in one
tentacle and uses the other to keep their book away
from foes. The seugathi also carries a tarnished silver
key that unlocks the door to the main laboratory
(area F25).

Treasure: The seugathi’s book contains several
sketches of the shanrigol behemoth and notes in Aklo
about its nature (it includes parts of, and therefore
derives abilities from, driders and urdefhans), its
weakness to positive energy, and that it’s kept docile in
the arena by a steady diet of failed experiments. More
than just a text about one speciﬁc monster, this book
contains several insights of general applicability to
other creatures. It’s worth 25 gp to a collector of rare
tomes, such as Morlibint.
F21. SPA
LOW 6
This room bears the rich stink of rot. Doors to four
changing stalls prominently appear at the east end of
this long hallway. Each door has a makeshift clockwork
mechanism attached to it, and the mechanism connects to
a lever on the eastern wall through a series of wires and
pulleys. The hallway to the west is hung with four wide,
tattered curtains. Another, thicker curtain covers the hall’s
west end.
The spa kept the gladiators in their best health and
entertained visiting guests. None of the seugathis or their
minions want to use it. The four tiny changing rooms
to the east have wooden doors that stop six inches from
the ceiling and the ﬂoor. The four thinner curtains
cover alcoves that serve as massage rooms; each has
only a dilapidated massage table. The thicker curtain
conceals the entrance to another chamber.
An
enterprising
morlock
engineer
rigged
a
complicated clockwork latching mechanism to turn
the changing rooms into very small prison cells. The
lever opens all four doors at once, but it then sticks
and won’t close them again.
Creatures: The room’s stink plainly originates
from the changing rooms. Some of Jafaki’s minions
captured, tortured, and imprisoned four ghasts here,
one in each changing room. The gaps below and above
the doors allow their potent stench to escape, but not
the ghasts themselves. They occasionally reach under
or above the doors with their claws, but they can’t
harm anyone who isn’t pressed up against a changing
room door. If freed, they immediately attack any living
creatures they see, so cunning heroes might use them
against other enemies in the dungeon.

This round sauna is constructed entirely from polished
stone. A wooden bench lines the circumference of the room,
save for the exit to the east, which is covered by a thick
curtain. At the center of the chamber stands a stone pedestal
topped with a heavy bronze bowl ﬁlled with red-hot rocks.
A wooden bucket full of water rests next to the pedestal.
The bowl maintains an evocation effect that keeps
the rocks within it constantly heated. The command to
turn it off and on is long forgotten. The intense heat in
the room gives creatures in the room a –1 circumstance

effects that give the enfeebled condition.
Creatures: Murschen is a rare skulk who enjoys
public attention. Once lauded as his town’s best brawler,
he started exploring the world in search of fame and
wealth, and to further his ability to hurt people who
consider themselves strong. Eventually, Murschen came
here with the notion that the seugathis could make him
an even better warrior. Jafaki believes Murschen will
make an excellent candidate for ﬂeshwarping, so they
shower the skulk with treasure and pit him against their
ﬁnest monstrosities in the testing grounds (area F9). A
sigil on Murschen’s forehead reads “victor” in Aklo.
Murschen hasn’t ﬁgured out that the seugathis don’t
intend to let him leave once they’ve experimented on
him or that their experiments will likely result in a
tortured existence. He feels like he’ll be able to take
whatever physical improvements the seugathis offer
and return to a life of seeking championships on the
surface again.
Murschen doesn’t like being outnumbered and
therefore doesn’t pick a ﬁght with the heroes right
away, yet he doesn’t want to simply let them go.
He attempts to make his way past the heroes to the
lever to release the ghasts. Once the undead have
softened up the heroes, Murschen plans to beat them
to death. He doesn’t realize that the ghasts are just
as likely to attack him as the heroes. Murschen ﬂees
the Abomination Vaults altogether if reduced to fewer
than 20 Hit Points.

Murschen makes two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the

of resistances and weaknesses. Murschen’s multiple
attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes.
Red Ruin Stance Ȱɵ (stance) Requirement Murschen is
unarmored; Eﬀect Murschen takes the stance of the
red ruin, designed to tear away chunks of ﬂesh like a
ferocious beast. Murschen can make red claw unarmed
attacks. These attacks deal 1d10 slashing damage; are
in the brawling group; and have the ﬁnesse, sweep, and
unarmed traits. While in this stance, when Murschen
would reduce his frightened condition value by 1, he
reduces it to 0.
Sneak Attack Murschen’s Strikes deals an additional 1d6
precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Side Quest: Murschen has met the urdefhan pugilist
Vischari a time or two. If the heroes take the time to talk
with the skulk, he mentions that he wants nothing more
than a one-on-one brawl with her to determine who’s
best. Vischari has never taken Murschen’s challenges
seriously, and the seugathis consider her too useful as
the manager of the Warped Brew to force her into the
arena. If the heroes agree to set up a match between
them, Murschen lets them leave to do so.
Vischari won’t agree to a ﬁght unless the heroes are
on good terms with her (such as if they bested Shadow
Malice). To convince her, a hero must succeed at a DC
23 Diplomacy check (Vischari’s Will DC) convinces
her to accept Murschen’s challenge. The two set up an
exhibition match on the Warped Brew’s stage, wagering
Murschen’s magical handwraps against the contents of
Vischari’s ofﬁce safe. The two are evenly matched, so
you can decide who wins; neither combatant will be
in any shape to challenge the heroes in the aftermath.
Whether or not the heroes threaten to pounce upon
them in this moment of weakness, the victor considers
the possibility and offers the spoils from the ﬁght if the
heroes agree to leave them alone thereafter.
Treasure: The heroes can ﬁnd the skulk’s treasures
stashed under a bench: a gold and emerald ring worth
40 gp, a ruby-encrusted dagger worth 70 gp, and a ﬁne
mithral bracelet worth 20 gp.

The seugathis use this area as a storage closet. Only
their alien minds can comprehend why they store
things like broken tables, three cots hopelessly tangled
together, a dismantled clock, a brass kettle with four
evenly spaced holes in its bottom, and seven mustard-
yellow and moth-eaten bedsheets.
Treasure: A hero Searching this area might ﬁnd rare
treasures hidden among this trash. Each successful DC
22 Perception check reveals one item, while a critical
success reveals two. The valuables include an emerald
grasshopper, a hand of the mage, an iron cube, and two
ichthyosis mutagens (page 213).
F24. TORTURE CHAMBER
LOW 6
As the heroes approach this room, there’s a 1 in 3
chance that one of the zebubs in the room is invisibly
patrolling the hallway. If it spots the heroes but
isn’t detected, it returns to the torture chamber with
dimension door to alert the other devils, who prepare
to rush out of the room and attack.
The stone walls of this chamber appear to glisten with
blood. An iron maiden stands in one corner, while the other
corner has a metal table bristling with nails.
Belcorra felt the natural red stone walls of this room,
which appear slick due to water seeping through them,
made it an ideal place for a torture chamber. The
victims here were usually gladiators in the arena who
she felt showed mercy or an insufﬁcient will to ﬁght.
Creatures: Urevian sent a barbazu and two zebubs
to secure a foothold on this ﬂoor and prepare for an
incursion. The barbazu keeps weapons at the ready and
awaits further orders. A zebub sometimes patrols the
corridor to the north to ensure they aren’t caught. When
they spot one of Jafaki’s minions in the corridor, they
attack, drag the minion back, and torture it to death.
The iron maiden currently holds a morlock’s corpse.
A devil reduced to fewer than 15 Hit Points ﬂees
from combat and heads back to the prison level
(using dimension door if possible). They report the
heroes’ presence to Urevian, who then reassigns them
elsewhere on that level, at your discretion.

The door to this chamber is locked with a good-quality
lock. A character who succeeds at ﬁve DC 30 Thievery
checks to Pick a Lock opens the door; alternatively,
the key held by the seugathi in area F20 can also open
it. The heroes can Force Open the sturdy door with a
successful DC 30 Athletics check.
Books, glass bottles emitting smoke, and clumps of slime
ﬁll the shelves that cover the high walls of this chamber.
The southern area displays the dissected remains of several
creatures, pinned to a wall like rare and unusual specimens.
The head of a morlock, somehow kept alive through some
mechanical means with tubes and wires connecting to its
body, screams a constant hoarse note.
The ceiling of this room is 25 feet high, and its
shelves go all the way to the ceiling.
JAFAKI’S BACKGROUND
Belcorra ﬁrst spotted Jafaki and several other
seugathis slithering through the Darklands while
she was building the Abomination Vaults. They
expressed an eagerness to serve her and advance their
own experiments. Belcorra knew the seugathis could
improve her forces, as well as expand. She tasked them
with building her a perfect soldier, then making armies
of them to conquer Absalom. Knowing that perfection
HELLFORGED WEAPONS
Weapons forged in the depths of Hell often gain
sinister powers. Urevian established a hellforge
on the prison level (area G4) and has gifted a few
of his favored followers with hellforged weapons
manufactured there. In the hands of a devil, these
hellforged weapons gain the agile and deadly d8
weapon traits (if the weapon already has the deadly
trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by
one step instead of giving it deadly d8). Although
worth as much as an ordinary weapon of its kind,
hellforged weapons exude palpable menace, so
upstanding merchants usually refuse to trade in them.

was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the
resources she could to the seugathis. The seugathis
pursued not one research path but many, including
ﬂeshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in
magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad
experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with
useful monsters for her growing army. She passed
along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists
and mages who could duplicate the work.
When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the
seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their
objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil
named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed
that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom
the bone devil remained loyal even after
her death—meant taking a ﬁrmer hand in
overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried
to constrain and direct the seugathis’
sprawling research. Rather than comply
with these unwelcome demands, the
seugathis rebelled; Jafaki ambushed and
killed Tarkannah and seized control of the
laboratories level.
This assault started a brief war between the
devils and the seugathis. For months the two sides
fought, but Urevian soon discovered the seugathis
weren’t really interested in expanding their holdings,
only defending the territory they had. The two sides
settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of
the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian
is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to
pass through the prison, and the seugathis’ cast-off
creatures often ﬁnd their way into the devil’s gradually
increasing forces.
Jafaki has little concern for the army growing on
the level below. The seugathis don’t bother with the
imp and zebub spies that occasionally pass
through the laboratories, but Jafaki and
their colleagues can make marching
through with a large army costly or
even impossible. Jafaki plans to permit free
passage only in exchange for additional
concessions to bolster their ongoing
experiments, even though Urevian is
certain to balk at the cost.
Jafaki’s research has seemed to
drift over the years through various abhorrent
sciences: ﬂeshwarping, reanimation of the
dead, selective breeding, or even golem
creation. Yet they remain as focused on their
goal of creating the perfect soldier as they
were when they spoke to Belcorra all those
years ago.
That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good
soldiers? They’ve created those, and all have died by
the dozens or hundreds in the arena. Great soldiers?
Some of Jafaki’s ﬁnest works have been nearly
unstoppable. But “nearly” is not “perfect.” Jafaki will
pursue perfection for as long as it takes.

scientiﬁcally engineering the most powerful monsters.
They might be encountered elsewhere in the
Laboratories level, as needed to evaluate potential
successes. They even strive to make the best of their
failures, such as by cultivating the shanrigol behemoth
in area F26. Jafaki isn’t likely to venture out in direct
response to the heroes’ presence; they consider the
heroes to be little more than annoyances and trusts
in others to take care of them. Once the heroes
show up here, Jafaki ﬁnally realizes they might have
underestimated them.
Creatures: Jafaki sends the drider to answer any
knock at the door since other seugathis sometimes
come by for Jafaki’s guidance. The heroes might
take advantage of this habit to take the preoccupied
researcher by surprise.
If the heroes try to Force Open the door open or
Pick the Lock, Jafaki realizes they’re intruders and
prepares for a ﬁght. The drider scrambles up to the
ceiling. Jafaki envenoms their rapier and casts levitate
to stay out of melee reach. Both use their spells as often
as they can; the drider uses ﬁreball and acid arrow to
inﬂict direct damage, while Jafaki prefers spells that
disorient opponents and turn them against each other,
like confusion. They hope to distill out which of the
heroes is the toughest, then take that hero captive for
experimentation. When direct damage is more useful,
Jafaki hurls their alchemical bombs to catch as many
targets as possible.
Both of these foes ﬁght to the death—the drider
out of loyalty to Jafaki, and Jafaki because they can’t
abandon their life’s work.

here. They intend to assemble it using the morlock’s
head and the neatly labeled body parts scattered
around the room. A sketch pad bears the instructions
for assembly and notes that ambient necromantic
energy in the Abomination Vaults will animate the
ﬂesh golem. The key to this experiment is the occult
machinery keeping its head alive, which focuses this
ambient energy. Finishing the golem requires Jafaki’s
knowledge and expertise; doing so goes beyond the
heroes’ current capabilities.
The heroes can, however, disconnect the machine
to end the morlock’s torment. Disconnecting this
machinery requires a hero to succeed at a DC 22
Occultism check. On a success, the morlock head
dies and the machinery can’t be used again. On a
failure, or if the heroes simply smash the machine,
the morlock head dies, but the invisible energies
accumulated within the machine seek another
source of stitched skin and meat to animate as a
ﬂesh golem.
If the heroes left the ﬂeshy statue of Belcorra
intact in the Temple of the Canker (area F34), these
errant energies animate it as a ﬂesh golem (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 184) instead. The ﬂesh golem comes to life
with an instinctive drive to ﬁnd and kill whoever
ruined the machine. It always knows the distance and
direction to the hero responsible and immediately
begins pursuit down through the Abomination Vaults.
As the golem is far away, it might take hours to catch
up to the heroes, at your discretion, but when it does,
it ﬁghts until destroyed.
Disappearing Morlocks: Jafaki is wrapped up in
their experiments and projects but nevertheless has
an effect on the surrounding dungeon. Every few
days, Jafaki calls for one of the morlocks in the
Warped Brew Tavern to come here with the promise
of being ﬂeshwarped into a dreshkan. The morlocks
eagerly come since Jafaki has created the many
dreshkans in the Abomination Vaults, but it’s a ruse.
Jafaki instead carefully dissects the morlock to add
additional living pieces to their current golem project.
If the heroes come here but retreat, Jafaki continues
these gruesome experiments; when the heroes return,
there should be more morlock parts afﬁxed to the
machinery (and fewer morlocks in area F11, if any
remained there). Once he has run out of morlocks to
experiment on, Jafaki starts capturing and dissecting
members of Shadow Malice instead.
Treasure: Scattered around the room are all the
pieces for an expanded alchemist’s lab, expanded
healer’s tools, and a superb repair kit. None of the
proper pieces are together, however, so it takes several
minutes of hunting around to assemble them all. In
addition, a crafter’s eyepiece and two vials of moderate
antiplague sit on the shelves.
XP Award: Award the heroes 80 XP, rather than
30 XP, for successfully disconnecting the occult
machinery. If they fail, award them this amount if they
defeat the ﬂesh golem in combat.
F26. ARENA FLOOR
SEVERE 6
Dried blood from past combats forms a crust over the sand
spread across this arena’s stone ﬂoor. Torches illuminate the
ﬂoor in bright light but hardly reach the walkway ringing the
arena high above. Two staircases lead up to this walkway, but
a metal portcullis blocks each one.
The site of hundreds of bloody battles, this arena
entertained Belcorra’s bloodthirsty guests and tested
her many gladiators. From these champions, she chose
ofﬁcers to lead her monstrous armies.
The portcullises are controlled by a wheel and lever
on the balcony above (area E26), but a creature can lift
a closed portcullis with a successful DC 25 Athletics
check. The doors to the east and west are unlocked.
Creature: After the death of hundreds of monsters
and gladiators, the arena is imbued with the essence
of death. When Jafaki ﬁrst dumped scraps from failed
creations here, the decaying ﬂesh spontaneously arose
as shanrigols. The ﬁrst few times this happened, Jafaki
had their driders drag the resulting shanrigols to the
holding cells (area E3) for study. Curious about how
large these aberrations could grow, Jafaki assembled a
giant pile of ﬂesh and assigned a seugathi to document
the resulting shanrigol’s composition and growth.
The creature has grown into a massive shanrigol
behemoth from incorporating scraps of driders,
urdefhans, and other creatures. The monstrosity simply
waits for meals of scraps and corpses. Outside of
feeding, the creature remains dormant and is relatively
unobservant. However, if it’s attacked, or if a creature
enters the area of its tremorsense, the shanrigol rouses
and attacks. It ﬁghts ferociously, using its web trap
against foes who ﬂee and shooting bone shards at
creatures who remain out of its reach. The shanrigol
behemoth ﬁghts until destroyed.

Treasure: A few creatures have tested their might by
ﬁghting the shanrigol—and lost. Their equipment lies
scattered in the bloody sand on the ﬂoor: ghoul hide, a
caterwaul sling, and a horn of fog.

CHAPTER 7:
Soul Keepers
Five centuries ago, Belcorra summoned the contract
devil Urevian to administer her Abomination Vaults.
Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further
offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion
of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani,
legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty
from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has,
for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value
to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s
aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul. When the
Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right
to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing
Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even
though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned,
the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The
sorcerer couldn’t fulﬁll her end of the bargain, trapping
Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a
surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse,
he didn’t dare return to Hell without the Rajani soul,
and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul
directly or through his infernal proxies, as Belcorra was
intended to deliver it. Urevian was trapped.
Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement
with her can be fulﬁlled. He plans to train her armies
and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying
has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can
also fulﬁll his contract, lives there.
Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the
ﬂeshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra
placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though
Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them
and has made that discovery his next priority.
Although the devils can use dimension door to
reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need
physical access, which required him to approach
the seugathi Jafaki about allowing them through
the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a
reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past
relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition:
Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally
inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and
improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki
to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and
that the ﬂeshwarper would never sign off on any
