CHAPTER 8:
Decaying Gardens
Gauntlight is active, but its true power is yet to be
realized. Belcorra penetrated deep underground to
build Gauntlight’s foundation, following the psychic
pull of the Empty Vault, a place sacred to Nhimbaloth
at the heart of an ancient, subterranean temple.
Gauntlight draws upon the energies of the Empty Vault
as its foundation and the source of its powers. Within
the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum
lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above,
focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s
full power. But the fulcrum lenses are dangerous; they
invite Nhimbaloth’s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra
can’t withstand the scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus,
though they hold great power, the fulcrum lenses are
also Belcorra’s greatest weakness.
Belcorra repurposed the massive natural caverns
above the Empty Vault for her needs. The eighth level
made a lush cavern of fungus growths and freshwater
lakes that teemed with subterranean ﬁsh, while the
ninth level was a wilderness where predators and prey
alike could thrive. Heroes must descend through these
levels to reach the Empty Vault.
Children of Belcorra
Uninterested in administering these vast caverns
herself, Belcorra enthralled deep gnomes already
living there, compelling them with threats and favors
to tend her subterranean farm. She dubbed these loyal,
diminutive gardeners the Children of Belcorra.
The Children of Belcorra disbelieved rumors of
Belcorra’s death as some sort of trick or test and
didn’t waver in their duties. But as the years passed,
more and more feral monsters made their way into
the level and made their mission in the farm more
difﬁcult. Believing that Belcorra (or, perhaps, some
other Haruvex) would return, the Children chose to
become undead to combat their dwindling numbers
and increasing age. They immured each other in
the muddy shores to rise again as bog mummies or
undertook difﬁcult transformations into other, more
powerful, undead.
Eventually, their timeless lives and lack of
direction took their toll. Many Children fell into
a torpor or retreated into obsession or isolation.
The farm they’d carefully tended became infested

with monsters and subterranean explorers, such as
calignis, drow, and urdefhans.
Even Belcorra’s return as the Ghost Queen couldn’t
quite energize all of the Children of Belcorra to action,
but many realized how much they’d failed their
charge. Belcorra gave the Children a new mandate:
to round up the various dangerous creatures of the
farm level to serve her in her assault on the surface.
She placed the Children under the command of a new
supervisor, a dark naga named Vethris, but chose
poorly; the naga is corrupt, lazy, and more interested
in her creature comforts than guiding the deep gnome
undead in their tasks.
The Children of Belcorra aren’t happy with the
naga’s indolence but are reluctant to contradict their
Ghost Queen. The pace of the Children’s work is, at
best, plodding and has done little to reduce the chaos
in the garden.
Wisps
Although Belcorra trusts the Children—and their new
overseer, Vethris—to put things in order on the Farm
level, she still keeps tabs on the area. A few will-o’-
wisps and dread wisps (page 252) can communicate
with the Empty Vault. They hover over basins ﬁlled
with brackish swamp water and reeds that thrive
despite the darkness, as they draw nourishment from
their connection to the swamp fed by the Empty Vault.
The wisps quickly inform Belcorra of any unexpected
intruders, such as the heroes, leading her to make
an appearance, as described in the Event: Belcorra
Attacks! sidebar, above.
The Cult of Urthagul
A group of caligni refugees came to the Hunting
Grounds years ago, ﬂeeing some deeper calamity.
Their two leaders—a spellcaster named Galudu and a
warrior named Dulac—led them into the safety of an
old lodge in the Hunting Grounds level. From there,
the calignis explored upward, reaching an abandoned
shrine of Nhimbaloth and eventually discovering a
gug mystic named Urthagul. Urthagul laired in a
cave resonating with strange psychic whispers that
awed the calignis. Some of the calignis, led by Dulac,
revered the gug and his eerie visions; others remained
skeptical of Urthagul’s powers. This ultimately
resulted in a schism: the self-named Cult of Urthagul
inhabits the shrine, and Galudu’s calignis reside in
the lodge below. The two groups aren’t enemies, but
they only rarely interact.
The Cult of Urthagul has grown increasingly
insular and zealous. (Urthagul, for his part, hardly
even noticed their presence, much less their worship.)
The calginis hunt chuul eggs from the lake, ritually
cooking and consuming them as part of their strange
rites. Dulac and her second-in-command, Padli, have
both gained occult powers from meditating on the
whispers in Urthagul’s cave, which they use to keep
the cult in line.
When Belcorra awakened, she visited the shrine
to Nhimbaloth and was surprised to ﬁnd the calignis
there. She visited with Urthagul and found that the
gug’s strange behavior wasn’t only due to the psychic
emanations of the cave, but also because the gug had
found the Crimson Fulcrum Lens and communed with
the splinter of Nhimbaloth’s essence inside it. Belcorra
realized the lens was probably safe in the gug’s claws,
but she didn’t want it to end up in the hands of some
interloper cult she didn’t have the time or desire to deal
with. She tasked her wisp minions to keep the calignis
contained within their shrine.
It frustrates the cult to be apart from the object of
their veneration. Dulac is desperate for a solution, so
the heroes might ﬁnd the calignis eager to talk.
Yldaris Drow
The drow outpost of Yldaris lies on the next level
of the Abomination Vaults, but their silent, skilled
hunters have established a watch post in an abandoned
Children of Belcorra outpost. The heroes might ally
with the drow here, which makes a peaceful meeting
with Yldaris more likely in Chapter 9.
Farm Features
The vast caverns of this level and the many structures
and rooms within them are normally dark, though
EVENT: BELCORRA ATTACKS!
Ghost stories work best when the ghost is an active
and terrifying adversary. When any wisp in Chapters
8 or 9 see the heroes, they immediately alert Belcorra
through the magic of the swampy basins throughout
the lower Abomination Vaults. Belcorra is worried to
hear that the heroes have penetrated this far, and
she resolves to harry them until the other dungeon
denizens can overcome them. The sidebar on page
148 sets out in detail how to most eﬀectively use
Belcorra’s attacks, and you might use this event
multiple times in the last few chapters.
XP Award: Each time the heroes survive one of
Belcorra’s attacks, award them 30 XP. Increase
this to 80 XP if they manage to defeat her in a
confrontation and force her to rejuvenate.

bioluminescent fungus is common in overgrown areas. The caverns reach
50 feet high, but the ceilings in rooms carved out of the stone are much
lower. Ceilings in the areas claimed by the Cult of Urthagul (areas H2
to H10) are only 10 feet high. Ceilings in other interior areas are sized
for the Children of Belcorra and are only 8 feet high. Sturdy planks of
fungal wood form the doors. They are crusted with mold and give off an
unpleasantly earthy, rotten smell.
The map of the Farm level appears on page 144.
H1. OVERGROWN STAIRS
The smell of rot and mildew pervades the air of this enclosed staircase. At the
base, a moist carpet of fungus, slime, and mold grows thickly on the walls.
The western wall of the passage contains a secret door leading into
Gauntlight’s footprint (area H37) that’s magically locked and can’t be
broken open. A hero spots the door’s faint outline with a successful DC
15 Perception check. It has a concave indentation, and it only opens when
touched with a fulcrum lens.
H2. HALL OF EYES
MODERATE 8
Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to the south. The four
easternmost alcoves each contain a large stone planter ﬁlled with muddy water
that reeks like a dismal swamp. Two scorch marks on the ground near the
eastern door surround piles of dark rags. The pommel of a blade peeks out from
underneath one of the rag piles.
The basins are magically connected to the swamp in the Temple level
far below (area J15). They remain ﬁlled with the swamp’s waters, and the
will-o’-wisps here can use them to transmit images to Belcorra.
The scorch marks and rags are the remains of two calignis who ran
afoul of this room’s denizens.
Creatures: A will-o’-wisp hovers over each basin, although they
appear at ﬁrst to be merely decorative lights. They telepathically report
on the heroes’ actions until they’re attacked or until the heroes try to
leave this chamber. At that point, the will-o’-wisps spring into action and
ﬁght until destroyed.
Belcorra should attack the heroes (see the sidebar on page 148) sometime
shortly after this encounter.

rack over the basin holds several brown and purple eggs,
each about the size of a human head, cooking in the smoke.
The walls are painted with sweeping lines and whorls.
Belcorra crafted these chambers centuries ago as
both a shrine to Nhimbaloth and as a base to study the
strange visionary effects of the island caves (area H12).
Calignis of the Cult of Urthagul now use this room for
prayer and meditation and to cook the chuul eggs they
harvest from the lake. The ones being cooked now are
the last of the cult’s current store of eggs.
A secret door to the lodge on the lower level is
hidden amid the abstract patterns painted on the west
wall. The calignis know about the secret door but
are reluctant to reveal it. A hero Searching this room
ﬁnds the door and the hidden knob to open it with a
successful DC 25 Perception check. The door’s other
side has an obvious latch mechanism that isn’t hidden.
Creatures: Six calignis meditate here and attack if
disturbed. They believes their death ﬂames empower
Urthagul, so they ﬁght tenaciously to the death.

USING BELCORRA EFFECTIVELY
During their trek through the lowest levels of the Abomination Vaults, the heroes likely face Belcorra several times before
they ﬁnally acquire the fulcrum lenses they need to defeat her for good. She learns about them from her wisp allies, as
described in the sidebar on page 146, and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most
tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn’t have
Belcorra ﬁght alongside other creatures until the Adventure Path’s ﬁnale—she’s tough enough on her own!
Belcorra’s statistics appear on page 204. Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes ﬁght and
adapts her tactics. She might cast spell immunity to protect herself from the heroes’ most eﬀective spells, true seeing to
keep them in sight, or dispel magic to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at
their successes—remember, she has been aware of them since her test ﬁring of Gauntlight’s beam in Chapter 2.
First Attack: As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes’ presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the Gauntlight
footprint (areas H37 and I28). She casts phantasmal calamity at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if
necessary so the heroes can’t follow.
Second Attack: Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses
single-target spells like feeblemind and phantasmal killer while demanding the heroes ﬂee her Abomination Vaults. With
her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.
Later Attacks: Once the heroes have recovered a fulcrum lens or the Fulcrum Lattice, Belcorra considers the heroes an
actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly
hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, conﬁdent that they’ll now leave her alone.
Leveraging Agents: Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the
Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they’re acting on Belcorra’s
orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers at once, so the heroes should be able to handle their attacks.
Killing Allies: Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with the calignis or drow. She knows better than
to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where
they can do the most damage to the heroes’ allies. It’s important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a
single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she orchestrated the attack.
In the Footprint: Belcorra is most eﬀective ﬁghting the heroes who enter the Gauntlight footprint (areas H37 and I28)
due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.
The Final Attack: If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the
Ebon Fulcrum Lens to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum.
Belcorra doesn’t ever surrender or ﬂee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having
the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they’ll need to retreat to collect the fulcrum lenses and return to face
her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth’s gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.

This storage chamber is a mess because calignis have
haphazardly thrown supplies in here over the years.
The plants are bioluminescent reeds that retain their
glow for weeks after being harvested, and they provide
dim light here. Most casks contain the meaty, dried

makes them practically inedible to other creatures.

This drab chamber contains a few bedrolls and a box with
several earthen mugs atop it. A desk holds stacks of paper.
Rank-and-ﬁle members of the Cult of Urthagul
all sleep in the eight bedrolls here. The bedrolls
contain nothing of interest.
Some cult members are mapping the
Abomination Vaults, in the hopes of
ﬁnding an easy way around the wisps
to reach Urthagul again. Their map is
on the desk. They’ve mapped out areas H2 to
H14 and drawn several lobster-like shapes in the
water between areas H13 and H14 to represent the
chuuls. Several angry ball-like shapes in areas H2 and

favors mushroom wine, and the jugs around this room
once held the earthy, intoxicating beverage.
Creatures: For all his hedonism, Padli is no less
devout than Dulac, and he sees any intrusion here as an
assault on the faithful. Padli lets his companions take the

This room is locked on the outside; Padli has the only
key. A hero can open it with four successful DC 25
Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or a successful DC 29
Athletics check to Force it Open.
A single prisoner waits inside: an urdefhan warrior
(Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 272) named Huglu whom the
calignis recently captured. The calignis have denied
Huglu food and water to get information out of him,
but the stubborn warrior would rather die than tell his
captors anything. He’s currently pretending to be dead
to catch his abductors off-guard, but as his Deception
DC is only 12, the heroes likely see through his ruse.
Getting any information out of Huglu is virtually
impossible, as the evil warrior’s only desire is to inﬂict as
much death and destruction as he can before
oblivion. Diplomacy attempts to improve
Huglu’s hostile attitude don’t work, though
the heroes might get information out of him
with Deception checks to Lie or Intimidation checks to
Coerce compliance. The DC for these checks is 19, which
is both his Will DC and his Perception DC.
On a success, Huglu relays his name, that he was
caught near the door in area H9, that he serves a great
war champion named Khurfel, and that his people
control the territory at the bottom of a nearby chasm
(area H34). Huglu sprinkles this information with
threats against the heroes and promises to drink the
heroes’ and the calignis’ blood (on a critical success,
however, Huglu omits these threats).
If the heroes free Huglu, he turns on them as soon
as he thinks he can kill one of them before being
killed himself.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for getting
information about the urdefhans from Huglu.

H8. DULAC’S CHAMBERS
MODERATE 8
This sparsely appointed chamber contains a single mat in
the far corner of the room and a small desk on the south wall
with an iron strongbox sitting under it. A bowl with some
gray gruel and a spoon are the only items on the desk.
This chamber serves as quarters for a severe caligni
woman named Dulac, the head of the Cult of Urthagul.
She has granted herself the title of “custodian” to
demonstrate her humble subservience to Urthagul. Once
a very active and vital leader, she drew the attention of
an owb, one of the malevolent manipulators of caligni
communities. The owb spends his time in the secret
chamber off of this room, twisting Dulac’s faith.
Dulac’s control and self-conﬁdence took a severe
blow when Belcorra stationed the will-o’-wisps around
the cultists’ domain. Cut off from Urthagul’s bizarre
babblings and strange insights, Dulac isn’t sure what
to do next. The owb offers vague assurances, but he
secretly likes seeing the cult crumble and doesn’t want
contact with Urthagul restored.
A hero who Searches this room and succeeds at a
DC 25 Perception check discovers the secret door in
the east wall as well as the hidden latch that must be
pulled and turned to open it. The room is empty—the
owb needs no comforts, only solitude.
Creatures: Custodian Dulac and the owb are in here
in close conversation. They ﬁght intruders, but if the
heroes give any indication that they’re willing to talk,
Dulac ceases hostilities to hear them out. However, the
owb presses the attack to silence the heroes.
If the owb is defeated and Dulac is reduced to fewer
than 30 Hit Points, she surrenders.

Side Quest: If the heroes parley with Dulac, she
proposes a deal. If the heroes gather more chuul eggs
and eliminate the wisps on the fringes of the cult’s
territory, Dulac will make them formal allies of the cult.
As allies, they can rest in the shrine whenever they’d
like. Further, she can grant them safe passage through
caligni territory in the lodge. She warns that the caligni
defenders on the lower level aren’t likely to speak with
the heroes without Dulac’s good word.
Treasure: The iron strongbox holds one small pouch
containing 13 gp and 50 sp, another with 30 pieces of
onyx worth 2 gp each, four moderate healing potions,
and a barkskin potion.
XP Award: Award the heroes XP for talking with
Dulac as though they’d defeated her in combat.
H9. BARRICADED DOOR
This stout, iron-bound door swings open to the north.
It used to be barred from the north, but after Huglu
sneaked in, the calignis blocked the southern side with
rubble for additional security. Moving the rubble to
open the door is time-consuming but not difﬁcult.
H10. STAIRS OF URTHAGUL
SEVERE 8
This long chamber features roughly carved stairs leading
upward. Its sides are dotted with nooks, two of which
contain stone basins ﬁlled with muddy water.
The basins are similar to and serve the same purpose
as those in the Hall of Eyes (area H2).

When Belcorra learned that calignis were meeting
with Urthagul, she sent a pair of dread wisps here to
prevent the calignis’ passage. She doesn’t want the
Crimson Fulcrum Lens to fall into caligni hands, as
she sees them as less reliable guardians than the gug.
Creatures: The pair of dread wisps attack any
creatures other than Belcorra and any Children of
Belcorra who attempt to pass. The defeat of the dread
wisps triggers the Belcorra Attacks! event described in
the sidebar on page 146.

H11. CARRION AMBUSH
LOW 8
Even before the heroes enter this chamber, they can
smell a putrid stench of carrion and decay.
This large, smelly cave opens onto a cliﬀ with a large body
of murky water about twenty feet below. At the edge of
the cliﬀ sits a heap of reeking, decomposing carrion. A
stream of water ﬂows from the north, past the heap and
over the cliﬀ in a narrow waterfall.
The pile of carrion was once a Huge aquatic reptile
that scaled the cliff to escape the predatory chuuls but
died here. Its rotting mass hides a group of Children
of Belcorra who wait underneath to gain information
about—and hopefully capture—Urthagul. They plan
to either follow Urthagul if the gug passes this way
(which they don’t realize the gug never does) or
capture and interrogate calignis (which they don’t
realize Belcorra has prevented).
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra are hiding
in the carrion heap, which counts as a bog for the
mummies’ abilities. They attack anyone who comes
near and ﬁght until destroyed.

H12. ISLAND CAVERN
MODERATE 8
Four small streams ﬂow through this chamber, fed by a
dark pond against the west wall. The streams divide the
chamber into islands, each covered with lichen, mildew,
and mushrooms. Bioluminescent fungi and strange
motes of light bathe the place in eerie illumination,
playing oﬀ the water to form odd shapes on the
cavern’s walls, like humanoid apparitions gliding
through the air. Water ﬂowing along the sides of
the islands echoes oﬀ the walls in weird ways,
like harsh whispers.
“Haruvex has risen. There is nothing you
can do,” the overlapping echoes say. The sound is
hypnotizing, and strangely calming.
Long-gone cultists used this cavern as a meditation
chamber to calm their emotions and clear their minds,
but it now echoes with subtle whispers of Nhimbaloth’s
alien will. These whispers can be maddening or
enlightening but are usually wholly unintelligible.
The northwestern end of this cavern forms a rock
wall 10 feet high that leads to a natural bridge 30 feet
above the lake to an old cage (area A13). Urthagul used
to leave this way every week or two to hunt for food in
the lake but hadn’t bothered to do so while the calignis
were bringing him offerings.

Distracting Whispers: Creatures in the cavern are
immune to emotion effects, but spending time amid the
whispers affects the mind. Every minute, creatures in
the cave must attempt a DC 24 Will save or become
stupeﬁed 1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure) for
24 hours. This condition is cumulative, up to
stupeﬁed 4. The whispers speak a different truth
each time a creature here increases its stupeﬁed
condition, as follows.
Stupeﬁed 1: “The lenses. She knows the
secrets of the lenses. Three are within reach, one
very close. The other lost by Yldaris. One held by
the blood eaters.”
Stupeﬁed 2: “She keeps them apart while she works
her petty vengeance, but the essences shall become one.”
Stupeﬁed 3: “Find the lenses and place their essences
together within a host.”
Stupeﬁed 4: “Join the essences within Haruvex,
and she can fall again. This is a promise of the Empty
Death, a promise of empty death.”
The cavern affects aberrations and sorcerers with
the aberrant bloodline differently; they don’t gain the
stupeﬁed condition but are fascinated while within the
cavern. This fascination ends as soon as they leave. If
such creatures stay here too long, they involuntarily
babble strange truths that echo in the whispers, which
is how Urthagul obtained his reputation as a mystic
among the calignis.
Creatures: On the northernmost island, amid a
nest of glowing toadstools, lurks the gug Urthagul.
He sits hunched, purring and stroking the Crimson
Fulcrum Lens in one of his four hands. Urthagul has
been here for decades, or perhaps longer. While
a formidable creature, his fascination with the
whispers and the Crimson Fulcrum Lens have
taken a toll. He rarely eats, and does so even
less now that the caligni cultists don’t visit him.
His glowing treasure commands nearly all of
his attention.
When the heroes enter, Urthagul takes no more notice
other than a glance in their direction. The heroes can
even explore or pass through the cave without rousing
Urthagul; if they speak to him, he doesn’t respond other
than to shift his treasure to the hand farthest from
anyone who might try to take it.
If the heroes use force against Urthagul or try to
take the Crimson Fulcrum Lens, he attacks with
relentless brutality. In combat, he prefers to use his
jaws, supplemented with the powers of the lens. When
Urthagul uses his Furious Claws ability, he can only
make three attacks instead of four, as he doesn’t let go
of the lens. Urthagul ﬁghts to the death to protect his
treasure, but he doesn’t leave this cavern.

CREATURE 10

Initiative Perception +19
Items Crimson Fulcrum Lens (invested, page 220)
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for recovering
the Crimson Fulcrum Lens.
H13. ISOLATED CAGE
This large metal cage stands atop a natural pillar rising
thirty feet above the water. The bars have been ripped and
bent, and bones lie scattered about the cage’s bottom.
The Children of Belcorra once imprisoned creatures
in this cage. After Urthagul attacked and ate the
creatures within, twice, the deep gnomes realized the
cage wasn’t worth the bother and abandoned it.
H14. RICKETY DOCK
LOW 8
A lone dock, rotten and rickety, juts out from a shelf of
rock. It looks long unused, and no vessel is tethered to
its moorings.
This dock went unused for many years as the Children
of Belcorra withdrew from their duties. It’s still usable,
with only the occasional mishap of a collapsing board.
The Cult of Urthagul used to dive for chuul eggs from
it, but they haven’t done so since being wracked by the
trauma of being cut off from Urthagul.
Creatures: A pair of chuuls hunt in this area,
sometimes working together, other times competing for
food. They prefer to sneak up on their prey, clambering
onto the dock close to the shore so their prey has
nowhere to run except into the water. A chuul reduced
to fewer than 20 Hit Points ﬂees and doesn’t return.
CHUULS (2)
CREATURE 7
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 64
Initiative Perception +15
Treasure: While the chuuls carry nothing of value,
heroes who Search under the water ﬁnd their hidden
nesting nook some 15 feet below the surface. It
holds a cache of 6 chuul eggs, 9 gp, 42 sp, and a +1
striking longsword.
H15. FETID LAKE
These waters are brackish and silty. Dark clouds of fetid air
and grimy mists cling to the surface. Where it laps on the
shore, the water leaves trails of glistening muck.
The lake’s water was once potable, fresh, and
teaming with subterranean ﬁsh stocked by the
Children of Belcorra. After Belcorra’s fall, the gnomes
allowed and even fostered strange aberrations and
other aquatic monsters in the lake. Despite the lake’s
calm, the visibility at the water level is poor; the mist
imposes a –2 circumstance penalty to Perception
checks, everything beyond 30 feet is concealed, and
visibility ends at about 90 feet. Visibility from a higher
point (such as the cliff in area H11, the pillar in area
H13, or the caves in area H22) is unobstructed and
gives a better view of the lake cavern.
Drinking the water can be hazardous but not fatal.
There’s a 1 in 6 chance that anyone drinking the water is
exposed to sewer haze (Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide
119). Fish still live in the lake: blind, ugly, spinous things
that are poisonous to most creatures. Eating these ﬁsh—
even when well cooked—is a slimy and sickening affair
and also spreads sewer haze. The other foul creatures
living in the lake have built a tolerance to its diseased
water and ﬁsh.
Random Encounters: Every 15 minutes that the
heroes spend traversing the lake, make a secret DC 5
ﬂat check. On a success, the heroes come across one of
the following encounters, determined randomly or at
your choice. If the result is a creature the heroes have
already faced, treat it as no encounter.

H16. MONSTER CAGES
VARIABLE 8
Seven cages constructed of metal and strange ﬁbrous
wood line this beach, each partially submerged in the
stinking waters.
The Children of Belcorra use the cages to trap
powerful monsters living in the lake, as Belcorra
recently commanded them to do. It is hard going and
involves many setbacks, but the Children are used to
taking their time to complete their goals. Each cage has
a simple latching device—a curved bar leading through
metal hoops—that takes three Interact actions to open
or close. The latch can’t be reached by a creature inside
the cage due to its position. The metal gives the cages
strength, and the ﬁbrous wood allows enough give that
they’re particularly difﬁcult to burst open. Forcing Open

a cage requires a successful DC 40 Athletics check. The
cages have wide enough gaps that a Medium creature
can Squeeze through the bars with a successful DC 25
Acrobatics check. Small or smaller creatures don’t need
to Squeeze and can simply move through the bars as
greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: The three unmarked cages are empty and
open. A “c” indicates a cage with a chuul, a “k” indicates
a cage with a krooth, and an “s” indicates a cage with a
skeletal hulk that was once a Large reptilian humanoid.
The creatures are furious at their imprisonment and, if
freed, simply attack anyone nearby and ﬂee if reduced
to half their Hit Points. The heroes might be able to
negotiate with the chuul, although it only speaks Aklo
and Undercommon. The chuul insists it will simply
swim away and not trouble the heroes again if freed;
if the heroes seem to need further enticement, the chuul
offers to reveal the location of several chuul eggs (area
H15). It goes back on its word only if the heroes seem
particularly vulnerable.

H17. DOCK AND LIFT
LOW 8
This large, T-shaped dock has four old skiffs moored to
it. On the land side, the docks open up to a large wood
and iron platform; at each corner, an iron chain climbs
upward into darkness. At the south end of this platform
sits a large pulley device. Its chains and machinery,
as well as the chains on the platform, are crusted
with rust.
This is the launch point for the Children of
Belcorra’s increasingly rare lake excursions.
The platform is a lift that connects to area G3
100 feet above. The big lift once brought food
and supplies from the Farm level to the
upper levels of the Vaults. While the rusted
machinery can still be coaxed to work, it’s
slow and often stalls. It’s controlled by
four levers situated in a mechanism on
the platform. The controls are unintuitive;
each lever controls a chain pulley on a corner, but
each lever pulls at a different rate. It takes 1d4 hours
of tinkering to ﬁgure out exactly how to control the
lift, and such trial and error might ruin the entire
mechanism (roll a DC 11 ﬂat check; on a failure, the
mechanism is permanently destroyed). A hero who
succeeds at a DC 24 Crafting check to Repair the
mechanism reduces the DC of this ﬂat check to 5 (or
to 1 on a critical success). The lift is marked by a
white square on the map.
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra are repairing a
skiff here. When they spot intruders, three rush to ﬁght
while the fourth ﬂees to area H19 for aid. Although
there are several caged creatures nearby, the Children
don’t release them because it was such trouble to
capture them in the ﬁrst place. Instead, if in genuinely
desperate straits, the undead either ﬂee to area H19 or
launch a skiff to get aid from area H21.

H18. ROPER PEN
MODERATE 8
The entrance to this cave is blocked by a makeshift
barricade of wood and iron straps. Its door is barred
from the outside, and the bar has the words, “Danger!
Do not open!” written on it in Gnomish.
The Children of Belcorra keep their largest and most
dangerous monsters here. The barricade has obviously
been broken and rebuilt many times, but it’s sturdy
enough to keep its current prisoner contained.
Creatures: The cave contains a single roper. The
Children who discovered the creature took great care
to capture it and move it here. They have no idea how
to control the aberration, but they’re sure that Belcorra
will want it for her army. The roper waits in the back of
the cave, disguised as a nondescript stalactite. If given
the chance (such as if the heroes open the door and then
leave), it creeps out of the cave so it can’t be imprisoned
again. Otherwise, it waits for creatures to step further
inside before striking, and it ﬁghts until destroyed.

H19. GAME ROOM
MODERATE 8
Four small reclining couches circle a small table toward the
corner of this L-shaped room. On the table is an elongated
game board split into rows of squares. Various pieces sit in
place on the board, and pyramid-shaped dice are scattered
about the surface.
Some Children of Belcorra retreated from their
duties after long years and spend their time gambling
on a deep gnome board game called “The Dark Chase.”
Their set is missing several pieces (although it has all
six required four-sided dice), but the incompleteness
holds a peculiar attraction to the Children: the missing
pieces mean there’s no end state, so the game is never
over. The wagers around the board are all colored
pebbles that are pretty but not particularly valuable.
A simple iron key to area H20 is among the pebbles.
Creatures: The three Children here ﬁght intruders,
but they avoid disturbing the game in progress. If a
hero damages the game (such as by moving across the
square containing the low table or by damaging the
square with a splash or area effect), the mummies focus
their rage upon that hero. They ﬁght until destroyed.

a non‑undead creature touches the door, even to open
it with the key.
This chamber is dusty and dry. At its west end sits a stone
slab three feet high. Atop it lies a small body covered in
funeral wrappings.
Gorsalthith, one of the oldest Children of
Belcorra, plans to become a demilich. The other
Children don’t know where he got this idea; none
of them have even seen a demilich, although
they’ve all heard stories of the gem-studded
undead
skulls
with
phenomenal
spellcasting power. But Gorsalthith
was adamant that he knew the
method: he placed gemstones in his
eyes, replaced his teeth with smaller
gems, and drilled holes into his head
to lodge a crown of crystals there. He
then locked himself in this room to lay
in repose, patiently waiting for his body
to turn to dust and his transformation to
take its ﬁnal form. He has been here
for nearly a century with no change
in his mummiﬁed form.
Creatures:
Gorsalthith

in total, each worth 8 sp. His eye sockets
each have a clear topaz worth 50 gp, and
his crown is nine bits of quartz worth 3
gp each.
A21. ANCIENTS’ CAVES
SEVERE 8
Four caves atop steeps cliﬀs sit ten feet above the
lake’s dark water.
These cliff walls have numerous handholds and
require a successful DC 15 Athletics check to Climb to
the caves (or across from one to the other).
Creatures: Three Children of Belcorra became far
too interested in the lore of Nhimbaloth and were
blasted with a powerful glimpse of the Outer God,
transforming them into bodaks. Nursing their pain
and resentment, the bodaks retreated to these caves.
The other Children acknowledge the bodaks’ power
and knowledge but rarely approach them. The bodaks
dwell individually in areas H21a, H21b, and
H21d. When any bodak is disturbed, the
others clamber over to help,
so anyone ﬁghting one of the
bodaks soon ﬁghts them all.

80 gp, 2 pp, and eyes of the
eagle. A greater staff of healing
lies discarded at the back of
the cave, and a +1 striking
shortsword is wedged in a
crack in the wall.
H22. QUIET LAKE
The western side of the
large lake has foul water and
obscuring mist like the lake to
the east (area H15). This side is
less populated, predominantly
due to the appetite of the
froghemoth lairing to the south.
The heroes might have random
encounters here, too, but the DC of the ﬂat
check for an encounter is 10 rather than 5.
H23. SHADOWED DOCK
LOW 8
This T-shaped dock has been recently
repaired, and a single skiff is moored on
its north side. Beyond the dock, a masonry
structure juts out from the cavern walls, the
drifting mist creating strange shadows on
the stonework. At its center is a single iron-
bound door.

This dock and building were abandoned decades
prior to Belcorra’s return. Vethris, the spirit naga
Belcorra recently put in charge of the Children of
Belcorra, now claims it as her lair. The door to the
building is unlocked.
Creatures: The shadows playing on the masonry
are more than just a trick of the water. A dread wraith
haunts this area, acting as a lookout. When it spots
strangers, it silently moves to the inner complex to warn
Vethris. Vethris peevishly dismisses the dread wraith,
commanding it to “take care of the problem.” The dread
wraith then hunts down the heroes, eager to make
wraith spawn out of them.

This damp room has a recessed ﬂoor ﬁlled with mud.
The mud is only a few inches below the doors’
thresholds but is two feet deep and is difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: Four Children of Belcorra lurk in the
mud in the eastern part of this room, bitter at being
stationed here under the command of the lazy Vethris.
They’re quick to attack when anyone disturbs this
room, but, being beneath the mud, they don’t notice
when the dread wraith ﬂits overhead to warn the naga
of intruders and aren’t likely to know the heroes are
present until the heroes enter the mud.

H25. NAGA LAIR
LOW 8
This room is ﬁlled with rugs, tapestries, and pillows. Most
are stained with mud.
This is the lair of the scheming spirit naga Vethris.
Vethris convinced Belcorra she would do a good job
of getting the Farm level back in good order and
keep the Children in line, but she has done nothing
of the sort. Vethris spends her days lounging about
and ordering her new minions to bring her food and
treasures. While the undead are dissatisﬁed with her,
they’re loyal to Belcorra, so they alternate between
grudgingly follow the naga’s orders and ﬁnding ways
to ignore her.
Vethris brought the pillows and other trappings,
but good hygiene isn’t one of the naga’s priorities.
One tapestry, depicting a stylized nest of intertwining
snakes, covers the secret door on the south wall.
Anyone removing the tapestry or Searching the
room locates the secret door with a successful DC 25
Perception check. It’s opened by pressing the proper
stone on the eastern wall.
Creatures: Vethris is lazy, but
she snaps into action against
any who dare intrude on her
relaxation. She screams curses
at her foes while casting spells
at them. She prefers to use
black tentacles to keep her foes
at a distance, but then she follows
up with paralyze as often as possible; this
is her favorite spell, and it frustrates her that
the Children of Belcorra are immune to it, and
thus she can’t use it to discipline them. Vethris
surrenders if reduced to fewer than 40 Hit Points
and tries to slither away.

H26. SECRET TREASURY
A glittering mass of treasure sits at the south end of this
small room.
This is the bulk of the treasure Vethris had accumulated
as well as that she tasked the undead to gather.
Poisoned Treasure: A porcelain teapot in the hoard is
slathered with nettleweed residue (Core Rulebook 553).
Treasure: Once the poison is washed off the teapot,
it’s worth 40 gp. Scattered about the room are 130 gp,
310 sp, greater bracers of missile deﬂection, a wand of
ﬁreball, three murderer’s knots, a potion of quickness,
and a javelin of lightning. A small sack contains 10
saltwater pearls worth 9 gp each.
H27. SHORES OF DEATH
EXTREME 8
At this southern terminus of the foul underground lake,
a small wooden dock juts out from a stone and masonry
building. The dock is in ruin; its front has been ripped away
with massive force, leaving the rest of it sloping down into
the water. The building had a door at the dock’s end, but
it has been ripped oﬀ its hinges, with a chunk of the door
partly submerged and leaning against the cavern wall.
South of the structure, the lakeshore gives way to a forest
of massive fungi. The water near the dock occasionally
bubbles, as if something massive dwells somewhere below
the surface.
A surly froghemoth attacked the Children of
Belcorra in this outpost, damaging the dock and
driving the bog mummies away. It’s the source of
the bubbles in the water. A hero who succeeds at a
Perception check against its Stealth DC of 38 spots its
eyestalk peeping above the fetid water.
Creatures: How the froghemoth came to the lake
is a mystery, but in the short time, it has been here, it
has damaged this building and driven nearly all the
aberrations and creatures away from the southern
lake. It sometimes makes its way north to hunt, but it’s
usually lurking under the water by the shattered dock.
The Children of Belcorra injured the froghemoth
more than they’ve realized; it’s afﬂicted with bog rot
that has affected its alien physiology in strange and
debilitating ways. Rather than simply being clumsy,
the froghemoth has the weak adjustment.
A lazy hunter, the froghemoth tends to attack from
the water and rarely pursues those who ﬁnd shelter
within the fungus garden. However, it’s vindictive in
a way; if it loses at least half of its Hit Points, there’s
a chance (DC 15 ﬂat check) it becomes enraged and
follow its attackers onto dry land.

H28. RUINED OUTPOST
The remains of a table and some chairs are scattered
around the room. While the western door has been ripped
oﬀ its hinges, the southern door is still intact but open. Two
torn, soggy corpses are slumped in the doorway.
The corpses are Children of Belcorra who were
destroyed in the froghemoth’s rampage.
While there’s nothing of value in the abandoned
room, there’s a secret door on the east wall. A
hero Searching the room who succeeds at a DC 20
Perception check spots the fake ﬂagstone in the wall
and can pull it aside with the rest of the secret door.
Beyond the door is a narrow passage heading east
and then turning north, leading to another secret
door of similar design. The Children of Belcorra used
this passage to gain quick access to the northern
reaches of the fungus garden.
H29. WEST GARDEN
While the fungal forest continues to grow high, there are
also signs that this area was recently tended. Rocks outline
sections of healthy growth, and the paths are clear of all the
but the occasional bits of mold and fungus. Bioluminescent
moss provides a low, even glow throughout the area, as
though intentionally cultivated for the eﬀect. To the east, a
wide stone bridge spans a massive chasm. A gigantic iron
ladder snakes down into the darkness of the chasm from
its other side. Beyond the bridge and the ladder, the fungal
forest becomes even more overgrown.
The Children of Belcorra long ago limited their efforts
from tending the entire fungus garden to only this
western end. With the recent arrival of the froghemoth,
they’ve even stopped their efforts here.
The fungi here are harmless; in fact, they’re good
sources of nutritious food, fungus-wood lumber, and
luminous moss.

H30. LUMBER SHED
This squat stone building looks like a storage room.
One of three storage rooms in the fungal garden, this
building was used to store wood formed from tough
fungus ﬁbers. Inside, a pile of fungus woods still sits,
along with a bundle of axes and saws used to collect
the fungus and cut the boards into shape.
H31. TOOL SHED
This shed has a small hole where a lock would be, but
traces of rust around the hole are all that remain there.
The tools once stored here have met the same fate
as the lock and are nothing more than a piles of
rust around axe handles, wooden shims, and other
non‑metallic materials. The shriveled corpse of a
fat rust monster lies in the center of the room; the
Children of Belcorra killed it years ago when it got
into their tools, and they never bothered to remove it.
H32. INHABITED SHED
MODERATE 10
This simple storage shed is ﬁlled with small, gnawed bones,
discarded scales, and a pungent reptilian reek.
The ghonhatine ﬂeshwarp lairing here doesn’t know
that there’s a secret door in the west wall. A hero who
Searches the room discovers the false ﬂagstone that
opens it automatically, as the ﬂagstone has shifted
slightly out of place.
Creatures: Some time ago, the ghonhatine escaped
from the Laboratory level far above and ﬂed all the
way here. It has found more than enough to eat in
the surrounding fungus garden, so it never ranges
far, although it prefers living prey. As it has learned
to avoid the nearby lake because of the lurking
froghemoth, it hasn’t had more than a few small bats
or rodents in months, and it’s eager for larger ﬂesh. It
rushes at the heroes who open this door and attacks
with a single‑minded fury until slain.

The round walls of this chamber are deeply carved with
ﬂowing runes. The runes are ﬁlled with silver and dust.
This is another portal chamber containing an
inactive teleportation circle. The heroes can connect it
to those in other levels of the Abomination Vaults with
the awaken portal ritual.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for using the
awaken portal ritual to reactivate the teleportation
circle here.
H34. EASTERN WILDS
MODERATE 8
Across the bridge’s span, fungus grows to greater
heights—some reaching nearly to the high ceiling of the
cavern, fifty feet overhead. The remains of old paths
remain here, but most are covered with clumps of
smaller fungus or patches of pale slime. Spores
drift through the air, and huge red blooms
on the fungi shift as though in a wind,
although there’s no wind here. An
enormous iron ladder hangs down into
the deep chasm. Each link of the chains that
hold it up are about as large as a human, but the
rungs are spaced to give even small creatures an
easy climb.
The east side of the fungus garden has gone a long
time without proper cultivation, which has made it
overgrown and dangerous. The paths are somewhat

The gigantic iron ladder leads more than 100 feet
down to area I27.
Creatures: The massive patch of fungus closest to
the bridge has grown two deadly red puffballs. These
dragon’s blood puffballs resemble overgrown ﬂowers,
but they soon detach and ﬂoat toward the heroes to
attack with their fatal blooms. They follow ﬂeeing
heroes and ﬁght until destroyed in an explosive burst.

H35. WEBBED CROSSROADS
SEVERE 8
The towering fungi around these overgrown paths are
laced in thick webbing. Within are a few humanoid ﬁgures,
too shrouded in webs to see clearly.
The webbed corpses are a desiccated urdefhan and
two much-more-recently killed drow from Yldaris. It
takes half an hour to clear the thick webbing from
each corpse.
Creatures: The hungry goliath spider that has
made its web here isn’t on the ground, but hiding in
a crevasse in the ceiling 60 feet above, where it has
greater cover. The spider begins its assault with its
Descend on a Web ability to catch its prey off guard. If
reduced to fewer than 40 Hit Points, it retreats for the
safety of its ceiling crevasse high above.

Treasure: The urdefhan carries a jade bauble and
a standard-grade darkwood shield. One of the drow
corpses has a pouch with dust of disappearance.
H36. ROUNDED WALL
LOW 8
This patch of fungus sits lower than the rest, though it
bears no signs of cultivation. Amid the other fungi are
bulbous green growths. The back wall of the cavern is
visible through a cloud of drifting spores; it isn’t natural
rock, but a pale, curved, seamless stone.
The wall is part of the footprint of Gauntlight high
above and is thus impervious to damage. A secret door
in the curved wall provides access to the structure’s
interior (area H37); like the secret door in area H1, it’s
easy to ﬁnd (DC 15 Perception) but only opens when
a fulcrum lens is placed into its indentation.
 Creatures: The spores and green growths belong
to a drakauthix lairing here. It attacks any living
creatures that approach, ﬂoating upward to reveal
its hooked tentacles. If reduced to fewer than 20
Hit Points, it ascends to the ceiling and tries to ﬂoat
away to the south. If the heroes haven’t dealt with the
goliath spider lurking above area H35, the drakauthix
ﬂoats right beneath its crevasse. The spider darts out,
kills the drakauthix, and retreats into its bolt-hole.
This might alert the heroes that the spider is there!

H37. UPPER PIT
This large, circular room is made of pale stone and covered
with dust. At its center stands a single, stone-lipped pit.
A twisting ribbon of blue light coils and twists in the air,
extending from the ceiling down into the pit. The stone of
the ceiling and the walls of the pit undulate in the eerie
light as though the stone itself were suﬀering.
This pit leads down through Gauntlight’s lowest
levels. The ribbon of energy shows that Gauntlight is
drawing even more power, and the heroes might have
seen a ribbon like it in the dungeon’s higher levels. A
living creature ending its turn within the 5-foot-diameter
ribbon of light takes 10d6 negative damage (DC 26
basic Reﬂex save); unlike the ribbons discovered in the
upper levels, this energy doesn’t heal undead creatures.
The pit leads down over 100 feet to a similar
chamber on the Hunting Grounds (area I28) and then
another 100 feet to the Empty Vault (area J20), where
Belcorra typically dwells.
H38. STRANGE SENTRY
TRIVIAL 9
Toward the end of the fungal path, a masonry structure
juts out from the cavern wall, a door at its center.
The structure served as a waypoint where the
Children of Belcorra could converse with their Ghost
Queen through the wisps. They abandoned this
building when they left the eastern fungus garden.
Creatures: A sinister, sloth-like monster called a
nilith moved into the structure, but it left a guardian
outside: a feebleminded medusa it calls Murmur.
Murmur stands in front of the door, her hood up,
muttering unintelligible words to herself.

Murmur isn’t likely to pose much of a challenge
for 8th-level characters, but she’s an indication that
something strange is afoot. She ﬁghts with her bow,
which she only barely remembers how to use, if
creatures remain at a distance. If foes close in, she drops
her bow and ﬂees into area H29 to join her master.

Side Quest: Restoring Murmur’s mind is a challenge,
but it isn’t impossible. If the heroes restore her, the
medusa introduces herself as Moadenn and offers to
ﬁght alongside them for a few days before striking
off on her own. She’s bossy and cruel, so the heroes
might not want her aid; she’s perfectly happy to depart
sooner if the heroes don’t want her around.
H39. LAIR OF THE DREAMER
MODERATE 8
Three alcoves in this square chamber are overgrown with
a tangle of thin mushroom stalks and creeping, ﬂowering
vines. The air smells sweet and heady.
The alcoves each contain stone basins, like those in
areas H2 and H11. They used to provide a connection
to the swamps below, but the nilith lairing here didn’t
want the interruption. It pulled the muck from the
basins, coated their interiors with a fungal resin, and
repurposed them as planters to grow vegetation that
remind it of its former home in the Dreamlands. If the
heroes clean them out, they reﬁll with fetid swamp
water once again, and a will-o’-wisp (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 333) appears above each. Their observation
triggers the Belcorra Attacks! event, as described in the
sidebar on page 146.
Soporific Pollen: The pollen in the air gives living
creatures in the room (except the nilith) a –1 circumstance
penalty on Will saves. This is an olfactory effect.
Creatures: The nilith climbs around on the vines in
this room, idly tending the ﬂowers. It is bored with
Murmur and is looking for other minds to twist, but
it’s willing to engage in conversation ﬁrst if the heroes
seem amenable. It talks about how the basins connect
to some malignant swamp far down, and it proudly
shows off its means of sealing them with resin to grow
its own strange garden. As it talks, it tries to rank the
heroes from the weakest mind to the strongest, so it
knows who to target best with its mental attacks. It
might propose puzzles or riddles to ﬁnd this out or ask
the heroes about their recent dreams.

Treasure: Hidden deep in the nilith’s hanging

three topaz gemstones worth 60 gp each, a thundering
runestone, and a moderate bravo’s brew.
H40. BETWEEN A ROCK AND A DOORWAY
LOW 8
The path ends at a door leading west. A large boulder covered
with spidery carvings blocks a cave entrance to the east.
The door to this room is locked, and Nyzuros (in
area H44) has the key. A hero can open it with four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or
a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Force it Open.
The boulder seems impassable, but it’s cleverly
hinged to open when parts of its surface are pressed
in the proper conﬁguration. The Elven carvings
describe how to move the boulder, but these
instructions are intentionally wrong and trigger
the hazard below. Finding the proper way to move
the boulder requires a successful DC 25 Nature,
Perception, or relevant Lore check. Alternatively,
a hero can roll it aside with a successful DC 30
Athletics check to Force Open, and a Small or
smaller creature can Squeeze past the boulder with
a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check.
Glyph of Warding: The carvings form a glyph of
warding containing a 4th-level sound burst (DC 28
basic Reﬂex save; DC 28 to notice and disarm the
glyph). The glyph triggers when a creatures handles
the boulder in the way indicated by the Elven
carvings. The noise also alerts the nearby drow to
intruders, and they go on alert.
H41. DESCENT TO YLDARIS
SEVERE 8
Faintly glowing green veins of crystal line the walls of this
large cave. To the south, a wide passage spirals into the earth
as though created by some massive burrowing creature.
The slick, green veins crackle with faint electricity
when touched, but they aren’t harmful. A cave worm
burrowed this passageway long ago. It leads to the
drow outpost of Yldaris far below (area I1).
Creatures: This passage isn’t unguarded; a
quartet of drow hunters is always on alert here.
If they detect intruders, they form a ﬁring line to
prevent anyone from getting past them. Although
they’re quick to attack calignis, urdefhans, or other
enemies they recognize, a group of surface-dwellers
intrigues them. The hunters keep their weapons at
the ready, but so long as the heroes don’t attack
ﬁrst, they ask the heroes why they’re trespassing
in Yldaris territory. Their starting attitude to the
heroes is indifferent. If the heroes improve their
attitude to friendly (which requires a successful DC
24 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression), they
agree to escort the heroes to their leader in Yldaris.
Three drow escort the heroes through areas I1, I5,
I6, and I17 to meet Quara Orshendiel. If the heroes
improve their attitude to helpful, only a single
drow accompanies them. If they can’t improve the
hunters’ attitude, the drow ﬁrmly turn them away.
If the heroes mention that they rescued Falxi
Orshendiel from the Warped Brew kitchen (area F12),
the hunters remember that Falxi mentioned them.
The heroes thereafter have a +4 circumstance bonus
on Diplomacy checks to negotiate entry into Yldaris.
The heroes might have earned the trust of the drow
in areas H44 or H45; in that case, the heroes don’t need
to separately win over these hunters.

H42. SPIDER GUARD
TRIVIAL 8
Sheets of webbing hang on the south wall of this room,
between two wooden doors.
Creatures: A trained hunting spider, the loyal pet of
the drow shootist Iribo in area H44, lairs in this room.
The spider whistles shrilly as its ﬁrst action when it
spots intruders, then springs to attack. The noise alerts
the nearby drow and brings them running; together,
this is a severe encounter for 8th-level characters.

H43. CELL
This square cell has two pairs of rusted manacles bolted
into the wall about six feet from the ﬂoor.
The drow recently captured one of the Children of
Belcorra in the fungus garden and brought her here.
She dangles from one of the manacles. They’ve been
interrogating her for information about the layout and
denizens of the level, but the mummy hasn’t yet been
forthcoming with any information.

Creatures: The Child of Belcorra realizes that the
heroes aren’t with the drow and asks for release. She
makes only vague promises about what she can do for
the heroes if released because she’s lying; as soon as
they let her go, she ﬂees to warn the other Children of
Belcorra that the drow have made signiﬁcant inroads
to the fungus forest (although the listless mummies
aren’t likely to act on this information anytime soon).
The prisoner knows the denizens and layout of areas
H15 to H25 and that there’s a froghemoth in area H27.

H44. OBSERVATION POST
TRIVIAL 8
This small room appears to be a lookout post. Three narrow
slits line the north and east walls, giving a view of the
overgrown fungus garden beyond.
The Children of Belcorra observed their cultivated
and thriving gardens from here, but the post had been
abandoned for some time before the drow of Yldaris
discovered it.
Creatures: A drow shootist named Iribo serves as a
lookout in this room. She investigates any indication
of intruders, such as her pet spider’s shrill whistle.
In a ﬁght, Iribo attempts to quickly incapacitate her
foes with her poison and calls for the drow in area
H45. However, she doesn’t foolishly throw herself into
combat; if she thinks it’s possible to negotiate with the
heroes, she does so.
A longtime friend of Yldaris’s leader, Quara, Iribo
knows that Quara might have some use for surface
dwellers. The heroes can attempt to improve her
starting attitude of indifferent just as they can with the
hunters in area H41. If they improve her attitude to
friendly, she personally escorts them to Yldaris.

Yldaris, but don’t award this additional XP if the
heroes have already arranged an escort from the drow
in area H41.
H45. PLANNING ROOM
MODERATE 8
This large room might have once been richly appointed, but
it’s now full of mold and decay. Shattered furniture covers
the ﬂoor, and tattered, mildew-specked tapestries hang
from the walls. At the north, curtains obscure a wide bay
window made of what looks like transparent stone.
The elder Children of Belcorra used to plan their
lush gardens from this room, but it’s now the
staging area for the small drow contingent.

clear view into the garden. The window is made from
blocks of enchanted stone that are transparent from
this side but resemble ordinary, natural stone when
viewed from outside. The drow stationed here might
have gotten a good look at the heroes passing by in
area H34, were it not for the fact they keep the curtains
closed most of the time.
Creatures: A drow hunter named Nyzuros and
four drow wardens huddle over a map of the
gardens. Their main concern is the goliath spider
that dwells at the crossroads, as it has already
feasted on two drow scouts. They debate whether
to risk attacking the spider, gaining signiﬁcant
glory for vanquishing such a dangerous foe, or
to summon aid from Yldaris. Nyzuros commands
this contingent, even though Iribo in area H44 is
their most respected ﬁghter. Whether the heroes
make it this far without alerting these drow, or
they’re called into battle by noise, the wardens are
hotheaded and quick to attack. Nyzuros is more
circumspect, however, and wants to know how
and why intruders have come. Like the hunters in
area H41, he has an indifferent attitude toward the
heroes, but his attitude can be improved in the same
way (and, if made friendly or better, he personally
escorts them to Yldaris). The heroes have another
option to get into Nyzuros’s good graces: if they’ve
killed the goliath spider in area H34 and promise to
let Nyzuros and his team take the credit for doing
so, his attitude automatically improves to friendly.
Nyzuros’s forbearance isn’t without limits. If the
heroes have slain other drow, he turns against them.

XP Award: Award the heroes 60 XP if they talk

Nyzuros’s escort into Yldaris, but don’t award this
additional XP if the heroes have already arranged an
escort from the drow in area H41 or from Iribo.
H46. PROVISIONS ROOM
The door to this room is locked, and Nyzuros
has the key. A hero can open it with four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or
a successful DC 29 Athletics check to Force it Open.
This room is plainly used for storage. Casks and bundles
are stacked against its north and west walls.
Treasure: The drow on this level keep their supplies
here, including six weeks of rations, three casks of
water, two casks of fungus wine (worth 2 gp each), ﬁve
longswords, six hand crossbows, 50 bolts, and 50 gp.

CHAPTER 9:
On the Hunt
As any explorer of the Darklands can tell you, the
farther you descend, the wilder and stranger things
become. As Belcorra dug the Abomination Vaults
deeper, she found an extensive system of caverns.
Unlike the self-contained Farm level, these caverns
were truly wild. At ﬁrst, she fought against the ﬁerce
denizens and tried to close off the passages to deeper
places, but the task was futile. She dubbed the place
the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save
for building alliances with the communities there.
Belcorra established only a few strongholds in the
area, including a lodge, a vault, and the entrance to the
Gate of Nhimbaloth, the subterranean temple holding
the Empty Vault and the source of Gauntlight’s power.
The Urdefhan Cult
Urdefhans are vampire-like humanoids who largely
pursue lives of violence and slaughter. As brutal killers
obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the
urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves
to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds
were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for
her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming
attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer
called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened.
Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard
of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the
Emerald Fulcrum Lens to the war champion as a token
of her favor until then. Generations passed, and the
war champions passed down the fulcrum lens as their
symbol of leadership.
Drow Allegiance
With the deep gnomes cowed and the urdefhans awed
by her power, Belcorra next turned to the drow of
the Hunting Grounds. From their secure stronghold
of Yldaris, the drow ranged through the caverns like
deadly apparitions, retreating in the face of signiﬁcant
danger. Belcorra knew that she must trap the drow into
an alliance, so she captured and imprisoned more and
more of their hunters until Yldaris’s leader agreed to
meet with her. She traded the captives for a promise that
the drow would keep the Ochre Fulcrum Lens safe and
provide aid in her attack on the surface.
