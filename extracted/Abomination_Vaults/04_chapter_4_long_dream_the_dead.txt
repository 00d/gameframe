CHAPTER 4:
Long Dream the Dead
The fourth level of the Abomination Vaults is one of
the smaller ones overall, yet it’s among the ﬁnest, as it
once served as Belcorra’s personal retreat.
Belcorra’s Retreat Features
Ceilings in this level are 10 feet tall in halls and 15 feet
in rooms. Unless otherwise indicated, rooms are unlit.
The doors are iron-banded wood; ephemeral spirits
gently shut any door left open for more than a minute.
The map for this level appears on page 70.
D1. BELCORRA’S DINING ROOM
MODERATE 4
A pair of brightly glowing chandeliers illuminates a long
banquet table surrounded by luxurious, high-backed chairs.
The table is still set as if for a grand meal, but some of the
place settings are scattered and toppled, as are a few of
the chairs. Four skeletons in tattered ﬁnery are scattered
about the room, some of them clutching their own necks.
When the Roseguard assaulted Gauntlight Keep
so many years ago, Belcorra was dining here with
representatives of a now-extinct Absalomian thieves’
guild whom she was courting as potential allies
against the city. When word came that the Roseguard
was handily overcoming the keep’s defenses, Belcorra
took no chances. She politely excused herself, bade her
guests ﬁnish their meal, and magically commanded her
chef to poison them all and murder the other servants
before taking his own life.
Stairs beyond the north door lead up to area C29.
Creatures: The guests died in excruciating pain,
then later became havens for corpselights seeking
hosts. When a living creature other than Volluk enters
this room, the corpselights within the skeletons begin
to glow, and then the skeletons stagger to their feet
and attack. Each time a corpselight is forced into wisp
form, it ﬂees to one of the adjoining rooms (areas D2,
D3, or D6) to claim another corpse host and return to
the ﬁght.

Treasure: A search of the guests’ remains reveals 48
gp, a bracelet of dashing, and a viper arrow.
D2. KITCHEN
A strange, squat cast-iron stove with no chimney sits in the
southwest corner of this room, while to the north, a large
oak table covered with cooking utensils sits against a wall.
A skeletal body slumps at the base of the cupboards along
the western wall.
The stove magically transmutes smoke welling up
from its ﬁre into clean air, but it’s built into the stone
of this room and far too heavy to be worth the trouble
of hauling away from the dungeon. The body was once
Belcorra’s cook, who died by suicide after carrying out
Belcorra’s magical commands to poison the guests and
kill the other servants.
A hero who Searches this room and succeeds at a
DC 19 Perception check spots a secret door to the
north. Some cooking utensils are afﬁxed to the wall;
manipulating them in the correct order opens the
secret door.
D3. STORAGE
The walls of this chamber are lined with cupboards,
shelves, and cabinets. A few barrels sit in the middle of the
room. Two skeletons lie slumped near the barrel.
The skeletons were two other servants who retreated
to this storage room before being murdered by the
chef. Nothing of value remains.
D4. WINE CELLAR
A tall wine rack, its bottles thick with dust after so many
years, stands against the north wall.
Treasure: Nearly all of this wine has gone bad, but a
successful DC 18 Society check is enough to note three
valuable bottles worth 20 gp each.
D5. LEVEL FOUR PORTAL CHAMBER
The walls of this chamber are decorated with twisting
runes carved into the wall and ﬁlled with dull, silvery
metal. The ﬂoor and ceiling are almost completely covered
with large, polished metal discs.
This room contains an inert teleportation circle
like the ones in areas B17 and C16. This teleportation
circle must be reactivated with the awaken portal
ritual hidden in area C35 to connect it to other portal
chambers in the dungeon.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for activating
this portal.
D6. WASHING ROOM
A dusty metal washtub with a small skeleton lying inside
sits next to a low shelf in this room.
As the guests in area D1 were dying of poison,
one of them managed to stab a halﬂing servant who
staggered into this large dish washing tub and died.
If the skeleton is disturbed, the tub momentarily
appears to be clean and ﬁlled with soapy water before
returning to its actual dusty state. The scent of harsh
dish soap clings for a minute before fading.
D7. DISPOSAL ROOM
LOW 4
An open metal hatch lies in the ﬂoor against this room’s
east wall. Storage bins sit to the north and south, each
heaped with old bones, broken tools, and lumps of stone.
Several bones in one of the trash bins belong to a
human, which a hero Investigating the bones can easily
determine. A servant slipped against a trash bin and died
here two days before Belcorra’s last meal in area D1. The
other servants simply hefted her body into the bin.
The hatch opens into a long chute that leads to
the disposal pond at area D17. Anyone who enters
the chute swiftly slides down to the pond in a rough
trip that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 20 basic
Reﬂex save) upon landing. Anyone in the chute who
doesn’t want to slide down can arrest their fall with
a successful DC 18 Reﬂex save to Grab an Edge or
with a successful DC 18 Acrobatics or Athletics check
to brace in place. In either case, a successful DC 18
Athletics check is required to safely traverse the chute.
Creatures: The spirit of the servant who accidentally
died here has returned as a poltergeist wracked with
indignation. It’s lurking here, invisible, but it doesn’t
attack until it’s spotted or someone approaches the
lip of the chute. It hurls debris from the trash bins or
uses telekinetic maneuver to Shove foes into the open
hatch. It ﬁghts until destroyed but can’t leave this
room. The poltergeist can be put to rest by disposing
of its remains in a respectful manner, such as cremating
them or saying a word of blessing over them.

D8. LOUNGE
SEVERE 4
The walls of this large chamber are hung with grisly paintings depicting various
spectral beings cavorting among ruined neighborhoods, overgrown swamps,
and foggy graveyards. Three large overstuﬀed chairs pair with small end tables,
upon which sit empty wine glasses. To the south stands a cluttered writing desk
with its own chair, while a large iron tub to the west is visible between standing
screens depicting shadowy marshes.
This large lounge once served as a place for Belcorra to relax, but today
it functions as a den for her one‑time apprentice, the drow Volluk Azrinae.
Most papers on the desk are Volluk’s disjointed notes. More usefully to the
heroes, the papers also include detailed blueprints of the top three levels of
the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors.
A hero Searching the room and who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception
check ﬁnds the secret door in the east wall: a lifelike graveyard painting
that swings outward. Every 10 minutes or so, a faint scream issues from
the other side of the secret door, though it sounds like it’s emanating from
the picture. After the ﬁrst scream, the DC to ﬁnd the door drops to 12.
A hero Searching this room who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check
ﬁnds an iron key hidden in a secret slot in one of the desk’s legs; it opens
Lasda’s manacles (area D9).
Creatures: Unlike most of the denizens who dwelt in the Abomination
Vaults in Belcorra’s day, Volluk is still alive—after a fashion. After feeding
himself to a vat of ritually prepared leeches, he lives on as a hideous worm
that walks. Volluk resembles a roughly drow‑shaped mass composed of
thousands of slithering leeches. He has been working with the voidglutton
that now dwells in Belcorra’s old chambers (area D20) to restore
Gauntlight, but he’s frustrated that Belcorra’s ghost doesn’t speak to him
directly. Being forced to do his mistress’s bidding through the will of the
voidglutton galls the proud occultist.
Volluk is reading at his desk when the heroes ﬁrst arrive. As soon as
he notices the heroes’ intrusion, he rises up—a squirming, awful mess—
and demands to know who they are and why they’ve come. He has little
interest in constructive discourse, but if the heroes let him talk, he uses
Intimidation to roll initiative.

CHAPTER 4 SYNOPSIS
The fourth level of the Abomination
Vaults was designed as a retreat
for Belcorra to relax and to revere
her uncaring deity Nhimbaloth.
No faction of signiﬁcance holds
sway over Belcorra’s Retreat today.
Instead, several powerful individuals
claim separate portions of this level.
The most signiﬁcant ally the heroes
can acquire is the ghost of Otari
Ilvashti, the fallen hero who gave the
town of Otari its name.
Environmental Cues: Cool
but comfortable temperature,
ﬁne furnishings that are old yet
luxurious, haunted house eﬀects
such as closing doors or sliding
chairs, profusions of fungi, smells
of dust and faint spices, spectral
visions of rooms as they looked 500
years ago.
CHAPTER 4 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable
items available as treasure in
Chapter 4 are as follows.
•	 +1 ghost touch whip
•	 +1 striking composite longbow

without having to Squeeze. He can use the same action
to coalesce back into his normal form.
Treasure: Among Volluk’s papers are a scroll of
comprehend language, a scroll of paralyze, and a
scroll of worm’s repast (page 225). A lantern of empty
light (page 221) sits on the writing desk. Volluk
takes this lantern on his journeys above ground,
where he unknowingly spawned the rumors of the
lantern‑carrying stranger.
D9. LASDA’S LAMENT
MODERATE 4
The walls of this circular chamber are smooth and gray. A
ﬂickering, nauseating ribbon of pale blue light churns in
the center of the room. Where the light touches the ceiling,
the stone bubbles as if it were infected ﬂesh. Below, the
light bathes a screaming, thrashing dwarf bound onto a
metal table, his body covered in blisters.
As in area B35, the ribbon of light is a manifestation
of Gauntlight’s growing power. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn in it takes 5d6 negative
damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save) and undead
creatures regain the same amount. To reactivate
Gauntlight for its test ﬁring on Otari’s graveyard,
Volluk Azrinae

Volluk and the voidglutton needed a living creature
as an anchor for the light. While others who touch
the light suffer negative damage, the light
simultaneously heals its anchor as swiftly as
it harms them, keeping the person in a
perpetual state of agony.
This victim is a dwarf named Lasda
Venkervale (LG male dwarf bartender
2), once the bartender at the Rowdy
Rockﬁsh in Otari. Volluk abducted
Lasda just over a year ago for
nefarious
experiments
while
the dwarf was on one of his
customary predawn walks
from the Rockﬁsh up to
the graveyard. Volluk
kept Lasda a prisoner
in area D11 for many
months and, impressed
by the dwarf’s hardiness,
decided
to
use
him
as
Gauntlight’s anchor.
Creatures: The heroes can’t focus on rescuing Lasda
without ﬁrst defeating a will-o’-wisp that has been
gorging itself on Lasda’s terror. It’s invisible when the
heroes ﬁrst arrive, but it ﬂares up in an angry blue
glow as soon as the heroes attempt to aid the dwarf. It
pursues foes who ﬂee and ﬁghts to the death.
WILL-O’-WISP
CREATURE 6
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 333
Initiative Stealth +16
Side Quest: To remove Lasda from the terrible
ribbon of energy, the heroes must ﬁrst unlock the four
manacles that bind him. The key to these manacles can
be found in area D8, or the heroes can succeed at three
DC 22 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock on each manacle.
Unless the heroes have some means of working on the
locks from a distance, each round a hero works to
unlock a manacle (by the key or otherwise), that hero
is exposed to the ribbon of necromantic energy.
Once freed and removed from the energy ribbon,
Lasda recovers his mobility after 2d4 rounds of
gasping for breath. Lasda can tell the heroes the
harrowing tale of his imprisonment and give a partial
description of areas D1 to D11. The heroes might have
heard of Lasda’s disappearance if they’ve spoken to
his worried mother, Brelda, at the Rowdy Rockﬁsh.
If the heroes return Lasda to the Rowdy Rockﬁsh,
his mother is overjoyed and presses upon the heroes
a family heirloom, a minor sturdy shield emblazoned
with an angry-looking rockﬁsh, as a reward.
Removing Lasda from the ribbon of light causes the
necromantic energy here and in areas B35 and C15 to
vanish. While this prevents Belcorra from ﬁring
Gauntlight’s beam upon Otari again, the
reprieve is only temporary. As the heroes
will learn from Otari’s ghost, Belcorra
continues to prepare Gauntlight for its
true purpose far below.
In addition, once Lasda is removed,
the haunts on the upper four
levels of the Abomination
Vaults don’t reset if they’re
deactivated or defeated. These
effects return if both Volluk and
the voidglutton survive, and they’re
given several days to ﬁnd and install
a new victim. If they do so, this
should be an NPC whose kidnapping
spurs the heroes into action!
D10. SCALATHRAX PEN
MODERATE 4
The ﬂoor of this rough-hewn cavern is strewn with bones
and scraps of metal and cloth.
All three irregular, rocky passages out of this area
end in secret doors. All three secret doors are obvious
from within the cavern.
Creatures: This cavern once merely connected the
southwestern and northeastern wings of the level, but
it now serves as a pen for a trio of scalathraxes. One
of these has already been transported from area D9 via
Gauntlight’s beam to Otari in Chapter 2, but the other
two remain here, awaiting Volluk’s next Gauntlight
test. They’re poorly fed and attack the heroes on sight,
pursuing them relentlessly.

Three ﬁve-foot-square iron cages, the bars lined with spikes

Blood-crusted manacles dangle from chains on the west
wall. A stout wooden table with more manacles anchored
to it stands in the southwest corner, and on it sits a whip
made of blood-red leather with a silver handle.
Here, Belcorra imprisoned and tortured those lacking
the qualities she sought for ﬂeshwarping experiments or
arena battles in the levels below. Once she was satisﬁed

her prisoners had nothing left to offer, or once she grew
bored, she sent them to area D13 for sacriﬁce. The dwarf
bartender Lasda inhabited the central hanging cage for
many months.
The northern cage has silver-lined runes carved into
its exterior. This cage is the destination of the inactive
teleportation circle in area C5b. It can be restored with
the awaken portal ritual; if so, it makes a useful way
to imprison anyone pushed into the alcove in area C5.
A hero who Searches the table and succeeds at a
DC 20 Perception check spots a hidden switch on its
underside that opens the secret door to the south.
Creatures: An evangelist velstrac named Vaulgrist
has been bound here by Belcorra’s magic for centuries.
The interminable years instilled a sense of listlessness
in the torturer, and she rarely even moves about the
room. Her hope of cruel amusements was brieﬂy
rekindled when she had Lasda to toy with, but she’d
only just begun a few months of laying the groundwork
for his torment when he was taken away. Her ennui
has returned even stronger than before.
At ﬁrst, Vaulgrist can hardly stir herself to
bother with the heroes. She morosely invites
them to depart this chamber and never return.
There’s no trick here—if the heroes simply leave
at once, the velstrac lets them go. If they persist or
question her, she sighs in frustration and attacks; she
has no interest in talking. She ﬁghts until destroyed but
doesn’t leave this area. With all the manacles present
here, Vaulgrist can use her animate chains ability from
anywhere in this room.

Treasure: The whip is a +1 ghost touch whip. It
was once one of Vaulgrist’s favorite weapons, but she
doesn’t use it any longer. Pay attention if a hero keeps
the whip, as it might have some use for them in area E2.
D12. THE GHOSTWALK
MODERATE 4
The ceiling of this wide hall rises to a height of twenty‑ﬁve
feet. Stone sarcophagi carved with tormented, emaciated
ﬁgures stand upright in alcoves along its walls. To the
northeast, a ﬁfteen-foot-wide portion of the wall has
crumbled away into a series of ledges that drop down into
a cavern. Eerie blue lights glow to the north and south—the
light to the south is brighter and constant, while the light
to the north ﬂickers softly.
This long hallway served as a gruesome trophy hall.
With the exception of the two northernmost alcoves
and the alcove leading to area D10, each sarcophagus
contains the deﬁled remains of one of Belcorra’s
enemies, stripped of gear and put on display. As soon as
anyone steps up to a sarcophagus, its stone lid becomes
transparent, providing a view of the long-dead body
within. Each corpse is dressed in rags and marked with
obviously fatal wounds. Most of these are the remains
of long-dead heroes with no signiﬁcant relation to the
Vaulgrist

story of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The
corpses here used to be linked to enslaved ghosts that
guarded the hall, but their undead presences have been
inadvertently drawn into the magical wall at the south
end of this hallway.
A large ﬂight of stairs to the south leads down to
area E1. For now, progress to this level is blocked
by a shimmering wall of ectoplasm. Now and then,
silently shrieking ghosts ﬂit through the swirling mist
of this wall. The stairwell beyond remains visible yet
tauntingly inaccessible. This wall acts as a wall of force
heightened to 9th level and has been forged from the
agonized souls of the heroes displayed throughout this
hallway—they’re the trapped ghosts who silently cry
out in agony within the wall. This wall’s creation was
an unintended side effect of Gauntlight’s test ﬁring
after it had lain dormant for so long. For now, though,
the wall blocks progress deeper into the dungeon.
Only the icons of Belcorra’s killers can bring it down,
as the ghost of Otari Ilvashti in area D18 can explain.
The secret door in the alcove, which leads to area D10,
is built into the back of the only empty sarcophagus.
A hero who Searches the empty sarcophagus and
succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check discovers the
latch to swing the sarcophagus open like a door.
The collapse in the northwest wall leads to a series
of 5-foot-high ledges that drop down to area D14.
Creatures: The two northernmost sarcophagi
contain traitorous apprentices transformed into cairn
wights. If anyone approaches within 15 feet of them,
both lids pop open and the cairn wights emerge to
attack. They relentlessly pursue foes through this level.

SEVERE 4
This vast octagonal chamber is mostly empty. The walls
are carved and painted to resemble a sprawling graveyard
half-sunken into a swampy morass, yet all the graves in
the mural are open and empty. Carved images of shrieking
ghosts parade upward and into the hungry pupil of a
malevolent eye at the apex of this room, thirty feet above.
A circular ﬁfteen-foot-diameter platform sits in the middle
of the room, raised three feet oﬀ the surrounding ﬂoor.
The platform supports an altar stone made of an irregular
slab of rock marked by seven deep indentations, almost
as if a huge, seven-ﬁngered hand had gripped the stone
with enough force to leave grooves behind. Now and then,
a faint blue light ﬂickers and pulses inside one of these
indentations. Small objects lie heaped atop the altar.

Knowledge identiﬁes this chamber as a shrine dedicated
to Nhimbaloth, the Outer God of despair, ghosts, and
swamps. Her shrines are often empty of additional
furnishings, such as statues or benches, symbolizing the
emptiness of death itself. Worshipers typically kneel or
prostrate themselves on the stone ﬂoor while priests
lead sermons and sacriﬁces at the altar.
The entire shrine is infused with an overwhelming
sense of despair and hopelessness. Any living creature
who enters this room must succeed at a DC 22 Will
save or become frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical
failure). A living creature can’t reduce its frightened
condition while in this chamber. A critical success
grants the creature temporary immunity for 24 hours.
Creatures: A hero who succeeds at a DC 16
Perception check from the room’s entrance identiﬁes
the objects on the altar as four severed hands. These
undead guardians scuttle forth and attack when the
heroes enter this room. When the hands animate,
four ﬂickerwisps slither out from indentations on the
altar’s sides and join in their attack. The ﬂickerwisps
and crawling hands don’t pursue foes from the shrine
room. If no foes are present, they return to their
original places on the altar. They ﬁght until destroyed.

Lights from the Altar: The altar produces a new
ﬂickerwisp each day at dusk, but no more than four
ﬂickerwisps can exist in this chamber at one time. The
malevolent aura and ﬂickerwisp generation persist
until the heroes place the four Roseguard icons atop
the altar stone, as directed by Otari’s ghost (area D18).
At this point, the frightening despair in the room ends,
and the altar produces no more ﬂickerwisps.
D14. PAVILION
SEVERE 4
This immense cavern is cold and damp. Water drips from
condensation above into a large, still lake. Thick patches
of moist mushrooms, some nearly four feet tall, grow
along the western shore of the lake, while a narrow
trickle of water feeds in from a tunnel to the south. A
thirty-ﬁve-foot-long pavilion made of stone stands in the
middle of the lake, elevated ten feet above the water level
by more than a dozen stone columns. The entire pavilion is

encrusted with damp, pale fungus. Two stone bridges arch
from the pavilion—one connecting it to a door set in the
northern wall and another to a door to the east. A faintly
ﬂickering campﬁre burns in the middle of the pavilion, its
smoke curling to the ceiling.
The fungus growing here might look ominous, but
it’s harmless. The lake has steep banks that drop away
into a nearly uniform depth of 15 feet.
Belcorra built this pavilion as a place to meditate.
The denizens of the Abomination Vaults don’t visit
here, as the lingering presence of Otari’s ghost in
area D18 subconsciously inﬂuences them to stay
away. Living creatures (such as the pavilion’s current
inhabitants) don’t feel these inﬂuences.
Creatures: A grizzled, feral-looking man lives in
the pavilion. He’s Jaul Mezmin, a violent criminal
and murderous werewolf wanted in the town of
Otari for the slaying of several locals 30 years ago.
Jaul’s last victim was a woman named Ayla Lathenar,
wife of Keeleno Lathenar, the owner of the Otari
Market. Jaul hid in plain sight as one of the druids
of Stone Ring Pond while he committed his murders,
but when he was found out, he escaped capture
by leaping from the Otari cliffs into the sea. The
tides pulled him into sea caves, leaving him nearly
drowned, but over the following weeks, he recovered
and found his way here.
Jaul’s been living here ever since. His skin is pasty
and pale, and he reeks of mushrooms and sour
sweat. Cave crickets make up the bulk of his diet.
His only companions over the years have been a
series of loyal wolves; when one perishes, Jaul simply
makes his way out through the caves to bond with
another. At ﬁrst, he made plans to return to Otari, but
after living in this cave for so many years, Jaul knows
no other life.
The heroes disrupt that life, though. When Jaul
notices them, he staggers up to the edge of his
pavilion and howls and barks wildly to warn
them away. The wolf at his side accompanies
his howls with its own. A hero who succeeds
at a DC 27 Society check to Recall
Knowledge realizes this man is the
killer who disappeared from Otari a
generation ago. At your discretion,
a hero familiar with Jaul’s legacy
treats the result of this check as one
degree of success greater than the
rolled result.
If the heroes attack Jaul or attempt
to enter his pavilion, he assumes his
hybrid form and attacks. If the heroes
hang back, he continues to bark and
howl until someone can calm him down.
As soon as the heroes successfully use any
skill with the linguistic trait on Jaul (such as to
create a convincing Lie, use Diplomacy to Make
an Impression, or try to Coerce him), he stops
howling and blinks several times as he remembers
that he can talk as well. A few moments later, he
calls out in a halting voice, warning the heroes that
this is his territory and they aren’t welcome. His initial
attitude is hostile, and if the heroes try to talk to him

too much, he grows frustrated and uses his magic
to attack from afar. Depending on the questions the
heroes ask, Jaul might reveal his name or who he is,
but it’s likely only a matter of time before the paranoid
werewolf loses patience and attacks.
If Jaul is reduced to 30 or fewer Hit Points, he begs
for mercy and promises to give the heroes a reward if
they spare him. This reward is Ayla’s necklace. Heroes
who show Jaul mercy can get him to talk further;
Jaul is somewhat familiar with the eastern half of this
level (areas D14 to D19). For example, he can warn
the heroes of the shadowy ghost on the island to the
south (area D18) and tell them that if they enter the
“nightmare stairs” to the north (area D19), they’d
do well to keep their eyes closed if they want to ever
escape them. If the heroes let him go, he exits through
the sea caves and ﬂees the region. Whether or not he
resumes his murderous ways is left for you to decide.

realize who he is right away, allow a hero who looks
over the inscription on his necklace to attempt a DC
18 Society check (DC 13 if the hero is afﬁliated with
the Otari Market). On a success, the hero recognizes
the name as Ayla Lathenar, the dead wife of the Otari
Market merchant, Keeleno Lathenar. Approaching
Keeleno with proof that the werewolf is dead—as the
bitter man won’t accept his wife’s murderer remaining
alive—earns the heroes a 20 percent discount for all

D15. TWISTING TUNNEL
Several slippery ledges lead up and out of area D14,
joining a small complex of caverns that stretches
between Fogfen and the coast. It was via these tunnels
that Jaul Mezmin arrived, and he leaves through them
occasionally to hunt for food. The tunnels connect
to the coastline west of Otari in a sea cave that’s
underwater even at low tide. The actual contents of
these caverns are beyond the scope of this adventure,
but they likely contain other predators and dangers.
Feel free to expand them if the heroes wish to explore
them and are in need of additional XP.

D16. HAUNTED STAIRS
A staircase leads upward from this narrow landing. The
south wall, facing the stairs, ﬂickers and glows with
ribbons of eerie green luminescence.
These stairs lead up to area C33.
During his ﬂight through the Abomination Vaults,
Otari Ilvashti made one of his ﬁnal stops on this
staircase. He waited here for only an hour to patch
some wounds and regain his courage, then moved on
through the door to area D14, hoping to ﬁnd an escape
route. Unfortunately, he never made it to the sea cave
exit, for the enormous otyugh that dwelt in the cavern
in those days attacked him at once. Otari was forced
to ﬂee south and made it to area D18. The otyugh was
too large to reach him there but too stubborn to leave,
and it’s there that Otari ﬁnally perished from a disease
the otyugh inﬂicted upon him.
As in areas B28 and C3, Otari’s spiritual energy
remains here. When the heroes reach this point, another
message manifests in the glowing light on the wall:
“Gauntlight is a weapon, built to raze Absalom—it
must be brought down!” After the message is read, the
words slide down into a writhing ribbon of footprints
that leads into area D14, then makes a panicked, twisting
route down through area D17 and into area D18.
This spectral manifestation can appear once per day.
D17. DISPOSAL POND
A rusty metal chute protrudes from the ceiling to the west
here, coming to an end over a pool of slimy water. A huge
mound of fungus lies under the tube against the west wall,
resting in a strangely monstrous shape.
This chute leads up to area D7, but it’s slick and
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check to Climb.
Characters who are dumped into the pool of water
here ﬁnd it cold and unpleasant, but it’s only 3
feet deep. Fortunately, the immense otyugh once kept
here for trash disposal purposes died long ago. Its
strangely preserved body lies encased in fungus under
the pipe. Anyone who examines the remains of the
Huge otyugh can identify it with a successful DC 23
Occultism check to Recall Knowledge.
D18. OTARI’S DOOM
SEVERE 4
The water in this area is dark but only 3 feet deep.
A low rocky isle rises less than a foot above the surrounding
water here, its surface covered with a ﬁne layer of pale
green mushrooms and mold. A human skeleton dressed in
rotten leather armor and clutching a rapier lies in a heap at
the center of the isle.
The skeleton on the island was once Otari Ilvashti.
He survived the battle with Belcorra and a desperate
ﬂight through the upper levels of the Abomination
Vaults only to become trapped here by the immense
otyugh waiting in area D17. Already weakened from
his ordeal before contracting ﬁlth fever from the ﬁght
with the otyugh, Otari lingered on the tiny islet only
two days before he perished.
Today, his spirit lingers on, both in the form of
the strange warnings on the walls throughout the
Abomination Vaults and also as a ghost consumed by
two linked desires—vengeance on Belcorra and fear that
Gauntlight might yet be used to harm his hometown of
Absalom. As the heroes draw near, Otari’s ghost rises up
from his skeleton, appearing much as he did during the
late stages of ﬁlth fever, albeit with a transparent green
shade. Otari can’t leave this area, and since the heroes
are the ﬁrst potentially helpful adventurers to visit his
haunted remains, he’s eager to provide help.
Creatures: Before Otari can speak to the heroes, a
will-o’-wisp and two ﬂickerwisps that have tormented
him for years dart forth to protect their fear-laden
victim. Otari can do little more than warn the heroes
about the “Eyes of the Empty Death” before they
swoop forth to attack.
Once combat begins, Otari provides what aid he
can. The aberrations long ago learned to stay out of
the ghost’s reach, but Otari makes Infested Shadow
Strikes against them by momentarily possessing the
heroes’ shadows. After the wisps are defeated, Otari
provides much more information, as described below.

heroes encounter Otari’s ghost and drive off the wisps
that torment him, he relates his tale of woe. He has
difﬁculty remembering much of his life but becomes
very emotional if he learns that the other members
of the Roseguard survived and founded a town they
named after him.
While Otari’s information about the dungeon is
centuries out of date, his supernatural link to the
Abomination Vaults affords him glimpses into the inner
workings of the dungeon and its key players. As Otari
speaks to the heroes, make sure he conveys the following
key points of information to them, either in the form of
answers to questions or volunteered information.
•	 Belcorra harbored a grudge against Absalom and
intended to use her sinister lighthouse, Gauntlight,
as a weapon against the city. The Roseguard
never discovered its actual use, other than that it
had something to do with the ability to transport
creatures across signiﬁcant distances and could
animate the dead with its light. None of the
other Roseguard members knew about the
Abomination Vaults beneath Gauntlight. Otari
learned about them only in his last few days alive.
•	 Some property of the Abomination Vaults
increases the manifestation of ghosts, spectral
undead, and haunts within their domain. Otari
initially believed this was a side
effect from Gauntlight but has
now come to suspect a link to a
much more ancient and ominous
source deep below this level. He
knows nothing of Nhimbaloth, but if the
heroes tell him of the Outer God, he suspects
her inﬂuence is the source.
•	 Belcorra herself is now a ghost,
although she can’t move far from
the site to which she’s anchored.
Otari can sense her somewhere deep
underground and is also aware that the
range of her movements is slowly expanding.
•	 Otari suspects Belcorra intends to fully
reactivate Gauntlight and use it to begin her
long-delayed attack on Absalom. She must
be put to rest before she can ﬁnish this task.
Otari isn’t sure how to stop her, but believes
that clues await discovery in the deeper levels
of the Abomination Vaults.
•	 Finally, Otari feels the barrier in area D12
blocking progress deeper into the Abomination
Vaults. He understands that it’s powered by the
souls of Belcorra’s defeated enemies. Fortunately,
he also understands how to take the barrier
down. The Roseguard were the adventurers who
ﬁnally killed her, and their psychic resonance can
drop the barrier. The heroes must ﬁnd and place
four icons the Roseguard once held dear onto the
altar in area D13 to do this. Otari’s thieves’ tools
are here with his bones and serve as his icon. The
other icons are the brooch belonging to the cleric
Aesephna Menhemes (which bears the religious
symbol of her god, Erastil), the spellbook
belonging to the wizard Zarmavdian, and the
Otari Ilvashti

trusty longsword of the ﬁghter Vol Rajani. These
other three icons are described on page 217 and
can be found on the surface. Recovering them is
the focus of the ﬁrst part of the next chapter.
Once the heroes take on the burden of facing and
defeating Belcorra and open the way to the deeper
levels of the Abomination Vaults, Otari’s soul is free
to travel to its ﬁnal reward. You should ensure he has
imparted all of the above information to the heroes
before he fades away.
If you wish, though, you can put a darker spin
on things—rather than have Otari’s spirit achieve
freedom, it could instead be captured by the temple of
Nhimbaloth at the bottom of the Abomination Vaults.
In this case, the heroes should learn about Otari’s fate
through a vision or nightmare, or perhaps even see his
tormented ghost pulled downward against his will.
Otari’s ghost remains trapped until the heroes ﬁnally
defeat Belcorra.

D19. THE FOREVER STAIRS
The walls of this ﬁve-foot-wide hallway shimmer and ripple
with faint whorls of pale blue energy. A staircase to the west
leads upward, and the one to the east leads down. Both the
ascending and descending stairs reach small landings.
While at ﬁrst glance this hallway might seem
unremarkable, it should quickly become clear that
something truly strange is going on once the heroes
start to travel it. The hallway loops back upon itself;
for example, if the heroes choose to go clockwise, the
stairs will always lead upward, but they end up at
the same place they started after making a complete
circuit. Belcorra created this distorted spatial effect in
the early days of her construction of the Abomination
Vaults as she was experimenting with several magical
methods of delivering her monsters directly into the
streets of Absalom. While she ultimately abandoned
spatial warping as too inefﬁcient to be used on a
sufﬁciently large scale, she kept this warped hall she
constructed as a sort of defensive “moat” around her
personal quarters.
The outside doors to areas D13 and D14 are always
present, but the alcove and door to area D20 are
concealed by an illusory wall created by a 5th-level
illusory object spell. The Will DC to disbelieve the
illusion is 26, but the heroes might ﬁnd the wall in other
ways. A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check
while Searching the north hallway or a DC 20 Arcana
or Occultism check while Investigating the north hall
identiﬁes anomalies in the blue energy that indicate
something unusual about that section of the wall.
XP Award: Grant the heroes 30 XP the ﬁrst time
they manage to reach area D20.
D20. BELCORRA’S SUITE
EXTREME 4
These four angled rooms have identical basic
descriptions; adjust the following as needed to account
for the location of any doors in the room. Area D20d
also features a plain stone archway in one wall ﬁlled
with blank stone. This is an inactive portal to the
depths of the Abomination Vaults.
A pair of doors provide exits from this room, one of
which is set a foot higher than the room’s dusty ﬂoor on a
semicircular step.

When Belcorra ﬁrst began construction of the
Abomination Vaults, these chambers served as her
personal suite. She lived here for many years as she
oversaw the construction of the dungeons both
above and below, but once the project was complete,
she abandoned this home for one even deeper
underground. She moved her belongings deep below
as well, leaving these chambers abandoned and
empty, but when she became a ghost, her spiritual
energy reacted in much the same way Otari’s did
by manifesting lingering images within these rooms
where she spent so many hours.
As a result, each time the heroes step into one of
these four rooms, they’re greeted with a brief ghostly
image of the room as it once was. Each time, they
also see a vision of Belcorra herself within the room.
Descriptions of each room’s visions are given below,
but chances are good that the heroes won’t have time
to study the scenes at ﬁrst—see Creatures below.
D20a: This room was once a comfortable sitting
room with two chairs and a low end table between
them. In the brief vision, Belcorra is meeting with the
drow Volluk (as he was in life, as a drow). Although the
image has no sound, Belcorra is speaking animatedly
about something, and Volluk is listening attentively.
D20b: Originally a lounge with two plush divans,
this room ﬂashes an image of Belcorra relaxing while
reading a large tome. A hero who succeeds at a DC
18 Perception check sees that the book is titled The
Whispering Reeds (this book is currently in area C35).
D20c: A well-set table reveals this to have once
been Belcorra’s private dining room. In the image, she
sits alone at the table, drinking a glass of wine and
enjoying an elegantly plated roast arm that looks
disturbingly human.
D20d: Belcorra’s bedroom features a large bed
along the west wall. The stone archway to the north
shimmers as a portal opens and Belcorra steps
through with a cruel smile on her lips and blood on
her hands.
Creatures: A powerful and horriﬁc entity known as
a voidglutton has dwelt within these chambers since
Belcorra abandoned them. Unlike many of Belcorra’s
minions, the voidglutton came to her of its own free
will, drawn from across the dimensions by echoes of
Nhimbaloth’s presence. It volunteered to aid Belcorra
as a guardian of the upper shrine (area D13), but once
she relocated her personal effects to deeper within the
Abomination Vaults, it took over these rooms. It basks
in the latent fears and pains of the dungeon’s haunts
and ghosts.
When Belcorra rose as a ghost, the voidglutton took
note and visited her, learning of her plans to reactivate
Gauntlight and realizing it would take time to awaken
the dormant artifact. The voidglutton helped her reﬁne
the plans to testing Gauntlight and has recently done
so with Volluk’s aid (as the heroes experienced at the
beginning of Chapter 2). Since then, the voidglutton
has lurked here, understanding that it’s just a matter
of time before Belcorra contacts it again to enact the
next stage of her plan.
The voidglutton moves from room to room in this
area, as it ﬁnds the echoes of Belcorra’s spirit soothing.
It therefore has an equal chance of being in area
D20a, D20b, D20c, or D20d when the heroes arrive. It
notes the heroes’ intrusion immediately, however, and
swiftly moves to confront them. The creature has no
interest in negotiation; it attacks at once and ﬁghts to
the death, but it doesn’t pursue heroes who ﬂee these
rooms. If the voidglutton clearly has the upper hand
over a group of intruders, it might offer to let most of
them ﬂee if they leave it a single survivor to torment to
death over a few months.

Initiative Perception +18
D21. TROPHY VAULT
The walls of this octagonal chamber are sheathed
in a foul‑looking, moist webbing made of stringy,
semi‑transparent slime. The bodies of three creatures have
been mounted on the walls in this webbing, as if on display:
a lavender-skinned elf, the legless body of a spider-like
humanoid, and a hideous humanoid with transparent ﬂesh.
Belcorra took all of her treasure with her when she
left, but the voidglutton has used this place as a den
for many years and has placed a few of its favorite
trophies here—bodies of creatures whose minds it
fed upon and found to be particularly delightful,
along with some of their potent gear and treasures.
The bodies themselves are encased on the walls by
the voidglutton’s ectoplasmic webbing and must be
cut free before they can be searched. Once freed, the
bodies swiftly begin to decay, no longer held in stasis
by the effects of the voidglutton’s webs.
Treasure: The upper torso of a drider from the
ﬂeshwarping labs on the sixth level of the Abomination
Vaults carries a vial with a lesser mistform elixir. A
drow outcast from the outpost of Yldaris on the ninth
level of the Abomination Vaults wears a strand of holy
prayer beads on one wrist. The body of an urdefhan
from the same level carries a +1 striking composite
longbow in a case.

CHAPTER 5:
Into the Training Grounds
While the upper levels of Belcorra’s massive dungeon
were primarily for her personal use, she designed the
middle levels for work. Belcorra trawled the Darklands
for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations,
but their feral power wasn’t enough for her. She needed
to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis
of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces
forged for battle, in body and in mind. The ﬁfth level
thus included a massive arena and training grounds
where gladiators would ﬁght for the right to lead her
monstrous troops.
In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike
aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious
eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth
level—formerly support rooms for her monsters and
their trainers as well as a “preserve” where she kept
large beasts—as laboratories. There, the seugathis
sought to perfect ﬂeshwarping to create ﬂawless
monsters under the guidance of their leader, Jafaki.
Belcorra constructed the smaller seventh level as a
prison. She didn’t intend to keep many captives, since
creatures who displeased her could serve as raw ﬂesh
for Jafaki’s experiments or as food for her monsters.
However, one of Belcorra’s chief administrators, the
contract devil Urevian, insisted on building the prison.
Before long, the level became a warped mirror of Hell.
A decade into building her dungeon and honing her
preparations, Belcorra died at the hands of the heroic
Roseguard, who had no idea about these subterranean
machinations. The Abomination Vaults fell into
disarray almost immediately. Urevian attempted to
assert control, but Jafaki’s aberrant creations fought the
devil’s forces to a standstill. A sort of stalemate settled
over the middle levels, and the borders of control have
shifted only slightly over the centuries. Jafaki merely
wanted peace to continue their experiments; Urevian
idly prepared for the surface invasion as his contract
required of him, even though he knew it was almost
impossible for him to complete his contract because
Belcorra had died.
Word of the seugathis’ skilled ﬂeshwarping spread.
Before long, arrogant or desperate creatures came
to the Abomination Vaults seeking remarkable
transformations, though few ultimately considered
