CHAPTER 2:
The Forgotten Dungeon
While the heroes are free to enter the dungeon below
the keep as soon as they discover any of its entrances,
an important event should take place before they dive
too deeply into the Abomination Vaults. It’s best if this
event takes place at night while the heroes have line of
sight to Gauntlight’s cupola, such as when they retreat
to rest or perhaps even right after they’ve defeated
the vampiric mist in area A25. In any case, the heroes
should be 2nd level for this event. When the timing is
right, begin Deadtide for Otari.
Deadtide for Otari
Gauntlight isn’t yet fully functional, but enough of
its magical power has been restored that Belcorra
activates it as a test ﬁring before proceeding with
the more-involved process of restoring the artifact
to full use. She targets Otari’s graveyard, animating
the dead within it. The ghost then watches through
Gauntlight’s lens, but she can’t do much beyond
observe, limited as she is to the site of her haunting
deep in the Abomination Vaults. Read or paraphrase
the following to begin this event.
Gauntlight shudders and its light suddenly blazes with a
sickly, pale-blue illumination. This beam arcs south, falling
not directly on Otari, but onto the sprawling graveyard
located at Otari’s western edge.
The light remains ﬁxed on the graveyard and is
visible all the way from Gauntlight to the town. There
isn’t any way for the heroes to impede the beam, as
it emanates magically from Gauntlight and can’t be
stopped from its origin point except by Belcorra’s will.
As the dead are buried, it takes most of them some
time to dig free. Although the heroes might hurry
directly to the graveyard given the sinister implications
of the eerie light, you can still run these events as
written if the heroes ﬁrst take some time to tend to their
wounds or otherwise delay. If the heroes take more
than a couple of hours to arrive, town guards have
already erected a barrier around the cemetery but are
afraid to enter the grounds for fear of the occasional
shufﬂing corpse that pulled itself free sooner than
the others. Dealing with the undead should fall to
the heroes; if they aren’t self-motivated to enter the

graveyard and act the part of heroes, feel free to have
an ofﬁcial like Captain Longsaddle, Mayor Oseph
Menhemes, or Vandy Banderdash ask them to deal
with the situation. If the heroes continue to hesitate,
the undead might become a bigger problem.
OTARI GRAVEYARD
SEVERE 2
The soil of Otari’s graveyard roils and churns in the eerie
blue light. Dozens of skeletons and shambling corpses
haul themselves free from the ground and rush to the
south. Without any hesitation, the walking dead plummet
over the cliﬀ’s edge to rain down upon the domes of the
Dawnﬂower Library below.
Most of the undead raised by Gauntlight’s beam
plummet to their grisly destruction over the cliffs,
though a few remain in the graveyard. Yet the damage
is done—Otari’s citizens are horriﬁed and panicked. If
the heroes step into the graveyard to take on the few
remaining undead, the ﬁght is an important symbolic
stand—this is the heroes’ ﬁrst real step toward being
recognized as Otari’s saviors.
Creatures: A total of ﬁve skeleton guards and three
zombie shamblers remain active in the graveyard.
These foes technically constitute a severe encounter for
2nd-level characters, but canny heroes have a number
of advantages. The undead are scattered throughout
the graveyard with no undead within 30 feet of any
other, although they quickly move toward any ﬁght or
distraction. Stealth and ranged tactics could well thin
the opposition before they close in. With the undead
being scattered, the heroes won’t need to deal with
large numbers all at once if they’re quick and efﬁcient.
The four nearby town guards are horriﬁed by the
situation and are unlikely to be of much help—they
ﬂee if attacked. At your discretion, and particularly if
a hero manages to make a Request of the guards or
Coerce their aid, some of them might ﬁght. Guards can
also drag a fallen hero to safety. In the event you need
statistics for the guards, use the statistics for a guard
on page 232 of the Pathﬁnder Gamemastery Guide,
but treat the guards as frightened 3 at the start of any
ﬁght they join.

ABOMINATION’S ARRIVAL
MODERATE 2
Belcorra watches with amusement from afar as the
heroes deal with the undead. As soon as that ﬁght ends,
though, she decides it’s time to test Gauntlight’s primary
function: teleporting monsters in among her enemies.
Belcorra takes a moment to order her apprentice Volluk
to bring one of the scalathraxes from area D10 into area
D9. This delay grants the heroes a few minutes to recover
from their previous ﬁght. She then focuses Gauntlight’s
beam upon the heroes’ location to transport the creature
there. The illumination raises gooseﬂesh on those it
touches and scatters any remaining guards in a panic.
Creatures: An instant after Gauntlight’s beam shines
upon the heroes, a spiderlike scalathrax manifests in
their midst—and, just as quickly, Gauntlight goes dark.
The aberration uses Stealth to determine its initiative
and immediately attacks, ﬁghting to the death. Any
hero who witnesses the creature’s sudden arrival and
succeeds at a DC 20 Arcana or Occultism check (either
during or after the ﬁght) realizes that the creature was
teleported into the area via the beam.

DYING LIGHT
Once Gauntlight has delivered the scalathrax and gone
dark, it will be at least a month before the artifact can
return to a point where Belcorra can activate it again.
She might do so to animate more undead or teleport
another monster into town, either to attack the heroes
directly or to simply spread panic.
Of course, the townsfolk have no idea about this
schedule, and the fear that Gauntlight could shine
again at any moment has the citizens terriﬁed. People
fear to go outside after dark, and rumors about
Belcorra’s return run rampant. Assuming the heroes
played a key and visible role in defeating the undead
and the scalathrax, they’re soon contacted by mayor
Oseph Menhemes, who asks them to do what they
can to ﬁnd out what caused this event and, if possible,
prevent it from occurring again. Feel free to have other
town notables be present at this time—give the heroes
the chance to rise to the occasion. In any event, Oseph
promises a reward of 50 gp per hero from the town
treasury if they return to Gauntlight Keep and see to it
that Gauntlight never shines on Otari again.

once served as the quarters for Belcorra’s servants.

those in Gauntlight Keep above. When Belcorra was killed, the servants
here panicked. Some ﬂed, others hid in their rooms, and still others became
food for the cannibal librarians the next ﬂoor down. Today, the servants’
quarters are largely in ruins.
Areas are unlit unless otherwise noted, and the ceiling heights are
typically 8 feet in hallways and 10 feet in rooms. The doors are sturdy
wood, swollen shut with moisture. A hero trained in Athletics can open
doors on this level with a single Interact action, as normal; characters who
aren’t trained in Athletics must spend 2 Interact actions to open a door.
The largest faction presently active in the Servant’s Quarters is a group
of morlocks who call themselves the Children of the Ghost Queen. These
morlocks once dwelt deep below this level in caverns adjacent to the
Abomination Vaults. When Belcorra wakened, they clambered into the
higher levels to prepare the way for her, enduring a devastating clash with
the Cult of the Canker ghouls and later driving out the Mudlicker mitﬂits.
Belcorra always considered morlocks to be pests (and still does, even as a
ghost), but the morlocks’ leader, Graulgust, hopes to change her mind by
building her a temple. But, just as Belcorra’s eldritch patron Nhimbaloth
cares little about how she’s honored, the morlocks’ Ghost Queen doesn’t
care whether these devout morlocks live or die.
The Servant’s Quarters map appears on page 36.
B1. STAIRS UP
These tightly spiraling stairs lead up to area A21.
B2. VOLLUK’S WORKSHOP
The door to this room is locked. A hero without the key from area A20 can
Force Open the door with a successful DC 20 Athletics check or Pick the
Lock with three successful DC 20 Thievery checks.
Seven square alcoves, each containing strange magical apparatuses or alchemical
sets of tools, ring this damp stone chamber. The alcove to the north contains a
large glass tank ﬁlled with liquid. A goblin’s corpse, clad in outdated servant’s
clothing, ﬂoats inside it. A semicircular worktable covered with tools, moldy
papers, and a large open book stands in front of the tank.
Volluk Azrinae once used this chamber as his personal workshop. The
worktable in front of the tank holds the bulk of Volluk’s notes. A hero
Investigating these notes who succeeds at a DC 12 Arcana or Occultism
check to Recall Knowledge learns that the workshop is devoted to both
construct construction and necromancy. A critical success on this check also
reveals the workshop’s emphasis is transferring mortal souls, including into
a construct or a swarm of vermin.
The goblin in the tank is the preserved corpse of Borbo, once Volluk’s
devoted servant. Borbo volunteered his body and soul for a technique that
Volluk promised would grant immortality, though being turned into the
soulbound doll named Mister Beak wasn’t exactly the immortality that
Borbo had in mind. Still, Borbo, as Mister Beak, has thus far remained
loyal to Volluk. The corpse is well-preserved in the tank; even if removed,
it takes months to decay.
A search of the other alcoves reveals little of interest, with two
exceptions: a secret door in the southwestern alcove and an incomplete
soulbound doll in the northwestern alcove.
CHAPTER 2 SYNOPSIS
The Abomination Vaults’ second
level—its highest underground level—
harbors several old traps and ﬁercely
independent denizens who hunt on
the surface. It also contains a small
group of morlocks pushed up from
below. Before the heroes get too
far into exploring this level, though,
Belcorra activates Gauntlight in a
devastating test as she reﬁnes the
artifact’s power.
Environmental Cues: broken
low‑quality furniture and tools,
cobwebs, distant banging noises,
moisture beading on the walls, smells
of mold, unpleasant dampness.
CHAPTER 2 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable
items available as treasure in
Chapter 2 are as follows.

Secret Door: The southwestern alcove contains a
secret door leading down to area C10 and, from there,
back up to area B32. A hero who succeeds at a DC 20
Perception check while Searching this alcove identiﬁes a
toolbox bolted to the wall. When the tools within it are
pulled, the attached secret door opens.
Incomplete Doll: The northwest alcove contains a
soulbound doll resembling an armless, legless goblin.
It has an indentation in its back the same size as Mister
Beak’s soul focus gem (area A23). Inserting this gem
activates the soulbound doll, allowing it to speak but
not attack, move, or cast spells until its construction
is complete. A hero can complete it with enough work
and expense, but Borbo remains erratic and violent.
If Borbo is “returned” to this body, he wakens quickly
and begins to sob, lamenting in Goblin that his master
betrayed him. He remains inconsolable until a hero can
either calm him with a successful DC 16
Diplomacy check to Make an Impression
or scare him with a DC 16 Intimidate check
to Coerce him, or until someone places
him in a position where he can see
his former body in the north alcove.
In any of these cases, Borbo ﬁnally
goes silent and the heroes can speak to
him in Common, Elven, or Goblin. Borbo
has little useful to say and is prone
to ﬁts of self-pity and vitriol toward
Volluk, but if the heroes ask the right
questions, they can get four key
pieces of information from him.
•	 The location of the secret
door in this room.
•	 That there’s a secret treasure stash
behind a loose brick in his old room (area B4).
•	 Master Volluk was a “powerful mastermind
drow occultist artist craftsman” who had a
relationship with a “book lady down below” and
who worked for “Mistress Belcorra, who is very
frightening and absolutely none of my business.”
•	 Master Volluk is vain as well as cruel. If the
heroes present a nice image of Volluk (such as a
painting) to him and then threaten to destroy it,
Volluk will lose his composure and likely make a
tactical error the heroes can use. Unfortunately,
the only painting of Volluk Borbo knows about
is the one in area A22, and it’s destroyed. In
fact, only one image of Volluk remains in the
Abomination Vaults; it’s in area C36.
Once the heroes have learned all of his information,
Borbo pitifully asks to be released. If the heroes smash
the soul focus gem, Borbo’s soul is freed. For this act of
compassion, Pharasma grants the hero who destroyed
the gem a favor in the form of a momentary, prophetic
glimpse of their fate. This allows that hero to gain a +2
status bonus to a single check, which they can apply
even after they determine the check’s result. The hero
has 1 month to use this boon.
B3. VOLLUK’S CHAMBERS
This room shares features of both a bedroom and a study,
although the decor is devoid of any personal items or items
of sentimental value.
Volluk once dwelt here but relocated
downstairs to area D8 after becoming
a worm that walks. A search of the
room turns up a scrap of paper
listing the book titles What The
Worm Knows, Grave Feasts, and
Secrets of the Skull, along with a
note at the bottom indicating that
“Transcription will take months,
but I’ll try to have these
books back to you as soon
as possible, my love!”
B4. BORBO’S ROOM
This small room has a long-abandoned
straw bed, a dresser with open drawers
revealing a jumble of out-of-date servant’s
clothing, and a large barrel with a ladle atop it.
This room once belonged to Volluk’s
goblin servant Borbo, but it has been
abandoned since the goblin gave up his life to become
Mister Beak. The clothing matches that worn by
Borbo’s corpse in area B2. The barrel once held dozens
of pickles, but the brine inside evaporated long ago
and the pickles have rotted away.
Treasure: A hero Searching this room who succeeds
at a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds a loose brick
concealing Borbo’s small treasure stash: a jade shard
worth 15 gp, a silver statuette of two succubi worth 35
gp, and an oily-looking slick armor rune. The heroes
might hear about this stash from Borbo in area B2.
B5. VOLLUK’S MACHINE
MODERATE 2
A large metal table ﬁtted with leather straps and iron
bands sits in the center of this room. A strange contraption
that seems to be part spyglass and part mechanical drill
sits near the head of the table. A sparkling black gemstone
glitters in a metal framework built into this machine’s side.

The machine in this room is a sadistic device Volluk
crafted ages ago. With a successful DC 20 Occultism
or Religion check to Recall Knowledge, a hero
determines that the device aids in casting the create
undead ritual (this doesn’t provide knowledge of that
ritual). The drilling device penetrates the skull of a
restrained victim, while the scope focuses the ritual’s
necromantic energies. Using this machine grants a +2
item bonus to skill checks to cast create undead.
The stairs to the south lead down to area C7.
Creatures: One of Volluk’s last creations remains
here, a horriﬁc undead guardian created from a giant
leech. Volluk called the creature the “bloodsiphon” and
was amused at how shriveled the thing became. The
bloodsiphon appears to be a giant log of desiccated
ﬂesh until anyone disturbs or approaches it, at which
point it lurches forth and attacks. It pursues foes into
areas B1 to B4 but not beyond.

Three plain wooden chairs sit along the east wall of this

Belcorra’s lackeys once waited here to perform any
tasks she might need. The secret door to the east that
leads to area B21 is easy to discover from this side of
the room, as the middle chair leans against a section
of the wall that pivots slightly outward. The heroes
can discover this secret door by succeeding at a DC 12

north seems particularly comfortable, although its cracked
leather padding is mostly decayed.
Belcorra addressed her serving staff here. No one
has been in this room in decades, though; neither the
mitﬂits nor the morlocks know about it. This room
(and area B6) thus serves as a safe place to hide or rest.
The secret door leading to area B8 is obvious from
the north side; anyone approaching this secret door
from the north automatically spots it.
B8. SERVANTS’ ROOMS
SEVERE 2
This large open area is a ﬁlthy mess, even beyond the
collapse to the south that clogs part of the room with
rubble. Half-eaten ﬁsh, cat-sized beetles, and bits of
waterfowl lie strewn about in a tangle amid gnawed bones
of larger creatures.
This large room once served as a common area for
servants to relax and take their meals. The southern
half of the room (along with the servants’ toilets and
bathing facilities) were buried under rubble long ago.
The collapsed stairwell to the south once led to area
A8 above. The eight unmarked rooms connecting to
this area are ruined bedrooms with nothing of interest.
A hero Searching this area can discover the secret
door leading north to area B7 with a successful DC 28
Perception check. Pulling an old wall sconce causes the
door to open. None of the morlocks have yet noticed it.
Creatures: The Ghost Queen morlocks lair here.
The ﬁrst time the heroes enter this area, four morlock
scavengers are present, ﬁddling with a partially ruined
ballista that they dragged, in pieces, from area B21
(where it once served as a trap). The morlocks snarl
and hiss if they’re interrupted, ﬁghting until only one
of them is left standing. The surviving morlock then
tries to ﬂee to area B12 to warn their king, Graulgust.

dungeon levels. Volluk took them long ago.
Creatures: Graulgust commanded a pair of Ghost
Queen morlocks to guard this room, but they’re more
interested in tinkering with the broken clockwork
assistant the majordomo left behind. Their distraction
gives them a –2 penalty to initiative checks. They ﬁght
any intruders, ﬂanking foes when possible.
If a morlock scavenger ﬂeeing from area B8 runs
through the room, these morlocks relocate to area B10
to mount a defense.

Treasure: The morlocks have exposed the clockwork
assistant’s inner workings, which include an intricate
gear worth 40 gp. Removing the gear while preserving
its value requires a successful DC 16 Crafting check.
On a failure, the gear is worth only 20 gp; on a critical
failure, the gear breaks and is worth nothing.
B10. TRAPPED HALL
The north and south walls of this hall have been decorated
with a bewildering array of timbers, metal parts, gears, bits
of broken weapons, and trash.
Belcorra’s majordomo used this room for planning
and meetings, but the morlocks have dismantled the
furniture here, along with several other scavenged
items and devices, to build a gauntlet of traps to
defend the approach to their king’s throne room.
Hazards: Four spike launcher traps have been
hidden in the walls of this room, activated by nearly
invisible trip lines stretching across the room 1 foot
off the ground. Morlocks can move through the room
without triggering the spike launchers, as they know
where the trip lines are. One cord crosses each pair of
north‑to-south squares.

claws, revealing a rough-hewn tunnel leading west.
This once served as the majordomo’s washroom.
The tunnel to area B13 began as an eroding crack, then
was widened by the morlocks.
B12. GRAULGUST’S THRONE ROOM
SEVERE 2
A sofa-like throne made of an old mattress, several pieces
of reconstructed furniture, and dozens of bones sprawls
along the northern side of this room. A narrow rivulet of
muddy water trickles from a narrow tunnel to the south
and forms a puddle in the room’s center.
Creatures: Graulgust, the self-styled king of the
Ghost Queen morlocks, has chosen the majordomo’s
old bedroom as his throne room. He has rebuilt the
older furniture in this area into an immense throne
of sorts, and he’s attended at all times by a morlock
servant tasked with sharpening Graulgust’s ﬁngernails
and toenails, rubbing his feet, feeding him worms,
or whatever else Graulgust demands. Now and
then, Graulgust leaves his throne room to patrol the
Ghost Queen’s domain and to check up on the Ghost
Queen’s shrine (area B14), but the ﬁrst time the heroes
visit the dungeon, they encounter him here.
Graulgust fancies himself something of a worldly
diplomat, but since he speaks only Aklo and
Undercommon, communication with the heroes might
be difﬁcult. If he can’t establish communication,
Graulgust grows annoyed and sends his morlock
servant to ﬁght the heroes. Graulgust steps into the
ﬁght only once his servant is slain or if he’s attacked
directly. If he’s reduced to 30 Hit Points, he spends an
action to howl for his pet grothlut in area B13. If the
slithering monster still lives, it comes to its master’s aid
as soon as it can through the tunnel to the southwest.
Any morlocks present when Graulgust is slain gain
the ﬂeeing condition for 1 round and are frightened 3.

Side Quest: If he can communicate with the heroes,
Graulgust congratulates them for their bravery in
seeking him out and gives them a choice—they can
become sacriﬁces for the Ghost Queen (in which
case he directs his morlock servants to kill them), or
they can prove their worth to the Ghost Queen by
slaying the “water monster” that dwells nearby in area
B19 and bringing back her head. If the heroes agree,
Graulgust allows them to leave the room only via the
tunnel to area B18, and if they don’t have the river
drake’s head with them as proof of their deed the next
time they encounter Graulgust, he attacks the heroes
at once for their failure. If the heroes return with the
river drake’s head, Graulgust is delighted that the
morlocks now have an easy way out of the dungeon to
go foraging. He rewards the heroes by giving them the
title of “lackeys of the Ghost Queen” and leads them
on a stroll through Ghost Queen territory (through
areas B10, B9, B8, B14, B21, and B22). Once he and
the heroes reach B22, he offers them a new choice—
surrender their gear and become true slaves of the
Ghost Queen (and be imprisoned in area B24) or begin
a crusade for him against the Cult of the Canker—a
group of “heretic ghouls” who must be slaughtered for
the glory of the Ghost Queen. If the heroes agree to this,
Graulgust sends them downstairs through area B16
with a command to not return until all of the ghouls
are slain. If the heroes do so, Graulgust realizes they’re
too powerful to simply dispose of; he names them
“missionaries of the Ghost Queen” and commands
them to leave the morlock areas and never return.
During this time, the heroes can speak to Graulgust
and learn a bit more about the Abomination Vaults.
The morlocks haven’t explored the northern part of
this level, but he can inform the heroes of the secret
door to area B15 and provide a scribbled map of
level three (including areas C1, C6, C10, C11, C15,
and  C33). If asked about deeper levels, Graulgust
grows silent, saying “You are of the surface and do not
deserve to know of our homeland.” At your discretion,
if the heroes use mind control or other coercive
methods, they might force Graulgust to divulge more
information about deeper levels of the Abomination
Vaults, but note that the morlocks left them a while
ago and much has changed since Belcorra’s return.
Graulgust never speaks the Ghost Queen’s name
aloud, and if the heroes speak the name “Belcorra” in
his presence, he shrieks in anger and warns the heroes
never to say her name again. If they do so, he attacks.
Once the heroes have secured Graulgust’s trust, the
morlock occultist is shocked if they suddenly turn
against him. If the heroes attack Graulgust at any
point after he believes they’re working for him, he’s
slowed 1 for 2 rounds, as he grapples with the fact that
he no longer commands obedience.

B13. GROTHLUT DEN
LOW 2
Water drips down the walls of this cavern, particularly
along a jumble of dangling pallid roots to the south.
Beneath them is a large, soggy nest of mud and bones.
Creatures: This cavern is the result of years of
erosion, and its damp, earthy environs make it a
perfect home for the morlocks’ recently acquired pet,
a grothlut ﬂeshwarp. Graulgust rescued the grothlut
from a cage deeper in the Abomination Vaults, and the
aberration dotes on the morlock the way a loyal dog
adores its master. It attacks anyone who enters this
cave other than Graulgust, ﬁghting to the death.

B14. SHRINE OF THE GHOST QUEEN
While it’s apparent that this large room was originally a
kitchen, the furnishings have been rebuilt and repositioned
to create an improvised shrine. The western end of the hall,
where a large ﬁreplace for cooking food once stood, now
serves as an altar of sorts. Looming over a human corpse
is a towering statue in a feminine shape made of bones,
covered in sheets of moldering cloth and hanging moss.
A bare spot on the room’s north wall has been decorated
with mud and blood to depict the same feminine form
as the statue.
The Ghost Queen morlocks erected this shrine
to honor Belcorra, but as the morlocks fear the
ghost as much as they revere her, they only rarely
enter to provide periodic sacriﬁces—the latest of
which was one of the thieves from Crook’s Nook.
The body is that of a human man with a bird tattoo on
his right shoulder that marks him as a member of the
Osprey Club (with a successful DC 16 Society check
to Recall Knowledge, a hero identiﬁes the mark as
signifying membership in the thieves’ guild).
A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Religion check when
Investigating this shrine surmises that the “divinity”
worshipped here isn’t a well-known goddess, but that
the bloody scrawl on the wall over the secret door is
likely meant to illustrate someone of importance to the
cult. If the heroes have seen an image of Belcorra, such
as the painting in area A22, they recognize the statue
as a crude depiction of the same woman.
The secret door in the northern wall is easier to
ﬁnd than most of those in the area, and it takes
only a successful DC 18 Perception check for a hero
examining the crudely painted decoration to notice
it. The morlocks discovered this door shortly after
they arrived, but the one time they opened it to look
inside, they were scared off by the shadow within.
They believe this secret door leads to a place sacred
to the Ghost Queen. They decorated the wall where the
secret door is located to placate their patron and haven’t
opened it since.
Treasure: While the dead thief has no treasure on him,
the morlocks have left a few valuable offerings strewn

B15. CRYPT 
MODERATE 2
This ﬁve-foot-wide hallway features three alcoves along
each side. Stone sarcophagi stand upright within each.
Belcorra planned to inter her favorite followers
in this small crypt. Due to her high standards and
hard-to-please nature, only one servant ever had the
honor of being buried here—her ﬁrst majordomo.
Creatures: Today, the majordomo exists as a
shadow-like undead who retains her appearance
from life but otherwise functions as
a standard shadow. Her soul
is bound by her loyalty to
Belcorra and Gauntlight’s
necromantic energies. The
majordomo
emerges
from
the central sarcophagus on
the west wall to attack anyone
entering this crypt, but it doesn’t
pursue foes beyond area B15.

the
dungeon’s second level through this
room. Most of the gear and shelving once
stored here has been scavenged for other
projects (most notably Graulgust’s throne).
The stairs beyond the northeastern door lead
down to area C1.
B17. LEVEL TWO PORTAL CHAMBER
The door to this room is locked, and its key is long lost. A
hero can Force it Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics
check or Pick the Lock with three successful DC 20
Thievery checks.
The walls of this octagonal chamber are adorned with
swirling runes carved into the stone and then ﬁlled with
dull, silvery metal. The ﬂoor is polished smooth, as is the
ceiling ten feet above.
Belcorra installed several teleportation circles in
the Abomination Vaults for swift movement between
levels, but over time, their magic has faded. Smaller
teleportation circles, like those at areas A4 and C5, link
to only one area each, but this transit chamber was
linked to several others; by tracing speciﬁc patterns on
the wall runes, someone could transport everyone in
this room to one of nine other portal chambers in the
Abomination Vaults.
The awaken portal ritual required to reactivate
this teleportation circle is recorded in a folio in area
C35. Each linked teleportation circle must each be
individually reactivated with this ritual, though,
before they can be used—the heroes must therefore
physically travel to each portal chamber they want to

XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for reactivating
this portal.
B18. RUINED BOAT LAUNCH
At the north end of this small cave, the mouth of a swampy,
ﬂooded cavern yawns. A few ruined rowboats lie in heaps
on the ﬂoor of this cavern, strewn next to tangled coils of
rope. Remnants of a pulley system hang from the ceiling.
When Belcorra’s servants lived, they used this area to
move supplies from the boathouse (area A16) using a
pulley system to ferry a ﬂoating platform between here
and the pier, but that setup fell into disrepair long ago.
Several swaths of disturbed earth litter the muddy
ﬂoor between this cavern and the ﬂooded cavern to
the north, as though left by the movement of a large,
serpentine creature. A hero who Investigates the tracks
and succeeds at a DC 18 Arcana check to Recall
Knowledge realizes they were left by a drake (on a
critical success, the hero knows it’s a river drake).
B19. FLOODED CAVERN
LOW 2
Tangles of roots hang from the low ceiling of this ﬂooded
cavern, the roof of which is a mere three feet above the
murky water.
During the day, muted sunlight ﬁlters into this
cavern from an exit to the northwest, but even on
rare sunny days, the overhanging pier at area A17 and
dangling roots keep this room dim. The water in the
cavern is, on average, 10 feet deep.
Creatures: A river drake named Freznelkesh
has dwelt in this cavern for nearly two years. She’s
careful to limit her hunting to Fogfen, so no one in
Otari knows she exists. She was out hunting when
the Crook’s Nook thieves
came
through,
but
she
returned soon after and
cut off their easy escape
route (leading to their
eventual capture by
the morlocks).
Freznelkesh is likely
to be sleeping in the
water in the middle
of the cavern, and she
swiftly wakes up if she
hears the splashing of
potential food swimming
above. If reduced to fewer
than 10 Hit Points, she ﬂees
and doesn’t return for a few
days. She pursues foes that ﬂee
into area B18 or out into the
swamp, but she learned the hard
way about the dangerous mold at area
B20 and won’t pursue potential prey there.

B21. PROCESSIONAL
This long, ten-foot-wide hallway has a vaulted ceiling
arching to a dozen feet high. Three broken metal brackets
hang from the ceiling; one to the south, one to the north,
and one in the middle, although what the frames once held
is unclear. The ﬂoor is strewn with pieces of rotten wood
and twisted metal. To the north, pale green light shimmers
around a closed door’s frame.
The empty frames used to house small, swiveling
ballistas on the ceiling that functioned as traps, but
morlocks have scavenged the components. Only
detritus the morlocks deemed worthless remains.
The secret door leading to area B6 is exceptionally
well hidden from this side, its seams all but invisible
cracks in the stone. A hero who succeeds at a DC 28
Perception check while Searching this hall spots it.
The green light shining through the door frame
to area B28 is evidence of Otari’s unquiet spirit. The
morlocks don’t approach this light, as they believe it
to be a sign of the Ghost Queen’s wrath.
B22. WORKSHOP
SEVERE 2
Roll a secret DC 10 Perception check for each hero
before they enter this room to hear the sound of metal
clanging and wood splintering. A hero who speciﬁcally
listens before entering automatically hears the sound.
This long room smells of rust and grime. Stacks of
splintered furniture, pieces of weapons and armor, frayed
coils of rope, jagged shards of metal, and other bits of trash
lie in heaps along the walls of the room. A cold, unlit forge
sits in an alcove to the west. To the north, several heavy
timbers are wedged up against a door to keep it shut.
Removing the timbers from blocking the door to
area B24 is a simple-enough 3-round activity.
Creatures: Two Ghost Queen morlock engineers
toil at assembling a pair of broken ballistas. While
the morlocks have the skill to rebuild the devices, they
keep incorporating dubious improvements that require
restarting their repairs. The engineers quickly realize
they can present intruders to mollify Graulgust’s
frustration at their slow pace. They prefer to use their
junk launchers from a distance for as long as they can.
The morlocks do their best to capture the heroes
alive; if they do, they conﬁscate the heroes’ gear and
throw the heroes in with the thieves in area B24 until
Graulgust tells the morlocks what to do with them.
Graulgust’s offer to the heroes is described in area B12.

B23. WELL
The air here is cool and moist. A low stone well sits to the
east. Armor, weapons, and tools lie in heaps in the north.
This well drops 40 feet down to a large pool of water
in a natural reservoir in area C40 below. Anyone who
leans over the well can attempt a DC 15 Perception
check to hear a strange sound drifting up from
below—splashing combined with what sounds like a
small crowd. These noises come from the gibbering
mouther that lives below, but it remains out of sight
of anyone peering down the well. The rope and bucket
once used to draw water up from below are long
gone, but the metal bracket in the ceiling is sufﬁciently
strong to anchor a rope supporting the heroes.
Treasure: The heap of gear belongs to the prisoners
in area B24. It consists of three suits of studded leather
armor, two rapiers, one broken rapier, three sets of
thieves’ tools, a lesser healing potion, and 13 gp.
B24. PRISON
Alcoves along the walls might once have been storerooms,
but the stone shelves are all empty. The room smells foul.
The foul odor is due to the room’s use as a prison.
Of the four thieves who stole into the dungeon from
Crook’s Nook, only three survive—Gorul Vetters, Shad
Nunder, and Ziskilly Theed. (If you need statistics,

use the prisoner on page 215 of the Gamemastery

malnutrition and fear. Each bears a bird tattoo on the
right shoulder that indicates membership in the Osprey
Club (with a successful DC 16 Society check to Recall
Knowledge, a hero identiﬁes the tattoo’s signiﬁcance).
The thieves recount their harrowing time as the
prisoners of the morlocks if asked and are eager to
be led out of the dungeon. They thankfully accept
their gear (from area B23) if offered but really only
want to return to Otari. If the heroes lead them up to
the surface, the thieves can safely return to Otari on
their own; otherwise, chances are good that a dire fate
meets them. On the other hand, Yinyasmera pays well
for their rescue; see the Side Quest in area A17 on page
32 for details.
B25. CLEANING SUPPLIES
Shelves line the walls of this room, each ﬁlled with tools
used for cleaning or repair work. A silver-headed cane lies
amid a tangle of mops, brooms, and buckets.
The devil in area B27 investigates any noise here.
Treasure: None of these tools are particularly
valuable, but even a brief glance is enough to note
that they’re all clean and in good condition. The cane
hides a silver blade; it’s a low-grade silver sword cane
(Advanced Player’s Guide 248). Any attempt to move
it without a successful DC 16 Thievery check causes
the other tools to clatter noisily to the ﬂoor in a heap.
B26. CLOCKWORK STORAGE
A pair of hulking humanoid objects stands quietly in this
chamber, each covered in a thick layer of dust.
These two clockwork assistants once helped
maintain this level, but both are now broken beyond
any hope of repair.
Treasure: With a successful DC 18 Crafting or
Perception check, a hero identiﬁes eight gemstones
worth 5 gp each used as bearings in the clockworks.
B27. ZOZZLARIN’S ROOM
LOW 2
The walls of this room have been painted, crudely and
almost childishly, to depict a horriﬁc Hellscape of burning
mountains, rusting cities, and tormented souls.
Creatures: Belcorra used several bound devils
as minions and guardians, mostly in lower levels
of the Abomination Vaults. The lesser of the two
devils she assigned to the upper levels is a hapless
zebub named Zozzlarin. A chubby, ﬂy-bodied devil,
Zozzlarin is bound to this level as an eternal janitor.
Zozzlarin is contractually required to spend 18 hours
each day in this room, and he has done his best to paint
the walls to remind him of home. For the other 6 hours
each day, he’s compelled to buzz out into the surrounding
complex to clean and dust. Thanks to Belcorra’s cruel
sense of humor, Zozzlarin is required to spend at least 3
of those hours cleaning the dusty walls and ﬂoors of the
dungeon with his tongue, but to the hopeless zebub, this

indignity is nothing compared to the fact that he has been
forced to live here on the Material Plane for much longer
than his bargain originally required.
The frustrated Zozzlarin is quick to attack the
heroes as a result; the conditions of his imprisonment
allow him to defend the dungeon from above-ground
intruders. If reduced to 10 or fewer Hit Points, though,
the devil begs for his life, offering to share a “special
memory” as a reward.
If the heroes agree, the zebub uses his Infernal Eye
ability to reveal a signiﬁcant event he witnessed many
years ago: Otari’s ﬂight through the dungeon to hide
out in area B28. Zozzlarin doesn’t know this memory’s
signiﬁcance, but it’s the most recent memory he has of
other surface dwellers, so he assumes the heroes are
interested. A successful DC 16 Society or relevant Lore
check is enough for a hero to recognize the famous
adventurer, who was thought to have been killed long
ago in the clash against Belcorra.

B28. HAUNTED WASHROOM
This ten-foot-square washroom features an iron bathing tub
to the north and a commode to the southwest. The northern
wall glows and shimmers with rippling ribbons of eerie
green light.
When Otari Ilvashti became trapped in the
Abomination Vaults, he did his best to ﬁnd an escape
route. Unfortunately, at that time, many of Belcorra’s
dangerous minions still guarded much of this level.
He made it to this room only to collapse from his
wounds. Fortunately, Belcorra’s death had thrown the
dungeon into chaos, and he wasn’t discovered. When
Otari woke some time later, no longer on the edge of
death from his ordeal, he crept out of the room and
made his way west through area B31 and eventually to
B20, only to be confronted by an angry and oversized
chuul. He discovered the secret door in area B32 and
ﬂed deeper instead.
When Otari ﬁnally died in area D18, his soul
remained as a ghost, and the three locations where
he hid during his ﬁnal days became infused with
desperate echoes of his spirit. These echoes provide a
trail to his remains.
The ghostly energies react to the presence of the
heroes. The ﬁrst time the heroes see the glowing
energy, it slithers into letters to read, “I was Otari...
save me from below!” A moment later, the words
slide off the wall and form a green ribbon of light that
slithers across the ﬂoor like a serpent with a speed of
20 feet. The heroes can follow this ribbon, which lasts
for only minutes, to area B32, where it slips under the
secret door and fades away. The next clue of Otari’s
path is in area C3.
This spectral manifestation can appear once per day.
B29. HALL OF HATRED
LOW 2
Several wide alcoves adorn the walls of this L-shaped
hallway. Each alcove contains a small diorama of the same
city facing diﬀerent perils—a massive ﬁre, a devastating
tsunami, a thunderous earthquake, an attack by an
enormous tentacled monster, and an invasion of an army
of undead.
Each of the scenes in the alcoves depict the city of
Absalom in a different fanciful doom from Belcorra’s
imagination. The stone dioramas are enhanced with

A tiny Gauntlight, as though miles distant, sits at the
edge of each scene. A hero who succeeds at a DC 16
Religion check while studying the last diorama notes
that the undead are rising from Absalom’s graves as
Gauntlight’s beam shines upon them.
Hazards: In addition to displaying some of her
fantasies about Absalom’s destruction, Belcorra had
Volluk rig several traps in the hall to punish intruders.
One trap is linked to each diorama (see the map on
page 36).

B30. WAR ROOM
SEVERE 2
This large, low-ceiling room has a cross-shaped table at its
center. Ten chairs stand around the table. The walls, ﬂoors,
and ceilings of the chamber are completely covered with
thick layers of webbing.
Belcorra once held meetings with her most valued
advisors, minions, and conjured allies in this room,
usually to plan out her never-realized but oft-imagined
assaults on Absalom. The table in the center displays
an illusory map of the city of Absalom as it appeared
hundreds of years ago, during Belcorra’s life, to aid
in her plans, but the spiderwebs in this room obscure
this illusion.
Creatures: Several years ago, a web lurker named
Mimnivix came to this room after entering the dungeon
from the swamp. He found the illusory city a delight and
fancied himself the “King of the Ghost City,” making
the room his lair. After being damaged by a trap in the
outer hall, Mimnivix has taken to clambering along the
upper reaches of the hall to avoid stepping in front of
the traps as he comes and goes on hunting trips, timing
them for the hours the river drake is out of her lair at
area B19.
When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, the web lurker is
squatting atop the table, delighting in yet another
examination of his web-caked city. He rises up to full
height upon spotting the heroes and, in Aklo, greets
them by commanding, “Bow down before the King
of the Ghost City and present your offerings!”
Mimnivix’s inﬂated ego leaves him expecting any
visitors to be potential supplicants bearing gifts,
and if the heroes don’t offer him gifts (of any
sort), he hisses in frustration and attacks. If the
heroes actually do so, Mimnivix is so startled by
his own authority that he’s momentarily silent. He
makes further demands of the heroes to give more
offerings, polish his claws, and so forth until he
tires of their obsequiousness and simply attacks
them. He calls his hidden dream spider minions
out to ambush the heroes and does his best to
lure the heroes into one of his two web traps.
Mimnivix ﬁghts to the death.

shiny rocks, bits of glass worn smooth by the surf,
or neat seashells. Among the clutter is a mesmerizing
opal, ﬁve shining sling bullets, and a type I necklace
of ﬁreballs. The cache is visible to anyone who looks
under the table, as the magic sling bullets glow faintly
through the webbing holding them in place.
B31. RECEPTION ROOM
LOW 2
A ruined table and several destroyed chairs lie in a heap
in the middle of this room, along with several large bones.
If the heroes are following the ghostly trail left by
Otari from area B28, they’ll see this trail dance and
ﬂicker around the center of the room where a minotaur’s
skeleton is entangled with the ruined furniture. Otari
encountered the guardian here and killed it before
moving on. Unfortunately, the necromantic inﬂuence of
Gauntlight has animated these remains.
Creatures: As the heroes enter the room, the bones
shudder and pull together. This takes 1 round, so
swift characters can exit the room before the bones
assemble, at which time they fall back into place. If the
minotaur skeleton completely rebuilds itself, it pulls
its rusty glaive from the wreckage and ﬁghts until
destroyed—but it doesn’t pursue foes from this room.

B32. SECRET STAIRS
The heroes can spot the secret door at the top of
these stairs with a successful DC 18 Perception check.
The secret door opens when the rise on the top step
is pushed a certain way. The stairs beyond the secret
door lead down to area C10.
B33. PUNISHMENT ROOM
Broken-down torture instruments lie in half-collapsed
heaps on the ﬂoor here. To the north slumps a ruined
stretching rack, while to the south a pillory lies fallen on
the ﬂoor. Rusty tongs and chains, frayed and rotten whips,
and other implements lie on tottering shelves.
Belcorra used this room to punish insolent servants
or when she was bored and needed something to
distract her. Little of use remains here, but a hero
Searching this room who succeeds at a DC 18
Perception check ﬁnds the secret door to the south,
which opens when a rusted ring on the wall is pulled
down sharply.
B34. ELEVATOR DOWN
A hero Searching this dead end spots the secret door
with a successful DC 18 Perception check. Two wall
stones, pushed in unison, cause it to swing open.
This plain, circular room is empty. A single image of a
moss-caked skull adorns the eastern wall.
The ﬂoor of this room is a magical elevator that
links to area C22 below. If a creature touches the image
of the mossy skull—Nhimbaloth’s symbol—while the
secret door is closed, the ﬂoor slowly descends 30 feet
with a grinding noise. Doors slide up into view to the
north and south.
If the secret door is opened while the elevator is in
area C22, this room is a 30-foot-deep pit.
B35. GAUNTLIGHT BASEMENT
If the heroes manage to enter this room before Gauntlight
activates at the beginning of this chapter, then the artifact
is already empowered; no ribbon of ghostly energy is
currently present, and you should amend the following
read-aloud text accordingly. After Gauntlight activates, it
needs to recharge, so the ribbon of energy returns.
The walls of this circular room are smooth and gray. A ribbon
of pale blue light coils and slithers through the air, connecting
the ﬂoor at the center of the room to the ceiling ﬁfteen feet
above. The points where this light touches the stone above
and below seethe and writhe, as if the stone itself were
suﬀering from an infection. The desiccated remains of an
enormous worm lie slumped around the ribbon, forming a
crescent of shriveled and tattered purple ﬂesh.
One of Belcorra’s favorite pets dwelt in this room, a
purple worm she transported into the chamber from the
Darklands. For all the creature’s bestial power, it was
entirely dependent on Belcorra for sustenance, as the
keep’s walls are indestructible. After Belcorra’s death,
the worm starved to death.
The ribbon of ghostly light is a manifestation of
Gauntlight’s mounting power. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn within it takes 2d6
negative damage (DC 16 basic Reﬂex save), and
undead creatures regain HP of the same amount.
As long as Gauntlight remains at its low-level
activation, the light keeps churning, but if the heroes
rescue Lasda Venkervale from area D9, it winks out.
Treasure: A hero who digs into the dried worm’s
carcass ﬁnds the remains of its last meal: a duergar
skeleton still clutching a +1 warhammer that didn’t
help him cut his way out of the worm’s gut.

CHAPTER 3:
Cult of the Canker
The third level of the Abomination Vaults once served
as Belcorra’s sprawling library and rooms related to
research. The servants and librarians once employed
here have become dangerous undead creatures.
Library Features
Belcorra’s library is unlit except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are 8 feet high in halls and 10 feet
high in rooms, although the largest rooms and halls
have vaulted ceilings that rise to 12 feet high. Doors
are made of wood, and many are marked with signs
(described in area C11) to help scholars ﬁnd their way.
The Cult of the Canker is the most widespread
faction active in the library. Originally a collection
of librarians, caretakers, and scribes, this loyal staff
stubbornly kept working after Belcorra died, focusing
their research on ﬁnding a way to restore their leader to
life. When food stores ran low, rather than risk alerting
the Roseguard by making potentially public forays to
the surface, the researchers turned to cannibalism.
There were plenty of other servants to eat, after all, in
the conveniently nearby servants’ quarters. The onset
of ghoul fever tore quickly through their ranks, but the
researchers were so obsessed that they barely noticed.
The scholars’ research now has a distinctly ghoulish
bent: they work to gather enough “cankerous ﬂesh”
to fuel Belcorra’s full resurrection. The fact that the
ghouls’ hunger often compels them to feed on the
ﬂesh they’re trying to collect has certainly slowed their
progress, but it hasn’t slowed their zeal.
The map of the library level appears on page 54.
C1. VISITOR’S READING ROOM 
TRIVIAL 3
This large, cross-shaped chamber contains several long
couches, the leather cushions that once adorned them
cracked with age. Dead plants lie slumped in planter
boxes along the walls, and a long-dry fountain depicting a
lighthouse stands in the middle of the room.
Belcorra didn’t allow visitors into her library except in
this room and the reading rooms to the north. A librarian
would fetch texts for visitors to peruse in comfort. The
fountain and plants here have long since dried up.
