CHAPTER 3:
Cult of the Canker
The third level of the Abomination Vaults once served
as Belcorra’s sprawling library and rooms related to
research. The servants and librarians once employed
here have become dangerous undead creatures.
Library Features
Belcorra’s library is unlit except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are 8 feet high in halls and 10 feet
high in rooms, although the largest rooms and halls
have vaulted ceilings that rise to 12 feet high. Doors
are made of wood, and many are marked with signs
(described in area C11) to help scholars ﬁnd their way.
The Cult of the Canker is the most widespread
faction active in the library. Originally a collection
of librarians, caretakers, and scribes, this loyal staff
stubbornly kept working after Belcorra died, focusing
their research on ﬁnding a way to restore their leader to
life. When food stores ran low, rather than risk alerting
the Roseguard by making potentially public forays to
the surface, the researchers turned to cannibalism.
There were plenty of other servants to eat, after all, in
the conveniently nearby servants’ quarters. The onset
of ghoul fever tore quickly through their ranks, but the
researchers were so obsessed that they barely noticed.
The scholars’ research now has a distinctly ghoulish
bent: they work to gather enough “cankerous ﬂesh”
to fuel Belcorra’s full resurrection. The fact that the
ghouls’ hunger often compels them to feed on the
ﬂesh they’re trying to collect has certainly slowed their
progress, but it hasn’t slowed their zeal.
The map of the library level appears on page 54.
C1. VISITOR’S READING ROOM
TRIVIAL 3
This large, cross-shaped chamber contains several long
couches, the leather cushions that once adorned them
cracked with age. Dead plants lie slumped in planter
boxes along the walls, and a long-dry fountain depicting a
lighthouse stands in the middle of the room.
Belcorra didn’t allow visitors into her library except in
this room and the reading rooms to the north. A librarian
would fetch texts for visitors to peruse in comfort. The
fountain and plants here have long since dried up.

The stairs beyond the east door lead up to area B16.
Heroes can discover the secret door to the south
with a successful DC 27 Perception check. It’s
concealed behind a heavy sofa.
Creatures: A unique undead creature
dwells here. Augrael is a morlock ghoul
exiled by his living kin among the Ghost
Queen morlocks above, just as he’s reviled
by the ghouls of the Cult of the Canker who
occupy this level. As he hasn’t been steeped
in the maliciousness or fervor of either
group, Augrael is quite calm and collected.
When the heroes arrive, he greets them
cordially but cautiously.
Augrael wants only to dwell
within these dungeons, reading
and feeding on undead ﬂesh—
he has little taste for ﬂesh
that was merely once living.
He has hazy recollections of
how he and the other Ghost
Queen morlocks came up
from below and fought the
ghouls, as the ghoul fever
he contracted fragmented his memories. He knows the
rough layout of areas C1, C6, C10, C11, C15, and C33,
as his memories of these rooms are freshest.
Augrael’s initial attitude to the heroes is indifferent,
but it becomes friendly if the heroes prove that
Augrael’s chief rival among the morlocks, Graulgust,
is dead. The heroes can convince Augrael to
accompany them with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy
check to Request his aid (for 1 day on a success; 1
week on a critical success) or with a successful DC
20 Intimidation check to Coerce him (for 1 day on
a success; he attacks in a rage on a critical failure).
He won’t leave this level under any circumstances.
Augrael’s propensity to glut himself on ghouls the
heroes defeat is both off-putting and macabre.

C2. TUNNEL TO OTARI
Belcorra’s pet purple worm dug this long tunnel for
visitors who didn’t want to travel overland. The
passage leads under the Fogfen to the Stonescale
kobold warrens beneath Otari (which connect to other
Darklands passages). If you’ve run the “Menace Under
Otari” adventure in the Pathﬁnder Beginner Box, this
passage connects to area 15 beneath the Otari Fishery.
The secret door to area C1 is easier to ﬁnd from this
side—it’s a smooth section of a natural passage. A hero
identiﬁes it with a successful DC 16 Perception check.
C3. HAUNTED READING ROOM
The cracks around the edge of this door glow faintly
with greenish light, like the door to area B28.
An ancient, tattered sofa sits against the east wall of this
room. The south wall shimmers with strange green light.

This private reading room was the second room in which Otari Ilvashti
sought shelter in his desperate ﬁnal days. As in area B28, his ghost’s energy
lingers here. When the heroes enter this room, the green light forms the
message, “Belcorra fell to the Roseguard, but we never knew of these
vaults below...”
A moment later, the words slide off the wall and slither away. If the
heroes follow, the ribbon creeps back up to area C6 and then past the
stairs at area C10. Here, the ribbon hesitantly climbs the northern stair
only to turn around and quickly slither further east. The ghostly light
enters area C11, curls onward to C33, and then through the eastern door
and down the stairs before fading. The heroes can pick up the ﬁnal clue of
Otari’s path in area D16.
This spectral manifestation can appear once per day.
C4. NOT-SO-PRIVATE READING ROOM
LOW 3
An ancient sofa with its covering torn open and its stuﬃng and springs revealed
sits against the west wall of this room.
This reading room contains much more than meets the eye. Secret doors
in the north and south walls (either of which can be found with a successful
DC 23 Perception check) open into a hidden hall around the room (area
C5). A search of the wall above the couch (and another successful DC 23
Perception check) reveals a hidden peephole into this room. If Belcorra
deemed a visitor too dangerous, her forces would ambush the visitor and
bring them through a teleportation circle in area C5b to be imprisoned in
area D11.
Hazard: The ﬁnal victim of this room, a spy from Absalom whose
intelligence had already brought Belcorra’s activities to the attention of
the Roseguard, met his end here. When he put up a ﬁght and Belcorra
tried to subdue him, she accidentally killed him instead. The spirit of the
paranoid spy lingers on.

save, with the following results. An eerie red eye then opens in the center of the
western wall, looking about the room, and the haunt rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature becomes frightened 1 and feels like someone or
something is watching them for as long as they remain frightened.
CHAPTER 3 SYNOPSIS
Belcorra’s sprawling library has
been transformed from a store
of necromantic knowledge into a
stronghold for a cult of ghouls. The
heroes can not only eliminate this
vile cult but also uncover signiﬁcant
information about Belcorra’s
interests and plans.
Environmental Cues: books in
untidy stacks, dust, looming shelves,
musty mold, ruined tools and
furniture, sounds of ﬂipping pages,
stink as of something rotting in a
hidden corner, stuﬀy air.
CHAPTER 3 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable
items available as treasure in
Chapter 3 are as follows.
•	 +1 chain shirt
•	 +1 low-grade silver hatchet
•	 +1 striking pick
•	 barkskin potion
•	 crafter’s eyepiece
•	 everburning torch
•	 lesser bravo’s brew
•	 lesser healing potion
•	 moderate skeptic’s elixir (page 214)
•	 scroll of hypercognition
•	 scroll of mending

Failure The creature becomes frightened 2 and treats no
one as an ally as long as they remain frightened.
Critical Failure The creature becomes frightened 3 and
is confused as long as they remain frightened.
Routine (1 action) The eye glances about, and those it
can see (whether in area C4 or outside of it) take 4d6
mental damage (DC 21 basic Will save) as fears of being
watched impart ripples of pain. A creature that takes
mental damage from this eﬀect doesn’t reduce their
frightened value at the end of their next turn.
Reset The haunt becomes inert at the end of any round
in which there are no frightened creatures it can see.
It stays dormant for 1 hour, after which point it resets.
C5. SPYING HALL
This plain, angled hall has four alcoves. Each western alcove
has a silvery circle of runes inlaid on the ﬂoor. A peephole
in the eastern wall allows observation of the room beyond.
In addition to once giving Belcorra a place to spy
upon visitors in area C4, the western alcoves formed
a limited teleportation hub independent of the portal
chambers. Neither alcove is currently active.
The northwestern alcove (area C5a) once teleported
anyone entering it to the hidden alcove in area A4,
and vice-versa. Since that room was scoured clean
of its silver and defaced long ago by a determined
treasure-hunter, it can’t be restored. The southwestern
alcove (area C5b) once teleported anyone entering
it to the silver-lined cage in area D11. This was a
one‑way teleportation used to capture prisoners. This
teleportation circle can be reactivated by the awaken
portal ritual found in area C35, so long as that ritual is
performed at both ends (that is, here and in area D11).
Both secret doors are obvious from this side.
C6. GUARD ROOM
LOW 3
Thick clouds of white mist ﬁll this room entirely, making it
diﬃcult to discern any details.
The creature dwelling here generates this mist. The
secret door in the west wall can be discovered with a
successful DC 18 Perception check.
Creatures: Belcorra originally bound a trio of eerie,
octopean water elementals called mist stalkers into
this room to serve as guardians. Otari killed two of
them years ago, but one remains. The monster can see
through the mist it generates with ease, and as soon
as it identiﬁes intruders, it solidiﬁes the mist and then
moves to attack, ﬁghting until destroyed. It pursues
foes that ﬂee, but it doesn’t leave sight of this room.
MIST STALKER
CREATURE 4
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 114
Initiative Perception +13
Treasure: The secret alcove to the west once served
as an emergency cache of supplies for the guards on
this ﬂoor. Most of the supplies were raided during the
chaos following Belcorra’s death, but a few items of
use remain, including two lesser bravo’s brews, two
lesser healing potions, a moderate skeptic’s elixir (page
214), and a barkskin potion.
C7. STAIRS UP
These stairs ascend to area B5.
C8. KORLOK’S POST
MODERATE 3
The walls of this empty room are decorated with hundreds
upon hundreds of tiny little hash marks, as if someone had
been counting days for ages. To the northwest, an iron door
with a barred window sits in the wall, a large but open
padlock hanging from the door’s latch.
Creatures: The second of the two devils Belcorra
stationed on the upper levels of the Abomination
Vaults stands guard here. The barbazu Korlok takes
his post literally, and without any new orders from
Belcorra over the past several centuries, he’s remained
here patiently under her ﬁnal command to “wait here
and let no one out until I come for you.”
She never did.
This isn’t the longest posting that Korlok has served,
but it’s already starting to grate on his patience. If the
heroes enter the room, he stands at attention and in a
slightly bored voice informs them that, as intruders,
they are under arrest and should hand over their gear
before stepping into the adjoining prison. He ﬁghts to
the death if attacked or if any hero attempts to leave
(this gives him an excuse to leave the room).
KORLOK
CREATURE 5
Male barbazu (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 88)
Initiative Perception +13
Side Quest: The devil is patient and willing to speak
to the heroes for a few minutes if they wish. His initial
attitude to the heroes is indifferent, but if they can
improve this attitude (most likely with a successful DC
21 Diplomacy check to Make an Impression, but you
might decide that other checks—such as a Deception
check to Impersonate or to Lie—also appease Korlok),
Korlok admits his frustration. He knows Belcorra is
dead, but without access to his contract, he can’t study

it for a loophole. He suggests a trade—he’ll let the
heroes go just this once, but the next time they return,
he’ll arrest them if they don’t present him with his
contract. He isn’t sure where the paper is stored but
suspects it’s hidden somewhere in the library.
If the heroes present the contract, Korlok studies it
and discovers that his service was meant to end if 99
weeks and 99 days passed without a new order from
Belcorra. Before he vanishes back to Hell, the thankful
devil explains that he knows of other devils in the
Abomination Vaults: a zebub janitor on the level above
and a contract devil named Urevian on a lower level
(page 134). Korlok has nothing but scorn for the zebub,
but he says that Urevian is shrewd but well-known for
keeping his word.
C9. PRISON
An overturned chamber pot lies next to a rectangular patch
of fungus that might have once been a mattress in the corner
of this room. A skeleton is just visible within the fungus.
The skeleton is all that remains of Belcorra’s ﬁrst
chef, a hapless man who had the misfortune of
over‑spicing a meal. Perhaps due to some lingering
effect of the fastidious chef’s spirit, the fungus here is
not only edible but rather tasty.
C10. TWIN STAIRWELLS
This hallway is a landing for two staircases: one leading
up to area B2 in the north and one leading up to area
B32 in the south. Splintered, rotten wood lies scattered
around this hall, left over during the morlocks’ ﬂight
from this level.
C11. MAIN LIBRARY
MODERATE 3
Hundreds of stone shelves are carved into the
walls of this ﬁfteen-foot-wide hallway. While
there are many gaps in the collection, a staggering
number of books, scrolls, and folios remain. Signs
hang above several doors oﬀ of this hall. A faint,
blue glow ﬂickers beneath a sign to the south.
The books kept here cover a wide range of
subjects, and the Cult of the Canker keep the
stacks organized. A hero with the luxury of
pursuing these tomes for 8 hours learns the
library’s organization and gains a +1 item
bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge
on regional history, arcane topics, or
occult topics when using the Investigate
exploration activity here.
The signs here are all in Undercommon. The one
above area C15 to the south reads, “Reading Room.”
The ones over the smaller doors are labeled as follows:
area C12 is “Repair Storage,” area C13 is “Workroom,”

area C17 is “Safety” with a carving of leaping
ﬂames, area C18 is “Personal Quarters,” area C19 is
“Scrivener’s Ofﬁce,” area C26 is “Belcorra’s Ofﬁce,”
the hallway leading to areas C30 to C32 is “North
Wing,” and area C33 is “Restricted Collection.”
Creatures: Four ghouls all dressed in long, pale‑blue
robes work here, both to stand guard and to select or
retrieve books for the scriveners or cult leaders to use
or repair as needed. They don’t immediately attack the
heroes but do lick their lips in anticipation as they size
up their ﬂeshy bits. One ghoul asks the party if they’re
here to “donate ﬂesh for the Canker,” hoping to ﬁnd
out if the heroes are willing to offer body parts to the
work in area C34. A hero foolish enough to agree is
expected to lop off an appendage (a ﬁnger, toe, or ear
sufﬁces) for the ghouls, who scurry off to area C34
with the donation. Any other attempt to interact with
the ghouls quickly makes them impatient and they
attack. These ghouls ﬁght until destroyed.
If a ﬁght here last more than 4 rounds or is unusually
loud, the ghouls in area C15 come to investigate.
GHOULS (4)
CREATURE 1
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 169
Initiative Perception +7
Side Quest: A hero who knows Morlibint of Odd
Stories in Otari (or any hero who makes a successful
DC 14 Society check to Recall Knowledge when seeing
these books) realizes that Morlibint would likely be
interested in this collection. If a hero tells Morlibint
about the library here, the wizard eagerly provides a
long list of speciﬁc titles, publishers, and general themes
to seek in the shelves. In this area’s Treasure section,
along with those of other book-ﬁlled rooms nearby, the
number of books that can be salvaged and collected
for Morlibint are given a Bulk rating. A hero searching
for books in one of these rooms can attempt a DC 18
Perception check to sort through the books and, on a
success, secure 1 Bulk from the room’s total available
book Bulk (or 2 Bulk on a critical success). Morlibint
pays 5 gp per Bulk delivered to him in this way.
Treasure: The books kept here are of general
knowledge and thus little interest to Morlibint; there
are only 2 Bulk of books here to gather for him.
XP Award: If the heroes deliver at least 12 Bulk of
books to Morlibint, they complete the side quest. They
can still sell him more books, if they ﬁnd any.
C12. REPAIR MATERIALS
Shelves on the wall here contain iron sorting racks, jars,
and all manner of bookbinding tools.
Treasure: This room contains repair materials for
the upkeep of books. All are too old to be useful. A
hero Searching this room discovers two 2nd-level
scrolls of mending and a scroll of hypercognition.
C13. LIBRARIAN’S WORKROOM
MODERATE 3
The door to this room from area C11 is locked, and
its key is inside the room. A hero can Pick the Lock
with three successful DC 20 Thievery checks or Force
it Open with a successful DC 20 Athletics check, but
a failed Athletics check alerts the ghost in the room.
Three worktables line the walls of this room with a single
stool near one of the tables. A skeleton wearing a light blue
librarian’s robe lies in a heap beside the stool.
Three specialized benches here are outﬁtted to
bind books, repair pages, and prepare parchment,
respectively. The tables and tools are old and useless.
Creatures: The ghost of the librarian Jarelle Kaldrian
still haunts this workroom. Jarelle couldn’t escape the
other scholars’ increasingly gruesome schemes, so she
retreated into this room, locked the door, and drank a
jar of arsenic (used to work with book bindings) rather
than be eaten alive. She died quickly and in agony, only
to rise soon thereafter as a ghost. Jarelle spends her
time pantomiming the act of repairing books.
Jarelle is suspicious of the heroes but not
immediately hostile unless they show aggression,
though she becomes irate and attacks if they speak ill
of Belcorra. If the heroes choose to talk to her rather
than ﬁght, they can see that she seems drawn to her
tools and equipment, as if by a compulsion to reenact
her life’s work.

adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same eﬀect as
the possession spell (with a spell DC of 22), except since
Jarelle doesn’t have a physical body, she’s unaﬀected by
that restriction of the spell.
Poisoned Breath ʚʖ (divine, necromancy, poison) Jarelle
exhales a 15-foot cone of toxic mist that deals 5d6
poison damage (DC 22 basic Fortitude save; on a critical
failure, the target is also enfeebled 1 for 24 hours). She
then can’t use Poisoned Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
XP Award: If the heroes put Jarelle’s spirit to rest
without ﬁghting her, award them XP as if they’d
defeated her in combat.
Treasure: A search of Jarelle’s remains turns up the
key to the door to area C11, a gold paperweight worth
10 gp, and a crafter’s eyepiece.
C14. LIBRARIAN’S BEDROOM
A small, cramped bed is wedged awkwardly into this room,
as the walls are lined with sagging bookshelves.
Jarelle once lived here before she took her life in
area C13. The books she kept here were mostly
duplicates of others found elsewhere in the library, but
she viewed them as her private collection.
Treasure: There are 2 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint.
C15. GAUNTLIGHT READING ROOM
MODERATE 3
This chamber’s smooth stone walls glisten with moisture
despite the air being dry and somewhat stuﬀy. Several low
divans are arranged in a circle and interspersed with low
tables stacked with a few books and rotting morsels of
decayed ﬂesh. A twisting ribbon of pale blue light stretches
between the bare ﬂoor at the room’s center and the ceiling
above, its points of contact sending creepers of what looks
like infected tissue out in a distorted spiral for a few feet.
As in area B35, the ribbon of sickly light is a
manifestation of Gauntlight’s growing power. This
room once served as a reading room for library
staff, as well as a place where they could directly
evaluate Gauntlight’s energies. This eerie light churns
in a 5-foot-diameter burst at the room’s center. Any
living creature ending its turn in it takes 4d6 negative
damage (DC 18 basic Reﬂex save), and undead
creatures regain the same amount in Hit Points. As
long as Gauntlight remains at its low-level activation,
the ribbon of light continues to churn, but if the heroes
rescue Lasda Venkervale from his captivity area D9,
the ribbon winks out.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check
while Searching this room spots the secret door to area
C16 in the curved western wall.
Creatures: Today, Cult of the Canker ghouls relax
here with books and snacks. Ripened morlock ﬂesh has
been a staple of their diets lately, but the ghouls and the
cultist who commands them decide to add adventurer
ﬂesh to the menu once they spot the heroes. As they ﬁght,
any ghoul brought below half its Hit Points moves into
the ribbon of light to gain some necromantic healing,
Shoving a rival ghoul out of the way if necessary.

The walls of this circular chamber are decorated with
intricate, intertwining runes and shapes carved into deep
into the stone and ﬁlled with dull, silvery metal. The ﬂoor
and ceiling are polished to a
reﬂective sheen.
This room contains an inert
teleportation circle like the one

this teleportation circle must be reactivated
with the awaken portal ritual in area C35
before it can be used.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for

C17. FIREFIGHTING SUPPLIES
Several buckets of sand and a number of large barrels
crowd this cramped storeroom. A simple wooden case
with a closed lid is attached to the back of the door.
The supplies kept here are available to extinguish
ﬁres, a signiﬁcant threat in any library. The barrels
once held water but now contain only mildew.
Treasure: The case on the door is latched and holds
a wand of quench (Advanced Player’s Guide 223).
C18. TEMPORARY BUNKS
LOW 3
Three plain beds have been awkwardly stacked against the
west wall of this room, leaving room for a single low table

While most servants who toiled in the library kept
quarters aboveground, some needed rest during long
stretches of research. The ghouls don’t need the beds
and simply stacked them out of the way.
Creatures: This room now serves as a dining room
for three ghouls who are feasting on the remains of a
morlock. They attack the heroes on sight, but the ﬁrst
one injured tries to ﬂee to area C19 to recruit Aller

of tiny swatches of skinned ﬂesh marked with tattoos.
Judging by the workspace on the table in the middle of the
room, these tattoos have been placed postmortem, with
a swath of pale skin stretched over the desk sporting a
half‑completed image of a sinister woman.
Creatures: Aller Rosk served as a notary and scribe
for Belcorra when he lived, but after he died and
became a ghoul, his nature and interests shifted, if only
slightly. He’s developed a unique taste for tattooed
ﬂesh. The idea of writing something down and then
eating it appeals to the twisted ghoul, and when he isn’t
preparing a less-than-fresh morlock for distribution to
the other ghouls, he’s here, preparing his latest work
on a swath of morlock skin. His current project is a
depiction of Belcorra. While he doesn’t intend to eat
this one, some part of him knows that this work of art,
once complete, won’t have a fate any different than the
numerous others he’s created over the years.
Aller is focused on his work and takes a –2 penalty
to initiative checks. If interrupted,
he seethes and curses, wasting
an action each round for
the ﬁrst 2 rounds voicing his
displeasure and informing the
heroes about the blasphemous
limericks and humiliating odes he’ll
be tattooing onto their corpses once
he’s defeated them. Single‑minded
to a fault, Aller Rosk pursues foes
relentlessly once a ﬁght begins and
ﬁghts until he is destroyed.

C20. SCRIVENER’S OFFICE
The desk in this oﬃce has been repurposed into a messy
butcher’s block. A shiny silver hatchet is wedged
in the top of the desk, and bits of decaying
pale ﬂesh lie strewn about the room.
Aller has repurposed this ofﬁce into
a makeshift butcher’s shop. Of course,
there’s little artistry that goes into the
preparation of a morlock body for
ghouls to eat, other than a few quick
and brutal hacks with a hatchet.
Treasure: The hatchet is a +1
low-grade silver hatchet.
C21. FOOD STORAGE
The heaps of slowly decaying bodies
hung and stacked here reveal this former
bedroom’s current use as a meat locker.
Five dead morlocks are stored here,
their ﬂesh decomposing (aging, to the
ghoul palate) somewhat slowly in the
chilly room. There’s nothing of interest
in here, but the ﬁlthy conditions
expose any hero who Searches the room
to blueblisters, a disease arising from an
uncommon ﬂesh-eating bacteria. Ghouls ﬁnd
ﬂesh infected with blueblisters to be quite savory. A
hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Medicine or Nature
check realizes the danger these infected bodies pose
before Searching the room.

C22. ELEVATOR UP
The doors to this room open onto solid stone if the
magical elevator beyond is still up at area B34.
This plain, circular room is empty. An image of a moss‑caked
skull adorns the eastern wall.
The ﬂoor of this room is a magical elevator that links
to area B34 above. If a creature touches Nhimbaloth’s
symbol, the ﬂoor gradually ascends 30 feet. (If the
heroes aren’t aware of the secret door in area B34, they
might not realize this dead end leads anywhere.) It
isn’t possible to crush anything in the elevator shaft; if
anything gets in the way of the elevator’s ascent, such
as an item stuck in the doorway to the north or south,
the elevator simply descends again.
C23. GHOUL GARDEN
LOW 3
A large mound of dark-gray soil lies heaped in the southern
half of this room.
The ghouls have converted this ofﬁce into a garden
by hauling in mounds of swampy soil from the surface.
Creatures: The ghouls have cultivated a pair of
violet fungi here, both as a method to “ﬂash season”
ﬂesh and to serve as guardians. The fungi aren’t yet
fully grown but are still dangerous to non-ghouls (the
fungi have been trained to a rudimentary degree, and
they don’t lash out at their undead gardeners).

C24. CANKER SHRINE
MODERATE 3
Whatever this room’s original use, today it serves as a
horriﬁc shrine. A rotting heap of ﬂeshy material that seems
to be composed of equal parts eyes, mouths, and skin lies
in a stinking mound in the middle of the room, surrounded
by two dozen tiny humanoid eﬃgies crafted out of small
bones and tangles of knotted hair.
The mound of ﬂesh is a slowly decaying gibbering
mouther—a creature the ghouls revere as “pure ﬂesh.”
The efﬁgies arranged around it are representations
of each ghoul in the cult. The smell in this room is
particularly foul. A living creature must succeed at
a DC 18 Fortitude save when it starts its turn in the
room or become sickened 1. On a success, the creature
is temporarily immune to the smell here for 24 hours.
Creatures: Two cultists of the Canker are worshiping
here, and they become irate if their venerations are
interrupted. A hero identiﬁes the cultists’ reverence
for the dead gibbering mouther on any successful DC
20 Religion check to identify them, in addition to any
other information gained. Any attack against the dead
gibbering mouther—intentional or otherwise—shocks
the cultists, causing them to become slowed 1 for 1
round, but it also causes them to focus all their attacks
on the blasphemer. They ﬁght until destroyed.

C25. WASHROOM
This bathroom’s commode and tub are caked with dust.
It’s perhaps a blessing that the ghouls have no use
for this room. In fact, they rarely ever look in here, so
stealthy heroes might use it to hide out in the middle
of the ghouls’ territory.
C26. BELCORRA’S OFFICE
This oﬃce is brightly lit by several glowing lights in a
chandelier hanging above a desk and chair. Mirrors hang
on the north and south wall, although both of them are
badly cracked.
The light in this chamber isn’t particularly harmful
to ghouls, but the cult of the Canker doesn’t ﬁnd the
lighting pleasant—further, they view this area and the
rooms beyond as the private domain of their patron,
Belcorra, and out of respect for her on the day of her
return, they’ve left this room and those beyond it
untouched. If they discover the heroes have entered the
area, though, the surviving ghouls pursue them in here
with a righteous fury—as long as any heroes are in
here, Cult of the Canker ghouls gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to attack rolls against them.
The western door is locked, and the lock plate is
engraved with a stylized open book. This decoration
matches the image on one of the keys in area A13.

The keyhole is large enough to look through, but it’s
impossible to see anything in the room other than to
identify that the room is also brightly lit.
Treasure: The chandelier’s bright light comes from
an everburning torch socketed into its center. When
socketed, it reﬂects through many pretty (but valueless)
chunks of glass.
C27. BELCORRA’S READING ROOM
MODERATE 3
The door to this room from area C26 is locked with an
oversized lock; its key is on the key ring in area A13.
A hero can Pick the Lock with three successful DC 18
Thievery checks or Force it Open with a successful DC
22 Athletics check, but a failed Athletics check alerts
the fey reading here to the presence of intruders.
This room looks exceptionally comfortable with a thick
carpet, bright light from a glowing chandelier, and
soothing incense. Two overstuﬀed chairs sit opposite a
low table stacked with books, while more books sit on
a set of shelves to the west. A softly gurgling fountain
carved to resemble a mossy skull leaking water sits in the
northwest corner.
This room once served as a private and comfortable
place for Belcorra to relax and read, with minor
magical trappings like the scent of incense, the
bubbling of the fountain, and the bright light working
together to afford a pleasant reading experience.
Most of the books here concern topics of sacriﬁce,
incorporeal undead, and extinguishing living bodies
and souls to create powerful magic items. Other books
are tales (often ﬁctionalized) of famous hauntings
throughout the Inner Sea region. The books are quite
old but are well preserved. They can be used just like
the books in area C11 to aid in Investigation on these
topics, providing a +1 item bonus.
Heroes Searching this room discover an iron key
bearing a defaced symbol of Aroden between two
chair cushions. The key unlocks the door to area C30.
Creatures: The room’s comforts are wasted on the
current occupant, a lurker in light named Shimmergrin
who recently slipped into the brightly lit room to satisfy
their own curiosity. The creature sits awkwardly in one
of the oversized (for them) chairs in the room as they
focus on balancing a book a little bit too large for them
to handle. They periodically cackle and titter over the
book as they annotate its text with a colorful quill.
They’ve become distracted by the grisly descriptions
of ritual sacriﬁce in an illustrated copy of a text called
Pathways of the Worm and angrily attack if interrupted.
If brought below 20 Hit Points, the fey uses dimension
door to ﬂee to area C26 (although they can’t do so if the
heroes have doused that room’s illumination) and ﬂit
away. They plot revenge against the heroes, most likely
by allying with the ghouls in area C33.

Treasure: As in area C26, the chandelier incorporates
a removable everburning torch.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check
while perusing this collection turns up a slender volume
called Ineffable Hauntings tucked inside of a larger
book about ghosts. This volume contains the formula
for the create undead ritual to create poltergeists. It also
contains a detailed, academic analysis of the ghostly
weapon spell. A character who can cast 3rd‑level arcane
or occult spells can use these notes to retrain a 3rd-level
spell they know into ghostly weapon with only 1 day
of downtime. A wizard can simply transcribe this spell
into their spellbook. This book is worth 20 gp.
Among these tomes are enough texts to present 1
Bulk of books to Morlibint.
C28. PRIVATE WASHROOM
The bathtub and commode in this room are surprisingly clean.
Although a minor enchantment to keep this room
clean still operates, there’s little of interest here.
C29. ABANDONED GUARD POST
This now-empty room was once a guard post. Nothing
remains other than a broken iron stool and a well-used
whetstone. The stairs beyond the door to the south
lead down to area D1.
C30. SIEGE CASTLE HISTORY
SEVERE 3
This room is locked. The heroes can unlock it with
the key from area C27 or with four successful DC 25
Thievery checks. Alternatively, they can Force it Open
with a successful DC 22 Athletics check.
Shelves line the walls, while what appears to be a partially
completed—or perhaps partially ruined—sculpture of a
sprawling city sits atop a ﬁve-foot-diameter circular table.
The sculpture is of Absalom, depicted with heavy
damage in several areas. With a successful DC 20 Society
check to Recall Knowledge, a hero can conﬁrm that the
damage roughly matches what the city was said to have
suffered over the centuries from all of the siege attempts it
repelled, up until about 500 years ago (it doesn’t include

more recent attacks, such as the Red Siege, the Siege of
the Ravenous Raja, or the Black Echelon Uprising).
Most of these books focus on the history of
Absalom’s sieges, and while many of them contain
contradictory information, the collection as a whole
makes cross-referencing it to determine likely errors
easier. Anyone perusing these books ﬁnds heavy
annotations in all of them; taken together, they reveal
that a previous researcher was using the books to
catalogue the failures of prior sieges and analyze the
city’s response to various exterior threats, all in the
interest of ensuring the success of a new siege. Books in
this room can be used just like the books in area C11 to
aid in Investigation on the history of sieges of Absalom,
providing a +1 item bonus to relevant skill checks.
Creatures: A wood golem carved to resemble
Belcorra still stands guard in this room. It lumbers to
action as soon as anyone enters the room who doesn’t
also resemble Belcorra. It doesn’t pursue enemies out
of the room but otherwise ﬁghts until destroyed.

C31. UNFINISHED LIBRARY
The walls of this room are only partially completed and
bear the telltale marks of chisels and picks. Discarded
stone-working tools lie against the unﬁnished walls.
Belcorra planned an expansion wing to house
additional tomes that had started to pile up elsewhere
in her library, but the project was never completed
before her death, and the ghouls haven’t yet gathered
the initiative to resume the work.
Treasure: Most of the mining tools remaining here
are mundane, but one of them is a +1 striking pick.
C32. FURNACE ROOM
LOW 3
The air in this room feels blisteringly hot, although the
source of the heat isn’t apparent. Neither the wooden
barrel containing a few iron scoops nor the metal bin with
a hatch-like lid seems to be the source.
This room was used to burn refuse that accumulated
in the dungeon—more often than not, books Belcorra
came into possession of that she found to be useless or
dangerous. Originally, the refuse would be loaded into
the metal bin; once the hatch was closed, powerful ﬁre
magic incinerated the contents, and the ashes were
then scooped out and dumped in the swamp.
Hazard: In the aftermath of Belcorra’s death, a
squabble between two scholars concluded in this
room when they attempted to burn each other alive.
The machine malfunctioned and burned both scholars
to ashes. Today, echoes of their souls haunt the room.

C33. RESTRICTED COLLECTION
SEVERE 3
Rows of bookshelves run the length of this room, although in
places they’ve been damaged or tipped over. The books that
once sat on the ruined shelves appear to have been relocated
to other shelves. Several doors lead out from this room, but
the double door to the north is the most impressive: it’s
made of stone, carved with a strange feminine shape rising
from the ghost-laced mists of a cemetery of emptied graves.
The bulk of Belcorra’s most valuable tomes were
kept here, in a collection that was available to only
key scholars and very inﬂuential visitors. Much of
the damage done to this room is relatively recent, for
when the Ghost Queen morlocks emerged into this
room from the stairs to the east, they clashed violently
with the Cult of the Canker. Both sides suffered losses,
but the ghouls won the ﬁght and forced the surviving
morlocks to ﬂee west, eventually ﬁnding their way to
the Servants’ Quarters level upstairs.
The books here cover all the same subject matter
as those in area C11 but are much more useful and
better organized. Checks to Recall Knowledge about
the relevant topics here have a +2 item bonus instead.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 25 Religion check to
Recall Knowledge recognizes the scene on the north
door as the Outer God Nhimbaloth feeding on the
spirits of those who worship her.
The stairs beyond the east door descend to area D16.
Creatures: A single Canker cultist and four ghouls
are repairing the shelves as best they can—a task that
keeps suffering setbacks due to the decayed quality of
the ancient wood. They don’t immediately attack, but
instead adopt a defensive position around the north
door. The Canker cultist then addresses the heroes,
offering them the chance to have an audience with her
high priestess, Nhakazarin. Of course, this is a ruse—
she hopes to lead the heroes to her high priestess only
to betray them, and if her attempt to Lie to the heroes
fails (a likely outcome, given her mere +3 Deception
modiﬁer), she grows frustrated and orders an attack.
These ghouls all ﬁght until destroyed.

C34. TEMPLE OF THE CANKER
MODERATE 3
Soft light illuminates several display cases in this vast room.
Once used to display books, the cases stand smashed and
empty. Along the curved north wall stands a hideous, towering
ﬁgure of a woman. The form is composed of hundreds of
portions of stitched-together ﬂesh from a variety of diﬀerent
creatures and draped in tattered, ﬁlthy sheets. The stench of
rot from the statue ﬁlls even this large room.
Belcorra once displayed her most important and
valuable tomes here. A graveknight named Caliddo
Haruvex, one of Belcorra’s distant relatives and a loyal
guardian of her treasure vault far below, retrieved the
books and returned to the vault with them on Belcorra’s
orders. The magical light that once illuminated their
display cases remains, rendering this room well-lit.
The immense rotten construction to the north is an
incomplete shell akin to a ﬂesh golem. The Cult of the
Canker intends it to serve as a new body for Belcorra
once it’s ﬁnished. The rotting statue looks ominous but
is inanimate... for now.
The secret door to the west is particularly well
hidden; heroes Searching this area must succeed at a
DC 30 Perception check to ﬁnd it. None of the ghouls
know it’s here, and it’s unlikely that the heroes will
ﬁnd it at ﬁrst. Note, however, that the existence of this
secret door (as well as all other secret doors on the
upper three levels) is revealed in the blueprints found
in area D8.
Creatures: The high priestess of the Cult of the
Canker is a ghoul named Nhakazarin, a woman
who was cruel and sadistic even in life. Born with an
infestation of undeath in her soul, she served as one of
Belcorra’s many necromantic advisers. After her death,
she was the one who galvanized the other servants of
this level to prepare for Belcorra’s resurrection.
Nhakazarin spends her time working with bits
of ﬂesh harvested from morlocks, monsters, and
even other ghouls. She’s stitching this ﬂesh to her
masterpiece, a 15-foot-tall statue of Belcorra made
from decaying meat and stained bone.
Nhakazarin demands the heroes abandon their
gear and their lives, promising glory with the Canker
if they agree to accept ghoul fever and then be locked
away in the Author’s Hall (area C38) until they
transform. If the heroes refuse, Nhakazarin laughs
imperiously and attacks, using Intimidation for
initiative. As she ﬁghts, she promises the heroes that
they’ll join her cult, willingly or not. Once combat
begins, Nhakazarin prefers to ﬁght in a square
adjacent to her statue so she can use her Consume
Masterpiece ability if needed.

The walls of this small room have built-in shelves. Books
line the shelves to the north and south, while a stack of
loose scrolls sits on the shelf to the west. A single chair and
a small writing desk sit in the middle of the room.
Belcorra kept her most valuable and signiﬁcant
books in the large chamber to the east, but she stored
everything involving her work on Gauntlight and
the Abomination Vaults here. These resources have
remained here since her demise, since the ghouls
don’t know this room exists.

Vaults
The largest book on the northern shelf is a large
journal that focuses largely on Belcorra’s hatred of
Absalom. It’s written in Aklo, and a hero who spends 8
hours reading it learns of her family history from their
exile to poverty and her eventual return to the region
to build a lair from which she hoped to exact revenge
on the city that disgraced and impoverished her family.
The last several pages of the journal document much
of her work in building the Abomination Vaults.
While the journal doesn’t offer many speciﬁc details,
it mentions construction of ﬂeshwarping laboratories,
arenas where she pitted enemies against monstrous
champions for her amusement, prisons, torture
chambers, links to the Darklands, and a great temple
where “once the Empty Death herself brushed against
this fragile world.” Belcorra’s entries often speak
of her minions in the abstract, as if bragging about
how many have come to serve her in creating the
complex, but she only ever mentions one by name: her
“amusingly vain” apprentice, Volluk Azrinae. One of
the last entries describes how this apprentice arrived
from “a community of upstart and meddlesome drow
below” to serve Belcorra. The notes don’t provide any
further information about this drow community.
The stack of loose papers and scrolls contain a
wealth of information about Gauntlight (page 215).
These papers are written in Aklo; sorting and then
reading them takes 8 hours, after which the reader can
learn about Gauntlight’s functions as if they’d fully
researched the artifact.
Treasure: A folio containing several esoteric
diagrams is sandwiched between several books on
teleportation on the north shelf. The folio details
Belcorra’s series of linked teleportation circles to
quickly move around the Abomination Vaults, and it
notes the importance of using the awaken portal ritual
(page 223) to activate them should time or mischance
deplete them of power. The awaken portal ritual is
included here.
The largest book in the room, on the southern shelf,
is a rare text called The Whispering Reeds (page 216).
This magical book describes 77 supposed encounters
with the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth and how each
encounter left physical or mental scars. The book is
heavily annotated in Belcorra’s hand, particularly in
areas where themes of Nhimbaloth as an “eater of
ghosts” play into the parables and tales.
C36. SCRIPTORIUM
SEVERE 3
This room is lined with tables divided up into several narrow
carrels with old wooden chairs pushed in against  them.
Upon them, old stacks of paper and tattered books sit
amid dry inkwells and brittle writing quills. To the south, a
skeleton dressed in shiny-looking chain shirt lies slumped
on the ﬂoor, clutching something in its bony hands.
This room once served as a scriptorium where
Belcorra’s scribes worked to transcribe and copy
important books.
A hero who Searches the eastern wall and succeeds at
a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds an empty carrel, which
folds up to access a secret door leading to area C37.
Creatures: The skeletal remains to the south were
once a drow woman named Chandriu Invisar, director
of the scriptorium. Chandriu harbored a poorly
hidden adoration for Belcorra’s apprentice, Volluk,
and in the days after Belcorra’s death, Chandriu tried
to convince him to ﬂee with her to start a new life
together somewhere far from the Abomination Vaults.
Volluk spurned Chandriu, insisting that “Belcorra
needs me now in death even more than in life; you
should consider the same!” Chandriu returned here in
despair, only to be murdered by her disgruntled scribes
eager to get out from under her bullying, and she
grasped for Volluk’s portrait as she died.
As with so many others who had the misfortune
to perish in the Abomination Vaults, Chandriu arose
as a ghost. She now spends her days ﬂoating among
the work spaces, as if looking over the shoulders of
scribes to appraise their work, not realizing that
any time has passed at all since the hour preceding
Belcorra’s death. When the heroes enter the room,
the ghost mistakes them for new scribes and chastises
them for their tardiness before ordering them to begin
transcribing the old books stacked here. Any attempt
to do anything other than comply with Chandriu’s
commands (including simply leaving the room)
arouses her anger and prompts her to attack.
If the heroes each sit at a carrel and begin to work—
or even pantomime working—Chandriu is satisﬁed
unless they stop. She entertains brief questions and
discussion from her “scribes,” though, and will answer
any questions the heroes have, within reason, and that
don’t make her realize that Belcorra is dead or that
she’s a ghost. Every 10 minutes, she drifts through the
secret door to area C37, and a hero who watches and
succeeds at a DC 12 Perception check notes that her
actions suggest a hidden door (even though she simply
passes through the wall). She returns from these short
trips to area C37 in 1d4 rounds. The heroes can safely
escape the room during this window; if they later
return, Chandriu doesn’t remember them at all.
If the heroes attack Chandriu, or force her to
confront the truth that she’s a ghost or that Belcorra is
dead, she cries out in despair, then attacks.

its own missed opportunities. On a success, a creature
is temporarily immune to Chandriu’s Despairing Cry for
1 minute.
Treasure: There are 1 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint. In addition to these books, the three
mentioned in the note in area B3 (What The Worm
Knows, Grave Feasts, and Secrets of the Skull) are
located here as well. Morlibint has no interest in
these three grim treatises on necromancy, but they
can be sold for 8 gp each to someone other than
Morlibint (Yanyismera, for example, might be
able to procure a buyer).
A search of Chandriu’s remains reveals
that her +1 chain shirt is in good condition.
The object she clutches is a framed portrait of
Volluk Azrinae. The portrait captures the drow’s
beauty as well as his imperious, vain smirk, both
qualities Chandriu adored. His name appears
on a tiny gold plaque at the portrait’s base. The
work of art has endured the passage of time quite
well and is worth 10 gp, but it might be more
immediately valuable to the heroes as a way to
ﬁght against Volluk (area D8).
In addition to the obvious armor and portrait,
a hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check
while Searching Chandriu’s remains spots a tiny iron
key concealed beneath them; this key unlocks the
cabinet in area C37.

C37. SECRET SCRIPTORIUM
A worktable covered with blank scrolls and papers
sits against the eastern wall of this room. A
cabinet with several closed drawers stands to
the north.
There are ﬁve locked drawers in
the cabinet; each can be opened
by a hero using the key from area
C36, succeeding at three DC 20
Thievery checks to Pick a Lock,
or with a successful DC 16
Athletics check to Force it
Open. Several books are
stored within—copies of
texts produced by scribes and
once intended for sale or as
gifts to Belcorra’s allies in other
lands, all of whom are now dead.
These books consist of 2 Bulk for
Morlibint, though.
Not all of the scrolls on the desk are
blank; one tucked beneath the others
is an infernal contract. This contract
was meant to be stored deeper in the Abomination
Vaults, but it never quite made it there. A character
who can read Infernal and takes 10 minutes to look
over the contract learns that this is the devil Korlok’s
contract that binds him as a guardian. A reader who
succeeds at a DC 18 Perception or Society check, or
who’s trained in Legal Lore, notes a loophole that
can release the devil if it’s brought to his attention
(area C8).
Treasure: There are 2 Bulk of books here to gather
for Morlibint.
C38. AUTHORS’ HALL
MODERATE 3
Long shelves with several chairs drawn up to them ring
this room on all sides, save the north. Rancid stains of old
blood and decay cake the shelves and ﬂoor.
Belcorra’s scribes once used this room to pen new
works. The Cult of the Canker now use it as a place to
store victims of ghoul fever until they die and arise as
ghouls. There are no bodies stored here now, but the
heroes can ﬁnd ample evidence of the suffering and
death that has occurred here.
A hero who Searches the south wall and succeeds at
a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds a section of shelving
that folds down to allow access to a secret door
leading to area C39.
Creatures: A pair of ghoul cultists are having a
spirited debate on whether or not ﬂesh “ripened” by
violet fungi tastes better than naturally decayed
meat. They’re distracted enough that they don’t
overhear the sounds of combat in area C33,
but they attack any intruders they notice.

C39. GUARD ROOM
A
small
alcove,
its
ﬂoor
decorated with a silvery circle
of inlaid runes, sits in the
eastern wall of this empty room.
This room once housed a
bound devil who served as one
of Belcorra’s guardians, but this
creature’s contract expired long ago,
releasing her back to Hell.
C40. POOL
MODERATE 3
The dripping, sloshing sound of water ﬁlls this large cavern
chamber. The air is cold and damp, and to the east sits a
sizable pond. A lazy rivulet of overﬂow trickles to the north
down a sloping tunnel, while a ﬁve-foot-diameter opening
gapes in the ceiling above the center of the pool.
The pool here is 5 feet deep and was once used as
a source of drinking water for these levels; the hole in
the ceiling 15 feet above leads up 25 more feet to the
well in area B23, while the downward sloping tunnel
to the north leads to area D14.
Creatures: A gibbering mouther has dwelt in this
cavern for decades. It periodically crawls along the
tunnel to area C2 to hunt bats and rats. It immediately
attacks intruders and pursues foes as best it can. The
monster doesn’t differentiate between the heroes
and other denizens, so a canny group might lure
the gibbering mouther into a ﬁght against ghouls,
morlocks, or other creatures.

CHAPTER 4:
Long Dream the Dead
The fourth level of the Abomination Vaults is one of
the smaller ones overall, yet it’s among the ﬁnest, as it
once served as Belcorra’s personal retreat.
Belcorra’s Retreat Features
Ceilings in this level are 10 feet tall in halls and 15 feet
in rooms. Unless otherwise indicated, rooms are unlit.
The doors are iron-banded wood; ephemeral spirits
gently shut any door left open for more than a minute.
The map for this level appears on page 70.
D1. BELCORRA’S DINING ROOM
MODERATE 4
A pair of brightly glowing chandeliers illuminates a long
banquet table surrounded by luxurious, high-backed chairs.
The table is still set as if for a grand meal, but some of the
place settings are scattered and toppled, as are a few of
the chairs. Four skeletons in tattered ﬁnery are scattered
about the room, some of them clutching their own necks.
When the Roseguard assaulted Gauntlight Keep
so many years ago, Belcorra was dining here with
representatives of a now-extinct Absalomian thieves’
guild whom she was courting as potential allies
against the city. When word came that the Roseguard
was handily overcoming the keep’s defenses, Belcorra
took no chances. She politely excused herself, bade her
guests ﬁnish their meal, and magically commanded her
chef to poison them all and murder the other servants
before taking his own life.
Stairs beyond the north door lead up to area C29.
Creatures: The guests died in excruciating pain,
then later became havens for corpselights seeking
hosts. When a living creature other than Volluk enters
this room, the corpselights within the skeletons begin
to glow, and then the skeletons stagger to their feet
and attack. Each time a corpselight is forced into wisp
form, it ﬂees to one of the adjoining rooms (areas D2,
D3, or D6) to claim another corpse host and return to
the ﬁght.
