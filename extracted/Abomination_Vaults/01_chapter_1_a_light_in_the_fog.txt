Abomination Vaults. Belcorra’s spite has festered in the
intervening centuries, and she hungers for revenge, not
only against Absalom for destroying her family, but also
the town of Otari and its founders—the heroes who
killed her. Belcorra bides her time while she rebuilds,
reenergizing the dread Gauntlight and reasserting her
dominance over the feral and forgotten monsters of the
Abomination Vaults!
Getting Started
The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses
primarily on the sprawling dungeon complex, and
this campaign begins as the heroes approach the
aboveground ruins for the ﬁrst time. Their mutual
friend, Wrin Sivinxi, has already briefed them about
her sighting of a strange glow atop the ruin’s towering
lighthouse. From Otari, no one other than Wrin can
make out this glow, but if the heroes look up at night
from the immediate environs, they can conﬁrm what
Wrin’s supernaturally acute eyes picked out from
town—the top of the lighthouse does indeed glow a
faint, eerie blue after dark.
Of course, you don’t have to start this campaign on
the literal front porch of the dungeon—if you wish,
you can ease the heroes by roleplaying their initial
encounter with Wrin (perhaps as she gives them an
astrology reading), or after the heroes spend time in
town involving some last-minute shopping or a trip
to a tavern. In this case, consult the Otari gazetteer on
starting on page 9 or Wrin’s entry on page 18, but the
fun doesn’t truly begin until the heroes head up the
Gaunt Trail to the foreboding ruins in Fogfen!
Gauntlight Ruins Features
As the heroes approach the ruins of Gauntlight Keep
for the ﬁrst time, read or paraphrase the following.
The sound of frogs and mosquitoes mixes with water
sloshing against muddy shores, all muﬄed by the ever-
present mists that linger in the aptly named Fogfen. As
the mists clear, a shadow looms from the cloying swamp
vapors—a sprawling ruin of stone and wood squats atop an
island in the soggy marsh. The upper ﬂoors have largely
collapsed, leaving only the stone walls of the ground
ﬂoor intact. Above these ruins towers an out‑of‑place
monument—a colossal lighthouse whose painted walls
and iron-cased crown have resisted the corrosive eﬀects
of the surrounding swamp.
While the overgrown trail leads right to area A1, the
heroes can access the ruins through other entrances.
Along the southern side, waters surrounding the
ruins are relatively shallow, but on other sides, the
depth ranges from 10 to 15 feet, requiring a boat or
swimming to navigate.
With the exception of Gauntlight (area A25), the
upper levels of Gauntlight Keep collapsed long ago,
even falling to the ground ﬂoor in places. Areas
denoted as rubble on the map of Gauntlight Keep
are open to the sky above and considered difﬁcult
terrain. Where the roof hasn’t caved in, ceilings
are 10 feet high unless otherwise noted. The only
illumination comes from whatever sunlight ﬁlters in
through the constant fog. The doors on this level
are all cracked and rotten except where indicated;
handling them with any amount of force causes
them to split or simply fall off their hinges with a
wet splintering sound.
Gauntlight is magically protected from damage, as
described on page 215. This protection has bled into
the surrounding ruins somewhat, slowing the usual
rate of decay over the past 500 years. Nevertheless,
time is inexorable, and the rest of the ruins have
suffered in the passage of centuries.
The main faction active in the ruins is what’s left of
a small gang of mitﬂit gremlins who call themselves
the Mudlickers. Led by a large, bearded gremlin
named Boss Skrawng, the Mudlickers believe they
once dwelt in “glory” underground. However, the
arrival of the much larger and meaner Ghost Queen
morlocks forced them out of their homes, and they’ve
struggled to regain their footing ever since. Boss
Skrawng has thus far formed the inkling of a plan to
raise an army of giant insects to take over Otari. He
has already exuberantly guaranteed the restoration
of Mudlicker glory through this scheme, so the gang
BEYOND GAUNTLIGHT
The ruins of Gauntlight Keep aren’t far out of town—
just a 20-minute walk from Otari to the ruins. The
Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses almost
entirely on the dungeon itself, and you can gloss over
the details of trips between the dungeon and town as
you see ﬁt. If your players express interest in mixing
things up, you can use some of the encounters or
short adventures in the standalone Pathﬁnder
Adventure: Troubles in Otari. That adventure presents
additional content in the Otari hinterlands suitable
for 2nd- to 4th-level characters and provides great
ways to prepare heroes who need a bit of extra XP
before they delve into the deeper, more dangerous
levels of the Abomination Vaults.

CHAPTER 1 SYNOPSIS
The upper level of the Abomination
Vaults—and the only level
aboveground—is the ruin of a large
structure called Gauntlight Keep.
Although the upper levels of the
keep have collapsed into the lower
level (ﬁlling many of the remaining
rooms with rubble), one prominent
structure remains: Gauntlight,
a massive lighthouse placed
incongruously in the middle of a
large swamp called the Fogfen. Here,
the heroes can encounter hapless
but vicious mitﬂits, dangers left from
Belcorra’s day, and evidence that
Gauntlight draws upon power from
somewhere deep below.
Environmental Cues: crude graﬃti,
evidence of prior squatters, mounds
of rubble, overgrowth of mold and
creeping plants, puddles of standing
water, scuttling vermin, splashing
water, swampy odors.
CHAPTER 1 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable
items available as treasure in
Chapter 1 are as follows.
•	 +1 morningstar
•	 +1 rapier
•	 1st-level wand of heal
•	 black adder venom
•	 caltrop snare
•	 channel protection amulet
•	 lesser comprehension elixir
•	 lesser darkvision elixir
•	 lesser skeptic’s elixir (page 214)
•	 minor elixir of life
•	 minor healing potion
•	 scroll of restore senses
•	 spear frog poison
•	 spike snare
•	 wolf fang
loyally follows Boss Skrawng, working hard to keep intruders—like the
heroes—out of “their” ruins.
As a reminder, you should take note of what the players have their
characters generally do as they explore. You can have them choose from
the list of exploration activities in the Pathﬁnder Core Rulebook, or you
can ask each player to describe what their character does and decide
which exploration activity best ﬁts their description. Certain effects are
listed in the rooms based on whether a hero is Investigating, Searching, or
performing another exploration activity.
The map for this level appears on page 20.
A1. DAMP ENTRANCE
LOW 1
Swaths of mildew and mold cover the damp surfaces of this watchtower,
appearing as green and black smears on the dull stone walls. The door frames in
the walls to the north and south rotted long ago, while a few collapsed chairs lie
on the ﬂoor amid small heaps of foul-smelling gray lumps. Thick sheets of dusty
cobwebs hang from above, obscuring any view of the ceiling.
Once the primary entrance to Gauntlight Keep, this one-story
outbuilding is constructed of sturdy stone. The opaque sheets of dusty
cobwebs function as a drop ceiling at a height of 7 feet, leaving a 3-foot
space between the cobwebs and the stone ceiling above. The Mudlicker
mitﬂits have rigged a slipshod network of soggy ropes and planks in
the space above the cobwebs to clamber around on; a successful DC
12 Perception check can spot this feature through the webbing, and a
critical success also reveals a 3-foot-diameter hole in the roof in the
northwest corner, which the gremlins use to come and go. A successful
DC 15 Nature check to Recall Knowledge identiﬁes the deposits of gray
material as mitﬂit dung. Apparently the mitﬂits use this room as a latrine
as well as an advance guard station.
Creatures: Three mitﬂits lurk above the cobwebs but can’t resist a
chance to torment and trick the heroes once they enter the room below.
By crouching down on the planks and vines and peering through the
cobwebs, the three mitﬂits wait until at least two heroes have entered
the room below before calling out in their best imitation of high-pitched
pixie voices. They welcome the heroes into their parlor, warn them about
the mean bugs that live in the nearby keep, and suggest the visitors
partake of the “magic pixie mud” on the ﬂoor. Of course, the fact that
the mitﬂits lack any skill at Lying (they have a –1 Deception modiﬁer)
and can only speak in Undercommon means that they have slim chances
of success, but if they do, they’re overcome with guffaws of laughter and
can’t help but reveal their presence.
If confronted (either the heroes spot them or fail to fall for their
tricks), the mitﬂits shriek in anger and fear. One of them clambers up
through the hole in the roof and tries to climb across the vine stretching
from area A1 to A9 to warn his boss in area A10, while the other two
throw darts at the heroes. As soon as any mitﬂit takes damage, they
shriek in fear, cast bane, and then ﬂee to area A9. The mitﬂits keep a
nasty-smelling chunk of giant maggot meat handy for a snack, but if
forced to ﬂee, one tosses the maggot steak onto the shore of the pool in
area A3, hoping to cover their retreating by luring the slurk living there
onto shore to attack the heroes.

MITFLITS (3)
CREATURE –1
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 192
Initiative Stealth +5
Treasure: Searching the room reveals a peridot bead
(one of the mitﬂits thought it was candy) worth 2 gp,
along with a chipped mitﬂit tooth in one of the little
dung piles.
A2. DECREPIT DRAWBRIDGE
A wooden drawbridge, its timbers gray with age and decay,
spans the twenty-foot gap between the outbuilding and
sprawling ruin on the island. Rusty iron chains hang from
the ruin’s northern wall to the drawbridge’s southern side.
The chains look ready to fall apart, giving the drawbridge’s
structural integrity an extra layer of dubiousness.
True to appearances, the drawbridge isn’t safe to
cross, especially now that the mitﬂits have further
weakened the structure with some clever undercutting
to its supports. The heroes can spot the sabotage with
a successful DC 5 Perception check. A Small or smaller
creature can cross the bridge safely, but Medium
creatures must cross one at a time or the bridge
collapses with a groaning crash, which dumps everyone
on the bridge into the 4-foot-deep water. A creature
near the ends of the drawbridge when it collapses can
Grab an Edge (DC 10 Reﬂex save) to avoid falling in.
Once the bridge has collapsed, a character can attempt
a DC 10 Athletics check to Climb up to area A1 or A4
on either side. Of course, once the bridge collapses, the
slurk in area A3 quickly comes to investigate.
A3. SLURK POND
LOW 1
Tangles of reeds grow in thick clusters around the edge
of this muddy pond. The water appears murky with
algae, and the half-decayed body of a three-foot-tall scaly
humanoid lies on the pool’s northern bank, half-buried in
mud and leaves.
The water of this pond is only 4 feet deep, but an
extra few feet of mud below make it greater difﬁcult
terrain to wade through.
Vines and creepers festoon the ruins, but any hero
Investigating this area who succeeds at a DC 12 Nature
check to Recall Knowledge identiﬁes an unusually long
vine that seems out of place. This vine stretches from
the top of the watchtower (area A1) to the north end
of the walkway to the northeast (area A9). The mitﬂits
strung up this vine so they could avoid the ground if
they wanted to; it won’t support any creature larger
than Small in size.
Creatures: A single slurk, the former guardian and
only surviving remnant of the Stonescale kobolds who
recently dwelt in the ruins, still lives in this pond. The
mitﬂits enjoy playing “dodge the squirt”: they taunt the
slurk into spitting slime at them while they dash across
the vine. The slurk prefers to sleep in the center of the
pond with its snout above the water during the day,
then ﬂops out at night to hunt. Loud noises (such as a
collapsing drawbridge), the scent of sudden free food
(such as a tossed maggot steak), or anyone splashing
around on the pool’s edge will rouse the slurk from its
slumber. Once woken the monster eagerly attacks any
creatures nearby, but it doesn’t leave sight of its pond.
The creature ﬁghts to the death.
SLURK
CREATURE 2
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 301
Initiative Perception +6
Treasure: The corpse of a dead kobold lies on the
pond’s north bank. The slurk avoided eating the carcass
out of lingering loyalty to the recently slaughtered
tribe, and the slurk’s presence kept the mitﬂits from
looting it—but not from eyeing it covetously from
afar. The gear on the kobold’s body is mostly ruined
with the exception of 4 gp in one rotten belt pouch
and a spike snare bundled securely in a little backpack.
WANDERING MONSTERS
While this book doesn’t present wandering monster
tables for Abomination Vaults, the dungeon’s
denizens still occasionally leave their homes! You
can make the dungeon feel more dynamic by
familiarizing yourself with each level’s denizens and
then having them react to the party’s progression
and presence. For example, if the heroes noisily
explore an area, creatures in nearby rooms could
come to investigate or perhaps set up an ambush. If
the heroes decide to camp out in the dungeon rather
than return to the safety of town, nearby creatures
might visit or even attack their campsite while
they rest. If the heroes clear out the denizens of a
level and then return weeks later, they might ﬁnd
that new monsters have moved in. By keeping the
inhabitants of the Abomination Vaults active, you
can make the location feel all the more dangerous
and unpredictable to your players.

A4. MAGGOT TRAINING HALL
MODERATE 1
Piles of rotting timbers and loose stones lie in heaps
throughout this large, L-shaped hall. Clumps of moss and
tangled vines spill down from gaps in the wooden ceiling
above each pile of rubble. Several doors lead out to all
sides, most barely clinging to their hinges and frames.
Debris completely blocks a wooden stairwell that leads up
to a large hole in the ceiling. Here and there, the stone walls
bear the scars of ﬁre or damage from an ancient battle.
Many years ago, the Roseguard confronted Belcorra
in this vast room. The ﬁght spilled from here into the
servants’ lounge, now a sinkhole (area A8), and caused
some of the keep’s collapse. A hero Investigating
this room who succeeds at a DC 15 check to Recall
Knowledge using any skill associated with magic
conﬁrms that powerful, destructive spells caused some
of the damage centuries ago.
Most of the doors in this room are easy enough to
access, with a couple exceptions. The door to area A11
requires a successful DC 18 Athletics check to Force
Open, and rubble has mostly buried the door to area
A14. Characters can try to clamber over the pile of
rubble, through a hole in the roof, and down into the
room beyond with a successful DC 10 Athletics check.
A secret door opens into a small hidden alcove
to the northwest; a hero Searching this room who
succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check ﬁnds a section
of the stone wall that slides aside to access it. The
alcove beyond the door has several grooves in the
stone, caused by what looks like determined scraping.
This chamber used to contain a teleportation circle
(Pathﬁnder Advanced Player’s Guide 244) to area C5a,
but fortune hunters found this hidden alcove centuries
ago and gouged out all the silver in the magic runes.
The extensive damage drained away the magic and
permanently destroyed the teleportation circle.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Arcana or
Occultism check to Recall Knowledge
realizes the original purpose of this
room and the permanent damage
done. This room foreshadows
the many other teleportation
circles in the Abomination Vaults
that the heroes will be able to
reactivate and use.
Creatures: When
the
mitﬂits
dwelled in the dungeons below, they
numbered in the dozens, but their
violent eviction by the morlocks,
attrition from games of “dodge the squirt,” and
misjudged vermin empathy have diminished the group.
Originally, all the Mudlickers lived in this large room;
now, only three mitﬂits remain here.
The Mudlicker leader, Boss Skrawng, has an
audacious plan. After discovering the giant maggots
in area A5 and the giant ﬂy in area A6, he ordered his
mitﬂits to start training and breeding more maggots.
Once the insects have fully grown, he intends on
leading his entire group, mounted on trained giant
ﬂy war steeds, down to Otari to raid and rule. Three
mitﬂits are currently engaged in training their ﬁrst
maggot, hoping the pallid creature retains its training
after it matures into a giant ﬂy. None of the gremlins
know how long it takes for a maggot to grow up
big and strong, but upon sighting the heroes, they
immediately order their “pet” forward to attack. After
all, giant-ﬂy war steeds need to develop a taste for
people to grow up nice and mean.

A collapsed wooden staircase in the northeastern corner of
this room winds up to a moss-shrouded hole. The expanse
of the Fogfen is visible through a total collapse in a stone
wall to the west. A dead frog the size of a horse lies
sprawled in this collapse, its back legs bitten oﬀ at the hips.

This massive frog was attacked by Freznelkesh, the
river drake who lairs in area B19. The drake decided
she had no interest in the frog’s foul toxic skin after
gnawing off its legs. The carcass lies in the rubble on
the western wall.
Creatures: While the river drake didn’t ﬁnd the
frog’s ﬂavor appetizing, the giant maggots deposited
in the carcass by the giant ﬂy in area A6 aren’t so
discerning. If any creature approaches within 10 feet
of the frog’s body, two giant maggots burst suddenly
from the carcass to attack. They pursue fresh food
relentlessly and ﬁght to the death.

Examining the Frog: A hero who Investigates the
frog carcass and succeeds at a DC 18 Arcana or Nature
check to Recall Knowledge can tell that a draconic
creature ate the frog’s legs. On a critical success, the
hero recognizes the caustic mucus around the bite as
belonging to a river drake.
A6. FLY PEN
MODERATE 1
The interior of this watch post still has a wooden ceiling
high above, but a thick mound of ﬁlth and animal carcasses
heaped on the ﬂoor make the room anything but inviting.
This room’s ceiling is 15 feet high and has a trapdoor
leading onto a small parapet that survived the manor’s
collapse. A hero who succeeds at a DC 18 Perception
check can spot the trapdoor, which can’t easily be seen.
With the ladder gone, a character must succeed at a
DC 15 Athletics check to Climb to the trapdoor.
Under Boss Skrawng’s orders, the mitﬂits captured
the cornerstone of their plan to rule Otari—a
magniﬁcent, green-and-blue ﬂy the size of a pony that
the gremlins call Buzzybuzz. They keep it here believing
that the ﬂy can’t escape this room; the mitﬂits don’t
know about the trapdoor, but their ﬂy prisoner found
it right away. Buzzybuzz can leave whenever it wants,
but the food in this area keeps it satisﬁed here.
In fact, this room is slightly too convenient, as
a second giant ﬂy with brown and blue coloration
sometimes comes in, too. The two giant ﬂies get
along with one another since they both have plenty
of food. However, the mitﬂits have never seen both in
the room at the same time, so Boss Skrawng and his
followers believe there’s only one giant ﬂy. (They don’t
understand why Buzzybuzz seems to change color
from time to time.)
Creatures: The heroes ﬁrst encounter the green-and-
blue giant ﬂy when they enter this room. It lunges at
the heroes, assuming they’re more food. One round
later, the brown-and-blue giant ﬂy darts into the room
through the trapdoor and joins in the attack. Any
mitﬂits who see both ﬂies at the same time become
visibly confused, but their surprise turns to horror
when they see the giant ﬂies ﬁght to the death.

A7. DINING ROOM 
LOW 1
The collapsed ceiling at the middle of this room has left
a ragged hole in the wooden roof. Rotten tapestries, their
designs completely obscured by mold, hang in tatters
on the walls between arrow slits and ruined side tables.
The remains of a fancy dining table lie mostly pulverized
by the fallen ceiling.
Hazard: Not all the haunts plaguing Gauntlight are
direct echoes of Belcorra’s legacy. This room served as
the communal hall for the Stonescale kobolds before a
violent coup tore the group apart. The kobold spirits
linger here to this day.
This might be the ﬁrst haunt the heroes face in the
Abomination Vaults Adventure Path, so you should
do your best to describe the ghostly kobolds that rise
from the rubble not as monsters to be fought in a
traditional manner, but as a spectral phenomenon that
must be dealt with another way. You might try to lead
the heroes into trying the skills most likely to quell the
haunt: Intimidation to scare away the kobold ghosts
or Religion to put the spirits back to rest. This is a
good opportunity to get the players in the mindset that
haunts are often more like a puzzle to be solved than
a foe to be vanquished, and getting the heroes into the
mindset of understanding why a haunt is here in the
ﬁrst place. Understanding how a haunt came to be is
the best way to discover how to put it to rest.

or partially ﬁlled with rubble in the middle of the room;
Eﬀect Six ghostly kobolds surge out of the rubble with
eerie yowls. Each creature in area A7 must attempt a DC
18 Will save with the following results. The haunt then
rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected, is temporarily
immune to Confusing Confrontation for 24 hours and
realizes that a display of intimidating dominance
might quell the ghostly kobolds’ assault.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is confused for 1 round and is
frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is confused for 2 rounds
and is frightened 3.
Routine (1 action) The spirits swoop together toward one
creature in area A7 who’s frightened, instilling feelings
of betrayal and confusion. The target takes 1d10+4
mental damage (DC 18 basic Will save).
Reset The haunt deactivates if there are no frightened
creatures in area A7 at the start of its turn. The ghostly
kobolds return to the rubble pile. The haunt can’t
activate again for 1 hour.
Treasure: With a successful DC 20 Perception check,
heroes Searching this room ﬁnd many tiny bones
scattered in the rubble. Thirty minutes of work can
uncover six kobold skeletons. Destroying the bones
or removing them all from this room permanently
disables the haunt. A hero who’s trained in Religion
or who succeeds at a DC 15 Religion check realizes
the connection between the bones and the haunt and
understands that destroying the bones or removing
them all from the rubble pile is necessary to ensure the
spectral kobolds won’t ever rise again.
If the heroes discover the kobold bones, they also
ﬁnd several jumbled treasures: 3 gp, 20 sp, a box with
components for a caltrop snare, a wolf fang, and a vial
of black adder venom with the word “YUM” clumsily
written on it.
A8. SINKHOLE
MODERATE 1
Roll a secret DC 10 Perception check for each hero
before they enter this room to hear the sound of
high‑pitched squeals and shrieks from within. Any
hero who speciﬁcally listens before entering hears
these sounds automatically. The four mitﬂits gooﬁng
off in this room are the source of the noise.
Almost the entire ceiling of this room has collapsed ,while
below, the ﬂoor has crumbled into a ten-foot-deep sinkhole
ﬁlled with rubble, mud, and glistening patches of fungus.
Evidence of ancient damage—burn scars and acid scorch
marks—decorate the walls and much of the rubble.
The ancient battle between the Roseguard and
Belcorra came to its destructive end in this room when
Belcorra used a last-ditch explosion to try to defeat
the adventurers. The resulting collapse swallowed the
group’s rogue, Otari Ilvashti, and trapped him in the
dungeon below. Belcorra ﬂed to the lighthouse (area
A11) after this failed gambit. As in area A4, a hero
Investigating this room who succeeds at a DC 15
check to Recall Knowledge using any skill associated
with magic conﬁrms that a devastating magical battle
occurred here long ago.
A character must attempt a DC 12 Athletics check
to Climb to navigate the sinkhole’s steep slopes. A
hero who Searches the rubble and succeeds at a DC 18
Perception check spies a buried spiral staircase leading
downward. Clearing the rubble away can take many
days, but if the heroes persist, they open the way down
to area B8 below.
Creatures: Four Mudlicker mitﬂits clamber and
scurry around amid the rubble in the sinkhole. They’re
supposed to be gathering mushrooms and grubs but
are currently wrestling over who gets to snack on a
particularly bright blue grub. The mitﬂits take a –2
penalty to Perception checks rolled for initiative as a
result of their distraction unless the heroes take pains
to announce themselves before attacking. The mitﬂits
hurl darts at the heroes from below, but a mitﬂit
who runs out of darts or takes any damage focuses
on Climbing out of the pit and then running away to
warn Boss Skrawng in area A10.

A9. WALKWAY
A ﬁfteen-foot stone walkway spans a narrow stretch of
swamp water, connecting the ruined keep to a large stone
outbuilding. Double doors block each end of the walkway.
Standing before the southeast door is a seven-foot-tall
skeleton dressed in armor made of gnarled roots, bones,
and rusted metal. The skeleton clenches a morningstar in
one weathered hand with the weapon’s heavy, spiked tip
resting on the walkway at the skeleton’s feet.
The skeletal “guard” is nothing more than a statue
built by the Mudlickers. It looks frightening but poses
no danger; anyone examining the statue who succeeds
at a DC 12 Perception check notices the wooden struts
and crude lashings that keep it together. Any damage
dealt to the skeleton causes it to clatter apart loudly,
alerting the occupants of area A10.

Treasure: The mitﬂits found the morningstar and
are delighted with how well it keeps the skeleton
propped up. They don’t know it’s a +1 morningstar.
A10. MUDLICKER THRONE ROOM
SEVERE 1
Splintered framing in the ceiling and ﬂoor hint that thin
wooden walls once divided this stone building’s interior.
With those walls demolished, only a single, large chamber
remains. Rubble, swamp vegetation, and mud pile in heaps
like foul nests, while a larger stack of rubble, sticks, and
bones looks almost, but not quite, like a throne. A ﬂattened
mound of sand with a few dozen bits of wood and stone
stuck into it covers the ﬂoor before the throne.
The mitﬂits chose these old barracks for their
commander, Boss Skrawng, to use as a throne hall.
Boss Skrawng’s fragile throne requires constant
upkeep, a task two mitﬂits perform when they aren’t
sleeping in the ﬁlthy nests here.
Any hero looking at the sand mound in front of the
throne can attempt a DC 10 Society check to realize it
represents a crude map of Otari. On a critical success,
the hero notes several arrows that indicate plans of
attack from the direction of Fogfen.
Creatures: Boss Skrawng is always here, splitting
his time between berating other Mudlickers within
earshot, playing with his pet giant solifugid Bite Bite,
sleeping on his throne, or planning attacks on Otari in
his sand pile. If Boss Skrawng knows about the heroes
in the vicinity, he sits on his throne at attention with
Bite Bite at his side, ready to address them.
Boss Skrawng knew that it was just a matter of
time before heroes from Otari challenged him in his
domain, but he seems surprised that it happened
before he actually did anything to the town.
Unlike the other mitﬂits, Boss Skrawng
speaks Common, and he imperiously
demands to know why the heroes have
come to bother him before he attacked
Otari. If he realizes the heroes didn’t
come to confront him, he pathetically
backpedals, insisting that he has no plans
to attack and that he’s harmless and friendly.
He punctuates this reversal by using his trident
to scatter the map of Otari at his feet. Canny
heroes who can Lie to Boss Skrawng about their
reasons for being here can talk to him and perhaps
ﬁnd out some of what he knows about Gauntlight
Keep (page 29), but it doesn’t take long before Boss
Skrawng’s negligible bravery and greater impatience
prompt him to begin his assault on Otari by attacking
the heroes.
If combat breaks out, Boss Skrawng orders his
minions into melee, but he hangs back to use his
blowgun from behind the cover of his throne. At
the end of each of Boss Skrawng’s turns, the throne
shakes and shudders dangerously. It doesn’t collapse
unless a hero damages it (the throne has AC 10,
Hardness 2, and 3 HP). If the throne collapses,
Boss Skrawng becomes ﬂustered. He immediately
falls prone and must spend at least 1 action during
each of his next 3 turns sputtering and cursing in
Undercommon. Boss Skrawng gives up and begs for
mercy if he’s reduced to 5 or fewer Hit Points, but
his followers ﬁght to the death to demonstrate their
devotion to Boss Skrawng while he lives.

What Boss Skrawng Knows: If the heroes can get Boss
Skrawng to talk, he has useful information. He knows
about all the dangers in areas A1 to A10, the giant
scorpion in A14, and the “swamp dragon” that lives
under the boathouse (area A16). He also knows about
the “bogeys” in the keep, warning the heroes about
the haunts in area A7 and the glowing “ghosts” in area
A15. He never visited the outbuilding on the island to
the northwest, but mentions that a boat full of people
(whom he can describe as “big and sneaky-looking”)
came to visit it a week ago. The visitors went into the
SIDE QUESTS
Some of the locations in the Abomination Vaults list
side quests the heroes can pick up, usually after
interacting with an NPC or discovering a clue. If
the heroes complete a side quest, they earn an XP
award for a moderate accomplishment (30 XP) in
addition to any rewards the side quest grants, such
as treasure or useful information.
swamp dragon’s cave while the dragon was out, but the
dragon returned soon thereafter; Boss Skrawng assumes
the people got eaten.
If asked about Gauntlight’s eerie glow, Boss
Skrawng’s eyes get big, and he shakes his head,
warning the heroes that the light is the creepiest
haunting of them all. He conﬁrms that every night, the
light glows, and he worries that there might be a big
ghost up there.
Boss Skrawng also conﬁrms that the Mudlickers
used to live in a dungeon level beneath Gauntlight
Keep, but that a bunch of “mushroom-eyed people”
(morlocks, although the mitﬂits don’t know them by
that name) chased them up here many nights ago.
Boss Skrawng can provide a crude map of the ﬁrst
level and a partial map of the second if the heroes can
successfully Request or Coerce the favor from him
and supply him with the means to write out a map. A
bribe of at least 2 gp automatically gets Boss Skrawng
feeling helpful enough to provide these maps. His map
of the ﬁrst level omits areas A12 to A13, areas A19 to
A23, area A25, and all of the secret doors. His map of
the second level is obviously much less complete. It
only shows the areas once dwelt in by the Mudlickers:
areas B8 to B14 and areas B16 to B19 (although he
warns the heroes that a big swamp dragon lives in the
cave at area B19).
Side Quest: Boss Skrawng hates the “mushroom‑eyed
people” and promises the heroes a big pile of shiny
gems if they go downstairs, kill them all, and defeat
their king. He describes the king as a “magic priest
mushroom-eyed guy who can hurt your brain just
by looking at you.” Boss Skrawng doesn’t actually
have any shiny gems, and if the heroes do his quest
and return with proof, he realizes that the heroes are
tougher than the morlocks and that he made a terrible
mistake in promising them treasure he doesn’t have.
He instead throws himself at their mercy and agrees to
abandon his plots against Otari forever.

A11. GAUNTLIGHT BASE
MODERATE 1
The heroes ﬁnd the southern door to this room stuck,
but a character can attempt a DC 18 Athletics check to
Force it Open. Once opened, it falls to sodden pieces.
The western door has a 1-foot-square window set with
iron bars, and it opens normally.
The smooth walls of this circular room are painted a light
gray with no indication of seams between blocks of stone.
A set of iron stairs winds upward along the curved walls
before terminating at a trap door in the ceiling nearly a
hundred feet above. A red bloodstain glistens on the ﬂoor
at the room’s center, as though a human-sized creature
bled to death on the ﬂoor very recently, despite there being
no body in sight.
The Roseguard ﬁnally defeated Belcorra in this room
nearly ﬁve centuries ago. As she died, Belcorra’s spirit
was drawn down into the depths of the Abomination
Vaults through Gauntlight, but the bloodstain she left
on the ﬂoor remains as fresh as the day she died.
During daylight hours, the fresh blood ripples
occasionally; its slick, red surface appears like the
top of a deep pool, but it’s harmless despite this eerie
movement. At night, the bloodstain acts as the hazard
described below.
The iron stairs creak and sway alarmingly but are
quite sound. As part of Gauntlight’s structure, the
stairs can’t take damage as long as Belcorra’s ghost
remains active. The stairs wind up 90 feet to a locked
bronze trap door leading to the cupola in area A25. A
hero can Pick the Lock and open the trap door with
four successful DC 25 Thievery check or can use the
key hidden in area A13.
Hazard: This haunt can activate only at night. A
hero who has seen a depiction of Belcorra elsewhere
in the Abomination Vaults can recognize the haunt’s
appearance; otherwise, a successful DC 20 Society
check conﬁrms her identity.

creature ends its turn in area A11 at night; Eﬀect A
ghastly image of Belcorra, seemingly composed of fresh
blood, rises from the bloodstain on the ﬂoor and rotates
in place like a lighthouse. Beams of cold blue light shine
from Belcorra’s eyes and open mouth, causing blisters
and decay to spread across ﬂesh. Living creatures within
a 30-foot burst from the center of area A11 must attempt
a DC 20 Fortitude save. The haunt then rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes 1d8 negative damage.
Failure The creature takes 1d8+6 negative damage and
is dazzled for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature takes 2d8+6 negative
damage and is blinded for 1 round then dazzled for
1 round.
Routine (1 action) The bloody image opens its mouth and
appears to inhale, drawing blood from the body of one
creature in its line of sight within 90 feet from the center
of area A11. The creature targeted must attempt a DC 20
Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes 1d10 persistent bleed damage.
Failure The creature takes 1d10+6 persistent bleed damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes 2d10+6 persistent
bleed damage and is enfeebled 2 as long as it’s bleeding.
Reset If the haunt is disabled or destroyed through damage,
the bloody phantom of Belcorra sprays upward in a
spiral, dousing the trap door leading to area A25 before
draining upward through the keyhole, which reduces the
Thievery DC to Pick the Lock to 20. At the next sunrise,
the blood drains back down to this room and the haunt
resets. The haunt is destroyed permanently once Lasda
Venkervale is rescued from area D9.
A12. BELCORRA’S OFFICE
The ceiling has collapsed in the southwest corner of this
room. The walls bear several shelves, but the books and
papers once kept here have rotted to ruin long ago due to
exposure to the elements, as have the wooden desk and
chair in an alcove to the northeast.
A hero Searching this room who succeeds at a
DC 20 Perception check locates the secret door in
the east wall, where a rotating shelf functions as the
door’s handle. Beyond, a ﬂight of stairs leads down
to area B6.
Treasure: A hero Searching the desk automatically
notes a hidden drawer that has fallen partially open,
revealing a few still-potent alchemical elixirs Belcorra
stashed here: a lesser comprehension elixir, a minor
elixir of life, and a lesser skeptic’s elixir (page 214).

A13. BELCORRA’S SANCTUM
This triangular room might have once seemed comfortable,
but after years of rain and exposure to the elements
through the two arrow slits in the northwestern wall, the
room’s divan, armoire, and tapestries have fallen to decay.
Belcorra maintained this private room to relax and
constructed a secret entrance to the shrine to easily
access it. A rusted ring of keys sits under the divan, and
any hero Searching this room ﬁnds it. Rust has ruined
six of its iron keys, but two bronze keys remain usable:
the one decorated with a lighthouse unlocks the trap
door to Gauntlight’s cupola (area A25), and the other
decorated with a book unlocks the door to Belcorra’s
private reading room (area C27).
A tapestry formerly concealed a secret door, but
it rotted and fell long ago, so the door has become
slightly easier to ﬁnd. A hero Searching this room
who succeeds at a DC 16 Perception check locates the
secret door that leads into a small area that connects to
the shrine. Characters can obviously spot the second,
partly ajar secret door within this space, as described
in area A15.
A14. SCORPION KENNEL
MODERATE 1
The ceiling of this room has fallen in two places. A smaller
collapse destroyed a ﬂight of stairs that once led up to the
now-ruined upper ﬂoor. A larger collapse mostly buried the
southern double door, leaving a hole in the roof partially
blocked with several crossed timbers. A second double
door to the north has a stone face carved with skulls caked
with tangles of moss.
This room serves as a kennel for the Mudlickers’
ﬁrst signiﬁcant acquisition—a giant scorpion. The
mitﬂits lured the monster into this room with minimal
loss, then collapsed several timbers in the rubble to
keep it penned in. A Medium or smaller creature can
clamber through this tangle, but unless it’s signiﬁcantly
tormented, the giant scorpion won’t think to smash
through the timbers to leave the room.
Although the tangles of moss growing on the skull
carvings seem like part of the overgrowth prevalent
throughout the ruin, they belong to the original
design. The mossy skull is the religious symbol of
the Nhimbaloth, the Outer God of ghosts, despair,
swamps, and will‑o’-wisps, whom Belcorra reveres
as her patron. Nhimbaloth’s lore is rare and hidden,
however, so a hero must succeed at a DC 25 Religion
check to Recall Knowledge to identify the mossy skull
as Nhimbaloth’s symbol. Although ﬂedgling heroes
might not recognize evidence of Nhimbaloth, Wrin
Sivinxi in town knows of the sinister Outer God and
can enlighten the heroes if they report their ﬁndings
to her.
Creatures: The mitﬂits keep the giant scorpion well
fed and content, but it attacks other creatures at once.
It can skitter easily over the rubble in this room and
doesn’t treat it as difﬁcult terrain. The scorpion can
climb the rubble to the south and Force Open a path to
pursue heroes with a successful DC 18 Athletics check
if necessary, but it’s unlikely to do so unless attackers
are harrying it from the other side of the rubble.
The scorpion is a particularly dangerous foe for
1st-level characters, so you might encourage the
heroes to retreat if they’re having a hard time with
it and have the scorpion retreat back to this room
rather than pursue ﬂeeing heroes very far.

A15. NHIMBALOTH SHRINE
SEVERE 1
The air in this large chapel feels colder and damper than
elsewhere in the ruins. Condensed beads on the walls
run in rivulets across the countless skulls carved into the
stone. A moldering human corpse lies slumped against a
wall, his hands wedged into a crack as if he died trying to
pry a brick loose. Three short ﬂights of steps lead upward
to a wider chamber to the north, where a semicircular
dais supports an altar of white stone. Beyond the altar
loom four stained-glass windows, each twenty feet tall
and depicting four haunting scenes of ghosts rising from
overgrown graveyards toward a four-pointed orange star
high above.
Belcorra made no secret of her faith in Nhimbaloth,
and she maintained this sizable shrine to the sinister
entity both as a place of worship and an intimidating
setting to meet visitors. The shrine has an ominous
atmosphere, as if something immense and distant
watches through the stained glass windows. A hero can
identify this room as a shrine to Nhimbaloth with a
successful DC 25 Religion check to Recall Knowledge.
The corpse to the south lies slumped next to the
secret door leading to area A13. Once a human man,
this thief snuck into the temple through the secret doors
from area A13 months ago in search of a treasure, only
to ﬁnd himself outclassed by the corpselights lurking
in this room. He perished just before could reopen
the secret door to escape from them. The thief left the
door slightly ajar with the rotating skull that opens it

still slightly turned, so the heroes can easily spot this
secret door.
Creatures: Two long-dead acolytes of Nhimbaloth
have decomposed into little more than mossy skeletons
sprawled along the eastern edge of the large chamber
to the north, initially out of sight of anyone entering
from the south. They’re far from harmless, however,
as they harbor eerie creatures called corpselights.
The corpselights rise when the heroes approach the
northern chamber. They ﬁght until destroyed but don’t
pursue heroes who ﬂee. The ﬁrst corpselight to fall and
be reduced to its wisp form animates the corpse of the
dead thief at the secret door if it’s still available—or in
an even darker turn, a dead hero!
CORPSELIGHTS (2)
CREATURE 2
Page 232
Initiative Perception +7
Treasure: The thief’s corpse has several items of
value, including a +1 rapier, four daggers, a silver
ring worth 5 gp, a minor healing potion, and a
lesser darkvision elixir. The acolyte skeletons have
little remaining that hasn’t rotted or rusted away to
uselessness with two exceptions: one of them has a
gold tooth worth 4 gp still in its jaw, while the other
acolyte wears a channel protection amulet around its
bony neck.
A hero Searching the altar who succeeds at a DC 18
Perception check ﬁnds a secret panel on its northern
side, which has a shallow nook that contains a scroll
of restore senses and a 1st-level wand of heal.
A16. RUINED BOATHOUSE
A hero who takes a close look at the doors to this
boathouse notices that one of them has been forced
open and then carefully closed again within the past
couple of weeks.
The southern portion of this stonewalled building has
collapsed into rubble, exposing what remains of a
boathouse to the elements. The shelves and boats within
have decayed into heaps of rot and moss. The remains of a
relatively fresh campﬁre smolder faintly.
The campﬁre’s remnants hint at the presence of a
group of thieves from Otari—a band from Crook’s
Nook (page 14) who came here several days ago after
hearing rumors of treasure stashed in a cavern under
the island. They entered area B19 below only to get
in over their heads when they were trapped in the
dungeon and imprisoned by some of the Ghost Queen
morlocks there.
A17. RUINED PIER
Much of this wooden pier has collapsed into the swamp,
leaving about ten feet of moldy, soggy boards slumped
against ancient wood pilings. A rowboat tied to a piling
looks much more recently built.
The rowboat, left here by the Crook’s Nook thieves,
is in good condition. The heroes can use it to navigate
the waters around the ruins, and heroes Searching
the rowboat ﬁnd two things. The ﬁrst is a stash of
pastries—smoked salmon in a ﬁsh-shaped doughy
exterior; a hero who succeeds at a DC 12 Society
check recognizes the “ﬁshcakes” as those sold at the
Crook’s Nook in Otari. The second is a carving of a
ﬂying bird decorating the inside of the boat near the
bow. A hero who succeeds at a DC 16 Society check
recognizes that this mark belongs to the Osprey Club,
Otari’s thieves’ guild (a critical success conﬁrms that
the Osprey Club uses Crook’s Nook as a headquarters
and that guild members bear the mark of the ﬂying
bird as a tattoo).
If the heroes come here after dark, the ﬂickerwisp
at area A24 ﬂickers in an attempt to lure them closer.
An opening under the pier leads to area B19. At
your discretion, the river drake Freznelkesh might
venture out to hunt in the Fogfen and spot the heroes
while they’re nearby. Freznelkesh is a difﬁcult foe for
a party of 1st-level characters, so you should have the
river drake take off to pursue larger, safer prey in the
swamp if the heroes are having a tough time dealing
with her.
Side Quest: Should the heroes visit Crook’s Nook
and ask about the boat, Yinyasmera admits that four
of her “employees” went missing several days ago. She
promises a 50 gp reward if the heroes can ﬁnd out what
happened to them and bring them back. One thief died
(area B14), and the morlocks have kept the other three
as prisoners (area B24).
A18. APPRENTICE ISLAND
A low wooden bridge spans a watery gap between the
larger island and a smaller one. A single-story building sits
amid the thick reeds growing on the smaller island.
The building on this islet originally served as the
home of Belcorra’s apprentice, a drow named Volluk
Azrinae. Volluk no longer lives here, but he still
serves Belcorra in the chambers deep below, having
transcended from the limitations of his humanoid
form to become a worm that walks (he now resides
in area D8).

A19. SPOOKYWISP
TRIVIAL 1
The exterior door to this room is stuck, requiring a
successful DC 15 Athletics check to Force Open.
This study features several bookshelves, a desk, and two
chairs. The books and objects here lie in disarray with torn
pages strewn haphazardly across the room.
Volluk once pursued his studies and met with
Belcorra for lessons in this room.
Creatures: Today, a mischievous brownie named
Tangletop—a puckish fey whose eponymous blonde
hair stays in a constant state of frizzy disarray on his
head—occupies this chamber. Despite his comical
appearance, Tangletop fancies himself something of a
spooky sort of fey. As soon as he notices the heroes
approaching, such as if they try to Force Open the
door but don’t succeed at doing so right away, he
quickly slips into hiding under the desk before using
ventriloquism to call out in a deep voice. He claims to
be a dangerous “wispy-ghost” named “Spookywisp.”
He then uses dancing lights to create what he hopes
the heroes believe is a will-o’-wisp, ﬂoating the light
up in the air and using ventriloquism to cast his voice
from the light.
Tangletop arrived here only a few days
ago, but he made short work ripping
through the room’s contents before
ﬁnding nothing of interest to
him. He moved on toward area
A23; there, the shiny spyglass
entranced him before the
soulbound doll that guards
it chased him off. Faced with
an actually scary creature,
Tangletop retreated to this
room to plot methods of
securing
the
“shiny”
for
himself. The heroes give him that
method—see the Side Quest below.
If the heroes attack or confront him
with violence, Tangletop shrieks in fear
and ﬂees toward area A23, hoping
to lure the heroes into that room
so that they inadvertently end up
destroying the soulbound doll.
If they do, he tries to steal the
“shiny” therein before ﬂeeing the
area forever.
TANGLETOP
CREATURE 1
Male brownie (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 44)
Initiative Stealth +9
Side Quest: If the heroes speak to Tangletop, either
in person or via his persona as Spookywisp, the
brownie explains to them that he wants the “shiny”
in the room to the southwest. He warns the heroes
that a mean, beak-faced doll will try to stop them
from getting the “shiny,” but he promises that he’ll
tell the heroes three secrets he has learned about the
area if they bring him the “shiny.” Asked to describe
the “shiny,” Tangletop frustratingly says, “It’s shiny!
You’ll know it when you see it!” Pressed further, he
rolls his eyes and describes it as a “sparkling glowing
tube that I want, want, want!”
The “shiny” refers to the bejeweled spyglass kept
on display in area A23. If the heroes retrieve and hand
it over, the brownie reveals what he recently learned
from the books here as well as from reviewing the
paintings in the hallway between here and the room
where he spotted the spyglass.
First, this building used to belong to someone named
Volluk Azrinae. Second, Volluk was an apprentice to
someone else named Belcorra, and even though this
Volluk person seemed like someone who was mean
and dangerous, Belcorra seemed much worse! Finally,
the spooky magic lighthouse can do more than just
shine an eerie light; it can also shoot a beam
full of ghosts (this last description is based
on Tangletop’s interpretation of the
lighthouse painting in area A22,
but it isn’t far from the truth).
A20. REPAIR STORAGE
Shelves laden with tools, lumber,
and planks line the walls of this
ten-foot-square room.
These supplies were used
for upkeep throughout the
upper
works
of
Gauntlight
Keep. Volluk formerly functioned as a
head groundskeeper and managed repairs.
Considering such mundane tasks beneath his
skills, he often called upon Belcorra’s other
servants as needed for these jobs.
Treasure: Heroes Searching this room
discover a large silver key worth 10 gp.
This key unlocks the door to area B2.
A21. STAIRWELL
Moss and fungus coats these tightly spiraling stairs,
which lead down to area B1. From the state of
the growth, it’s obvious that no one has gone
this way for a long time.

A22. HALL OF PORTRAITS
A series of four paintings hang on the
northwestern wall of this hallway,
although layers of mold and decay
have severely damaged them.
The
paintings
along
the wall have sustained
irrevocable damage over
time and due to moisture
dripping
down
from
leaks in the roof.
The ﬁrst painting is
enormous, nearly 7 feet
tall and almost as wide. It’s
a landscape painting that
depicts the city of Absalom in
ﬂames with ghosts rising from the
city streets between the burning
buildings. The picture’s lower frame
bears a bronze plaque that reads, “So Shall the
Fools Suffer.”
The second painting is nearly as large as the Absalom
painting and is in the same style, though its subject
is different. This second painting depicts Gauntlight
Keep as it appeared before its upper ﬂoors collapsed.
The lighthouse rises above the stately keep into the
night sky, with its beacon emitting a pale blue light
in which ghostly faces sneer and grimace. Its bronze
plaque reads, “Let the Light Shine Forever.”
The third picture is a portrait that once depicted
Volluk but is now totally shredded. Volluk destroyed
it after becoming a worm that walks. Its plaque reads,
“The Artist at Work.”
The fourth and ﬁnal portrait is smaller and circular.
It depicts a smirking woman dressed in a red gown
with a high collar—an image of Belcorra herself. Its
plaque reads, “The Lady of the Light.” Long ago,
Volluk scratched the following sentences, written in
Aklo, into the stone next to this last painting: “I serve
you still! You shall be avenged!”
A23. LENS WORKSHOP
MODERATE 1
This once elegant workshop has fallen into shambles.
Soggy strings of dripping moss hang through cracks in the
wooden domed roof above. Below it, a carpet of broken
glass glitters dangerously. Workbenches and shelves,
armatures and displays—all formerly used in crafting or
repairing immense lenses for a lighthouse—lie in ruins.
Only a bejeweled spyglass sitting on a display rack near
the southern wall has survived the devastation.
Volluk caused most of this destruction. After
Belcorra’s death, he hid in the swamp while he
waited for the Roseguard to leave. When
he returned, he was ﬁlled with such guilt
over his cowardice that he destroyed
this workshop in a ﬁt of fury.
The layer of broken glass
and
shattered
materials
covering the ﬂoor makes
it uneven ground (Core
Rulebook 476) with an
Acrobatics DC of 11. A
creature who falls prone
while in this room takes 1
piercing damage.
Creatures: Volluk created
several
constructs
to
aid
him and his mistress in their
day‑to‑day jobs, but the raven-headed,
raven-winged soulbound doll he called
Mister Beak was his favorite. Neither the
most powerful nor the most helpful, Mister Beak
held the soul of his devoted servant, a goblin named
Borbo, a fact that ensured the construct’s place at
Volluk’s side. Today, Mister Beak remains abandoned
here, waiting forever for a creator who moved on to
other tasks and an entirely new body. Mister Beak
hasn’t lost hope, and when the heroes enter the room,
he stands up from the slumped mound in the room’s
center and asks in a warbling voice, “Is Master
Azrinae coming back?” Regardless of the heroes’
answer, Mister Beak realizes none of them are its
creator; it then leaps into the air on ﬂapping wings
to attack in a frustrated fury, ﬁghting until destroyed.
Mister Beak is a unique variant of a soulbound doll
with ungainly wings that he can nevertheless use to
ﬂy. He can therefore easily avoid the uneven ground
in this room.

Treasure: The bejeweled spyglass was Volluk’s ﬁnest
creation apart from the lenses for Gauntlight. Even in
his self-loathing rage, Volluk couldn’t bring himself to
smash this treasure. The spyglass is the “shiny” that
Tangletop seeks. If the heroes decide to keep it, the
spyglass has a value of 20 gp.
Mister Beak’s soul focus gem is located on his back,
nestled between his wings. The gem is worth 5 gp
but might prove more valuable as a potential source
of information if the heroes place it in the partially
completed soulbound doll in area B2.
A24. OLD PIER
LOW 1
This old wooden pier has partially collapsed into the
swamp, and the portion remaining above water looks
ready to follow the rest at the slightest touch.
The pier is just as dangerous as it looks;
anyone stepping onto it causes the entire pier to give
way and fall into the 3 feet of water beneath it. The
sucking mud beneath it is greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: A single ﬂickerwisp dwells amid the
rotting ruins of this old pier. When it notices the heroes,
it begins to glow and writhe, appearing alternately as
a string of ﬂickering ﬁreﬂies or a rippling ribbon of
light just above the gaping hole in the pier. Anyone
who steps onto this section of the pier runs the risk of
falling through, and the ﬂickerwisp quickly attacks a
victim who gets stuck in the mud. The ﬂickerwisp is
eager to sup on frustration and confusion; it doesn’t
retreat once a ﬁght begins, even if it’s outmatched.

A25. GAUNTLIGHT CUPOLA
MODERATE 1
Rows of black metal bars encase this circular chamber
like a cage. Shimmering waves of force ﬂicker between
the bars and gives the illusion that softly glowing glass
encases this entire area. The ﬂoor to the north has an iron
trapdoor; otherwise, this room appears empty save for a
human-sized encasement of glass and iron that ﬂickers
and glows with an unsettling, almost nauseating pale blue
shimmer—Gauntlight’s lantern!
The locked trap door in the ﬂoor of this room leads
down to area A11, marked with an “F” on the map.
Creatures: If the heroes enter this area after
defeating the blood of Belcorra haunt in area A11
below, that blood has slithered and ﬂowed over
Gauntlight’s lantern. As the heroes enter the chamber,
it slides off the lantern and transforms into a ravenous
blood-drinking vampiric mist which attacks at once,
ﬁghting to the death.
This encounter can repeat as often as the heroes
continue to trigger and defeat the haunt in area A11
below, but it doesn’t occur more than once per night.

CHAPTER 2:
The Forgotten Dungeon
While the heroes are free to enter the dungeon below
the keep as soon as they discover any of its entrances,
an important event should take place before they dive
too deeply into the Abomination Vaults. It’s best if this
event takes place at night while the heroes have line of
sight to Gauntlight’s cupola, such as when they retreat
to rest or perhaps even right after they’ve defeated
the vampiric mist in area A25. In any case, the heroes
should be 2nd level for this event. When the timing is
right, begin Deadtide for Otari.
Deadtide for Otari
Gauntlight isn’t yet fully functional, but enough of
its magical power has been restored that Belcorra
activates it as a test ﬁring before proceeding with
the more-involved process of restoring the artifact
to full use. She targets Otari’s graveyard, animating
the dead within it. The ghost then watches through
Gauntlight’s lens, but she can’t do much beyond
observe, limited as she is to the site of her haunting
deep in the Abomination Vaults. Read or paraphrase
the following to begin this event.
Gauntlight shudders and its light suddenly blazes with a
sickly, pale-blue illumination. This beam arcs south, falling
not directly on Otari, but onto the sprawling graveyard
located at Otari’s western edge.
The light remains ﬁxed on the graveyard and is
visible all the way from Gauntlight to the town. There
isn’t any way for the heroes to impede the beam, as
it emanates magically from Gauntlight and can’t be
stopped from its origin point except by Belcorra’s will.
As the dead are buried, it takes most of them some
time to dig free. Although the heroes might hurry
directly to the graveyard given the sinister implications
of the eerie light, you can still run these events as
written if the heroes ﬁrst take some time to tend to their
wounds or otherwise delay. If the heroes take more
than a couple of hours to arrive, town guards have
already erected a barrier around the cemetery but are
afraid to enter the grounds for fear of the occasional
shufﬂing corpse that pulled itself free sooner than
the others. Dealing with the undead should fall to
the heroes; if they aren’t self-motivated to enter the
