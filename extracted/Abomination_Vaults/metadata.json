      "title": "The Forgotten Dungeon While the heroes are free to enter the dungeon below the keep as soon as they discover any of its entrances, an important event should take place before they dive too deeply into the Abomination Vaults. It\u2019s best if this event takes place at night while the heroes have line of sight to Gauntlight\u2019s cupola, such as when they retreat to rest or perhaps even right after they\u2019ve defeated the vampiric mist in area A25. In any case, the heroes should be 2nd level for this event. When the timing is right, begin Deadtide for Otari. Deadtide for Otari Gauntlight isn\u2019t yet fully functional, but enough of its magical power has been restored that Belcorra activates it as a test \ufb01ring before proceeding with",

Ceilings are 8 feet high in halls and 10 feet high in rooms, although the largest rooms and halls have vaulted ceilings that rise to 12 feet high.

Belcorra trawled the Darklands for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations, but their feral power wasn\u2019t enough for her. She needed to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces forged for battle, in body and in mind. The \ufb01fth level thus included a massive arena and training grounds where gladiators would \ufb01ght for the right to lead her monstrous troops. In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth",

The two activities weren\u2019t all that separate since the most powerful of the monsters created in the laboratories fought in the arena, where the survivors joined Belcorra\u2019s growing ranks of monsters to assault Absalom. Conversely, failures in the arena became fodder for further experiments in the laboratories. When Belcorra died, the overbearing control of a bone devil named Tarkannah initially kept in\ufb01ghting on this level at a minimum, but many creatures chafed at Tarkannah\u2019s control. The seugathi \ufb02eshwarper Jafaki organized a coup and murdered the bone devil,",

Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further offered to train Belcorra\u2019s armies and lead her invasion of Absalom\u2014for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani, legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has, for reasons even Urevian doesn\u2019t know, special value to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian\u2019s aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani\u2019s soul. When the Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right to Belcorra\u2019s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing Rajani\u2019s soul to a much more powerful entity\u2014even though he didn\u2019t yet have it.

Belcorra penetrated deep underground to build Gauntlight\u2019s foundation, following the psychic pull of the Empty Vault, a place sacred to Nhimbaloth at the heart of an ancient, subterranean temple. Gauntlight draws upon the energies of the Empty Vault as its foundation and the source of its powers. Within the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above, focus Nhimbaloth\u2019s attention and unleash the artifact\u2019s full power. But the fulcrum lenses are dangerous; they invite Nhimbaloth\u2019s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra can\u2019t withstand the scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus, though they hold great power, the fulcrum lenses are",

As Belcorra dug the Abomination Vaults deeper, she found an extensive system of caverns. Unlike the self-contained Farm level, these caverns were truly wild. At \ufb01rst, she fought against the \ufb01erce denizens and tried to close off the passages to deeper places, but the task was futile. She dubbed the place the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save for building alliances with the communities there. Belcorra established only a few strongholds in the area, including a lodge, a vault, and the entrance to the Gate of Nhimbaloth, the subterranean temple holding the Empty Vault and the source of Gauntlight\u2019s power.",

Was it the hub of a cult cast deep into the earth by some ancient enemy, or the headquarters of a Darklands cabal? No matter its original purpose, the complex series of initiation trials are the last challenges that the heroes must face to confront Belcorra. The \ufb01rst is the Challenge of Souls, where unworthy initiates were poisoned, tormented, and had their souls extracted. The second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the Swamp, where initiates demonstrated their mastery over swampland dangers. The heroes are likely to face these",
