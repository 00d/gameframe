CHAPTER 10:
To Draw the Baleful Glare
Perhaps a few of the vaults’ inhabitants know the true
story of Nhimbaloth’s ancient temple—notably Lady’s
Whisper and maybe a dread wisp or two—but none
will tell the tale. Was it the hub of a cult cast deep into
the earth by some ancient enemy, or the headquarters of
a Darklands cabal? No matter its original purpose, the
complex series of initiation trials are the last challenges
that the heroes must face to confront Belcorra. The ﬁrst
is the Challenge of Souls, where unworthy initiates were
poisoned, tormented, and had their souls extracted. The
second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced
their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the
Swamp, where initiates demonstrated their mastery over
swampland dangers. The heroes are likely to face these
in order only if guided by Lady’s Whisper; otherwise,
they’re free to tackle them in whatever order they’d like.
Beyond lies the Empty Vault, Belcorra’s domain and the
source of Gauntlight’s powers.
Temple Features
The temple is wholly dark, except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are generally 15 feet high but reach
60 feet in the main chambers (areas J1, J9, J14, J18,
and J20). The stone doors all bear intricate carvings,
such as a moss-ﬁlled skull, swirling mists, or detailed
swamp scenes, as well as clusters of seven divots.
Lady’s Whisper controls the doors here.
The map of the Temple level appears on page 194.
J1. FIRST CHALLENGE
A basin ﬁlled with reeds and moss stands in an alcove
between doors that lead to the north. Two metal tubes
jut into the room from the east, each sealed oﬀ by some
iris-like mechanism a foot or so inside the pipe. No method
of opening these mechanisms is visible. Black stone doors
lead south, and a single gray stone door carved with shapes
of swirling mist leads west. None of the doors have handles
or latches.
The tests begin with the Challenge of Souls through
the western door. The metal tubes slant downward
and drain into the swamp (area J15). They’re just large
enough for a Medium creature to slide down. If the

heroes enter here with Lady’s Whisper, the skeleton
silently points at the gray door. That door opens with a
push or simply swings aside if someone stands in front
of it for 1 round. The doors to the south (Hardness 15,
Hit Points 60) and the tubes’ mechanical iris openings
(Hardness 18, Hit Points 72) are all shut and don’t
open unless Lady’s Whisper wills it.
If dread wisps are following the heroes, one of them
takes a position above the basin to silently report
everything the heroes do here to Belcorra.
Passing the Challenge of Souls: When the heroes
return here having either fed or defeated the dread
wisps in area J8, Lady’s Whisper opens the doors to the
south and leaves them open. A hero who succeeds at a
DC 27 Perception check to Sense Motive realizes that
Lady’s Whisper is offended that the heroes passed the
test but is keeping this irritation suppressed.
J2. POISONING ROOM
MODERATE 10
At the eastern end of this long room stands a giant jade
statue of a cracked and chipped skeleton in a burial shroud.
The skull clenches a bundle of swamp weeds in its teeth.
Built into the walls are several narrow slits and stone doors.
A hero who Investigates the statue and succeeds at a
DC 25 Religion check realizes that it’s a rare physical
representation of Nhimbaloth.
Long ago, initiates were commanded to kneel
before Nhimbaloth. When they did, cultists hiding in
the galleries shot poisoned blowgun darts at them.
Those who didn’t succumb to poison were deemed to
be worthy and led south; those who succumbed were
taken north to have their souls harvested.
Creatures: Six cultists have arisen as specters.
They manifest in the shooting galleries with ghostly
blowguns, which they use in addition to their vile
touch Strikes to shoot ephemeral darts made of their
own ghostly substance. The narrow slits provide
anyone in the shooting galleries with greater cover
(+4 circumstance bonus to AC, Reﬂex saves against
area effects, and Stealth checks). If the heroes enter a
shooting gallery, the specters pass through the walls to
keep their distance. The specters ﬁght until destroyed.

corruption
J3. CLEANSING CHAMBER
Two grime-crusted copper tubs, devoid of water, stand
against the south wall.
Long abandoned, this chamber was once where
initiates who survived the poisoning room were
stripped, bathed with swamp water, and then escorted
into the worthies’ cave. A hero can discover the secret
door while Searching this room with a successful DC
25 Perception check. A false stone on the eastern wall
must be rotated to pivot open one of the copper tubs
and the wall behind it.
J4. WORTHIES’ CAVE
LOW 10
The ceiling of this natural chamber bears seven holes no
larger around than a human ﬁnger.
Before surviving initiates took the next challenge—
the Challenge of Despair—they were subjected to a
mind-numbing gas to make the test more difﬁcult.
The secret doors here both open the same way: when
rotated, a portion of the smooth, ﬂat wall makes the
door pivot open. The secret doors are each at the end
of short hallways, so they aren’t hard to ﬁnd. Anyone
Searching either short hall discovers the secret door
and the method of opening it. The doors won’t open,
however, if the room’s trap is active, so they must be
battered down (Hardness 18, Hit Points 60) to escape
the trap.
Hazard: The trap spews mind-numbing gas through
the seven holes in the ceiling.
THE PROCTOR
The heroes might go along with Lady’s Whisper at
ﬁrst, wondering just what the enigmatic undead
is asking of them. After they complete one or two
tests, they might decide they don’t want to be judged
worthy of Nhimbaloth’s attention after all. This is
especially true if they realize that each successful
test increases Lady’s Whisper’s displeasure and that
the undead plans to kill them.
Lady’s Whisper responds to any preemptive
attack by the heroes as though expecting it. The
undead attempts to levitate out of melee reach and
cast spells to eliminate the heroes. The lurking pair of
dread wisps that might have followed from area I64
join the ﬁght as well.

within the chamber must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or become
stupeﬁed 1 (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical failure). The trap then rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The gas intensiﬁes. Each creature in the room must make a DC

to the gas for 1 hour, though if the creature has already been stupeﬁed by
the trap, that condition remains for its normal duration.
Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Failure The creature becomes stupeﬁed 1 for 24 hours. If the target is already
stupeﬁed, the condition value increases by 1 (to a maximum of stupeﬁed 4)
and the target takes 8d6 mental damage.
Critical Eﬀect As failure, except the target takes double the mental damage.
Reset After an hour, the trap deactivates; the gas disperses slowly, and the doors can
be opened again. After 24 hours, the gas builds up and the trap can be triggered
once more.
J5. LEVEL TEN PORTAL CHAMBER
MODERATE 10
Belcorra added this room to the temple to connect her network of
permanent teleportation circles. Its door is locked, and the key is long lost.
A hero can Force it Open with a successful DC 25 Athletics check or Pick
the Lock with four successful DC 25 Thievery checks.
Swirling, silver-ﬁlled runes adorn the rounded walls of this chamber. Sheets of
reﬂective metal cover the ﬂoor and ceiling.
The heroes can reactivate this portal chamber and connect it to others
throughout the Abomination Vaults, as described in area B17.
Creatures: As the lowest portal chamber, Belcorra ensured this room
was well-guarded. A powerful stone golem is built into the wall, in an
open space between the silver-ﬁlled runes. It steps out and attacks anyone
who isn’t accompanying Belcorra.

CHAPTER 10 SYNOPSIS
The heroes have their ﬁnal
confrontation with Belcorra in this
chapter. On the way to the Empty
Vault, where Belcorra can be found,
they pass through several challenges
that aspirants of Nhimbaloth faced
back when this was an active temple
to the Empty Death. Ironically, this
lowest level of the Abomination
Vaults is one of the safest, in that its
denizens generally stay put and the
heroes can rest for as long as they
need in empty chambers. They’ll
need to be in top form to tackle
Belcorra; if they haven’t collected all
three fulcrum lenses by now, they
might need to retreat, recover them,
and face Belcorra again.
Environmental Cues: black stone,
carvings of bones or mist, clammy
air, eerie lights, fog, swamp plants

J6. CREMATORIUM
MODERATE 10
Two pools of bubbling magma sit side by side in the center
of this large chamber.
This crematorium is extremely hot (Core Rulebook
518), dealing 2d6 ﬁre damage every 10 minutes (the
scorpions are immune). Immersion in the 25-foot-deep
magma pools deals 20d6 ﬁre damage each round.
Creatures: Bound ﬁre elementals have maintained
the heat in this room for centuries. They climb out
of the magma pits to attack intruders, pursuing
aggressively and ﬁghting until destroyed.

J7. SOUL EXTRACTORS
MODERATE 10
This strange, irregular hall features several wide alcoves,
each with a standing rack bearing crystals and levers, like
bizarre torture devices.
Failed initiates were brought here and strapped to
the strange standing racks. These occult machines
extracted the initiates’ souls into crystal globes as
special glass golems sliced their bodies to pieces.
Cultists took the soul-infused globes (which were far
too delicate for the blade-handed golems to handle) to
the dread wisps in area J8.
Only three of the occult machines still function,
and each holds a crystal globe containing the soul of
an initiate killed centuries ago. A hero Investigating
a functional machine and succeeding at a DC 30
Occultism, Religion, or relevant Lore check (such as
Spirit Lore) realizes what the globes are
and how they were created.
Creatures: The four golems
remain here and do their
best to slice intruders to
ribbons. Their greenish
glass
bodies
emit
an unsettling glow,
giving them the Grim
Glittering ability instead
of Dazzling Brilliance.

Treasure: The three crystal globes are each about a

soul merchants, such as night hags. If smashed, their
fragments are valueless but the soul trapped within
travels to the Boneyard and its ultimate reward.
The three functioning machines contain some
valuable parts. With several hours’ work and a
successful DC 30 Crafting check, a hero can strip a
machine of rare metals and delicate gears worth 80 gp.
If this check is a critical success, the parts are worth
160 gp; on a critical failure, the parts in that machine
are ruined and valueless.
J8. DEVOURING CHAMBER
SEVERE 10
This large chamber has a spiny, dust-covered ﬂoor. On the far
western end is a large stone basin ﬁlled with swamp plants.
A thick layer of dust covers the shattered crystal
shards littering the ﬂoor, evidence of hundreds of
initiates’ extracted souls. The broken crystal makes the
ground difﬁcult terrain and inﬂicts a –5 circumstance
penalty to Stealth checks, but it isn’t dangerous to
anyone who isn’t barefoot. Barefoot creatures take 5
piercing damage at the end of each Stride in the room.
Creatures: Three powerful dread wisps called soul
feeders ﬂoat here. As extensions of the evil energies of
the Empty Vault (area J20), they funnel souls released
here into that chamber. They can’t return to the Empty
Vault, or even leave this room, without more souls.
When the heroes arrive, the bobbing wisps demand
that the heroes gather the crystal globes from the next
room and smash them here. They don’t admit that
doing so frees them to return to the Empty Vault but
might insist (truthfully) that doing so will cause them
to vanish from here. One soul feeder winks out for
each sphere the heroes smash; the heroes will face
them again in the Empty Vault.
If it becomes clear to the soul feeders that the heroes
aren’t going to comply, they attack the heroes in an
attempt to kill them and use their souls as the fuel for
the Empty Vault instead. Soul feeders gang up on one
hero at a time, moving on to another when their target
is dead. Each hero killed in this room returns one soul
feeder to the Empty Vault immediately.
SOUL FEEDERS (3)
CREATURE 10
Elite dread wisps (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 6, page 252)

Stolen Soul: A hero who dies in this room has a
portion of their soul stolen to power the Empty Vault.
The hero can be raised as normal, but they gain the
doomed 1 condition and can’t reduce their doomed
condition below 1 for a year.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for dealing with
these soul feeders and passing the Challenge of Souls.
J9. SECOND CHALLENGE
This chamber looks much like the room to the north, except
the gray door to the west is carved with frightened faces
rather than mist, and there are three metal tubes rather than
two. The basin of reeds and swamp water is to the south.
This is where initiates began the Challenge of
Despair. The south doors and mechanical iris openings
in the tubes are similar to those in area J1. The door
on the west wall is unlocked and leads to second test.
If Lady’s Whisper is leading the heroes through the
challenges, it points silently at the western door. The
second dread wisp shadowing Lady’s Whisper moves
to hover above the basin and silently report the heroes’
movements to Belcorra. Once the heroes are through
the door, Lady’s Whisper opens the doors to area J14
and awaits the heroes there, closing the doors after
moving through them.
J10. PATH OF PLEASANT MEMORIES
The walls of this long, narrow hall are momentarily stark
white, but colorful images soon swirl upon them. A door
stands at each end of the hall.
Occult magic powers the illusions here and along
the path that constitutes the Challenge of Despair
(areas J11 and J12). Each viewer sees different images,
as they’re all a hodgepodge of memories drawn from
the viewers’ mind. You might draw upon the heroes’
victories, friendships, and amusing encounters in this
Adventure Path to describe the images. A hero who
approaches the western door must attempt a DC 27
Will saving throw; on a failure, the hero is entranced by
the illusory images for 24 hours. While so entranced,
the hero takes a –10-foot penalty to all Speeds in areas
J10 to J12 and can’t Avert their Gaze from the images
in the same areas.
Two secret doors allowed cultists to cut quickly
between the challenges. Heroes Searching this hall
discover the secret door to the north with a successful
DC 25 Perception check and the secret door to the
south with a successful DC 30 Perception check. Each
is opened by manipulating a nearby section of the wall
that’s slightly darker than the surrounding stone. The
secret door to the south is one-way only; the heroes
can use it to access area J12 but can’t come back.

J11. PATH OF FAILURE
This path widens and turns south opposite the single
narrow door. Its walls are a riot of swirling images.
The occult magic in this hall pulls personalized
memories from the viewer, as in area J10, but these
memories are all failures: mentors scolding the viewer,
authorities punishing them, or lost friends crying. You
can also pull from any signiﬁcant failures a hero had
during this Adventure Path, such as needing to ﬂee a
signiﬁcant foe or triggering a damaging trap.
Hazard: This room’s images worm into the victim’s
mind. The heroes can Avert their Gaze (Core Rulebook
472) from these images and gain that action’s bonus
to saving throws required by this hazard, even though
these illusions are more than merely visual.
IMAGES OF FAILURE
HAZARD 12
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 35 (expert) to realize the illusory images conceal
a magical trap (noticing the images has a DC of 0)
Description Psychically enhanced illusions ﬂood the minds
of creatures in the 40-foot-long, 15-foot-wide hallway
(the white dotted box on the map) with memories of
their past failures.
Disable DC 32 Occultism (master) or dispel magic (5th
level; counteract DC 26) to weaken the images; three
successes are required to disable the trap
Echoes of Defeat Ȳ˓ (curse, emotion, enchantment, mental)
Trigger A creature ends a move action within the trap’s
area; Eﬀect The triggering creature takes 2d10+10
mental damage (DC 32 basic Will save) as it recalls its
past failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft
whisper oﬀering, “Let me take something from you and
I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access
to a random skill feat that isn’t a prerequisite for another
feat, and the creature doesn’t take further damage from
Echoes of Defeat. This eﬀect lasts for 1 week and can be
ended by eﬀects that remove curses.
Reset The trap resets immediately and can aﬀect the same
creature multiple times on the creature’s turn.
J12. PATH OF POWERLESSNESS
The walls, ﬂoor, and ceiling of this long hall swirl with
overlapping, shifting images.
This hall’s occult magic manifests images drawn
from the viewer’s mind, as in areas J10 and J11, but
these images predict failure in the future. Viewers see
themselves growing inﬁrm, succumbing to disease, or
falling in battle against Belcorra.
The secret door leading north doesn’t open from
this side. The secret door to the east is the only way
to leave and complete the Challenge of Despair; those
who couldn’t ﬁnd this hidden exit eventually died
from the torment in the images. Anyone more than
20 feet from the secret door can’t see it due to the
overlapping images, but anyone within 20 feet who
Seeks in the area discovers it with a successful DC 27
Perception check. A hero who Searches the hall (which
isn’t possible while the trap is active, as the heroes
are in encounter mode rather than exploration mode)
ﬁnds the secret door automatically.
Hazard: This trap is similar to the one in area J11,
though its area is much larger, as it ﬁlls the entire long
hallway. The heroes can also Avert their Gaze from the
images in this trap as well, if they choose.
IMAGES OF POWERLESSNESS
HAZARD 12
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 35 (expert) to realize the illusory images conceal

(the white dotted box on the map) with visions of their
failures yet to come.
Disable DC 32 Occultism (master) or dispel magic (5th
level; counteract DC 26) to weaken the images; three
successes are required to disable the trap
Flood of Despair Ȳ˓ (curse, emotion, enchantment, mental)
Trigger A creature ends a move action within the trap’s
area; Eﬀect The triggering creature takes 2d10+10 mental
damage (DC 32 basic Will save) as it considers its future
failures. A creature that takes damage hears a soft
whisper oﬀering, “Let me take something from you and
I can stop the pain.” A creature who agrees loses access
to a random class feat that isn’t a prerequisite for another
feat, and the creature doesn’t take further damage from
Flood of Despair. This eﬀect lasts for 1 week and can be
ended by eﬀects that remove curses. The creature also
immediately detects the secret door at the end of the hall,
no matter how far away from the end of the hall they are.
Reset The trap resets immediately and can aﬀect the same
creature multiple times on the creature’s turn.
J13. CHAMBER OF REFLECTION
The walls of this bare room are white and plain.
Initiates who passed the Challenge of Despair were
permitted to stop in this psychic refuge to recover
before facing the next test.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for reaching
this room after passing the Challenge of Despair.

J14. THIRD CHALLENGE
This large room has double doors of black stone to the
north and an enormous slab of rough-hewn rock blocking
passage to the south. Two metal tubes jut into this room
from the east wall. Both of their mechanical irises are open.
The slab of rock blocking the passage south is one
of two slabs that function as enormous doors. There’s
a gap of only a few inches between them. The doors
are particularly sturdy, and the only way for anyone
other than Lady’s Whisper to open them is to smash
them down (Hardness 20, 80 Hit Points each).
Passing the Challenge of Despair: Lady’s Whisper
meets the heroes who enter from area J13 here. A hero
who succeeds at a DC 22 Perception check to Sense
Motive realizes that Lady’s Whisper is angry that the
heroes passed. On a critical success, the hero realizes
that Lady’s Whisper plans to betray them if they keep
passing Nhimbaloth’s tests.
Lady’s Whisper points to the open pipes. When the
heroes exit through the pipes, it closes the iris portals
after them and then raises the stone slabs enough to
enter area C18, where it again waits for the heroes.

feet from area J1, 20 feet from area J9, and 15 feet
from area J14). In all cases, the drop is into reeking
swamp muck, so falling creatures take no damage but
draw the attention of this room’s inhabitants.
This massive cavern is a thick swamp, moist and stinking.
Seven rusted metal boxes are just visible within the dense
reeds of the swamp. The south end of the cavern is a
rounded metal dam that’s slid upward so only a constant
trickle of water dribbles from its top, near the ceiling.
Ancient gears on either side of the dam appear to lower
it, though streaks of rust show they haven’t moved in
quite some time. At the lower north end of the cavern, the
swamp water drains into a murky, ﬂooded room.
This room’s environment echoes the poisonous
terrain of Nhimbaloth’s dead world, Voidbracken. The
Challenge of the Swamp is simple: survive, ﬁnd the
way to open the dam, and enter area J17.
This area is difﬁcult terrain, as the water isn’t deep,
but the ground beneath it is sucking and treacherous.
Further, the air in the swamp is toxic. Any creature
starting its turn in the swamp must succeed at a DC
27 Fortitude saving throw or become sickened 2
(sickened 4 on a critical failure) and can’t reduce its
sickened condition while in the swamp. The creature
is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes, whether
or not it succeeded at the save. This is a poison effect.
Heroes Searching this area spot three rusted
metal pipes running just beneath the swamp water
and weeds. These connect to the rusty metal boxes
(marked on the map) and are part of the control
system to lower the dam. Heroes who succeed at a DC
25 Crafting, Engineering Lore, or Thievery check to
Recall Knowledge realize that the pipes are important
to controlling the dam; on a critical success, the hero
also realizes that they connect to controls further
north (in area J16).
Rusting Boxes: Each box has a single valve turned
sideways, pointing east to west. This is the “off”
position; turning it to point north to south (the way the
pipes run beneath them) puts it in the “on” position.
All seven boxes must be turned to the “on” position
before the control wheels in area J16 can turn. If your
players like puzzles, you can have each valve that’s
turned (in either direction) automatically turn all other
valves along its pipe and in its row as well; the players
then need to puzzle out how to turn them all “on.”
Creatures: Before the heroes can do much, they
must contend with a trio of chuuls imbued with
Voidbracken’s vile energy. The chuuls ﬁght until slain.
DESTROYING BELCORRA
Belcorra only stops rejuvenating once she completes
her goal of inﬂicting murderous revenge upon
Absalom—but there’s another way to end her villainy
for good. Nhimbaloth, the devourer of spirits, can
utterly annihilate the ghost so she troubles the
world no longer. Drawing the reclusive and inhuman
Nhimbaloth’s attention isn’t easy, but Belcorra laid the
groundwork for this by relying so heavily upon the
Ebon Fulcrum Lens. Nhimbaloth is already inclined
to turn her spirit-consuming attention to Belcorra
because Belcorra has made frequent use of the
glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence within the item.
The heroes must strengthen this contact by imbuing
Belcorra with the splinters of Nhimbaloth’s essence in
the Crimson Fulcrum Lens, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens,
and the Ochre Fulcrum Lens (it’s easier to do so via the
Fulcrum Lattice, but that item isn’t strictly required).
Each splinter gives Belcorra a bit more power, but all
three together (building upon her past use of the Ebon
Fulcrum Lens) draw Nhimbaloth’s dread gaze to her
ghostly devotee.

J16. PERILOUS CONTROLS
SEVERE 10
Swamp water ﬂoods much of this cave. Three small islands
each bear a metal box with a rusty wheel.
The murky water in this room looks no deeper
than the swamp in area J15, but the water is 25 feet
deep. The heroes will likely need to swim to reach the
islands. Fortunately, the air
in this cavern isn’t as toxic
as that in area J15 and no
saving throws are required for
breathing the air here.
The three wheels on the
islands control the dam in
area J15. If all are turned
fully clockwise (requiring three
Interact actions each) while all
the valves are positioned “on,”
the dam there grinds downward,
releasing a cascade of fetid swamp
water. This inﬂux raises the water level
here and in area J15 by several inches.
Creatures: Lurking under the water are
a pair of dread dhuthorexes that attempt to
ambush intruders and ﬁght to the death.

A circular pool of swamp water sits at the center of this
square chamber. The pool is fed by a channel in the west wall,
between two sets of black stone double doors. The water
ﬂows out to the north, through a metal dam. A thick knot of
writhing reeds, like a grotesque tree, rises from the pool.
The pool and channels are only six inches deep, which
is why the room ﬂoods so easily when the dam is closed.
Creature: The writhing here is caused by an isqulug
infestation. When the heroes arrive, the grotesque
aberration moves out of the reeds to attack. While a
malevolent creature, it isn’t afﬁliated with Nhimbaloth
and recalls very little about how its larvae came here ages
ago. If reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, the isqulug
casts control water to raise the water in this room by 10
feet and, it hopes, gain an advantage in the ﬁght. When
destroyed, its larvae scatter in the water and slip into the
swamp below—in time, to grow a new host body.

The vaulted ceiling of this massive chamber reaches eighty
feet high and is carved with intricate patterns of bones,
swamp weeds, and misty swirls. To the south stands a huge
dais, its stone carved into crooked, cracked teeth. Upon the
dais rests a massive skull, its eye sockets empty and its visage
menacing. A channel of ﬁlthy water cuts across this room,
emerging from the base of the walls on the east and west side.
Double doors bracket each channel outlet.
The wall behind the giant skull hides a secret door,
partially outlined in moisture and easier to find than
normal. A successful DC 20 Perception check while
Searching this area locates it.
Creature: If the heroes have yet to defeat Lady’s
Whisper, it’s waiting on the dais. It doesn’t point toward
any direction, but instead walks slowly toward the
heroes. It whispers, “I know that you are pretenders.
Deﬁlers. You should not be here. Nhimbaloth thinks
you serve some purpose to her plans, but I disagree.”
Lady’s Whisper then attacks to stop the heroes’
progress. It uses its unwilling teleportation ability to
shunt the heroes into area J14 if it can, so they have
to take the time to come around through the swamp
again. Lady’s Whisper ﬁghts until destroyed.

J19. PASSAGE TO THE DEPTHS
SEVERE 10
A smooth, natural cavern winds its way through the
darkness, ending in a larger chamber with a wide pit at the
far side. A corpse is slumped at the pit’s edge.
The pit is hundreds of feet deep and leads to even
deeper places in the Darklands. Its challenges are
beyond the scope of this Adventure Path.
The corpse is a messily killed humanoid of a strange
appearance: two heads and a chitinous body. The
irlgaunt in the pit hollowed it out and ﬁlled it with
gravel, so it makes a clattering noise when disturbed
unless it’s handled very carefully.
Creatures: Although this passage hasn’t been used
in centuries, it isn’t wholly abandoned. A crab‑like
irlgaunt from deeper in the Darklands lurks in the pit.
When the irlgaunt hears activity in the room above,
such as the clattering of gravel from the gruesome
alarm it made, it skitters up the pit and arrives in 2
rounds. It retreats, abandoning its potential meal, if
reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points.

J20. EMPTY VAULT
EXTREME 10
This strangely shaped chamber is humid and oppressively
clammy. The room’s four wings each contain a massive
pool of bubbling swamp water. Flickering motes of light
and darkness play underneath the surface of the pools. The
chamber’s center is partially blocked by a circle of towering
black standing stones, which crackle with eerie energy
that shoots up into a shaft in the ceiling. Seven narrow
channels, as though dug into the stone by a seven-ﬁngered
hand, run from each pool and three of the walls to a moat in
the center of the room. From there, the water ﬂows under
the wall to the east, between a pair of black stone double
doors. An island in the moat holds a smooth altar topped
with a black lens the size of a ﬁst.
The Empty Vault has always been a generation pit for
the wisps who serve Nhimbaloth. A funnel of swamp,
despair, and ghostly energies, it’s mystically connected
to the various swamp plant basins throughout the lower
Abomination Vaults. Any follower of Nhimbaloth can
telepathically communicate with wisps adjacent to the
basins from here.

The Empty Vault drew Belcorra’s soul after the
Roseguard killed her, and her ghost reappeared here
500 years after the most traumatic event in her life—
not her death, but her family’s exile from Absalom.
Belcorra can’t leave this chamber for long, so she
uses her wisp proxies and bound agents to enact her
will throughout the Abomination Vaults. She keeps
the Ebon Fulcrum Lens on the altar to restore its
energies; while here, it can regain its glimmers of
Nhimbaloth’s essence, but this takes time.
The seven swamp water rivulets are both dangerous
and noxious, as they mark where Nhimbaloth once
touched the world. It’s a simple matter to step over them,
but they pull unpleasantly at the life energy of anyone
who crosses them. At the end of any turn in which a
hero crosses a rivulet (whether by Striding, Stepping,
Flying, or any other means), the hero must succeed at
a DC 22 Fortitude save or become doomed 1. This DC
increases by 2 for each additional unique rivulet crossed
during that turn (for example, a hero who crosses over
3 rivulets in their turn must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude
saving throw). The doomed condition is cumulative on
subsequent rounds. Crossing the pools doesn’t have
this effect, so the heroes might learn that there are safer
ways to move about the room than simply walking in
a direct line. The rivulets have no effect on followers of
Nhimbaloth, including Belcorra and the dread wisps.
The black stone menhirs help support Gauntlight’s
weight and emit the twisting ribbon of eerie energy
that writhes up the shaft through areas B35, C15,
H37, and I28. Belcorra can
manipulate this ribbon of
energy to power Gauntlight.
Creatures:
If
Belcorra
hasn’t yet rejuvenated, the Ebon
Fulcrum Lens automatically rejuvenates her when the
heroes arrive. She’s so incensed that another group of
adventurers would dare to oppose her in her sanctum
that she attacks with her full fury. Belcorra focuses
her attacks on anyone who carries fulcrum lenses,
especially a hero who carries them in the Fulcrum
Lattice. She realizes that the lenses are potent weapons
that can be used against her.
There’s one soul feeder here at all times. If the heroes
presented souls to the soul feeders in area J8, they’ve
come here and also ﬁght at Belcorra’s side; this makes
the encounter particularly challenging!
Belcorra and the soul feeders use the menhirs for
cover as they dart about, hoping to draw the heroes
over the doom-inducing rivulets of swamp water.
When the heroes infuse Belcorra with splinters in the
Crimson Fulcrum Lens, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens,
and the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, Nhimbaloth comes for
her, and she’s forever destroyed. When the heroes do
this, proceed to Nhimbaloth’s Entrance (page 205).

Nhimbaloth’s Entrance
Once the heroes infuse Belcorra with all three of
Nhimbaloth’s splinters, the earth shakes. A tremendous
and hideous wail emanates from somewhere beyond
this chamber—indeed, it seems, from beyond the
Material Plane. All creatures in the Abomination Vaults
must succeed a DC 30 Will save or become frightened
3 (a creature that critically fails is also paralyzed for
1d4 rounds). At the start of the following round,
Nhimbaloth’s essence pervades the room.
A terrible, blackish-gray mist seeps into the room. It
stinks of a fetid bog and leaves a layer of cloying, slimy
water upon everything it passes. The mist twists in shape
and form, with seven-ﬁngered tentacles appearing and
disappearing in the fog.
This misty incarnation can’t be attacked or
damaged. It ﬂows into Belcorra, who shrieks, “No! I
deserve your power, not your attention! My death is
full of rage and strength—it is not empty!” Despite
these protestations, Belcorra’s form is pulled apart into
the mist, and the mist vanishes.
An immense grinding noise comes from high above.
Gauntlight, Belcorra’s greatest work, is collapsing,
one level at a time. With each passing round, the
artifact drops one dungeon level along the lighthouse’s
footprint (but not in the rest of the Abomination
Vaults!), obliterating anything directly beneath it.
In the 9th round, it collapses into this chamber,
destroying everything here—by then, the heroes would
best be gone.
Conclusion
With Belcorra destroyed, Otari and Absalom are
safe from her spiteful schemes. The heroes receive a
warm welcome in Otari, and everyone wants to hear
their tales over a friendly ﬁre, good food, and more
than a few drinks. The heroes are told, retold, and
embellished upon for generations.
Gauntlight is no more, and only the pit in the Fogfen
marks the spot it once stood. The dangers lurking
there might one day regain their strength and menace
the surface—but those are tales for other heroes.

Adventure
Toolbox
Abomination
Vaults
The banks of the River of Souls brushes against every
world, for when a mortal dies, their spirit steps out
of their body to cross over these banks on the ﬁrst
step toward the afterlife. Yet, as
with most rivers, predators lurk
along these perilous banks. Night
hags, astradaemons, devourers,
and worse stalk the River, eager to
pluck souls free and feed on them.
Dread Nhimbaloth, the Empty
Death, doesn’t deign to hunt
the shores of the River of Souls
alongside
these
predators—she
instead feeds upon the predators
themselves, reveling in consuming
souls already being digested in the gullets of those who
would deem themselves the apex hunters of the dead.
Nhimbaloth uses the shores of the River of Souls
to manifest upon the universe’s countless worlds, but
she can’t just do so whenever she wills it. Before the
Empty Death can manifest within a world, it must
ﬁrst endure a cataclysm so vast that the outﬂow of the
dead into the River of Souls weakens the boundaries
between life and death. When such massive casualties
sufﬁciently thin these borders, she can drift in through
the cracks and stain what she ﬁnds. The resulting
blurring between the River of Souls and its shore is
metaphysically akin to the muddied boundary of a
swamp. It’s no coincidence that when Nhimbaloth
emerges into a world, she chooses to dwell in its
remote swamplands. Nhimbaloth isn’t a glutton—
she’s endlessly patient and can linger on a world for
centuries before being noticed.
More often, her presence in an isolated swampland
simply festers, turning a region of natural beauty into
a dangerous fen that draws all manner of monsters
to its fetid heart. Such lands call to will-o’-wisps; for
these feeders of fears, the ruin wrought by the Empty
Death is like a ﬁne wine of unparalleled vintage.
In time, many of these wisps realize the truth of the
inﬂuence in their chosen haunts, and in most cases,
these ravenous aberrations become Empty Death’s
most fervent worshippers.
Personification
and Realm
While Dread Nhimbaloth has
no physical body of her own,
she has been known to manifest
a perceivable shape under the
perfect
conditions,
growing
visible after consuming a huge
quantity of souls the way an
empty glass’s contours becomes
more deﬁned once ﬁlled with
liquid. In this form, Nhimbaloth appears as a
twisting, melted mass of glistening blue ﬂuid with
eyes the shape of yellow four-pointed stars and a
tangle of translucent tentacles extending in every
direction. The tentacles’ tips split into seven smaller
tendrils, and where these “hands” touch the world,
they leave her mark behind—a ring of seven strange
divots where vegetation refuses to grow, stone
becomes chalky, and ﬂesh festers as if it had forgotten
how to heal. The position of the stars in the sky, the
number of dead trapped within the swamp, and the
time of year all seem to play a part in determining
when this shadow of what might have once been
Nhimbaloth’s body can appear, as does the presence
of her cultists, but the manifestation rarely persists
for long. Always, the manifestation ends in a sudden
consumption from within when the Empty Death
retreats to her domain, leaving behind a dead
swampland of toxic waters and mindless undeath.
This form often appears in illustrations that
depict the Empty Death, though Nhimbaloth is also
portrayed as a ghostly human woman with a single
yellow eye in the shape of a four-pointed star ﬁlling
her otherwise blank face, and a long, writhing mane
of ghostly, seven‑ﬁngered tentacles wraps around

her nearly skeletal body in a smoky shroud. This
version of her is surely the product of an artist’s
nightmare, yet cults have adopted it as their own.
Nhimbaloth’s realm is a twofold domain. She uses
the banks of the River of Souls as a hunting ground
and a highway to travel from world to world, but
supposedly dwells on a distant, dead planet. The
name of this domain has been lost to time; the
faithful of Nhimbaloth refer to it in whispers only
as Voidbracken. Here, an ancient battle between
Nhimbaloth and another power took place (most
myths suggest her foe was Pharasma) that resulted
in the destruction of the Empty Death’s body. This
conﬂict didn’t result in her death, however, and
her cult fondly views the event as an evolution—
for without a body, she could now come and go
as she pleased along the shores of the River of
Souls. Voidbracken spins still in the Dark Tapestry,
wandering aimlessly through the universe but driven
always by Nhimbaloth’s will, and when it draws near
an inhabited system, the souls of the living are drawn
from their mortal shells in a cataclysm referred to in
rare surviving accounts as the Deadtide. According
to certain passages scribed in ancient texts like
the Necronomicon, many of the Great Old Ones
and Outer Gods must wait for the stars to align
just right to manifest. This is quite literally true in
Nhimbaloth’s case. Eventually, her Deadtides will
claim enough lives so that Nhimbaloth’s death will
die; the accumulated spiritual energy she has digested
will ultimately undo her ancient defeat, allowing her
to once more exist as a physical being.
She will rise from death hungrier than ever.
Dogma and Worshippers
Nhimbaloth’s creed and worship are entirely the
product of her cultists, as the Empty Death has little
interest in providing her worshippers with direct
inspiration or direction. This tradition echoes the
pattern established with all other cults centered on
entities of the Elder Mythos who similarly care not
for their worshippers. Because of this lack of divine
direction, while their worshippers strive to accomplish
speciﬁc goals, they aren’t limited by anathemas.
In Nhimbaloth’s case, her worshippers seek to create
undead—particularly ghosts and other incorporeal
creatures—to provide sustenance for their eldritch icon.
They also feast upon carnivores at their ceremonies, aping
Nhimbaloth’s predation upon soul-eating monsters. Her
faith is all but unknown in urban areas, but in isolated
swamp villages, worship of the Empty Death can suffuse
entire settlements. In such instances, the cult typically
builds the shell of a mainstream church to serve as a
front and satisfy any curious outsiders passing through,
while worshipping their goddess at a hidden location in
the heart of the night.
Lower-level clerics of Nhimbaloth dress in whatever
corpse’s attire is commonly used in their society’s
burial rites, choosing to wear a “ﬁnal suit” or “last
gown” during their rituals in hopes that sweet oblivion
might answer their prayers. Cult leaders, however,
often eschew this tradition, instead wearing dark green
or gray hooded robes adorned with tangled sheets of
clinging moss and skull-shaped masks adorned with
veils of additional moss. The cultists favor ﬂails in
combat; these weapons often have heads shaped into
four-pointed stars with the ﬂail’s chain attached to the
center of the star and handles wrapped in moss and
tanned ﬂesh stripped from the dead.
Humanoids are far from the Empty Death’s only
worshippers. As mentioned, will-o’-wisps and their kin
ﬁnd much to admire in the sinister aura Nhimbaloth’s
presence brings to desolate swamplands, and it
doesn’t take long for them to take up faith in the
Empty Death, almost as if feeding on fear spurred
by her inﬂuence infects the wisps with devotion to
her faith. Marsh giants have also been known to
venerate Nhimbaloth under names like “Bogmother,”
“The Rushlight Woman,” “Swampﬁre Queen,” or
the like, although they pray to her more as a patron
of swampland than anything else. Vampiric mists
commonly appear in her swamplands as well, and
many scholars have nervously wondered about the
implied connection between Nhimbaloth’s mark
and the clusters of seven perfectly spaced punctures
vampiric mists leave in the bodies of those they’ve fed
upon through their misty tendrils.
NHIMBALOTH’S INSPIRATION
H. P. Lovecraft encouraged others to add to the
mythos of eldritch beings he created to populate his
weird ﬁction, and it was in this tradition that I ﬁrst
created Nhimbaloth as an antagonist for my own
stories and roleplaying campaigns. Largely inspired
by the mysterious horror lurking behind nature’s
veil in Algernon Blackwood’s classic short story
“The Willows,” and with some valuable advice on
Outer God naming conventions from the ﬁne folks
at Chaosium, Nhimbaloth has become one of my
proudest additions to the ever-expanding Lovecraft
Mythos. —James Jacobs

Temples and Shrines
Often, the members of a cult of the Empty Death
consist of the truly desperate, those with little money
and less hope. They conduct their worship in their
homes, or what passes as a home—partially collapsed
shacks, abandoned barns, or even slumped survivalists’
shelters all sufﬁce for the worship of Nhimbaloth. The
rarer cults led by deviants of means construct larger
structures to honor Nhimbaloth and often build these
structures as mockeries of other churches by including
stained glass windows, mosaics, and other works of
art that honor the Outer Goddess. In such cases, the
structure often serves a secondary purpose, such as
a castle, a manor house, or the like. Curiously, these
larger structures often share a particular feature:
a tower that serves as a beacon or lighthouse as a
way to honor will-o’-wisps, which the cult adore. To
her followers, will-o’-wisps are Nhimbaloth’s eyes,
and her gaze looks out upon the world through the
lambent glow of these supernatural predators. A
beacon or lighthouse in a temple thus symbolizes a
will-o’-wisp, but also, they believe it gives Nhimbaloth
a lens through which to gaze upon the world.
Nhimbaloth’s symbol is a skull with moss stuffed
into its jaws, although her cultists often create variants
of it as crude dolls or efﬁgies of moss-caked bones and
fragments of skulls. Temples that can afford to be open
about their afﬁliation with the goddess often adorn
their structures with skulls that have moss carefully
grown into soggy, vermin-infested beards or with
moss draperies that hang down over archways to form
moist curtains in place of proper doors.
A Priest’s Role
As with most cults of the Elder Mythos, the majority
of Nhimbaloth’s devout don’t worship out of respect
or adoration so much as fear. For them, the concept
of death isn’t what evokes nightmare, but the fear of
what judgment might await in the afterlife is what
drives most to her faith. Those who have sinned, who
have committed heresy against a prior faith, or who
simply live in constant terror of what Pharasma might
say to them when they reach her throne instead seek
the oblivion offered by Nhimbaloth. They seek not to
escape death or life, but to escape what they fear will
be an even worse afterlife.
Yet this is not the only motive that draws worshippers
to her fold. Some, rather than being driven by a fear
of the afterlife, are enticed by the opportunity to bask
in the misery and despair of others. These members
are some of the most awful in the sect, for they use the
promise of oblivion that Nhimbaloth offers to those
who worship her as a lure to draw in the desperate
to aid their own nefarious plots. Some seek to use
these eager-for-oblivion zealots as disposable armies
for acts of vengeance or rage; others draw upon these
worshippers as sacriﬁces to fuel abhorrent rituals or to
craft horriﬁc magic items.
Even these predators of the desperate pale in
comparison to the worst of Nhimbaloth’s worshippers—
nihilists who fully understand the Empty Death and
see in her the ultimate tool to destroy a world they’ve
grown to loathe. For these cultists, nothing less than
using the Voidbracken to bring a Deadtide upon their
world will sufﬁce. They might have a hidden plan to
escape the world the moment all life is ended; they
might even seek their own oblivion or believe that
Nhimbaloth herself might reward them with dominion
over a dead world. Regardless of their intent, these
doomsday shepherds are the most dangerous of the
Empty Death’s worshippers.
Holidays
Cults of Nhimbaloth that exist in small communities
under the guise of a different religion take pains to
observe that faith’s holidays if visitors or (more
rarely) townsfolk don’t know their gathering’s true
faith, but apart from that, worshippers of the Empty
Death don’t observe regular holidays or religious
festivals—with one unusual exception. The exact date
on which Nhimbaloth’s body was taken from her
and Voidbracken was denuded of life is unknown, so
each cult chooses one day of import to observe this
anniversary. The fact that no one knows the length
of Voidbracken’s year makes this ritual even more
arbitrary; regardless, her faithful believe that on one
of these so-called Void Dawns, the sun won’t rise upon
the world and all life will be snuffed in a Deadtide.
Cultists celebrate the night leading to a Void Dawn
with a gluttonous feast consisting of all manner of
carnivores and monsters—meals they often make
during the proceedings while the “food” still lives.
When the sun inevitably rises, the cultists choose one
of their own as the ﬁnal feast in atonement for failing
to bring the Deadtide to their world.
Aphorisms
Worshippers of Nhimbaloth fondly quote and recite
their favorite tales from The Whispering Reeds, each
of which has a number of memorable and haunting
lines. However, a variant of an infamous quote from
the Necronomicon particularly resonates with all of
her worshippers.
Long Dream the Dead, Yet Even Death Can Die:
To many, the notion of death is akin to an eternal
slumber, a dawnless rest in which the soul experiences

an afterlife in the way a sleeping person could dream
several different lives in the span of a single night.
Whether a dreamer wakes with the dawn or dies in
their sleep, all dreams eventually come to an end. Just
as when the Empty Death comes to call, even death
knows oblivion—and even death may die.
Holy Text
Mentions of Nhimbaloth are rare, even for the esoteric
topic of the Outer Gods. The dread Necronomicon
mentions her, and certain translations of that book
purportedly contain descriptions of her true form,
which might be the only place where Nhimbaloth’s
true form is set down in print. This information isn’t
even present in the text most often associated with her
worship: a rare tome called The Whispering Reeds.
The genesis of The Whispering Reeds lies not in
those who worship the Empty Death, but in those who
sought to oppose her. The book consists of stories,
myths, parables, and encounters with Nhimbaloth
gathered from hundreds of regions in dozens of worlds.
The compiler’s name has been long forgotten, as they
neglected to name themself in the text. This matters
not to those who worship Nhimbaloth, nor does the
fact that the author originally penned the book for the
purpose of cataloging the ways in which Nhimbaloth’s
inﬂuence could be opposed. The very act of collecting
these old stories of the Empty Death brushing against
the world had the opposite effect, and now, those who
seek to draw their goddess’s attention to their world
uses The Whispering Reeds to spread stories of her
previous visits.
Details on this potent, cursed work appear on
page 216.
Relations with Other Religions
Nhimbaloth doesn’t consort with other gods,
although often her visitations upon the wilderness
force confrontations with other faiths. In particular,
Gozreh and Desna oppose her influence—the former
because of the proliferation of unnatural elements
that taint swamplands, and the latter out of a
mixture of anger and fear that her flock might
stumble into Nhimbaloth’s clutches accidentally
while exploring the wilds. The Eldest of the
First World also oppose Nhimbaloth, whose
parasitic tendrils can occasionally drift into
that plane through fey gates and portals.
Even after driving out the Empty Death,
small cults of fey who have fallen
under her sway inevitably remain.
Pharasma
opposes
Nhimbaloth
for multiple reasons. Those who
perish in lands haunted by the
latter’s presence tend to rise as
ghosts. Moreover, the Empty Death’s
habit of consuming those ghosts has
rightly angered Pharasma, for rather
than being released to the Boneyard,
the consumed souls simply disappear.
One might assume that such an affront
to the cycle of life and death would
compel Pharasma into a direct
confrontation with Nhimbaloth,
and indeed, certain ancient texts
tell of such a clash between
the
two
goddesses
at
the very dawn of mortal
civilization.

to hide her predations upon the world so that even
Pharasma can’t readily ﬁnd her, and one particularly
blasphemous tale in The Whispering Reeds speaks of
a hidden scar that Pharasma bears to this day as a
reminder of her failed attempt to decisively defeat the
Empty Death—a scar, supposedly, in the pattern of
seven divots of ﬂesh where Nhimbaloth fed upon the
essence of the Goddess of Death.
Whether or not this myth has any basis in fact,
the faithful of Pharasma view Nhimbaloth and
her cult with a combination of hatred and fearful
respect. Only the most devout and powerful of
Pharasma’s worshippers receive leave to hunt
Nhimbaloth’s faithful, and they work hard to
prevent lay worshippers from learning much of the
Empty Death. Their justification—that Nhimbaloth
feeds only on ghosts, and that by defeating or
preventing the formation of theses undead, they
strike blows against the Empty Death—reads to
some as an excuse.
Nhimbaloth (CE)
The Empty Death’s sphere of inﬂuence
encompasses
despair,
ghosts,
and
swamps. As with most of the Outer Gods,
Nhimbaloth cares nothing for those who
worship her (and thus her clerics have no
key anathemas), yet those who venerate
the Empty Death nonetheless toil in vain to
attract her favor.

VISUAL
Cast ʚʖ somatic, verbal
Range 5-foot emanation; Targets creatures in the area
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
With a wave of the hand, you cause the targets to see
the world around them as if a gauzy ﬁlm had been lifted
away to expose the truth that lies below their perceived
reality. Natural features they can see grow twisted and
horrendous, structures appear distorted and ruined, and
objects seem warped and alien. This alternate vision fades
quickly, but the glimpse beyond the natural world lingers
for the spell’s duration.
Aberrations or worshippers of Outer Gods or Great Old
Ones are bolstered by this vision of warped reality and gain
a +1 status bonus to Will saving throws and attack rolls
for 1 minute, while all other creatures must attempt a Will
saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected and temporarily
immune for 1 hour.
Success The creature is frightened 1.
Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute and
frightened 1.
Critical Failure The creature is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute and
frightened 2. It can’t reduce the value of its frightened
condition below 1 as long as it remains stupeﬁed by
this spell.

You open your mouth wide and inhale sharply; you draw
in the bravery, self-conﬁdence, and hope to which the
frightened target clings and then strip away the target’s
false assumption that these fragile emotions can save
them from the oblivion of terror. The target’s stolen hope
reinvigorates you.
You deal 6d4 mental damage to the creature, which
must attempt a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage; you regain Hit
Points equal to half the damage the target takes.

Vaults
The Abomination Vaults harbor many secrets, but not
all of them are dangerous. Some are useful tools or
fantastically powerful artifacts the heroes can ﬁnd as
they journey into the depths. The new rules the heroes
can ﬁnd by delving into the Abomination Vaults are
presented below.
Alchemical Items
The following alchemical items can be found in this
adventure, usually in the hands (or claws) of the
creatures who manufactured them.
ALCHEMICAL BOMBS
Alchemical bombs are martial thrown
weapons with a range increment of
20 feet. Like all alchemical bombs,
necrotic bombs combine volatile
alchemical
components
that
explode when the bomb hits a
creature or object.
Urdefhans

and
use
necrotic bombs against living
foes, since they don’t need to worry
about dealing splash damage to their
allies in melee range of their targets.
Urdefhan death scouts usually carry
several necrotic bombs and are quick to employ them
against their enemies.

Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider
disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a
life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb
deals the listed negative damage and splash damage, and
it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage
harms only living creatures. Many types grant an item
bonus to attack rolls.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 3 gp
The bomb deals 1d6 negative damage and 1 negative splash
damage. On a critical hit, the target is sickened 1.
Type moderate; Level 3; Price 10 gp
You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals
2d6 negative damage and 2 negative splash damage. On a
critical hit, the target is sickened 2.
Type greater; Level 11; Price 250 gp
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 3d6
negative damage and 3 negative splash damage. On a
critical hit, the target is sickened 3.
Type major; Level 17; Price 2,500 gp
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls. The
bomb deals 4d6 negative damage and 4
negative splash damage. On a critical hit, the
target is sickened 4.
ALCHEMICAL ELIXIRS
These consumable alchemical concoctions
have unusual effects. Some seugathi
ﬂeshwarpers brew ichthyosis mutagen
from the rare chemicals they use to break
down their victims’ skin; the elixir has the
reverse effect, toughening the imbiber’s
hide. The heroes can ﬁnd ichthyosis
mutagen tucked away in an storage closet
on the Laboratories level.
Skeptic’s elixir is popular with anyone who
anticipates a tense diplomatic exchange or otherwise
expects to be lied to in the near future. Belcorra and
her guards stashed some skeptic’s elixirs on the higher
levels of the dungeon.

ALCHEMICAL POISONS
Poisons can produce a variety of debilitating effects on
the body. Seugathi ﬂeshwarpers use sloughing
toxin on their victims. The heroes
might come across sloughing toxin as
they explore the laboratories where the
seugathis work their wicked science.
Stupor poison is a potent toxin distilled
from sources deep in the Darklands. It’s
popular among drow who consider the
more common lethargy poison to be
insufﬁcient to bring down their foes,
including most drow of Yldaris (who
ﬁght monsters in the Hunting Grounds).

ITEM 2

Price 6 gp
Usage Worn; Bulk L
Activate Ȱɵ Interact
This mask is made of Darklands wasul reeds, which have
been alchemically treated to enhance their air-retaining
properties when submerged in water. When you put on
this mask, for the next hour, you can hold your breath for
15 rounds plus your Constitution modiﬁer (instead of 5
rounds + your Constitution modiﬁer) before drowning.
It has no eﬀect in non-aquatic
environments that require you
to hold your breath. One hour
after you apply the mask, it
ﬂakes away into ﬁber shreds.
Artifacts
The
heroes
come
across
the
following
artifacts
in
their
explorations. Of course, Gauntlight
is hard to miss, as it towers over the
ruins of Gauntlight Keep and its base
extends down through every level of the
Abomination Vaults to the Empty Vault
far below. In many ways, this artifact is just as much
a key danger of the campaign as the spiteful Belcorra
Haruvex herself.
The heroes might discover the dread tome known as
The Whispering Reeds in Belcorra’s secure collection
of books on the Library level.
GAUNTLIGHT
ITEM 20
UNIQUE
ARTIFACT
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
Gauntlight is much more than a 115-foot-tall lighthouse
rising from the heart of an old ruin in Fogfen—its pale
stone walls extend far below the ruins, passing through
eight diﬀerent dungeon levels and ﬁnally terminating
at the ninth level below the surface, where its deep
foundation centers on an ominous chamber where, long
ago, Nhimbaloth herself once physically brushed against
this world. Once she ﬁnished its physical construction,
the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source
of power to infuse the walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings of each
of Gauntlight’s levels with eldritch power. The lens at the
apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to
focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam,
but Belcorra’s plans were cut short before she could replace
the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.
As an artifact, Gauntlight can’t be damaged by normal
means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any
attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers
of Nhimbaloth. They block eﬀects that allow temporary
passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against
dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract
teleportation eﬀects and planar travel into or out of areas
within Gauntlight and eﬀorts to summon creatures into
the area (using a +37 counteract modiﬁer); this eﬀect does
not stop a summoned creature from departing when the
summoning ends. Note that this eﬀect only applies to the
areas that are within Gauntlight and its footprint (areas
A11, A25, B35, C15, and so on), and not to the entirety of
the Abomination Vaults!
In Gauntlight’s current state of diminished functionality,
it can be activated only in the two ways below. By
swapping in a series of four magical lighthouse lenses
called fulcrum lenses that focus Nhimbaloth’s
baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even
Belcorra takes special care with them—
the artifact gains signiﬁcantly greater
power, including the ability to reach
all the way to Absalom and to
activate its eﬀects every minute.
To
activate
Gauntlight,
a
creature must be in the deepest
portion of the artifact, the Empty
Vault on the Temple level (area J20).
From anywhere within the Empty Vault,
a creature can observe the world outside remotely
through Gauntlight’s lens in its cuploa, including any area
Gauntlight’s beam can reach.
Activate ̂ˬ Interact; Frequency once per month; Eﬀect
A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and
illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point
within 1 mile. The light saturates the region, causing
any corpses in the area or within 10 feet of the surface
of the illuminated area to animate as level –1 undead
(typically as skeleton guards or zombie shamblers). Once
animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until
then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by
the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully
restored, the undead instead animate as any Common
undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.
Activate ̂ˬ Interact; Frequency once per month; Eﬀect
A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight’s lens and
illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point
within 1 mile. The user chooses one creature of 4th level
or less that is physically located within Gauntlight; this
creature is then is teleported to any point within this
illumination radius. If Gauntlight is fully restored, any
number of creatures within Gauntlight of 15th level or
lower can be transported. This is a teleportation eﬀect.
Destruction If Belcorra’s ghost is permanently destroyed,
Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and
collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving
an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.

THE WHISPERING REEDS
ITEM 10
RARE
ARTIFACT
DIVINATION
OCCULT
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an
anonymous author who sought to collect all parables,
myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess
Nhimbaloth. According to the introduction, the author’s
original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty
Death could use to ﬁght against her inﬂuence, but as one
reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the
opposite eﬀect has been achieved—by compiling these
stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that
made it easier for Nhimbaloth to inﬂuence the world. Those
who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book
to use as a guide and religious text, while those who
don’t know better and peruse the book as though it
were merely an anthology of stories ﬁnd themselves
unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth’s cult or
agents of the entity herself. Those who study from
The Whispering Reeds for too long are often
cursed to rise as ghosts after death—though
their existence never lasts for long, as they
are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.
If a character understands the dangers
of this book, however, moderated use can
stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If
a character takes special care, they can even potentially
use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose—as a
weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text
too often or leveraging some of its more powerful eﬀects,
however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these
cases, the user is exposed to the tome’s curse, Empty
Death (see below).
The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an
enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after
the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled
those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies
already created. This crusade caught the attention of
Nhimbaloth’s cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler.
Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are
believed to still exist. The book’s sinister nature causes
all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of
gibberish, nonsense text.
The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you
can’t activate any of them while you are stupeﬁed unless
you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.
Activate 10 minutes (Investigate); Eﬀect You gain a +2
item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about
Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with
her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists,
wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with
death). Each time you use this ability after the ﬁrst in
a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.
Activate ʚʖ command, Interact; Frequency once per hour;
Eﬀect You read aloud a phrase from the book and target
a single incorporeal undead creature within 30 feet.
That undead creature takes 5d6 positive damage (DC 27
basic Will save) as portions of their incorporeal being
are consumed in patches of seven equally spaced holes.
Each time you use this ability after the ﬁrst
in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the
Empty Death.
Activate
ʚʖ
command,
Interact;
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect You
invoke a tale from The Whispering
Reeds that parallels the situation, environment, or
creatures nearby. Eerie mists and indistinct whispers
rise in a 20-foot emanation around you, and clusters of
seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground,
vegetation, and ﬂesh of creatures in the emanation other
than yourself and up to three creatures you designate
at the time of activation. Creatures aﬄicted with these
divots suﬀer from agonizing mental anguish
in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6
mental damage (DC 27 basic Will save). The
mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end
of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage
from the eﬀect also takes a –1 penalty to saving throws
against eﬀects with the emotion trait for 1 minute. You
are exposed to the Empty Death each time you use
this ability.
Activate Cast a Spell; Frequency three times per day; Eﬀect
You cast one of the following spells at the lowest level
possible (unless otherwise speciﬁed): crushing despair
(one target within 30 feet only), fear (3rd), paranoia, or
phantasmal killer. You are exposed to the Empty Death
each time you use this ability.
Empty Death (curse, necromancy, occult) Saving Throw
DC 27 Will; Eﬀect If you activate The Whispering Reeds
and are not a worshipper of Nhimbaloth, you become
stupeﬁed 2 for 24 hours as your thoughts ﬁll with
paranoia that something is watching you from the other
side of death. If you die while aﬀected by the Empty
Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost.
Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you
must succeed at a DC 2 ﬂat check. On a failure, you are
consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is
consumed in this way does not travel to the River of
Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only
be restored to life via a 10th-level spell eﬀect or ritual,
like wish.
Destruction Copies of The Whispering Reeds have no
special protections and can be destroyed like any
regular book, but doing so without engaging in careful
ritual preparations exposes the one who destroyed the
book to the Empty Death.

Icons of the Roseguard
The founders of Otari each had a single item imbued
with the essence of their abilities as adventurers. Two
of these are mundane items, invested with a spark
of magic sufﬁcient to keep them from deteriorating
over the years: Otari Ilvashti’s inﬁltrator’s thieves’
tools (which the heroes can ﬁnd in area D18) and
Zarmavdian’s spellbook, Thresholds of Truth. Vol
Rajani’s sword and Aesephna Menhemes’s brooch are
magic items. Otari’s thieves’ tools
are no different than standard
inﬁltrator’s thieves tools; the
other three items are described
here in detail.
The Roseguard didn’t realize
that these items would become icons
imbued with their essence, of course;
this occurred after their deaths, when
they’d already put their adventuring gear
away for their well-earned retirement. (Of
course, each member of the Roseguard had
other useful, if mundane, adventuring gear,
much of which is on display in the town
museum in Menhemes Manor as historical relics.)
Otari Ilvashti only learned that these speciﬁc items
are critical to bypassing the ward that blocks the
Abomination Vaults’ lower levels once he returned as
a ghost and witnessed the barrier’s creation.
COOPERATIVE BLADE
This longsword has been in the Rajani family for
years, and Vol Rajani carried it throughout her
distinguished adventuring career. Despite
its pristine and gleaming appearance, the
Cooperative Blade is incredibly ancient,
created in pre-Earthfall Nidal. The
Cooperative Blade is normally on
display at the Dawnﬂower Library,
but Carman Rajani steals it from the
library at the beginning of Chapter 5.

you’re an expert with the skill or attack roll you’re using

circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a

HUNTER’S BROOCH
Aesephna Menhemes, a cleric of Erastil, wore this
brooch during her time as an adventurer. She passed
it down to her descendants, and it’s now on display in
Menhemes Manor.

Activate ̂ˬ command, Interact;
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect By
touching a weapon you wield to
the symbol and uttering a plea for
Erastil’s steadying hand, you

weapon instead gains the fatal
d12 trait. This blessing lasts
for 1 minute, until you score a critical
hit with the weapon, or until you aren’t
wielding the weapon.
THRESHOLDS OF TRUTH
Zarmavdian’s spellbook, Thresholds of Truth, was
once a straightforward treatise on arcane and occult
lore containing several useful spells. It’s been so heavily
annotated, however, that the original text is hard to
read. It’s clear that Zarmavdian wanted to prevent
eldritch creatures from manipulating innocent
minds, but his spellbook is a treasure trove for
those seeking dangerous or inscrutable lore. The
bookseller Morlibint currently keeps this book in
his collection at Odd Stories.
Thresholds of Truth provides
access to the Eldritch Researcher
archetype (page 228) and contains
the following spells.
Cantrips: chill touch, dancing lights,
daze, detect magic, electric arc, ghost
sound, mage hand, light, prestidigitation,
read aura, shield

Infernal Contracts
Some mortals damn themselves through tyranny,
murder, or other soul-staining offenses. Others need
a little assistance surrendering their souls to Hell.
Devils gladly offer enticing temptations to desperate
mortals—but at a high price.
These arrangements are formalized in the traditions
and trappings of binding agreements most familiar to the
mortal’s culture, such as a handshake, a hand-binding
ceremony, or a written agreement signed by both parties.
Devils often include their own diabolical spin on the
traditions by requiring the handshake to be performed
while mingling the blood of both parties, binding hands
with a red-hot chain, or signing a document in blood.
These ﬂourishes are rarely necessary; demanding them
of the mortal is simply a display of power designed to
put the devil at an advantage. Most deals with devils in
the Inner Sea region take the form of written contracts,
which purport to offer full transparency to mortal
signatories, but in actuality incorporate additional
agreements hidden in obfuscated language.
Nearly all infernal contracts have three separate
provisions: an ongoing beneﬁt to the mortal, a
payment the mortal must make to the devil (usually in
the form of a supernatural restriction or prohibition),
and a termination clause that, upon its occurrence,
immediately voids the entire contract and ends all its
effects. Contracts often include hidden conditions that
give the devil additional leverage.
The rules effect of an infernal contract is that of a
magic item with the contract trait. This item has no
physical substance and can’t be dispelled, altered, or
destroyed except by destroying both physical copies
of the contract (a virtually impossible task, as most
devils send their copy to the Fallen Fastness in Dis, an
infernal library all but off-limits to mortals). An infernal
contract is automatically invested and counts toward a
character’s limit of 10 invested items—all such contracts
therefore include, as part of their cost, a fraction of
the bargainer’s ability to use other magic items. Once
invested, infernal contracts aren’t visible—though their
effects can be—but anyone who has one is constantly
aware of its presence. If a creature dies with an infernal
contract invested, its soul is consigned to Hell and it
can’t be restored to life unless its soul is freed.
The following are some examples of contracts a
mortal might obtain; each speciﬁes the type of devil
most likely to offer them and the kinds of checks
readers can use to decipher their terms.
DEVIL’S LUCK
ITEM 3
RARE
CONTRACT
ENCHANTMENT
FORTUNE
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Devil imp; Decipher Writing Arcana, Occultism, Society
You’ve bargained with an imp, one of the least powerful
devils, for a fragment of infernal luck.
Beneﬁt Once per day, you can roll a saving throw twice and
use the higher result.
Payment At the termination of your mortal life, your soul
must serve the imp for 100 years.
Hidden Condition The “termination of mortal life” clause
is carefully worded to hasten your demise. You can’t
use the beneﬁt against a death eﬀect, and if you roll a
failure on a saving throw against a death eﬀect, you get
a critical failure instead.
Termination Clause If you critically fail a saving throw
against a death eﬀect and do not die, the contract
becomes unenforceable on its terms and is voided.

Beneﬁt Your successful Strikes with slashing and piercing
melee weapons deal 1 persistent bleed damage. On a
critical success, this persistent bleed damage is equal to
half your level.
Payment You regain half the normal number of Hit Points
from resting (including Hit Points gained from long-term
rest) and from any application of the Medicine skill.
Hidden Condition The barbazu owns any weapons you
ﬁnd. No more often than once per month, the barbazu
can demand a single weapon of its choice (often the best
weapon in your possession). You are compelled to hand
over the weapon immediately, without question.
Termination Clause The contract guarantees that you will
not “be slain by the barbazu or by barbazu action.” This
wording is vague; if any barbazu kills you, or if you die
from persistent bleed damage from any source, the
contract is voided.
RIGHT OF RETRIBUTION
ITEM 8
RARE
CONTRACT
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Devil erinys; Decipher Writing Nature, Religion
Profane powers of vengeance are yours to inﬂict.
Beneﬁt When a creature deals damage to you, you can
call out for retribution as a reaction. Until the end of
your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack
rolls against that creature.
Payment If you wound a creature, it is your duty to kill
it. If a creature survives for 24 hours after you deal
it damage, you are doomed 1. If you already have the
doomed condition, it increases by 1.
Hidden Condition No more than once per year, the erinys
can compel you to attack a creature of the erinys’s
choice that you can see. You are controlled by the
erinys and must ﬁght the chosen creature for 1 minute.
Termination Clause The contract demands that you
enact bloody vengeance against anyone who has
ever wronged you, but the nature of the vengeance is
vague. You can end the contract by creating eﬃgies of
everyone you believe has ever wronged you, bleeding
upon them all at once (at least 1 Hit Point per eﬃgy),
and destroying them.
ICY DISPOSITION
ITEM 11
RARE
ABJURATION
CONTRACT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Devil gelugon; Decipher Writing Nature, Games Lore
Your ﬂesh looks no diﬀerent, but is cold to the touch.
Beneﬁt You gain cold resistance equal to your level and a
+1 status bonus to saving throws against mental eﬀects.
Payment Liquids in your possession, including potions
and liquid alchemical items, freeze over the course
of 1 minute and thaw 1 minute after they leave your
possession. Frozen potions and elixirs take 1 minute
to consume.
Hidden Condition (conjuration, teleportation) No more than
once per week, the gelugon can move you like a piece on
a game board to advance its schemes. The gelugon can
appear and transport you and any items you’re wearing
and holding from your current space to a clear space
within 500 feet (the gelugon need not see this location,
but must know its relative location and distance from
you). This eﬀect doesn’t transport any other creatures.
The gelugon is unlikely to place you in a less dangerous
space than the one you left.
Termination Clause The contract provides you the beneﬁts
of “the eternal ice of Cocytus.” If you travel to Cocytus,
Hell’s seventh layer, and stand within an area at least 100
feet across that contains no ice and has a temperature
above freezing, the contract is void. Such locations are
exceptionally rare in Cocytus, and the eﬀorts to create
such an area are likely to attract unpleasant attention.
INTERPRETING AN INFERNAL CONTRACT
Understanding the complex, legalistic provisions of
an infernal contract is diﬃcult, and doubly so when a
devil is at hand demanding an expeditious signature.
A reader must attempt a secret check to Decipher
Writing to understand a contract’s provisions. Each
contract indicates appropriate skills to use, and the
DC is based on the contract’s item level (Pathﬁnder
Core Rulebook 503). Alternatively, the reader can
always use the Legal Lore skill to decipher the
contract at the DC – 4. Regardless of the outcome
of the check, the reader always understands the
Beneﬁt and Payment provisions of the contract.
Critical Success The reader understands the
Hidden Condition and the Termination Clause.
Success The reader understands the Hidden
Condition.
Failure The reader misunderstands the Hidden
Condition and receives false information about it.
Critical Failure The reader misunderstands both
the Hidden Condition and the Termination
Clause, receiving false information about each.
A mortal can try to renegotiate the contract;
whether the devil agrees is up to the GM. The mortal
must understand the Hidden Condition or Termination
Clause to change the terms in their favor; the devil
knows if the mortal misunderstands these clauses
(from a failed Decipher Writing check) and if so usually
plays along, knowing that any further agreements
they make based on a misunderstood clause aren’t
binding and don’t change the contract’s eﬀects.

Magic Items
The Abomination Vaults hold several new magic items
for the heroes to ﬁnd. The lantern of empty light is in
the possession of Volluk Azrinae, the worm that walks
who sometimes ventures out into the Fogfen with it.
Kragala, Shadow Malice’s duergar drummer, uses as
set of folding drums in her performances. The devils
of the Prison level use the drover’s band to drill their
ﬂeshwarp troops.
Fulcrum lenses are unique magical crystals that
each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence. They
belong to a larger set of lenses created to manipulate
or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other
lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex
family came into possession of four of the lenses,
and they knew that bringing them together focused
Nhimbaloth’s
attention
in
unprecedented
and
dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to
the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install
them in Gauntlight for her ultimate revenge upon
Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called
the Fulcrum Lattice to hold the lenses so that their
power could be focused together. She realized
the danger of keeping the fulcrum lenses
too close together until the right time
and spread them out among loyal
groups in the Abomination Vaults’
lowest levels for safekeeping.
Belcorra keeps only the most
powerful lens, the Ebon Fulcrum
Lens, with her—indeed, as a ghost,
it’s the only one she can carry. If
the heroes can bring the other three
lenses to bear against Belcorra, they
can draw Nhimbaloth’s dread glare
to the sorcerer. Despite her loyalty,
Belcorra can’t hope to keep her spirit intact when
Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it.
The fulcrum lenses are more than mere receptacles
of Nhimbaloth’s essence. Each grants those who use it
a fragment of the Great Old One’s power.
CRIMSON FULCRUM LENS
ITEM 9
UNIQUE
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
OCCULT
Price 700 gp; Bulk 1
This concave lens has a drifting crimson cloud resembling
slowly swirling blood within it.
While you have the Crimson Fulcrum Lens invested, you
seethe with malevolent fury you can barely contain. You
gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against fear eﬀects
and a +2 item bonus to your melee Strike damage (this
increases to a +4 item bonus to damage if the melee Strike
is a jaws attack).
You can activate the lens in the following ways.
Activate ʚʖ Interact; Frequency once per day; Eﬀect You
grasp the Crimson Fulcrum Lens in one hand and make
a Strike that doesn’t require that hand. The Strike deals
an additional 1d8 precision damage (or 2d8 precision
damage if you make a jaws Strike) and doesn’t count
toward your multiple attack penalty.
Activate ʚʖ Interact (attack, possession); Eﬀect While
grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with
a modiﬁer of +18. On a hit, you force the splinter of
Nhimbaloth’s essence from the lens to possess the
target. You’re no longer invested in the lens, and the
target gains the beneﬁts as though it had invested the
lens but can’t activate the lens’s other abilities. This
eﬀect is permanent, but it can be ended by any eﬀect
that removes a possession eﬀect. The lens doesn’t have
any magical abilities until the possession eﬀect ends;
when it does, the essence returns to the lens.

magic item invested.
Activate ̂ˬ command; Frequency
once per day; Eﬀect You exert your will
over a mindless creature within 30 feet.
If the target is a mindless creature of 3rd
level or lower, it must attempt a DC 20 Will
save. If you are a devil, the target uses an
outcome one degree of success worse than the result
of its saving throw.
Critical Success The target creature is unaﬀected.
Success The target creature is slowed 1 for 1 round as its
responses are muddled by your commands.
Failure The creature is controlled by you for 1 hour,
although it doesn’t follow commands that are
obviously self-destructive.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 day.

While you have the Ebon Fulcrum Lens invested, and
you’re a corporeal creature, you become insubstantial,
gain the incorporeal trait, and are drained 2. Your drained
condition can’t be reduced below 2 as long as you have the
lens invested.
You can activate the lens in the following
ways. Both require expenditures of glimmers
within the lens; once the lens is depleted
of its three glimmers, it retains its ability
to make corporeal creatures insubstantial
but can’t be used for its other abilities
until its glimmers are restored (which
generally requires a ritual or being steeped
in an area of Nhimbaloth’s power).
Activate Ǻȓ envision; Frequency once per day;

a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with
a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk),
or a large standing drum set with a built-in
stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum’s
size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the
drums must have suﬃcient open space to
accommodate their new size or they can’t
be unfolded.

FULCRUM LATTICE
ITEM 11
UNIQUE
OCCULT
TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,200 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
This silver and copper framework is shaped
to hold four focusing lenses, one behind the
other, from smallest to largest. It has a socketed base
to be mounted into a stand, such as that found atop a
lighthouse. The Fulcrum Lattice was speciﬁcally designed
to hold the four fulcrum lenses from smallest to largest
(ebon, crimson, ochre, emerald), and it hums slightly while
within 10 feet of any fulcrum lens. A fulcrum lens slotted
into the Fulcrum Lattice has no Bulk; the lattice
remains at 1 Bulk. Inserting or removing a
lens from the Fulcrum Lattice requires an
Interact action.
The Fulcrum Lattice channels the
power of fulcrum lenses joined with
it. While you hold the Fulcrum Lattice,
lenses socketed into it are considered
to be in your hand for the purpose of
activating their abilities. When you make
a melee spell attack with a lens in the
Fulcrum Lattice, you use the highest melee
spell attack modiﬁer of any lens in the lattice,
or you can use your melee attack modiﬁer
with simple weapons if it’s greater.

to the glow of a ghost when it is consumed by the Outer
Goddess Nhimbaloth. A lantern of empty light is not
intrinsically an evil item, though it remains a favored
tool of those who would manipulate the minds of others
for sinister reasons. It can be used as a normal bull’s-eye
lantern, but prolonged use tends to instill in the user a
vague sense of being watched by unseen eyes, even
when the lantern isn’t in use.
Activate ʚʖ Interact (emotion, visual);
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect You direct
the lantern’s light upon a single living
creature within 60 feet. That creature
must attempt a DC 20 Will save to
resist the light’s eﬀects.

thinks the light was harmless, unless
it knows the true nature of the
lantern already.
Failure The creature becomes fascinated
by the lantern’s light, and remains
fascinated as long as you Sustain the Activation, up to
10 minutes.
Critical Failure As failure, but you can Sustain the
Activation for up to 1 hour. When the eﬀect ends,
the fascinated creature remembers any events
that took place while fascinated only as indistinct,
dream-like memories.
Activate ʚʖ Interact; Frequency once per day; Eﬀect
You direct the lantern’s light upon a single incorporeal
undead creature within 60 feet to siphon away some of
the creature’s essence, dealing 4d8 positive damage to
the creature (DC 20 basic Will save).

lassitude grips you and your emotions are hard to sway.
You gain resistance 10 to mental damage and a +2 status
bonus to saves against emotion eﬀects.
You can also activate the lens in the following ways.
Activate ʚʖ Interact; Frequency once per day; Eﬀect You

Pantheon
A pantheon is a collection of deities worshipped
together. The rules for following a pantheon are on
page 92 of Pathﬁnder Lost Omens Gods & Magic.
COSMIC CARAVAN
As friends of Wrin Sivinxi, the heroes all know that she
follows a pantheon of deities collectively
known as the Cosmic Caravan. Any
hero who wants to can learn about this
pantheon from her.
COSMIC CARAVAN
Areas of Concern constellations, fortune telling,
the night, hope for a better tomorrow

Edicts spend time stargazing or meditating

Zon-Kuthon (or other religions that espouse the night
as a bastion for evil) hold sway, help the desperate or

travel with no particular destination in mind
Anathema portray the night as a time of evil, destroy
astronomical or astrological equipment, spend the night
in the same place twice in a row
Favored Weapon starknife
The Cosmic Caravan is known to astronomers and
astrologers alike as a collection of constellations in the
sky, said to travel forever in a circle around the star
Cynosure. The association of a diverse array of gods
and demigods thematically linked with the stars and
the spaces between is a relatively new faith that ﬁrst
rose to prominence in western Avistan, particularly in
Varisia, Nidal, and Ravounel. The deities worshiped by
the faithful of the Cosmic Caravan include: Desna and
Sarenrae; the empyreal lords Ashava, Black Butterﬂy,
and Pulura; the elven god Ketephys; the outer god
Yog-Sothoth; and, in the regions where he is known,
the moon god Tsukiyo. This faith has been gaining
ground particularly in Nidal, where the worship of the
night is overwhelmingly associated with Zon-Kuthon,
and a rising number of Cosmic Caravan worshipers
seek to oppose or, one day, even overthrow the
Midnight Lord’s theocracy to reclaim the night from
the implications that all who dwell in the dark are evil.

Vaults
Rituals and Spells
The heroes may ﬁnd the following new ritual and spell
useful in the Abomination Vaults.
AWAKEN PORTAL
The Abomination Vaults are vast, and Belcorra
sometimes considered them too large to traverse by
normal means, particularly when she was in a hurry.
She therefore installed teleportation circles throughout
the Abomination Vaults, both for directed travel and
for more convenient general transport. Over time, the
magic of Belcorra’s teleportation circles has faded.
The awaken portal ritual is required to reactivate
them. Each linked teleportation circle must each be
individually reactivated with this ritual, before they can
be used, so the heroes must physically travel to each
side of a linked pair of portals to awaken
them. An exception is the network
of portal chambers throughout the
Abomination Vaults (areas B17, C16,
D5, E18, F13, G2, H33, I59, and J5); for
this network, the heroes can awaken the
portals as they ﬁnd them, but the awakened
portals only connect to others in the network
that the heroes have previously awakened.
This ritual is recorded in a folio in Belcorra’s
secure collection (area C35), but the mummy
ritualist Chafkhem (in area E18) knows it as well, so
the heroes might learn it from him.
AWAKEN PORTAL
RITUAL 3
RARE
CONJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Secondary Casters up to 5
Primary Check Arcana or Occultism (trained); Secondary
Checks Arcana or Occultism (whichever is used for the
primary check)
Range 10 feet; Target 1 portal
You attempt to reactivate a dormant gate, portal, or
teleportation circle (Advanced Player’s Guide 244) by
infusing it with magical energies. This ritual must be
successfully performed twice, once at each location
the portal connects. While the teleportation circles and
portals found in the Abomination Vaults require no
additional cost to awaken, other portals might require
rare items or speciﬁc materials as a cost for this ritual
at the GM’s discretion—some portals might even be so
powerful that this ritual cannot awaken them at all.
The DC required to successfully awaken a portal varies
based on the strength and distance between its end
points. For the portals found in the Abomination Vaults
Adventure Path, the DC varies according to the
dungeon level on which it is located.
Use the DCs by Spell Level section
of Table 10–5 on page 503 of the Core Rulebook to
determine the DC for a portal, using the dungeon level in
place of spell level. Thus, activating the portal on the ﬁrst
level of the Abomination Vaults requires a successful DC
15 check, while activating the portal on the fourth level
requires a successful DC 23 check.
Critical Success You awaken the portal. If its other side is
awakened, the portal can be used normally and won’t
deactivate naturally. If its other side is not awakened,
this side remains awakened for 1 year, possibly
allowing you enough time to ﬁnd and awaken the
connecting portal.
Success As critical success, but if the portal’s other side is
not awakened, this side remains awakened for only 1d6
days before it fades and falls dormant again.
Failure You fail to activate the portal, and magical
backlash leaves you stupeﬁed 1 for 24 hours.

Critical Failure As failure, but in addition, a hostile
creature is drawn through the portal and immediately
attacks anyone present. The creature drawn through
the portal varies, according to the portal’s nature; in
the Abomination Vaults, the creature conjured depends
on the dungeon level where the ritual was attempted,
as listed below.

This horrid spell is widely circulated among urdefhan
blood mages, and its gruesome use is a signature
ability of those spellcasters.
CALL THE BLOOD
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
DEATH
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast ʚʖ somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Target 1 living creature
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
With a word and gesture, you cause streams of blood to
erupt from the target’s mouth, nostrils, ears, or other facial
openings and come rushing into your mouth. You deal 8d4
negative damage to the target.
If the target takes damage, its blood ﬂows into your
mouth. If you’re a living creature and don’t have negative
healing, you’re sickened 2. If you’re undead (or living but
have negative healing), you can choose to either gain
temporary Hit Points equal to half of the negative damage
the target takes (after applying resistance and the like) and
become quickened for 1 round, or forgo the temporary Hit
Points and become quickened for 1 minute. You can use
this extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike. You lose any
remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4.
DAYDREAMER’S CURSE
This spell creates a stultifying curse that afﬂicts the
target and inhibits the ability to think clearly. The
heroes are most likely to gain access to this spell
because it’s included among the spells in Zarmavdian’s
spellbook, Thresholds of Truth. It’s also among the
spells that a character with the Eldritch Researcher
archetype can learn.

You impose a curse upon the target that renders it easily
distracted and unable to focus on tasks demanding insight
or discernment. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and
use the worse result whenever attempting a Medicine,
Nature, Perception, or Survival check. If the target
critically succeeds at a Perception check or skill check to
perform an action with the concentrate trait, the target
gets a success instead.
Failure As success, but the eﬀect is permanent.
Critical Failure As failure, except the target treats the
outcomes of all checks with the concentrate trait as
one degree of success worse than the result it rolled (a
critical success becomes a success, a success becomes
a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure).
ECTOPLASMIC EXPULSION
Cavern seers are those rare denizens of the Darklands
who can pull whispers from the stone that supports
the world. Although drow cavern seers are rare, the
drow twins Bhazrade and Klathor have both tapped
into this power and can share this spell that draws out
possessing inﬂuences from living hosts. They teach it
to heroes on good terms with the Yldaris drow.

NECROMANCY
Traditions occult

You call upon tendrils of ephemeral ectoplasm to pass
through the target and carry away a harmful psychic
aﬄiction. You immediately attempt to counteract a single
eﬀect on the target with the emotion or possession trait,
or an eﬀect giving the target the controlled or fascinated
condition. If you fail to counteract the eﬀect, you
nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to
more ably escape the eﬀect on its own; for the next hour,
the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug
oﬀ the eﬀect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves
to shake oﬀ control by the possession spell).
SAGE’S CURSE
This spell overwhelms the brain with knowledge and
is available to characters with the Eldritch Researcher
archetype.

Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You aﬄict the target with a curse that ﬁlls its mind with
distracting and hyper-specialized minutiae, causing it to
second-guess even simple facts. The target must attempt
a Will saving throw.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice
and use the worse result whenever attempting
an Arcana, Lore, Occultism, or Society check.
If the target succeeds at a check to Recall
Knowledge, it gains one piece of true
knowledge and one piece of erroneous
knowledge, but it has no way of
knowing which is which (this has
no effect if the target critically
succeeds at a check to Recall

as one degree of success worse than the result the
target rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a
success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a

2d6 persistent piercing damage. The target must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The worms writhe away harmlessly and
the target takes no damage.
Success The target takes full initial
damage but no persistent damage, and
the spell ends immediately.
Failure The target takes full initial and
persistent damage and is flat-footed due to the
pain for as long as it takes persistent damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target takes
double the initial damage and is also slowed 1
by the pain for as long as it takes persistent
damage.
Heightened (+2): The initial and persistent
damage increase by 2d6 and 1d6, respectively.
Weapons and
Adventuring Gear
The heroes can ﬁnd several unusual
new weapons in the Abomination
Vaults. The xulgath lutenist Gulzash is
prepared for a ﬁght with his battle lute, and drow
make heavy use of repeating hand crossbows and
the associated gear that makes using repeating hand
crossbows even easier. Urdefhans use a variety of
strange weapons that are wholly unknown on the
surface, including rhoka swords, shauth blades, and
shauth lashes. Even ﬂeshwarps
made
from
urdefhans
use
bizarre
weapons,
including
the
tamchal
chakrams that mulventok
ﬂeshwarps employ.
GEAR DESCRIPTIONS
Shootist
Bandolier:
This
leather
bandolier
holds
up
to
three
repeating
hand
crossbow
magazines in leather pockets
that
pop
open
with
the
quick ﬂick of a thumb. You reduce
the reload time for a repeating
hand
crossbow
magazine
from
the bandolier by 1, to a total of 2
actions. You can wear only one shootist bandolier
at a time.
WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS
The heroes can find the following weapons on their
explorations. Their statistics are provided in Table

Battle Lute: This reinforced lute is suitable both for
use as a handheld musical instrument and for bashing
heads should a crowd turn sour. Its strings are ﬁnely
braided wires that run along its sturdy metal neck.
Repeating Hand Crossbow:
This
weapon
features
an
ingeniously
designed
catch
mechanism at the top of the
ﬂight grove, just in front of the
latch, which automatically loads a
bolt from a magazine and resets the
string each time the weapon is ﬁred.
A typical repeating hand crossbow
magazine holds ﬁve bolts.
Rhoka Sword: These dual‑bladed
swords are commonly used by urdefhan
warriors.
Shauth Blade: These strange curved blades are
jagged and deadly weapons made from the alchemically
strengthened teeth of dead urdefhans. Each weapon
is typically named for the urdefhan whose teeth were
forged into the weapon, which are often carried (and
revered) by that urdefhan’s descendants. Magical
shauth blades allow an urdefhan wielder to channel
their Wicked Bite ability through shauth blade Strikes.
Shauth Lash: This metal chain bears hook-like
barbs made of alchemically strengthened urdefhan
teeth. Magical shauth lashes have the same ability to
channel an urdefhan wielder’s Wicked Bite as magical
shauth blades, and urdefhans hold these weapons
with the same reverence as they do shauth blades.
Tamchal Chakram: These circular weapons are
among the many strange weapons used by urdefhans.
The sharp metal circle contains numerous protruding
blades, while an angled central handle provides a
decent grip that spins the weapon as it’s thrown.
WEAPON TRAITS
Repeating hand crossbows have the following new
weapon trait.
Repeating: A repeating weapon is typically a
type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time.
These weapons can’t be loaded with individual
bolts like other crossbows; instead,
they require a magazine of
specialized ammunition to be
loaded into a special slot. Once
that magazine is in place, the
ammunition is automatically loaded
each time the weapon is cocked to ﬁre,
reducing its reload to the value in its
reload entry (typically 0). When the
ammunition runs out, a new magazine
must be loaded, which requires a free hand
and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine,
retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in
place). These actions don’t need to be consecutive.

to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever
you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater
proﬁciency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that
proﬁciency in the hand crossbow. If you’re at least an expert
in a hand crossbow you’re using, you gain access to its critical

FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Drow Shootist Dedication
You become trained in the repeating hand crossbow (page 73)
and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and shootist
bandoliers (page 73). Whenever you gain a class feature that
grants you expert or greater proﬁciency in a given weapon
or weapons, you also gain that proﬁciency in the repeating
hand crossbow. If you’re at least an expert in a repeating
hand crossbow you’re using, you gain access to its critical

Requirements You’re holding an unloaded hand crossbow.
You can ﬁre oﬀ a single shot even when unprepared. You
Interact to reload your hand crossbow and Strike with it.
Special If you have the Repeating Hand Crossbow
Training feat, you can use this feat with a repeating hand
crossbow to load either a bolt or a magazine, but the speed
means you can ﬁre only one bolt, then the magazine jams.
You must spend a 3-action Interact activity to remove the
jammed magazine and clear it before it can be used again.
LETHARGY POISONER
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Drow Shootist Dedication, trained in Crafting
You’ve learned more than the use of hand crossbows
from drow lore. During your daily preparations, you can
prepare a dose of lethargy poison (Core Rulebook 552)
from ordinary materials in a wilderness or urban area. If
you’re an expert in Crafting, you can instead craft a dose
of stupor poison (page 74). You can prepare two doses
(of either poison) if you’re a master in Crafting and three
doses if you’re legendary in Crafting. The save DC for this
poison is equal to your class DC. Only you can use these
poisons, and they expire the next time you make your
daily preparations. The GM might decide that the area
you’re in is too barren to provide the materials you need
for this feat.

ELDRITCH RESEARCHER
An eager student of occult lore, you enjoy reading rare
or forgotten tomes with ancient rituals and hidden
secrets. You connect disparate facts to unlock deeper
mysteries and uncover the truths of the universe, and
you zealously hoard the knowledge your painstaking
research produces. Aberrations fascinate you for
many reasons, not the least of which is because their
anatomy is wholly alien and yet, to the insightful,
eminently sensible.
You’ve been particularly enlightened by the
accumulated lore in Thresholds of Truth, and you know
Zarmavdian was a kindred soul in occult research.
With this book in hand, you feel like you stand at the
doorway to unprecedented occult discoveries.
You scoff at those fools who claim you meddle
in things mortals aren’t meant to know—for isn’t it
the duty of the enlightened to gather the universe’s
deepest truths?
ELDRITCH RESEARCHER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Trained in Arcana and Occultism
You gain the ability to cast a single arcane or occult cantrip
of your choice (which is heightened to a spell level equal
to half your level rounded up). If you weren’t already, you
become trained in that tradition’s spell DCs and spell attack
rolls with Intelligence as your spellcasting ability.
Regardless of whether you choose an arcane or occult
cantrip, you also become an expert in your choice of either
Arcana or Occultism. You also gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to checks you attempt with the chosen skill when
Investigating or Identifying Magic.
Special You can’t select another dedication feat
until you’ve gained two other feats from the Eldritch
Researcher archetype.
SEEKER OF TRUTHS
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths
borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion
to bear. You gain the cleric’s Domain Initiate feat but must
select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You
cast that domain’s domain spell as a focus spell of the
same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher
Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse
mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability
would manifest a divine symbol—such as the word of truth
focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique
to you that seems to defy geometry.
Special You can take this feat up to three times, selecting
a diﬀerent domain each time.
STRANGE SCRIPT
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
DIVINATION
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You have such familiarity with obscure texts that you can
compel them to reveal their secrets. Once per day, you can
touch a single text (such as a tome, a wall of hieroglyphics,
or something similar) and understand its meaning for
1 hour. If the text is in multiple languages, you gain the
ability to understand them all for only the purposes of
reading the text. If the text is in a code or cypher, you
don’t automatically understand the text, but you gain a +2
circumstance bonus to checks to decipher it.
SCHOLARLY DEFENSE
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
Your knowledge of strange creatures and their bizarre
anatomy allows you to anticipate their physical attacks and
reduce the damage you take from them. You gain resistance
to physical damage from melee attacks made by aberrations
and oozes. This resistance is equal to one-third your level.
ABLE RITUALIST
FEAT 8

Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
Your readings on rituals make you a skilled participant. You
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to primary and secondary
checks you attempt as part of casting a ritual.
LOREFINDER
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You know that fate sometimes conspires to keep dangerous
knowledge or items from the eyes of those most able to
understand them. You deny fate the ability to conceal
truths from you. You can cast locate as an innate occult
spell once per day. When you reach 14th level, this spell is
heightened to 5th level.
KNOW IT ALL
FEAT 10
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
Your knowledge of abstruse topics is unparalleled. When
you succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge, you gain
additional information or context. When you critically

might gain even more additional information or context
than normal.

WORDS OF UNRAVELING
FEAT 12
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You have unlocked abstruse methods to tangle with
reality itself, altering the fate of a single individual
by untethering their fate from reality. Once per day
as an occult innate spell, you can cast daydreamer’s
curse (page 224), outcast’s curse, or sage’s curse (page
225). At the GM’s discretion, you can substitute or add
additional occult curse spells of 4th level or lower to
this list. You can choose a different spell from the list
each time you use this ability. If you couldn’t already
cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as
your spellcasting ability, and you become trained in
spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if
you could already cast occult spells, your proficiency
in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells
increases to expert.
ENTITIES FROM AFAR
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You can call in aberrations to ﬁght for you or to answer
questions about the universe that their own strange
perspective can illuminate. You can cast summon entity as
an innate occult spell once per day. If you couldn’t already
cast occult spells, these spells use Intelligence as your
spellcasting ability, and you become trained in spell attack
rolls and spell DCs for occult spells; if you could already
cast occult spells, your proﬁciency in spell attack rolls and
spell DCs for occult spells increases to expert.
As soon as the aberration arrives, instead of giving it any
other commands, you can demand that it answer a single
question that you pose to it. For the creature to eﬀectively
answer, you must Sustain the Spell for 1 minute, and you
must understand and be understood by the aberration. If
you do, the aberration gives you a cryptic clue as provided
by the read omens spell, except that the clue is even
more enigmatic than normal; the creature then
immediately returns from whence it came
without providing you any other beneﬁt or
taking any other actions.
At 16th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the
summon entity spell is heightened by 1 level (to a
maximum of 8th level when you reach 20th level).
INCREDIBLE RECOLLECTION Ȱɵ
FEAT 14
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Eldritch Researcher Dedication
You can sift through knowledge locked within your mind
at an incredible pace. You instantly use up to 5 Recall
Knowledge actions. If you have any special abilities or free
actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall
Knowledge, you can’t use them for these actions.

GHOST HUNTER
Ghosts have a wide range of capabilities and features—
no two ghosts are exactly alike, as the nature of their
abilities depends as much upon who they were in life
as on how they died. Haunts, the spectral phenomena
remaining in a site of death or powerful emotions, are
related to but distinct from ghosts.
The ghost hunter knows that ghosts and haunts
share many features. By focusing on these similarities,
they can track down, confront, and defeat all manner
of unquiet souls, helping them to ﬁnd peace and move
on to the afterlife.
GHOST HUNTER DEDICATION
FEAT 2
UNCOMMON
ARCHETYPE
DEDICATION
Prerequisites Trained in Occultism or Religion
You have focused your training on hunting and defeating
ghosts, spirits, and all manner of haunts. Pick Spirit Lore
or Haunt Lore; you become trained in this skill. If you were
already trained in both skills, you become trained in a new
Lore skill of your choice.
Choose two cantrips from the occult spell
list. Each cantrip must have the divination,
enchantment, or necromancy trait. You can
cast these spells as innate occult spells. You
gain access to the Cast a Spell
activity if you didn’t have
it already. You’re trained in
occult spell attack rolls and
spell DCs. You can usually replace
material components with somatic
components, so you don’t need
a spell component pouch. Your
key spellcasting ability for these
spells is Charisma.
Special You can’t select another
dedication feat until you have
gained two other feats from the
ghost hunter archetype.
GRAVE’S VOICE
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ghost Hunter Dedication
You can use your choice of Spirit Lore
or Haunt Lore to Make an Impression
or Request things of incorporeal
creatures. At the GM’s discretion, an
incorporeal spirit might be willing to
hear you out.
INVESTIGATE HAUNTING
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ghost Hunter Dedication
You are skilled at noticing the telltale signs of ghosts
and hauntings. Even when you aren’t Investigating in
exploration mode, you get a check to Recall Knowledge
about incorporeal undead and haunts active in the area.
You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to
disable haunts.
SPIRIT SPELLS
FEAT 4
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ghost Hunter Dedication
Your ability to confront incorporeal menaces develops into
full-ﬂedged spellcasting. Choose a 1st-level occult spell.
You can Cast this Spell as an innate occult spell. At 6th
level, you gain a 2nd-level occult spell, and at 8th level, you
gain a 3rd-level occult spell. Each of these spells must have
the divination, enchantment, or necromancy trait. You can
cast each of these spells once per day.
GHOST STRIKE ʚʖ
FEAT 6
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ghost Hunter Dedication
Once per day, you can infuse a weapon you are carrying
with magical energies that allow it to strike true
against incorporeal undead. The weapon gains
the eﬀects of the ghost touch property rune for
10 minutes.
At 10th level, you can apply this eﬀect to
two weapons instead of one.
PEER BEYOND
FEAT 8
ARCHETYPE
Prerequisites Ghost Hunter Dedication
You have uncanny insight into the way ghosts
and haunts manifest, manipulate the mind,
and rejuvenate. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to saving throws against mental eﬀects
caused by incorporeal undead and haunts, and
you can roll a Spirit Lore or Haunt Lore check
for initiative if you know that an incorporeal
undead or a haunt is present.
If you are present when a spirit or haunt is
defeated, you instantly gain a ﬂash of insight
into how it can be permanently put to rest.
Typically, this ﬂash manifests as a vision that
presents a quick scene closely linked to the
source of the spirit or haunt’s creation.
Attempt a Spirit Lore or Haunt Lore check,
respectively, with a DC appropriate for the
spirit or haunt’s level. On a success, you
gain a hint about how to put the spirit to
rest or permanently disable the haunt; on a
critical success, you learn the exact method
of doing so.

Bright Walker
Those who encounter calignis (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 50) quickly learn that
their deaths involve burning out instead of bleeding out. At times, this
dramatic immolation is denied to a caligni, so they arise as a bright walker.
Tied to caligni society, these creatures don’t understand that their glow
damages and repels living calignis. Despite their name, these undead don’t
walk; they instead ﬂoat a few inches above the ground.

the blazing end they were denied at death. This blaze deals
10d6 ﬁre damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex save) to creatures

for 1 minute (blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure).
Light Aura (aura, divine, light) 30 feet. The bright walker

for 1 round, reducing it to a faint, ghostly glow of dim light.
Speed ﬂy 25 feet; landbound
Melee Ȱɵ radiant touch +21 (agile, ﬁnesse, ﬁre, light, magical), Damage 2d8+11 ﬁre
Ranged Ȱɵ radiant ray +21 (ﬁre, light, magical, range increment 60 feet) Damage
2d6+11 ﬁre
Landbound A bright walker can’t ﬂy higher than 1 foot above the ground. If they
ﬂy higher than this distance, they fall but don’t take any damage from falling.
Light Flare ʚʖ (divine, evocation, ﬁre, light); Requirement The bright walker’s
Light Aura is suppressed; Eﬀect The bright walker reignites their Light Aura
with a burst of brightness that deals 5d6 ﬁre damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex
save) to creatures within a 20-foot burst. Creatures who are dazzled or with
light blindness ﬁnd this ﬂare particularly painful; such a creature’s save result
is one degree of success worse than the result it rolled.
Shadow Jump Ȱɵ (conjuration, divine, teleportation); Requirement The bright
walker’s Light Aura is suppressed; Eﬀect The bright walker teleports to a
square it can see within 60 feet that is not in an area of bright light. The bright
walker can’t use Shadow Jump again for 1d4 rounds.
BRIGHT WALKER FORMATION
Most calignis assume that bright
walkers arise at the whims of their
malign and capricious demigods, the
Forsaken, but as the Forsaken are
denied the souls of these undead,
some other unknown force must be
involved.

Corpselight
A will-o’-wisp that starves to death might rise as a cold, blue, glowing
sphere of spongy wetness—a corpselight. A corpselight instinctively seeks
out a host corpse to dwell within, as its physical form quickly deteriorates
if not hidden within a dead creature.
CORPSELIGHT
CREATURE 2
RARE
CE
MEDIUM
UNDEAD
Perception +7; corpse sense (precise) 30 feet, darkvision
Languages Common, Necril
Skills Athletics +7, Intimidation +8, Stealth +8
Str +3, Dex +4, Con +1, Int +1, Wis +1, Cha +2
Corpse Sense A corpselight can sense dead bodies within range. This is a precise
sense that functions through solid barriers less than 5 feet thick.
AC 17; Fort +5, Ref +10, Will +7
HP 40, negative healing; Immunities death eﬀects, disease, fear, paralyzed,
poison, precision, unconscious; Weaknesses bludgeoning 5 (in skeletal
corpses) or slashing 5 (in ﬂeshy corpses)
Sunlight Powerlessness A corpselight exposed to sunlight is
stunned 2 and clumsy 2, and cannot Claim a Corpse.
Wisp Form When a corpselight is reduced to 0 Hit Points
while merged with a corpse, it is instead reduced to 1
Hit Point as the corpse collapses to the ground and the
corpselight emerges in its wisp form. While in wisp
form, a corpselight is Tiny and can take no actions other
than Claim Corpse or Fly. A corpselight that starts its turn
in wisp form must attempt a DC 16 ﬂat check at the end of
its turn; if it fails, it loses 1 Hit Point. A corpselight reduced to
0 Hit Points while in wisp form is destroyed.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet (wisp form only)
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +10, Damage 1d8+6 piercing
Melee Ȱɵ claw +10 (agile), Damage 1d6+6 slashing
Claim Corpse Ȱɵ (necromancy) Prerequisites The corpselight is in wisp
form and is adjacent to a Medium or Small corpse that hasn’t been
claimed by a corpselight in the past 24 hours; Effect The corpselight
merges with the corpse, causes the corpse to Stand, and regains 3d6
Hit Points.
Death Light ̂ˬ (emotion, fear, mental, necromancy, occult) Prerequisites
The corpselight is merged with a corpse; Eﬀect The corpselight emits a
sickly blue beam of light from its mouth and eyes in a 20-foot cone. All
living creatures in this area must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude
saving throw. If at least 1 creature fails its save, the
corpselight regains 2d6 Hit Points, gaining any that
exceed its maximum as temporary Hit Points
that last for 1 minute. The corpselight can’t use
Death Light again for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The creature takes 1d6 negative
damage.
Failure The creature takes 2d6 negative damage
and is frightened 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes 4d6 negative damage
and is frightened 3.
LARGER CORPSELIGHTS
A typical corpselight can animate
only a Small or Medium corpse, but
particularly powerful corpselights
can inhabit larger bodies. Their basic
abilities remain the same, but the
damage they deal and the DC of their
Death Light increase as appropriate
for their increased level.

Drow
Drow (Bestiary 136) have a reputation for evil due to demon worship in their
major settlements. However, like members of any ancestry, drow can have any
alignment, especially when removed from the demon lords’ sinister inﬂuence.

ADHERENTS OF CHAOS
Away from the larger drow cities,
where worship of demon lords is
instilled into all citizens from a
young age, drow might adopt the
worship of other entities. Many drow
feel the call of the protean lords and
embrace chaos, art, and freedom
to set themselves apart from their
demon‑worshipping kin. These
communities often have proteans
living among them, instructing drow
proteges in the power of disorder.

SHOOTIST ENTOURAGES
Many drow shootists have a
magnetic bravado that draws others
to follow and learn from them. Few
shootists are as skilled at teaching
as they are at ﬁghting, however, and
their followers aren’t much more
than an entourage. These hangers‑on
are rarely as lucky or quick as the
shootist, so shootists lose their
followers to monsters or mischance
with startling frequency.

Fleshwarp
Although twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime
of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices
or developed them independently. The worm-like seugathis (page 244)
sometimes warp other creatures whose territories abut their lightless lands;
the ﬂeshwarps below result from morlocks and urdefhans, respectively.
DRESHKAN
Because morlocks are descended from distant human ancestors, clumsily
or hastily ﬂeshwarping a morlock simply produces a grothlut (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 158). Skilled ﬂeshwarpers, however, can tease out a morlock’s
genetic differences to make an entirely different creature. Creating a
dreshkan involves replacing the morlock’s bones with a metal skeleton.
This new skeleton is often heavily augmented, such as with spiderlike
limbs protruding from the spine or magazines of tiny, deadly needles.
Arcane electricity courses through the dreshkan thereafter, making it
jumpy and irritable.
Morlocks view dreshkans as impressive fusions of ﬂesh and technology.
They gladly ﬁght alongside dreshkans, viewing them as paragons of
morlock potential. Dreshkans don’t think much of morlock allies and
don’t much care if they’re injured by an errant spray of electriﬁed needles.

needles at as many creatures as it would like in a 30-foot cone, dealing

Swarming Stance A dreshkan can share the same space as a morlock
or another dreshkan, but no more than two such creatures can occupy
the same space. When these creatures share the same space, they gain a +1
circumstance bonus to attack rolls.
DRESHKAN VARIATIONS
Though most dreshkans ﬁre
electriﬁed needles from the metal
limbs on their backs, some are built
with even stranger abilities. Seugathi
masters looking to perfect their craft
will sometimes “upgrade” dreshkans’
artiﬁcial limbs to gout steam,
hammer through stone, or launch
hooks at the end of long cables.

MULVENTOK
Sinister ﬂeshwarpers reshape captive urdefhans into these juggernauts
of war. Their clear skin is hardened into a thick, mirror-like carapace,
creating an intimidating exoskeleton. Mulventoks don’t live long;
within weeks—or, at most, months—their hyperdeveloped muscles
split open their toughened skin, and they erupt in a shower of gore. A
mulventok’s creator shapes its mind just as much as its body, directing
its aggression toward a single purpose, such as to raze a fortress or
murder a speciﬁc individual.

(necromancy,

When
a
mulventok dies, its mirrored ﬂesh
ruptures and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Creatures caught in the blast are
covered with viscera and take 8d6 negative damage (DC 22 basic Reﬂex save).
Stay in the Fight Ǻȓ (healing, necromancy, occult); Trigger An allied creature
within 30 feet reaches 0 HP; Eﬀect The mulventok imparts some of its own
energy to keep the ally ﬁghting. The target creature gains 1 Hit Point, and the
mulventok takes 2d6 mental damage.

Fervent Command Ȱɵ (auditory, mental) The mulventok shouts an order
to one of its allies within 30 feet. That ally immediately takes a
Raise a Shield or Step action. A creature can beneﬁt from Fervent
Command only once per round.
Psychokinetic Honing (occult, transmutation) A thrown
weapon gains the eﬀects of a returning rune when a
mulventok throws it. Thrown weapons the mulventok uses
deal an additional 1d6 mental damage, whether used in melee
or thrown.
MULVENTOK LEADERS
Some ﬂeshwarpers forge small
units of mulventoks to pursue a
similar but important goal, thinking
that if some of the creatures don’t
survive, the others can complete
the objective. Mulventoks work
together surprisingly well, creating
hierarchies of command that shift
as needed in the ﬁeld. Although
mulventoks are arguably just
as eﬀective when working with
non-mulventoks, their singular
focus—which even extends to what
they eat and where and how they
sleep—is oﬀ-putting at best.

Gibtas
This rubbery, spheroid scavenger is nearly all acid-dripping mouth, with
ﬁve bulbous black eyes and two powerful, gangly legs. A gibtas often forms
a bond with a single other creature—usually, a more powerful aberration—
and serves this master loyally, if erratically. Creatures who keep a gibtas as
a pet or guard soon learn to keep it away from any important possessions
they don’t want spattered with acid.

WILD GIBTASES
In the wild, gibtases are scavenger
creatures, avoiding much larger
and more powerful predators while
feeding oﬀ abandoned scraps. This
limits their consumption-based
reproduction. By spawning hundreds
of oﬀspring at once during times
of plentiful food, they ensure the
propagation of their species only
during times of plenty.

Morlock
Morlocks originate from humans long lost to the surface world. They have
an afﬁnity for machinery, scavenging, and strange occult behaviors.
MORLOCK SCAVENGER
The morlock scavenger is a lankier, smaller version of a typical morlock.
Their stature allows them to wriggle into areas other morlocks can’t access.

terrain caused by natural cavern features like rubble or stalagmites. At any
point during its movement, the morlock can make a melee Strike against an
enemy in its reach.
Sneak Attack The morlock deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
Swarming Stance A morlock can share the same space as another morlock, but
no more than two morlocks can occupy the same space. When morlocks share
the same space, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls.

Morlock engineers are talented at
ﬁguring out ancient machinery or
damaged constructs, but don’t keep
notes or record their techniques. As
a result, a morlock enclave might
well be defended by strange, ancient
mechanical hazards or constructs
that treat morlocks as allies, even
though none of the morlocks can say
who built the machines they use.

projectile from objects it carries or that are readily accessible in adjacent
squares. Where unusual materials are available, an improvised projectile
might deal damage other than bludgeoning or piercing—for example, a
morlock engineer by a campﬁre could build a projectile that deals ﬁre damage.
Sneak Attack The morlock deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
Swarming Stance As morlock scavenger.
Uncanny Tinker ʚʖ The morlock engineer tinkers with an adjacent construct or
mechanical hazard. They attempt a Crafting check against the construct’s or
hazard’s Fortitude DC. The morlock can’t get an outcome better than failure if
the target’s level is more than double the morlock’s. This ability reﬂects hasty
battleﬁeld repairs; once a construct or hazard regains Hit Points from this
ability, it can’t do so again until it’s been Repaired.
Critical Success The target regains 8d6 Hit Points and a +1 circumstance
bonus to attack rolls for 1 minute. Alternately, the morlock can deal 8d6
damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as chosen
by the morlock engineer) to the construct or hazard.
Success As critical success, but the target regains 4d6 Hit
Points or the morlock deals 4d6 damage.
Critical Failure The morlock injures themself, taking
3d6 damage (typically bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing, but potentially a diﬀerent type at the
GM’s discretion).

creatures.
MORLOCK CULTS
Morlocks led by cultists don’t always
follow an established religion, in part
because their insular background
limits contact with the rest of the
world. In many cases, a morlock
cult worships some ﬁgure from the
group’s past, be it a revered (or more
often, feared) ancestor, or even the
strange machines or statues left
behind from a mysterious civilization
that once ruled the place where the
morlocks now live.

Scalathrax
These slippery, scaly horrors dwell in remote cave networks in the
Darklands, preferring to nest in narrow ﬁssures. When on the hunt, they
ﬂick barbs from their long legs, or spray down their foes with a clear,
toxic oil. The same oil coats the scalathrax’s body, all of which is quite
ﬂammable—whether it’s coating a victim or the scalathrax itself.
While a scalathrax appears feral, it’s more intelligent than it seems
and is capable of speaking in a wet, slithery voice. The vast majority of
scalathraxes are foul-tempered and quick to anger, and most of them
enjoy killing. It’s possible to forge an alliance with a scalathrax, but doing
so requires either constant bribes of new creatures to kill or a particularly
intimidating personality—scalathraxes often respect bullies, seeing in
them a mirror of their own cruel values.

Seugathi
The wicked, alien neothelids (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2 181) impregnate
themselves through ritualistic magic to produce wormlike servitor
creatures called seugathis. These creatures spawn with a strong psychic
drive to complete some task on behalf of the neothelids’ far-reaching
plans. These directives are diverse, strange, and usually cruel toward
humanoid life.
SEUGATHI SERVANT
The most common seugathis spawned by neothelids are seugathi servants.
Their masters equip them with tools useful in their tasks (often a wand
and a weapon), and they rarely value other material things beyond their
usefulness in completing their imprinted mission.

Mindfog Aura (enchantment, mental) 20 feet. A creature that starts its turn
in the aura must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become confused
for 1 round; on a success, that creature is temporarily immune
for 1 minute. A seugathi can suppress or activate this aura
as a single action with the concentrate trait.
Command Confusion Ǻȓ Trigger A creature fails
its save against the seugathi’s mindfog
aura; Eﬀect The seugathi determines
who the confused creature
attacks for that round, instead
of the target being randomly determined
by the GM. If the chosen target
is the confused creature’s ally,
the creature can immediately

SEUGATHI OBSESSIONS
Because of their singlemindedness,
seugathis often come across as
eerily obsessive. These obsessions
can include corralling 100 deros
into a cave, collecting skulls of a
certain shape, or even more unusual
tasks that either have no apparent
result or are harmful to the seugathi
themself. A seugathi that completes
their mission nearly always ﬁnds
another to replace it buried in its
psyche, creating a centuries-long
chain of inscrutable—and sometimes
even contradictory—commands.

SEUGATHI REALITY WARPER
Seugathi reality warpers create and destroy inhospitable environments on
a small scale by manipulating the forces of raw chaos. A neothelid might
spawn such a seugathi to create habitats for unique slaves or guests, or
to destroy the ecosystem of a troublesome species. Darklands scholars
refer to reality warpers as veterans in the seugathi ranks, but they’re more
accurately compared to aggressive landscape architects.

Warp Reality ̂ˬ (concentrate, occult, transmutation) The seugathi bends
reality in their choice of a 10-foot emanation or a 60-foot line, altering the
terrain of the area. The terrain becomes a diﬀerent type of terrain (such as
aquatic, arctic, or desert) and becomes normal or diﬃcult terrain, as the
seugathi chooses. Structures, general geographic features, and creatures in
the area aren’t transformed, but creatures in the area take 5d6 chaotic damage
(DC 28 basic Fortitude save) as reality tries to bend them along with the
terrain. Though changes to the area are permanent, the natural environment
might eventually revert the land back to its original state (aquatic areas drain,
arctic areas thaw, and so on).
UNUSUAL EQUIPMENT
Most seugathi carry a magic wand—
either one gifted by their neothelid
master to serve a particular end or
simply one they’ve discovered to
be particularly useful. A wand of
2nd-level magic missile is common,
but speciﬁc equipment is as varied
as the seugathis’ inexplicable
missions. A seugathi might instead
carry alchemical equipment, a
strange tool, or another magic
item. One is just as likely to have
a traveler’s anytool as a jar full of
eerie, unstable explosives.

Shanrigol
Fleshwarpers, regardless of their origin or training, create a shocking
amount of waste. When the discarded remnants of aberrant ﬂesh are
heaped together with an accidental mixture of alchemical compounds or
odious energy, the mass can quicken and regain life. Without the guidance
of a ﬂeshwarper, these aberrant body parts form into a shanrigol, a mess
of bone, muscle, and sinew.
SHANRIGOL HEAP
The most basic and common type of shanrigol is called, based on its
general shape, a shanrigol heap. These amalgamations of warped ﬂesh and
shattered bone establish hunting grounds by accident rather than design,
remaining where prey has been plentiful in the past so they can grow larger
and larger as they add to their jumbled forms. Only rare ﬂeshwarpers
create these abominations willingly, as they ignore all commands and
containment to seek out prey.

Step until it occupies an area large enough for its
normal form.
SHANRIGOL TREASURE
Because these undead aberrations
seek only to absorb more ﬂesh, they
don’t care about material things.
When near a shanrigol’s lair, it’s not
uncommon to see bloody armor,
unsheathed weapons, and intact
potion bottles scattered around the
site of a battle. A shanrigol’s fruitful
ambush location is likely to have
piles of overlooked valuable treasure
from past victims.

SHANRIGOL BEHEMOTH
Shanrigols that grow with the additions of many living victims can become
truly enormous in size and pose a greater danger in their expanding hunting
territories. Subterranean communities have collapsed entire tunnels to
prevent the creatures from reaching their settlements.
Many shanrigol behemoths absorb enough brain matter to form crude
intelligences and take a serpentine or humanoid shape. They’re more
varied in their abilities than shanrigol heaps, as they often gain abilities
from their constituent creatures. The shanrigol behemoth presented
below contains ﬂesh from driders and urdefhans, giving it a web attack
and necrotic decay ability. Not all shanrigol behemoths have these two
abilities, but should have other abilities to replace them.

sublimates into a foul-smelling gas that ﬁlls a 5-foot

EMPTY CARESSES
Just as the cult of Nhimbaloth
regards will-o’-wisps as their
goddess’s eyes, their teachings hold
that ﬂickerwisps are the gentle
caress of her touch. To them, the
confusion imposed by a ﬂickerwisp
is akin to opening the mind to the
goddess’s presence, and many
cultists of the faith keep ﬂickerwisps
around to use in much the same
way other faiths use incense or
intoxicants to achieve deeper
religious ecstasies.
Wisp
The eerie aberrations called will-o’-wisps (Bestiary 333) come in many types.
Flickerwisp
The dancing, twisting ﬂickerwisp is a less powerful but no less malevolent
type of will-o’-wisp. Like their more dangerous kin, ﬂickerwisps prefer to
haunt lonely swamps or stretches of lonely rivers or creeks, particularly
near the shorelines where they can pass themselves off as a small gathering
of ﬁreﬂies. A ﬂickerwisp’s body is a 3-foot-long length of hair-like ﬁbers
that ﬂash and pulse with ribbons and points of eerie yellow light.
While a ﬂickerwisp can taste fear, and ﬁnds the ﬂavor delectable, it does
not feed on this emotion. Instead, ﬂickerwisps subsist on confusion and
doubt. The sense of unease a traveler exudes when they become lost in
the woods is ﬂickerwisps’ favorite repast. They can sip from this sense
of disorientation without betraying their presence or harming their prey.
Eventually, the ﬂickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to ﬂit
closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions. The most skilled
of these tormentors can keep a chosen meal alive for days, sipping from
confusion in small doses.

eﬀects to persist. It regains 1d4 Hit Points, and if the creature’s
confused condition has a limited duration, it lasts 1 additional round.

ﬂits in the air around an adjacent creature’s head, and its length ﬂashes and
sparkles in a bewildering array of distracting pulsations. The creature must
succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 1 round (2 rounds on a

to Flicker for 24 hours.

associated with the Outer Goddess
Nhimbaloth. Her cultists see
voidgluttons as roving incarnations
of her hunger and have been
known to oﬀer themselves up to
voidgluttons as prey in order to
achieve religious insights. Most who
attempt this get a closer look at
death than they intended.

Dread Wisp
Will-o’-wisps native to the Darklands are more ominous and malevolent
than those that bob about in the lonely marshes and surfaces of the
upper world. These dread wisps instill terror with eerie shifts of light and
consume the fear they create, drawing life energy from their victims in the
process. While dread wisps can survive anywhere within the Darklands,
they prefer moist areas like the banks of underground rivers.
Dread wisps don’t glow as brightly as surface will-o’-wisps because even
the dimmest light attracts notice underground. Long-lived and hateful
creatures, they remember vivid details about their lives, travels, and most
delicious prey. Although dread wisps could share extensive lore and unique
experiences, they don’t, as they ﬁnd amusement in others’ ignorance.

Dread Flickering (aura, light) 20 feet. A dread wisp, though naturally invisible,
glows with a grayish illumination, casting dim light in the aura and making them
visible. Living creatures that end their turn in the aura must succeed at a DC 25
Will saving throw or become frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical failure).
Those that critically succeed are temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Magic Immunity A dread wisp is immune to all spells except faerie ﬁre, magic
missile, maze, searing light, and spells with the positive trait.
Speed ﬂy 50 feet
Melee Ȱɵ draining touch +17 (magical, negative), Damage
3d8+8 negative plus wearying touch
Feed on Despair Ȱɵ (concentrate, necromancy, negative,
occult); Frequency once per round; Requirement An
enemy within 15 feet of the dread wisp is under a
fear eﬀect, drained, or dying; Eﬀect The dread wisp
feeds on the creature’s despair. The dread wisp
regains 2d8 Hit Points and deals 3d8 negative
damage to the creature (DC 25 basic Fortitude
save), and if the dread wisp has Gone Dark, their
Dread Flickering reignites.
Go Dark Ȱɵ (concentrate) The dread wisp
extinguishes their Dread Flickering, becoming
invisible. They can end this eﬀect with another use of
this action. If the dread wisp uses their draining touch
Strike while invisible, the arc of pale energy lets any
observer determine their location, making them hidden to
all observers only until the dread wisp moves.
Shadow Flitter Ȱɵ (conjuration, occult, teleportation) The dread
wisp teleports to a square they can see within 30 feet that isn’t in an area of
bright light. The dread wisp can’t use Shadow Flitter again for 1d4 rounds.
Wearying Touch If the dread wisp critically hits with their draining touch Strike,
the target is drained 1.
DREAD WISP ORIGINS
The origins of will-o’-wisps are hotly
debated, but dread wisps have
a commonly understood origin.
Surface wisps give momentary hope
to those lost and scared in a dark
and damp wilderness, but nearly
all of the Darklands is dark and
damp. Hope has little place here,
and deﬁant people and menacing
monsters populate the Darklands.
Subterranean will-o’-wisps adapted
to overcome these new, resilient food
sources. Dread wisps descended
from those tenacious survivors.
