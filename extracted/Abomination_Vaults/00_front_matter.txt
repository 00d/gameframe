From the Beginner Box
If you started the heroes’ careers with the Pathﬁnder Beginner
Box and the adventure “Menace Under Otari,” your heroes
already know about Otari. They’re also already 2nd level! You
don’t need to make any adjustments to this adventure, as 2nd
level characters can begin it without any trouble. Don’t allow
them to level up to 3rd level until they’ve substantially cleared
the dangers in both of the upper two dungeon levels.

Abomination
Vaults
The ghost sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex is the primary
villain of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The
story behind her spiteful rage is one of exile and loss.
Belcorra’s History
The Haruvex family tree both sprawls and surges
with sorcery. The family’s strongest bloodlines have an
aberrant strain, which provides family prestige as well
as sorcerous power. Generations of Haruvexes married
within the family to strengthen this lineage, and the
most powerful Haruvexes lived in Absalom 500 years
ago. These Absalom Haruvexes made secret obeisance
to the Outer Gods for great wealth and greater power.
But none in the family approached the power of their
youngest scion, Belcorra Haruvex. Belcorra had been
told, every day for as long as she could remember,
that she was the harbinger of Nhimbaloth, the Empty
Death, and that she was her family’s greatest hope for
power and prosperity.
The Haruvexes enacted abhorrent rites in their
worship,
including
bloody
sacriﬁces,
and
the
authorities eventually caught wind of their crimes. The
Haruvexes were ﬁnally driven from the Isle of Kortos
in 4219 ar, forced to leave their estates and luxuries
behind. Belcorra was only 6 years old at the time, but
as she grew, her rage at losing her home solidiﬁed into
an overwhelming hatred of Absalom and everyone
in it.
Most of the exiled Haruvexes died in poverty,
but Belcorra grew strong and proud. At 17, she
interpreted visions from Nhimbaloth that led her
back to the Isle of Kortos to plan her revenge. Far
above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called
the Empty Vault, in a lonely stretch of wooded coast
a few dozen miles from Absalom, Belcorra erected a
magical lighthouse and called it Gauntlight. She dug
deep beneath it to reach the shrine she had seen in her
visions, and while she worked, she began to plan her
revenge. She would draw subterranean monsters and
violent beasts into her secret dungeons—which she
called the Abomination Vaults—and use Gauntlight’s
magic to send them into Absalom to wreak havoc.
She enacted the ﬁrst part of her plan, expanding
the Abomination Vaults and raising a defensible
keep around the lighthouse. She leveraged family
acquaintances to acquire powerful retainers and
champions to lead her monstrous forces.
Belcorra was still stocking her Abomination
Vaults with aberrations when rumors of her villainy
reached Absalom. The Roseguard, a group of heroes
headquartered in Absalom, set out from the city to
confront and vanquish her. The Roseguard faced
Belcorra within Gauntlight Keep and killed her there.
One of the four members of the Roseguard, a rogue
named Otari Ilvashti, died in this ﬁght. Grieving their
lost friend, the Roseguard left, sealed up the keep,
founded what would become the town of Otari, and
retired there. They never knew of the keep’s lower levels
or the many creatures still remaining within them.
A DUNGEON FULL OF MONSTERS
The horrors trapped in the Abomination Vaults
developed some measure of ecosystem in the following
centuries. While many monsters beneath the citadel died,
others have prospered, and now several communities
of morlocks, urdefhans, ghouls, and stranger creatures
call the dungeons home. Only the longest-lived
remember any life other than the dungeons. Belcorra
had bound several devils to serve her as overseers and
administrators, and many of these still maintain order.
Apart from the regions maintained by these devils
and a drow outpost in one of the lowest levels, the
Abomination Vaults are lawless and dangerous.
The Abomination Vaults consist of 10 levels,
including the ruins around Gauntlight on the surface.
They’re, from top to bottom, the ruins of Gauntlight
Keep, the servant’s quarters, the library, Belcorra’s
former living chambers, the arena, the laboratories, the

prison, the farm caverns, the hunting cavern, and the
temple level, which holds the Empty Vault. Each level
has its own character, and the levels are progressively
more dangerous the deeper the heroes venture.
BELCORRA’S RISE
Belcorra’s spirit didn’t rest peacefully. Consumed by
rage and empowered by Nhimbaloth, she arose as
a powerful ghost 500 years after her family’s exile
from Absalom, the event that so dramatically altered
her life. Belcorra now lurks in the deepest levels
of the Abomination Vaults, plotting her revenge
against Absalom and the heroes who vanquished her.
The Roseguard are long dead, but the town they
founded remains, and the icons representing their
adventuring careers (page 217) now have the power to
penetrate Belcorra’s protections.
At ﬁrst, no one in Otari realizes the danger Belcorra
poses. Her machinations and her monsters are well out
of sight. But before she moves against Absalom, she
intends to use her Gauntlight against Otari—the town
built by the adventurers who killed her ﬁve centuries
before. Only Otari’s newest heroes can prevent
Belcorra’s vengeance and put her spirit to rest.
Date

Event
Age of Darkness	 Serpentfolk construct the Empty Vault, a shrine to Nhimbaloth far beneath the surface of Golarion.
When Aroden raises the Starstone Isles from the Inner Sea, the Empty Vault ascends with it, ending
up several hundred feet below the Isle of Kortos.
Unknown
The neutral drow of a subterranean city construct an outpost closer to the surface called Yldaris.
These drow are unconsciously drawn to the Empty Vault but don’t know of its presence.
4213 ar
Belcorra Haruvex is born to the wealthy Haruvex family in Absalom. Unknown to anyone outside
the family, the Haruvexes have a strong aberrant bloodline and a familial devotion to the Outer
God Nhimbaloth.
4219 ar
The Haruvex family is ejected from Absalom when their secret sacriﬁces are discovered. They ﬂee
to Andoran, where they live in poverty. This is particularly hard on 6-year-old Belcorra, the family’s
youngest scion. The Haruvexes instill in Belcorra a hatred of Absalom and impress upon the child
her role as Nhimbaloth’s chosen one.
4230 ar
Belcorra, the last exiled Haruvex, has become a powerful sorcerer. She secretly relocates to the Isle
of Kortos, where she begins work on a magical lighthouse called Gauntlight, situated directly above
the Empty Vault. She magically opens passages through the earth to reach the shrine and begins to
collect an army of aberrations to attack Absalom.
4234 ar
Belcorra completes Gauntlight and begins work on its dungeons, the Abomination Vaults. She uses
will-o’-wisps and bound devils to enforce her will on the rapidly expanding hordes within. She meets
the drow and urdefhans who dwell in the area and demands their fealty in exchange for their lives.
4244 ar
One of Absalom’s “hunting lodges” (a sanctioned group of adventurers) called the Roseguard hear
of Belcorra’s presence and come to investigate her lighthouse. They kill her but never learn of the
existence of the expansive Abomination Vaults beneath Gauntlight; Belcorra kills the rogue Otari
Ilvashti in this battle. The victorious Roseguard construct a small port community and retire there,
naming it Otari after their fallen friend.
4290 ar
The last Roseguard passes away, and Otari begins to fall into decline.
4294 ar
Otari is abandoned.
4300 ar
Stonescale kobolds colonize Otari.
4310 ar
Yarlaip seals his tribe’s fate by luring ships to their doom; the Stonescale kobolds are soon thereafter
defeated by adventurers. Maklanni Menhemes leads the resettlement of Otari.
4323 ar
Construction of the Otari Mill and log ﬂume is completed.
4719 ar
Belcorra awakens as a ghost and begins work to reactivate Gauntlight. Its dungeons have been
populated with generations of inﬁghting creatures since her death, and she seeks to bring them
under her control once more.
4721 ar
The current year. Gauntlight becomes infested with a band of mitﬂits, who are displaced by
morlocks pushing upwards at the urging of their “ghost queen.” Gauntlight is ready for a test to
demonstrate its power.

Gamemaster Advice
While each level of the Abomination Vaults is
built with the assumption of a group of heroes at a
particular character level, each has more than enough
encounters for a party to level up. Part of the joy of a
large dungeon crawl is the exploration of every nook
and cranny, and a party who faces every encounter
might gain enough experience points to reach higher
levels well before the end of this Adventure Path—and
that’s ﬁne! Some later encounters challenge a high-level
party well enough, even if the heroes have to retreat,
rest, and recover less often.
The dungeon provides lots of freedom to explore,
particularly in the middle levels. Let the players gauge
whether their characters are in over their heads and
retreat (or ﬂee!) if the situation demands it. When the
heroes face harder-than-expected challenges for their
current level, they earn more XP, and when they face
easier-than-expected ones, they earn less. This keeps
their progression on roughly the same track. That said,
if you want a slower-paced game, Abomination Vaults
works well with a slow Advancement Speed (Pathﬁnder
Core Rulebook 509).
Story-based progression can be tricky for a giant
dungeon crawl since the heroes can move between
levels through multiple routes. If you prefer story-based
progression, rather than automatically allowing the
heroes to level up simply because they quickly reached
a lower dungeon level, consider requiring them to
complete speciﬁc milestones to level up, as detailed in
the Advancement Track.
The ﬁnal three levels are where the story of the
Abomination Vaults comes to its head. It’s critical that
the heroes discover the three fulcrum lenses in the lower
levels and learn how they work—speciﬁcally, how they
can permanently destroy Belcorra. Yet Belcorra has
more freedom to harry the heroes throughout these
lower levels, and by the time the heroes face her in
the Empty Vault, they’ve earned her ire. With luck, the
heroes can defeat Belcorra and topple Gauntlight.
1
The heroes begin at 1st level (or at 2nd level if they’ve played the Pathﬁnder Beginner Box adventure).
Milestone: The heroes advance to 2nd level (or remain 2nd level) after clearing out most of the Gauntlight
Ruins, including the lighthouse’s cupola.
2
The heroes should be 2nd level before the “Deadtide for Otari” event.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 3rd level after defeating the Ghost Queen morlocks.
3
The heroes should be 3rd level upon entering the library.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 4th level after defeating the Cult of the Canker.
Advancement Track
The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is designed for four characters, with each dungeon level’s encounters
keyed to a speciﬁc character level.
4
The heroes should be 4th level upon entering Belcorra’s Retreat.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 5th level after speaking with Otari’s ghost.
5
The heroes should be 5th level before addressing the theft and dream-possession in town.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 6th level after clearing out most of the Arena level.
6
The heroes should be 6th level upon entering the Laboratories level.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 7th level after defeating Jafaki and the seugathis.
7
The heroes should be 7th level upon entering the Prison level.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 8th level after dealing with Urevian.
8
The heroes should be 8th level upon entering the Farm level.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 9th level after clearing out most of the Farm level.
9
The heroes should be 9th level upon entering the Hunting Grounds level.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 10th level upon entering the Gate of Nhimbaloth.
10
The heroes should be 10th level upon entering the Temple level.
Milestone: The heroes advance to 11th level after (or, perhaps, just before) defeating Belcorra.
The heroes should reach 11th level by the end of the Adventure Path.

Though the immense metropolis of Absalom has long
dominated the urban scene on Starstone Isle, civilization
has always thrived across the island. Otari’s beginning
is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along
the way. When Belcorra Haruvex arrived in the region
in 4230 ar, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the
coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she
built Gauntlight, the keep surrounding the area, and
the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without
attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as
the Roseguard eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy
and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a
rogue named Otari Ilvashti.
Having lost both their friend and their taste for
adventuring, the three surviving members of the
Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their
savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier
in a sheltered cove south of the site of their ﬁnal battle.
Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle
down in a small seaside village, they named this new
village after him.
For some decades, Otari prospered as a ﬁshing
village, though its population never grew beyond
a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard
adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing
away from natural causes—an accomplishment many
adventurers never achieve.
With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna
Menhemes, in 4290 ar, Otari’s fortunes began to
dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had
all drifted elsewhere. Otari lay abandoned for decades
before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved
in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships
during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal
their cargo, it didn’t take long for new adventurers to
arrive and vanquish them.
While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter,
their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind.
Maklanni, Aesephna’s granddaughter, conceived a plan
to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained
dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored,
after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill
and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated
Maklanni’s plan—the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding
Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difﬁcult.
Maklanni’s solution was ingenious—she constructed
a wooden ﬂume that allowed for the easy transport of
lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there,
down an astounding loading ramp that extended
from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor
below. The mill and ﬂume made Maklanni wealthy
and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy
of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold
on the island’s lumber industry. Two other small
lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium
and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of
Maklanni’s invention.
Today, Otari is a thriving settlement—the largest
on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni
is long dead, but her descendant Oseph carries on
the family trade and also serves as the town’s mayor.
Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium
have secretly inﬁltrated Otari and seek to undermine
the town’s security. However, a far greater threat looms
over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to
light the baleful ﬁres of Gauntlight once again!
Otari at a Glance
Otari is nestled in a coastal valley between two
looming cliffs. To the west, the cliffside rises to meet
a well-cared-for graveyard. To the east, a fantastic feat
of engineering draws the eye—the trestle supporting a
wooden loading chute extends down from the clifftop to
a loading platform built into the harbor. This ingenious
construction swiftly delivers lumber processed further
inland at the mill to waiting ships below.
The people of Otari are friendly and welcoming
for the most part, although they tend to react with

reticence toward those they suspect hail from Absalom.
Trade with Absalom is important, but the townsfolk
are proud and feel no need to accommodate visiting
“city folk.” People in Otari typically subsist on ﬁsh
along with vegetables from local farms (primarily
potatoes, carrots, and other root vegetables), but more
unusual fare isn’t hard to get from Absalom. Coffee is
a mainstay and a favorite drink of the hardworking
and early-rising residents.
Exploring Otari
Signiﬁcant locations in Otari are detailed on the
following pages and correspond to the numbers on
the map on page 8. Unlabeled buildings are wooden
homes whose inhabitants work for nearby businesses
or for one of the town’s three lumber concerns.
Many signiﬁcant locations end with a stat block
that summarizes the site’s name, general function, and
level (for the purpose of determining any necessary
values associated with it, such as the highest level task
available to Earn Income). This stat block also notes
the site’s address, wares and services for sale there
(such as spellcasting services), and information about
the most signiﬁcant NPC who lives or works at the
establishment. The NPC’s initial attitude condition to
the heroes is also listed, along with DCs most likely to
be useful when interacting with the NPC.
LOCATION SUPPORT
If a hero adjusts an NPC’s attitude condition to helpful
(which might require completion of a listed task but
usually requires successful Diplomacy checks to Make
an Impression), that NPC’s location supports the
party in certain exploration and downtime activities.
The speciﬁc beneﬁts are based on the location’s traits
and are listed below. This support generally lasts
throughout the campaign, although you might decide
certain actions lose a location’s support. The heroes
can be supported by multiple locations in town, so
long as they make enough friends!
Church: Faithful characters whose beliefs align
with those of the church’s NPC (at your discretion)
are permitted to use the location’s resources to retrain
more efﬁciently. Retraining that would normally
require a week takes only 5 days at this location,
retraining that would normally require a month takes
only 3 weeks, and retraining is generally free. Checks
to Identify Magic, Treat Wounds, or Treat Disease on
site gain a +1 circumstance bonus.
Discount: The location provides a 10% discount on
its wares.
Employer: The location offers tasks up to its level to
Earn Income with a speciﬁed skill.
Garrison: Martially inclined characters can retrain
more efﬁciently here (as Church). Checks to Gather
Information or Treat Wounds on site gain a +1
circumstance bonus.

comfortable cost of living for no charge.
Library: Scholarly characters, as well as arcane and
occult spellcasters, can retrain more efﬁciently here (as
Church). Checks to Create Forgery, Decipher Writing,
or Learn a Spell on site gain a +1 circumstance bonus.

efﬁciently here (as Church). Checks to Identify Magic
or Subsist on site gain a +1 circumstance bonus.
Parlor: Socially inclined characters can retrain
more efﬁciently here (as Church). Checks to Gather
Information or Earn Income with Performance gain a

1. THE GIANT’S WHEEL
The Otari Mill is known locally as the Giant’s Wheel,
as its towering, 30-foot-diameter waterwheel is truly
a sight to behold. The wheel’s immense size is needed
to generate enough torque to power the mechanized
treadmill loading logs into the ﬂume and keep the saws
running within the mill. Much of the lumberyard’s
income comes from the town’s two larger lumber
families, who pay to have their lumber processed here.
The mill is a noisy place, with the constant grinding and
churning of the wheel itself competing with the whine
of the saws and the clatter of the loading ramp.
The Menhemes family leaves the day-to-day
administration of the mill to a heavily scarred half-orc
foreman named Klorte Hengus. In his youth, Klorte
made a name for himself in Absalom’s gladiatorial
arena, the Irorium, by ﬁghting with paired hatchets
and picked up the moniker “the Lumberjacker.” Klorte
has put that violent past behind him and fails to see
any ironic humor in the fact that he’s now employed
by honest-to-goodness lumberjacks.

Income using Survival by patrolling the ﬂume’s length. If
you choose, encounters with local wildlife might liven up
a shift of ﬂume-walking. If Klorte warms to the heroes,
he might even gift them one of his old +1 hatchets.
2. LOADING FLUME
A mechanized treadmill runs from Otari Mill into
a wooden ﬂume ﬁlled with water from the Osprey
River. The treadmill and chute transport timber from
the Giant’s Wheel hundreds of feet south to a loading
chute, which itself descends to the harbor so the timber
can easily be loaded onto ships. The loading ﬂume has
long been a draw to local youths who enjoy “riding
the chute,” but after a few unfortunate accidents,
Klorte keeps a wary eye out for such foolishness.
3. MENHEMES MANOR
Mayor Oseph Menhemes lives in the family estate with
his wife Emnala, their ﬁve children, and a small army
of servants. One of the town’s oldest structures, the
cross-shaped building is a sprawling affair that’s larger
than the Menhemes clan needs. The entire west wing of
the manor has been closed for two generations, while
the eastern wing has been converted into a publicly
accessible museum of Otari’s history.
Oseph does his best to keep his roles as businessman
and politician separate, devoting the mornings to work
as a public ﬁgure and the afternoons to managing his
company, Otari Lumber. The heroes are likely to have
much more interaction with the Menhemes family,
particularly Oseph’s oldest daughter, Dorianna, in
Chapter 5.

4. WRIN’S WONDERS
This curio shop bears no sign, but locals know it as
Wrin’s Wonders: a place to marvel at whatever strange
new trinkets and offerings its equally strange owner
might have come across. The structure consists of a
ring of what appear to be standing stones arranged in
a 60-foot-diameter circle surrounding a 15-foot-high
dome of wooden beams covered with triangular pieces
of canvas. Closer inspection of the standing “stones”
reveals that they’re also made of wood frames and
canvas, cleverly painted to resemble granite. The area
THE ROSEGUARD
An adventuring party who made their name in
Absalom, the Roseguard defeated the villainous
Belcorra Haruvex and founded what’s now the
logging town of Otari. Today, the people of Otari
honor them on founders’ day, 3 Desnus. The
Roseguard consisted of the following heroes.
Aesephna Menhemes: Aesephna was the party’s
healer. She was a cleric of Erastil who was always
more comfortable in smaller towns than big cities.
Otari Ilvashti: Otari, the group’s rogue, was an
optimist who kept the others hopeful with his charm
and humor, even during their darkest hours.
Vol Rajani: Vol was the party’s ﬁghter, a capable
and no-nonsense swordswoman who claimed to be
exiled royalty from Nidal.
Zarmavdian: The group’s wizard was a well-educated
diviner who pursued outlandish conspiracy theories
and occult lore.

Wrin Sivinxi has what she regards
as a very good reason for the curio

of claustrophobia. The central dome

A three-story stone tower rises from the back half of

indeed a wizard, Morlibint had the sign commissioned
in an attempt to portray the power of imagination
within the fanciful ﬁction works and anthologies
that are his specialty. Morlibint sells other texts as
well, although he leaves the nonﬁction curation to his

8. OTARI GARRISON
This squat stone building houses Otari’s civic guards,
who keep the peace and patrol the Roseguard Road,
which leads off toward Absalom, to ensure it stays
clear of banditry and trouble. Clad in distinctive green
and white uniforms, the Otari Guard also serve as
ﬁreﬁghters and barristers, switching predominantly
to the latter role when they reach the age of 40. The
head of the guard is Captain Longsaddle. This elderly
but hale man was a veteran of Absalom’s city guard
who “retired” to Otari a decade ago. He took up
the mantle of leader after its previous captain, Trusk
Hanely, drowned in an unfortunate misadventure
involving a bit too much raspberry mead and an
ill‑advised boast regarding how long he could hold
his breath. Those among the guard who remember
Trusk do so fondly, for Longsaddle is short-tempered,
foul-mouthed, and much stricter than his dwarven
predecessor. The town’s jail is in the basement of
the building, but its cells are rarely used to hold any
criminals other than petty crooks or drunkards.

a dozen rooms that are free of charge to visiting
farmers, but available for rent to others. The current
guildhead is a business-minded halﬂing woman named
Jala Highstepper who maintains a shrine to Erastil
in the side yard. She isn’t a cleric herself, and hopes
someday to convince a visiting priest of Erastil to settle
in Otari and take up the mantle of representing the
regional farmers, despite the fact that she has done an
admirable job of it herself so far.

pirate ships in the Shackles gave her anything, it was
a fondness for unusual alcohol. Now well into her
twilight years, Magiloy likes tending bar and inventing
new drinks for locals and visitors to enjoy. The two
most popular drinks currently are a spiced pumpkin
rum and a sour blackberry ale. Of last month’s

11. CROOK’S NOOK
Any town with a successful economy
inevitably
generates
its
own
homegrown band of thieves and
scoundrels,
and
Otari
is
no
exception. Crook’s Nook serves
several purposes: it’s a public bridge
over the Osprey River, a tavern
known for serving the best seafood
in town, and a cheap place to
stay for the night. Its attic
serves as the guildhall for
Otari’s thieves’ guild, the
Osprey Club—a function
that’s perhaps the town’s
worst-kept secret, as evidenced by
the ediﬁce’s very name.
The owner of Crook’s Nook is a lanky
woman named Yinyasmera. While she has
never run for mayor, her inﬂuence in town remains
as strong as that of any publicly elected ofﬁcial.
Yinyasmera
keeps
her

operations
from

One part open-air farmer’s market, one part log‑cabin
trading post, the Otari Market is a gathering place
for locals and a one-stop shop for all manner of
general goods. Tended by a dour, humorless man
named Keeleno Lathenar, Otari Market is open every
day from dawn to dusk, with one exception:
Keeleno closes the market down on every
Gozran 5th in honor of his dear departed
wife, Ayla, who was mauled to death 30
years ago. The killer turned out to be
a werewolf druid named Jaul Mezmin,
whom Keeleno believes remains at large
to this day. Keeleno remains bitter and
fearful toward druids, particularly those
who worship at Stone Ring Pond.

The Otari Market won’t support the

otherwise automatically supports heroes who
return Ayla’s necklace to Keeleno along with evidence of
Jaul’s death (see area D14’s Side Quest on page 79). If the
Otari Market supports the heroes, they can stand guard
over the market and Earn Income using Intimidation. At
your discretion, a minor encounter with a cutpurse or
other petty crook might take place during a work shift.
13. OTARI FISHERY
Tamily Tanderveil turned her back on what could’ve
been a lucrative position as a captain among the
Gray Corsairs to retire to a safer job here in Otari—
the loss of a leg during a raid on a pirate ship having
convinced her that serving as a harbor warden would
be a wiser decision for her longevity. The jolly and
irreverent Tamily maintains a growing collection of
peg legs for various occasions that she regularly swaps
out. Every night, from an hour before sundown to
an hour before midnight, Tamily opens the ﬁshery’s
ground ﬂoor to sailors, laborers, and travelers for
games, snacks, and entertainment.

14. RUINS OF THE THIRSTY ALPACA
The Thirsty Alpaca was once the largest tavern
in Otari, but in a recent disaster, excavations by
a small band of overeager kobolds attempting to
expand some of the old Stonescale warrens below
the building caused the structure’s dramatic collapse.
Several employees and a few visitors from out of town
perished in the accident, and the tavern’s owner has
gone missing. Today, the locals avoid the ruins, for
strange lights and eerie sounds there have given the
place a reputation of being haunted. In truth, a few
kobold sappers survived the collapse and are
keeping the townsfolk away from their lair
with spooky tricks.
15. INKLEHOLTZ MANOR
Whistledown Cutters is a successful
lumber company thanks to the
cunning business sense of its owner,
Alymora Inkleholtz. She invested
funds to bolster Otari’s educational
services, a shrewd move that has made
her admired by Otari’s parents. Many
have been pushing Alymora to run
for mayor the next time elections
come along, but for now,
the half-elf is happy raising
her family and building her
business’s legacy.

heroes to Earn Income using Lore associated with one of
the four disciplines that the Inkleholtzes hope to foster
in the local children: literature, mathematics, science,
and history.
16. CHERTEL MANOR
Wrab Chertel is the current patriarch of one of
Otari’s three lumber concerns, Chertel Timber. The
Chertels are struggling with a combination of poor
management, labor disputes in distant lumber camps,
and difﬁculties with ﬁnancing. Wrab suspects the other
companies of meddling in his business and sabotaging
both lumberjack morale and equipment
alike; in truth, the Kortos Consortium is
behind Wrab’s woes. By forcing Chertel
into desperate straits and hasty hiring,
the Kortos Consortium has managed
to place an increasing number of its
own agents in Otari’s lumber industry.
CHERTEL MANOR
MANOR 4
EMPLOYER

keeping an eye on his competition—
the Menhemes and the Inkleholtzes—
as well as his own workers. The heroes
can Earn Income using Perception, but on a
critical failure, word of their spying gets out, and Chertel
no longer oﬀers the job.
17. THE ROWDY ROCKFISH
Despite its name, The Rowdy Rockﬁsh is the quietest
and quaintest of Otari’s taverns. A sign depicting a
rockﬁsh with his ﬁns up in a boxing pose hangs above
the door of this two-story wooden structure, but
within, the calm demeanor of its patrons leads some
to wonder if this might be the one tavern in the Inner
Sea to never host a barroom brawl. The Rockﬁsh’s
current proprietor is a matronly dwarf named Brelda
Venkervale, a stoic but shrewd businesswoman who
took over the bar after her son Lasda, the previous
owner, vanished without a trace. A few locals saw the
red-bearded Lasda walking out of town with a hooded
stranger carrying a lantern. Over a year has passed,
and Brelda suspects that her son is gone for good.
THE STONESCALE WARRENS
When the Stonescale kobolds took over Otari, they
used the buildings above as a sort of camouﬂage,
living in an extensive network of tunnels that
connected many of the buildings below ground.
Today, this network is a complicated tangle of ﬂooded
or collapsed tunnels. Thieves and smugglers from the
Osprey Club use some, while others have become the
dens of monsters. One tunnel leads all the way to
the Abomination Vaults; see area C2 on page 54.

18. DAWNFLOWER LIBRARY
Otari’s largest temple stands at the
town’s westernmost edge, atop an
upraised shelf that juts out far
below the clifftop. The library is
constructed in the Qadiran style
of Sarenite temples, with two
smaller minarets ﬂanking a golden
dome. The building’s position allows it
to catch the rays of the rising sun,
which transforms the dome into
a brilliantly glowing testament to
the sun goddess—at least, on days that
aren’t fogged in or overcast.
A dozen acolytes of various faiths
attend to Dawnﬂower Library. Shrines to
Cayden Cailean, Erastil, and Gozreh can be found in
the western portion of the building, while the primary
shrine to Sarenrae takes up the eastern portion. The
rest of the building contains the stacks. Dawnﬂower
Library has a wide range of books ranging from
ﬁction to history, satire to textbook, and even includes
a sizable collection of (mostly) tasteful erotica. The
current head priestess of the library is a chatty halﬂing
woman named Vandy Banderdash, a devotee of
Sarenrae. Always eager to greet newcomers regardless
of their faith or vocation—with the exception of
thieves, whom she can’t abide—Vandy has a strange
knack for recommending literature tailored to the
tastes of people she only just met.

19. STONE RING POND
Two dozen standing stones, each exactly 12 feet
high, stand sentinel around the shores of this shallow
pond. These stones were raised generations ago by the
church of Gozreh soon after Otari was retaken from
the Stonescale kobolds and have remained a place of
worship for druids, rangers, and naturalists ever
since. The waters of the pond are unusually
reﬂective but, despite whispered rumors,
aren’t magical.
A small cabal of nomadic clerics and
druids faithful to Gozreh include Stone
Ring Pond in their peregrinations,
and there’s always a few temporarily
camping nearby. For the most part,
these travelers have avoided contact
with Otari for 30 years, ever since one
of their number, Jaul Mezmin, soured
their relationship with the town. A
werewolf who had kept his nature from
even the other priests, Jaul lost control
one night and slaughtered a half dozen
locals before he was driven over the
cliffside into the ocean below. His body
was never recovered.
About
ﬁve
years
after
Jaul’s
disappearance, an idealistic gnome druid named
Worliwynn heard of Jaul’s rampage and came to Otari
speciﬁcally to repair the damage the werewolf had done
to the Gozrens’ reputation and guide locals interested
in living in greater harmony with the land. A generation
later, Worliwynn has been largely successful, with the
signiﬁcant exception of still-grieving Keeleno Lathenar.
Worliwynn shares more than grief with Keeleno.
She also suspects that Jaul survived his fall from the
cliff. She patrols the Otari hinterlands nightly, vigilant
for any sign that Jaul might have returned to his old
hunting grounds.

20. OTARI GRAVEYARD
Looming over the western cliffside and crowned by a
grove of scraggly trees that no living person in town
can remember ever having borne living leaves, the
Otari Graveyard is tended by the Dawnﬂower Library
acolytes. A wooden stairway ascends the cliff face
from the library below, but most priests prefer to take
the half-hour walk through town and up the easier
roads to tend the graves.
Cremations and burials at sea have become more
popular in Otari, so burials in the graveyard tend to
be the province of older families who value tradition.
While the graveyard itself is spooky and unsettling,
it doesn’t have any undead problems within its
boundaries—at least, not until the Gauntlight shines
upon it again during Chapter 2!
Otari Backgrounds
The following backgrounds are particularly suitable
to characters in the Abomination Vaults Adventure
Path, although heroes can select any background
they choose and need not conﬁne their selection to
those provided below. People come from all walks
of life to seek their fortunes, after all. Among the
backgrounds presented in the Pathﬁnder Core
Rulebook, the best choices are acolyte, bounty
hunter, farmhand, ﬁeld medic, guard, hunter, martial
disciple, miner, nomad, or scout.
BIBLIOPHILE
BACKGROUND
You love few things more than a good book, and as a result,
Odd Stories is your favorite shop in Otari. The bookseller
Morlibint supplies you with ﬁction, anthologies, and other
delightful reads, and he’s always eager to discuss his latest
ﬁnds with you. You know that imagination is the greatest
magic, but a working knowledge of actual magic helps, too.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Library Lore
skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat.
ELDRITCH ANATOMIST
BACKGROUND
You’re a trained physician who can ably tend wounds of
many kinds. But more than a practitioner, you’re a scholar.
Some cultures shape ﬂesh to extreme degrees, creating
aberrations from humanoid forms. The ﬂeshforges of
distant Nex practice this ﬂeshwarping, as do certain
subterranean societies you hope to one day study—
preferably from a safe and clinical distance.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Fleshwarp
Lore skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Medicine.
FOGFEN TALE-TELLER
BACKGROUND
You know there are monstrous things out in the swamp
known as Fogfen; you’ve seen these things through
the mist, gliding through the murky water and heaving
themselves over sodden bits of land. No one in Otari
believes your tales of swamp monsters from the depths,
even when you embellish the creatures of your stories with
fangs, wings, or tentacles. You’ll just have to prove to them
that there are truly monsters out there, and that they were
wrong to doubt you.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Athletics and the Swamp Lore skill. You
gain the Titan Wrestler skill feat.
MARKET RUNNER
BACKGROUND
Keeleno Lathenar, the proprietor of Otari Market, is a
grim and bitter man. A werewolf named Jaul Mezmin
mauled his wife, Ayla, to death 30 years ago. Keeleno
has never forgotten nor forgiven this attack, and he
believes against all odds that Jaul has evaded justice and
is alive and well. Running errands for Keeleno around
town, you’ve gotten to know him almost as well as
you know Otari. Keeleno’s suspicions have rubbed off
on you a bit, so you keep a wary eye on other people—
particularly around the full moon.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution
or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Otari Lore
skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.
RUIN DELVER
BACKGROUND
You’ve looked through some of the smaller ruins in the
Otari hinterlands but have never quite built up the courage
to check out the creepy lighthouse called Gauntlight.
You’ve heard that these ruins are pretty well picked over,
and mostly collapsed, but you always planned to some day
explore them and perhaps ﬁnd some bauble left behind
from the centuries-old battle where the Roseguard slew
an evil sorcerer. You know that the crumbled stone of old
ruins has a tendency to shift, so you’d better step lightly if
you get the chance to explore Gauntlight.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Acrobatics and the Roseguard Lore
skill. You gain the Cat Fall skill feat.
STARWATCHER
BACKGROUND
You’re one of Wrin Sivinxi’s closest conﬁdantes. You’ve
spent many long nights with her under the stars, learning
the tales associated with the Cosmic Caravan and how the
heavens can predict the future. You know that Wrin has
paralyzing claustrophobia; she sees menace in angles and

danger in conﬁned spaces, which is why her shop is an all
domed canvas that opens to the sky. If Wrin thinks there’s
trouble, you’ll be the ﬁrst to oﬀer to help.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution
or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Astrology
Lore skill. You gain the Dubious Knowledge skill feat.
WITCHLIGHT FOLLOWER
BACKGROUND
While in a dismal forest or remote swamp, you caught
sight of a string of lights bobbing through the trees.
You stepped forward for a closer look, and then still
further when the lights retreated a few paces. Then you
remembered the rumors. Will-o’-wisps, rushlights, corpse
lanterns—whatever they’re called—such evil creatures
lead people to their doom. With a supreme eﬀort of
will, you broke free from the alluring enchantment, and
you’ve resolved to never let the strange lights of remote
wildernesses claim you again.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or
Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in Survival and the Wisp Lore skill. You
gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat with both swamp
terrain and subterranean bodies of water.
Wrin Sivinxi
Wrin Sivinxi grew up in the small village of Glitterbough
in Kyonin, but a traveler wouldn’t ﬁnd her hometown
if they were to visit that nation today, for Glitterbough
was destroyed 10 years ago by demons in the service
of Treerazer. Despite the loss of her hometown, Wrin
feels no sadness or despair about the event, for none
perished in Glitterbough’s fall. In the days before the
demon army’s attack, Wrin had a vision of the disaster.
She warned her parents and neighbors, and their
trust in her visions gave the town the time it needed
to relocate everyone in the village to safety. When
the demons came, they found Glitterbough deserted,
and when they burned it in frustration, they suffered
greatly from the magical traps the elves had left behind
to greet them.
When she came of age a few years later, Wrin left her
parents and friends, eager to ﬁnd her own place in the
world. As she traveled, she trusted in her visions and
her unusual faith in a pantheon of deities associated
with space and time she refers to as the Cosmic
Caravan, looking to the nightly stars to make decisions
for tomorrow. Her knack for ﬁnding lost things and
gathering strange treasures made establishing her own
curio shop an obvious choice, and it wasn’t by chance
that she decided to set up that shop in Otari—it was
simply the port she’d arrived at when her capacity to
carry her collection ﬁnally outweighed its portability.
She opened her shop, Wrin’s Wonders, four
years ago. In that time, she has become part of the
community, even if many of its citizens regard her
as a good-natured eccentric. Sales of the strange and
bizarre aren’t brisk in the small town, but that’s no
matter to Wrin—she’s patient and has enjoyed her
time in Otari so far. One day, she hopes to make
enough money to fund a trip west, for she has heard
tell of an abandoned observatory in the small town of
Crookcove on Ravounel’s southwestern coast that she
hopes to purchase and transform into a temple devoted
to the Cosmic Caravan. But for the time being, she’s
content to stay in Otari and sleep under the stars.
Wrin’s tieﬂing ancestry is impossible to miss, and
it’s something she long ago decided to embrace. Eyes
devoid of pupils, small ram horns curling around her
elven ears, a thin tail, and ﬁngertips that sparkle with
motes of glittering lights leave no doubt that she’s
touched by supernatural forces. Yet, her quick smile
and welcoming attitude have always helped her to
secure friendships during her travels.
CAMPAIGN USE
Wrin’s primary purpose is to motivate the heroes’
initial explorations and to give them a focal point to
gather around. The Abomination Vaults Adventure
Path assumes that Wrin is a contact the heroes share
in common, so when she notices a strange buildup of
eerie light atop distant Gauntlight, it’s natural for her
to conﬁde her fears in the heroes.
As the campaign progresses, Wrin can help the
heroes in other ways, such as by performing astrology
readings for the heroes to aid them in their explorations.
While she won’t give her store’s wares away for free,
her establishment is the best place to buy and sell the
odd magical treasures heroes tend to ﬁnd and crave.
Wrin can also introduce the heroes to the wonders of
the spirit world—her tutelage unlocks the ghost hunter
archetype (page 230). Despite the claustrophobia she
suffers, if the heroes ﬁnd themselves in over their head
in the Abomination Vaults, you can have Wrin face her
fears to brave the dungeon and mount a rescue. Of
course, you shouldn’t use Wrin in this capacity except
as a last resort to keep the campaign from reaching an
untimely end!

Claustrophobia Wrin becomes overwhelmed when she’s

can’t be used to Hide.
Read the Stars (divination, exploration, prediction, primal)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect Wrin attempts to read
the future in the stars by spending an hour studying the
night sky—she can’t use this ability during the day, on an
overcast night, or when she can’t otherwise study the
stars. Although Wrin usually performs this reading for
an individual person or to answer a pressing question
she has, for the purposes of this campaign she reads
the stars for the party as a whole. She attempts an
Astrology Lore check, using the DC appropriate for the
heroes’ current level (see Table 10–5: DCs by Level, Core
Rulebook 503).
Critical Success The results of Wrin’s astrological
readings have the eﬀects of read omens, and the
heroes gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
for 24 hours.
Success The results of Wrin’s astrological readings have
the eﬀects of augury but can predict results up to 24
hours into the future.
Failure No reading.
Critical Failure Wrin brushes against hostile spiritual
forces and can’t Read the Stars for 1 week.

CHAPTER 1:
A Light in the Fog
When the fog is creeping,
And the moon is low;
When the town is sleeping,
Gauntlight starts to glow!
That’s when she arises
For her midnight lunch.
Naughty kids are prizes
For her teeth to crunch.
But if you obey me,
And obey the rules;
You’re safe from Belcorra;
She just eats the fools!
So warns a popular nursery rhyme among the parents
in the town of Otari, as they often sing the melodious
but unsettling poem to their children at night to
encourage good behavior. As a result, everyone who
grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect,

strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp’s heart.
As they grow older, townsfolk learn what’s more often
accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari
had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago.
For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around
the lighthouse called Gauntlight, but today, common
knowledge holds that the place has become a haven
for pests—no longer a source of active danger or
signiﬁcant treasure after being completely picked over.
Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra’s defeat
after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace
to Otari through sinister rhymes.
Or so the citizens of Otari believe.
While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she
did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn’t limit
her diet to foolish children), the belief that she’s no
longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th
anniversary of the most signiﬁcant event of her life—
her family’s exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites—
Belcorra’s spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight
Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented
only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had
stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her
