CHAPTER 7:
Soul Keepers
Five centuries ago, Belcorra summoned the contract
devil Urevian to administer her Abomination Vaults.
Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further
offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion
of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani,
legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty
from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has,
for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value
to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s
aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul. When the
Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right
to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing
Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even
though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned,
the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The
sorcerer couldn’t fulﬁll her end of the bargain, trapping
Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a
surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse,
he didn’t dare return to Hell without the Rajani soul,
and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul
directly or through his infernal proxies, as Belcorra was
intended to deliver it. Urevian was trapped.
Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement
with her can be fulﬁlled. He plans to train her armies
and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying
has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can
also fulﬁll his contract, lives there.
Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the
ﬂeshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra
placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though
Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them
and has made that discovery his next priority.
Although the devils can use dimension door to
reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need
physical access, which required him to approach
the seugathi Jafaki about allowing them through
the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a
reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past
relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition:
Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally
inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and
improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki
to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and
that the ﬂeshwarper would never sign off on any

troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this
entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.
Urevian sees the heroes as an unexpected opportunity
and a potential solution. If the heroes slaughter their
way through Jafaki and the seugathis, then all the
better for the devil. Urevian has ordered his devils to
keep an eye out for the heroes, to kill all but one or
two, and then bring him the survivors for negotiations.
He plans to convince the remaining heroes to deliver
Carman Rajani to him. Otherwise, he’ll march his
army up through the dungeon and destroy Otari.
Urevian’s devils have had little contact with the
Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, even in less troubled
times. He receives food from the farm level below to
feed his mortal soldiers but cares little for the denizens
there or their machinations. Since Belcorra’s return,
Urevian has seen an increase in
urdefhans,
drow,
and
more
parading through the prison level, and
he has had enough. He recently blocked the stairs
leading down to the lower level with rubble (area G1)
and erected a magical barrier across the large elevator
opening (area G3). Urevian knows that his control
over these barriers probably gives him some leverage
with the heroes, too, which further beneﬁts him. He
needs them to be his hands on the surface.
Prison Features
Ceilings are 20 feet high throughout the prison, which
is illuminated by dim, red light from ﬂickering ﬂames
or glowing diabolic symbols. The doors are all stone
bound in iron, and many are locked. As a side effect
of pervasive, diabolic inﬂuence, all doors ﬂicker brieﬂy
with ﬁre around their edges when opened or closed,
making sneaking in the prison level difﬁcult. A hero
trained in Religion can utter a brief incantation
(which requires no action) when opening a door to
prevent this effect.
The map for this level appears on page 126.
G1. LOWER SHAFT
The spiral staircase bottoms at a circular
chamber’s red stone ﬂoor. Four wide
passages lead away in opposite directions,
three of them ending at a door. The west passage features
the most impressive of these doors, which are ﬁfteen
feet high and inscribed with a blazing pentagram. The
southwest stairway descends from this room and appears
choked with boulders, rubble, and dust.

This chamber provides easy access to the prison’s cell blocks. Most
doors leading from this room are unlocked and open easily, except for
two described in their respective locations: the secret door to area G2 is
both hidden and locked, and the pentagram-inscribed doors to area G10
are magically sealed.
The stairs leading downward connect to area H1, 100 feet below. The
currently impassable stairs take at least a week of labor to clear. This
level’s denizens likely won’t give the heroes this time without harrying
them, so they can’t effectively clear away the rubble while the devils and
other hostile creatures remain. Urevian agrees to clear the way for the
heroes if they negotiate with him, as described in area G10.
An Eye on the Shaft: This room doesn’t have any guards, but the barbazu
drilling the unit of dreshkans in area G3 to the north likely sees anyone
entering it. That barbazu exhorts his soldiers to attack.
G2. LEVEL 7 PORTAL CHAMBER
A hero who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception check spots the secret door
to this room. Pressing a particular stone above the door causes it to rotate
inward, but only an inch or so and just enough to reveal a combination lock
made of metal cylinders. The combination is long lost, but a hero can open
the door with a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Force it Open, or four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks to Pick the Lock. A hero who’s a master
in Thievery recognizes the tumblers as the lock’s most vulnerable part and
can open it with a single successful DC 20 Thievery check.
This room’s ﬂoor gleams under a thin layer of dust. Runes ﬁlled with silver inlay
have been carved into the walls.
This room contains an inert teleportation circle like the ones elsewhere
in the Abomination Vaults (area B17). This teleportation circle must also
be reactivated with the awaken portal ritual.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for activating this portal.
G3. DRILL FIELD
MODERATE 7
This chamber’s well-worn ﬂoor attests to its constant use. The walls angle up to
the ceiling twenty feet overhead. The northern wall has a mine shaft elevator, but
a wall of shimmering orange energy blocks the passage leading into it.
Belcorra welcomed her guests from the Darklands here before leading
them upstairs for entertainment and refreshments. The chamber’s opulence
has diminished over time. Centuries of military drills, sparring, and other
abuses have damaged the walls, which are splattered in blood and ichor.
Urevian pulled in favors from infernal contacts to create a permanent,
glowing wall of force that blocks the elevator’s shaft and sheds dim light
throughout the chamber. He has no personal control over the wall; it’s tied
to the essence of Urevian’s contract. It disappears immediately only when
Urevian’s contract with Belcorra is fulﬁlled, or if he’s slain. Details about
concluding the deal are presented in area G10. The elevator descends 100
feet to area H17; its function is described there, as its in the lower position.
Creatures: Jafaki doesn’t pay much attention to the many grothluts
whom the devils defeated, assuming that the devils slew them all. In truth,
Urevian’s forces have trained the grothluts to ﬁght on their side against
CHAPTER 7 SYNOPSIS
Long ago, Belcorra handed over the
prison level to the contract devil
Urevian and his infernal minions.
They now prepare diligently to
invade the surface, and the level is
on reasonably high alert. The heroes
must ﬁght their way through many
devils and ﬂeshwarp minions. They
might ﬁnd some surprising allies,
including an imprisoned bounty
hunter and an imp named Szek
who’s eager to make a deal. Here,
the heroes can also put an end to
the malevolent creature tormenting
Dorianna Menhemes. When the
heroes ﬁnally meet Urevian, he
extends an oﬀer wrapped in a
diﬃcult moral choice.
Environmental Cues: stench of
brimstone, eerie silence, ﬂickering
ﬂames, smoke, cell doors, infernal
runes carved on surfaces (Urevian
has been spying on Carman Rajani
and thus knows a little about the
heroes. You can play up the ominous
atmosphere by having some of the
heroes’ opponents call them by
their names or predict their general
tactics—particularly anything they’ve
used or discussed around Carman.)
CHAPTER 7 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable
items available as treasure in
Chapter 7 are as follows.
•	 +1 ﬂaming striking hellforged
glaive (page 122)
•	 +1 striking composite longbow
•	 +1 striking kukri

their creators. As grothluts are mindless creatures,
training them is an exceptionally slow process, but the
devils have had a lot of time on their hands.
A barbazu is currently drilling six grothluts here. He
uses his magical bracers to encourage compliance, and
the grothluts follow his orders. The devil is immune to
the grothluts’ piteous moaning. These troops attack as
soon as they see intruders, which likely occurs when
the heroes arrive in area G1.

G4. STORAGE CELLS
LOW 7
These rooms stem oﬀ a long hall and obviously functioned
as prison cells, but the doors stand open. The cells contain
stacks of crates, barrels, and quivers full of arrows.
These former prison cells hold barrels of pitch, jugs
of lantern oil, fuse cord, ﬂint and steel, and hundreds of
arrows—sufﬁcient supplies to destroy a small village.
Only one cell door is locked—the isolation cell to the
west (area G4a). The zebub in this hall holds the key;
the door can also be opened by a hero who succeeds at
three DC 20 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock or a DC
25 Athletics check to Force it Open.
Creatures: A zebub named Azvalvigander is
responsible for itemizing this equipment, which
Urevian intends to use against Otari. The fussy zebub
has checked the inventory twice over, doing so again to
ensure she didn’t make any mistakes. Four dreshkans
help her with brute labor and defense.

potions, and 10 moderate alchemist’s ﬁres.
G5. HELLFORGE
MODERATE 7
This chamber’s walls are charred black. Chains hang from
the twenty-foot-tall ceiling, suspending shelves holding tools
and metal ingots. A forge ﬁlls an alcove in the north wall;
its mouth yawns open, ﬁlled with jagged teeth like those of
a great beast, and a blazing ﬁre roars inside. Between the
beast-forge’s horns, a hole in the ceiling captures the smoke
belching from its nostrils. An anvil rests near the forge. The
west wall has a trough of sooty water pushed up against it,
and weapon racks ﬂank the double door on the south wall.
This room once served as a torture chamber, but
Urevian repurposed it for a more efﬁcient use: creating
weapons for his inevitable assault on the surface.
The tiny ventilation shaft extends upwards hundreds
of feet before ending in a large, empty chamber in the
earth, where smoke is trapped until it settles.
Creatures: Urevian assigned forge duty to an erinys
named Barcumbuk, a skilled smith who bristles at
having to produce mundane weapons. He derives
more pride from the laborious and lengthy process of

creating hellforged weapons, so his overall productivity
over the centuries has been relatively modest.
The devils realize that the heroes must have
defeated Azvalvigander and her bodyguards to get
here, and they’re openly appreciative of the exacting
zebub’s demise. They still attack the heroes, however.
Barcumbuk ﬁghts with his ﬁery forge hammers; he has
the ﬂames of fury ability common to erinyes, so any
weapon he holds gains the effects of the ﬂaming rune
while he holds it. The barbazu uses a magical hellforged
glaive (making its damage considerably greater than
that of a typical barbazu). The devils ﬁght to the death.

The Hellforge: The heroes lack the skills to use
the evil hellforge as anything but an ordinary
forge, but they can certainly destroy it. A hero
who succeeds at a DC 22 Crafting or Religion
check to Recall Knowledge remembers that even
a small amount of holy water splattered on
an infernal forge can destroy it (on a critical
success, the hero also remembers that doing
so releases a blast of energy). If the heroes
splatter the hellforge with holy water, it
cracks down the middle with a mighty
groan. It deals 4d6 sonic damage and 4d6
evil damage (DC 23 basic Fortitude save) to creatures
in the room.
Treasure: Special metals Barcumbuk hasn’t gotten
around to forging are stacked neatly near the anvil: ﬁve
cold iron chunks (10 gp each), two silver chunks (10 gp
each), and an adamantine chunk (500 gp).
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for destroying
the hellforge.

The guardian here made these carvings to pass the
time. Each carving represents a nonsense metaphysical
question in Infernal, such as “Who are you if you are
no one?” and “When your soul is consumed, do you
consume yourself?” The creature likes to pose these
types of questions during their interrogations to make
victims puzzle over them in search of deeper meanings
and feel foolish upon failing to ﬁnd any.
Creature: A bone devil named Iyagian stands watch
here at Urevian’s command. Unhappy with serving as a
mere guard, yet bound by the contractual terms of their
service, Iyagian treats their charge very literally. They
never warn the erinyes in the summoning chamber of
any trouble and don’t leave this room no matter what
they hear elsewhere unless they’re personally under
attack. If given the chance to talk, Iyagian freely explains
their role and offers some of their nonsense meditations.
The devil uses the time the heroes spend contemplating
to ask questions using their Stygian Inquisitor ability.
Iyagian quickly loses patience, however, and insists the
heroes must leave or risk their wrath. If combat begins,
the bone devil ﬁghts to the death.

G7. SUMMONING CHAMBER
SEVERE 7
A stairway at the room’s south end leads north to a platform
overlooking a cylindrical chamber. Half-melted candles cover
a stone altar perched on this platform’s edge. Above the
altar, water slowly drips from a crack in the ceiling and onto
the platform, the droplets rapidly evaporating in the stiﬂing
heat. Six heavy chains suspend a wide metal disk above a
magma pool that illuminates the chamber with an orange
glow. A ﬁery pentagram features visibly atop the disk.
Belcorra had geomancers divert a natural magma
ﬂow to pool here. She then commissioned the creation
of the ritual altar and the summoning circle atop
the disk. Belcorra summoned several ﬁends in this
chamber, binding each to her service. The greatest of
these was Urevian, as her contract with him gave her
access to all the devils who serve Urevian as well.
The ceiling is 20 feet tall at the doors of this room.
As the stairs descend to the platform, the ceiling stays
the same height, so it’s 25 feet above the platform. The
disk is at the same level as the platform, but the 15-foot
gap over magma makes it daunting to reach.
The air in this chamber is magically cooled to only
severe heat (Core Rulebook 518), dealing 1d6 ﬁre
damage every hour. The 10-foot-deep magma pool
presents a greater danger; immersion in the magma
deals 20d6 ﬁre damage each round. A hero who
succeeds at a DC 23 Crafting or Religion check realizes
that the magma’s heat powers the summoning circle.
The Cracked Ceiling: A character who succeeds at
a DC 23 Nature check (or a related Lore skill, such as
Mining Lore) recognizes that the crack in the ceiling
allows water to drip down from the underground
lake directly above (area F4). If the heroes widen this
crack—a task requiring appropriate tools, the ability to
reach the ceiling, and several hours of chipping away
the stone—the drips become a trickle, then a ﬂood. The
rush of water ﬁlls the room with steam and cools the
magma to stone over a few hours. The hero also knows
that cooling the magma destroys the summoning circle.
Creatures: Twin erinys sisters are trying to convert
the summoning circle into a permanent gate to Hell.
Concerned more with the theory of extraplanar portals
than the application, the sisters spend a lot of time
discussing their work but haven’t done much to enact
it. Furious at interruptions to their discourse, they most
likely attack intruders. However, if they think a hero
shares their interests (such as if they see a hero summon
a creature in a ﬁght), they offer to cease combat to
discuss the ﬁner points of extraplanar lore. When
they’ve learned all they think they can, the erinyes
attempt to murder the rival scholar.

G8. ISOLATION CHAMBER
SEVERE 7
The door to this cell has a note afﬁxed over a small
sliding grate at eye level. Written by the imp Szek
in Common, Undercommon, and Infernal, the note
reads, “Do not disturb if you value your limbs.”
The walls and ﬂoor of this chamber are covered in short
spikes just long enough to cause discomfort to anyone
standing, sitting, or leaning on them.
Once a chamber to detain particularly headstrong
or troublesome prisoners, this room has seen very little
use until recently.
This isolation chamber no longer has a lock, so
the door closes but doesn’t latch. Anyone moving the
note and sliding the grate aside to look in the cell sees
its gug occupant meditating; if she succeeds at a DC
30 Perception check when the grate slides aside, she
awakens from her meditation.

Creature: Belcorra recently sent a gug named Aulr
to check on Urevian’s progress. Aulr’s unexpected
and unwelcome arrival was one of the intrusions
that convinced Urevian to ﬁnally block access to
the lower levels. Urevian has put off talking to Aulr
because he doesn’t really want to renew or revisit
his deal with Belcorra. Aulr has grown tired of
speaking to Urevian’s underlings and demanded
to have her next conversation with Urevian
himself. If the heroes disturb the gug, she
mistakes them for yet more lackeys and reacts
with sudden and startling violence. She allows
foes who ﬂee to retreat, but she otherwise
ﬁghts to the death.

G9. OBSERVATION ROOM
This tall chamber reaches a height of thirty feet.
Transparent stone makes up the southern wall, which
looks into a vast room ﬁlled with square, transparent
pillars surrounded by a catwalk. A jumble of metal scrap
lies against this transparent wall.
While transparent from this side, the
southern wall appears opaque from the
other side. Strategists could look out over
the stasis chamber to the south to select
creatures to transport with Gauntlight. The
metal scrap used to be a high catwalk, but the gug
in area G8 wrecked it in a fury when Urevian sent
a barbazu to provide a summary report rather than
personally meeting with her.
Creature: An imp named Szek ﬂutters near the
ceiling, holding a small notebook and charcoal pencil.
She records observations about the various prisoners
with recommendations on how to use them in the
upcoming invasion of Otari. Sample entries include
“gibbering mouther—ground manipulation could
disable or destroy bridges, such as the tavern bridge
near river mouth.”
When Szek detects the heroes, she casts invisibility
and attempts to parlay rather than ﬁght.
“Close the door! Close the door! I don’t want to get caught
talking to you—you’ll get us all tortured. So, surface
dwellers, eh? Glad to see you. You’re taking down Urevian,
right? Nasty devil. Bad business keeping him around—
yup, yup, yup. How about we leave each other alone and
pretend we never saw each other?”
Although perfectly happy if the heroes leave, Szek
will speak to them if broached. Her starting attitude
is indifferent, and she remains invisible until the
heroes change her attitude to friendly, which requires
a character to succeed at a DC 17 Diplomacy check to
Make an Impression (as that’s Szek’s Will DC).
Szek tires of running menial errands for Urevian.
She’s looking for someone more pliable to serve
and hopes to enter into a devil’s luck infernal
contract (page 218) with someone. If
the heroes improve her attitude, she not
only offers this contract, but answers
questions as best she can (whether or
not they take the contract).

What Szek Knows: Szek knows that Urevian has
some sort of arrangement with Belcorra, but he wants
to get out of it, even if it means making a deal to
undercut Belcorra’s efforts. She suggests talking to
Urevian to ﬁnd out more, but she knows they’ll need
the ﬁve parts of a pentagram amulet to open the door
to area G10.
If asked about the pieces’ locations, she speculates
that the fragments could be held by the sarglagon sent to
sabotage the laboratories level (area F5), Azvalvigander
the quartermaster (area G4), Barcumbuk the smith
(area G5), Iyagian the guard (area G6; they don’t have
one), the gate-forgers (area G7), or the strange Motley
Man who Szek sees sometimes but who terriﬁes her
(she refers to Ysondkhelir in area G18).
Szek knows that Urevian got tired of visitors from
the lower levels and blocked one route with magic
and the other route by simply stufﬁng it full of rubble.
She’s certain he could open either easily.
If asked about the higher levels, Szek gleefully admits
to participating in a “big ﬁght” between Urevian and
“the worm-monsters” a long time ago. She locked a
powerful wizard in his room with just a few pitons
and still takes pride in the act. The wizard—Chafkhem
in area E17—would be keen to learn that Szek is the
one who imprisoned him.
As far as the prison level’s layout, Szek has limited
information. She knows only about areas G1 through
G16, although she’s aware of an angry green spirit in
area G17. She has a rough idea of each room’s forces,
but she doesn’t know about the traps in areas G11 or
G16; in fact, she believes area G16 is haunted.

The huge doors to this room are magically sealed and
emblazoned with an enormous, glowing pentagram,
The pentagram’s center has a circular indentation
about the size of a human hand with ﬁve deeper
indentations. The heroes can discern that some device,
like an amulet, ﬁts into the indentation.
Urevian’s pendant opens the door, but it’s currently
split into ﬁve fragments held by his lieutenants. A devil
who casts dimension door while touching even a single
fragment to the door can teleport to the other side. To
open the door, other creatures must reassemble all ﬁve
fragments and touch the pendant to the indentation.
After doing so, the door effectively stays open for
good; Urevian can enact a year-long ritual to recreate
the door and the pendant, but he likely won’t do so.
Urevian doesn’t realize it, but a clever user can open
the door with only four pendant fragments by touching
them to the door and succeeding at a DC 25 Religion
check to mimic the unholy energies of the missing
fragment. A creature who fails this check takes 4d12
ﬁre damage and is stupeﬁed 1 for 1 hour (8d12 ﬁre
damage and stupeﬁed 3 for 1 hour on a critical failure).
The ﬁve pieces are in areas F5, G4, G5, G7, and G18.
A large chamber of natural stone runs north to south with
an enormous stone double door as its only exit. Lit braziers
cast strange shadows on the walls and bathe the room in a
sinister light. Bookshelves and a sturdy desk, accompanied
by neatly rolled-up scrolls and stacks of parchment, ﬁll an
alcove to the north.
Urevian made this room his home, sealed off from the
rest of the dungeon so that he can work in peace. He
fashioned the door for himself, but he had to manufacture
a magical pendant for Belcorra so she could bypass it.
Shortly before Belcorra’s death, Urevian had the imp Szek
steal the pendant back. Urevian broke it into ﬁve pieces,
giving one to each of his lieutenants. His trusted devils
can come and go as they please, but even they know not
to bother Urevian barring ofﬁcial business.
The desk contains reports, inventories, and maps
that depict the surface world, Gauntlight, and the
surrounding Darklands. Of particular note to the
heroes are complete maps of the ﬁfth, sixth, and
seventh levels of the Abomination Vaults, including all
secret doors on those levels. The characters can also
ﬁnd copies of several infernal contracts, the originals of
which are safely stored in Hell’s vaults. A character who
Investigates the desk and succeeds at a DC 23 Society or
Legal Lore check realizes that Urevian has kept tabs on
Vol Rajani’s line for generations.
Creatures: The phistophilus Urevian spends most
of his time revising attack plans based on numerous
contingencies. He keeps two barbazu bodyguards
nearby at all times to intercept reports from his
lieutenants and to keep him from being disturbed.
When the heroes open the doors, the barbazus spring
forward, but Urevian stops them and warmly greets
the heroes. Read or paraphrase the following.
As a ruggedly handsome devil steps forward, as the long
rolls of parchment hanging from his horns curl up, then
unroll again. “Friends, friends! Weapons away. Truly, I am
happy to see you.” The devil turns to the two bearded devil
bodyguards, their glaives raised. “Stand down, you two. I
doubt they are arrogant enough to ﬁght us.
“I am Urevian, phistophilus and contracted agent of
Belcorra, but I assure you I am no enemy of yours. You seek

to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the
threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then
perhaps we can broker a deal—one that greatly beneﬁts
both of us with a minimal number of precious lives lost.”
If the heroes already encountered Szek and made
an agreement with her—which Urevian doesn’t really
mind—he adds, “You already struck a bargain with Szek,
so I know it is not a matter of if, but of what price.
Trust me when I say, I am offering you an excellent
deal.” For this conversation, refer to the following list
of likely questions and Urevian’s responses.
Who are you? “I am Urevian, a contract devil of
some renown, if I do say so myself.”
What do you want from us? “Simply put, you
are the third-party agents I need to get out of this
dreadful place and return home. You see, there
is something I want but am not allowed to go
and get myself, nor can I employ any infernal
agents to retrieve it. No, the hands of a mortal
foe of Belcorra must deliver me my prize. My
devils are valueless in this regard, as are my
ﬂeshwarp soldiers.”
Why does it have to be a mortal foe of
Belcorra? “That is the delight of legalistic
contract interpretation. It cannot be me,
any of my minions, or any ally of Belcorra.
The contract was written with the intent
that Belcorra alone could give me the prize
as my payment. Which, of course, she
will not until I have given her the full
measure of service the contract requires.
However, a very technical reading
means any of her foes can also provide
it—and you have thus far conclusively
demonstrated that you oppose her.”
What is it that you want? “I require
the soul of Carman Rajani. In his living
body, if possible, though I can make do
should he... perish.”
What do you want with Carman’s soul? “I
owe the soul of a Rajani to someone much
more powerful than myself. It would be...
unwise for me to leave the Material Plane
without it. Carman is the last descendant
of Vol Rajani.”
What will this powerful someone do
with Carman’s soul? “I do not know;
my contract merely stipulated to
turn it over. Just arranging the deal
proved considerably costly, but I
stand to gain quite a bit of prestige in
Hell if it is completed.”
What do we do if he died? “I know a ritual that can
summon his spirit out of the River of Souls and back
to the place where he died. There it can be captured. If
you sign an agreement with me, I shall teach it to you.”
We can’t give you someone’s soul. That’s evil! “Is
it? I say it is a lesser evil to turn over the soul of
one corrupted individual than to allow an entire
town’s destruction. Far less bloodshed on all

sides. I do not want to raze Otari, and I don’t want to
kill you. However, the contract I have with Belcorra
requires that as long as I remain within her employ, I
must pursue the domination of the surface world and
the destruction of her enemies. Once my contract ends,
so does my obligation to her. All I need is the soul of
Carman Rajani to fulﬁll the contract.”
How’s Carman Rajani corrupted? “Oh, that
bastard of a man. His soul is already damned for lying,
cheating, theft, vandalism, destruction of property,
arson, abuse of power, blackmail—even a murder. It
is quite clear where he shall go in the afterlife. You
would simply cut out the bureaucracy by giving him
to me directly.”
If we hand over Carman, he’ll never have a chance
at redemption. “Do you honestly believe that? Just
recently he burned a library and stole a historical
relic in some misguided ploy to win a political ofﬁce,
which he would just use to further abuse his power
and increase his wealth. If I did not need his soul for
this speciﬁc purpose, I would hire him.”
What do we get out of this arrangement? “Peace for
Otari. I will leave, taking all of my devils with me. And
when I go, the barrier preventing you from getting to
the lower level will disappear. If you would like, I can
direct my ﬂeshwarp minions to clear away the blocked
staircase, giving you a second way down. I can even
broker further agreements between you my devils.”
What further agreements? Urevian can arrange for
infernal contracts (page 218) with any of his surviving
barbazus (pact of blood-taking) or erinyes (right of
retribution). As Urevian drafts these agreements on
his devils’ behalf, skill checks to interpret the contracts
use a DC of 33 (Urevian’s Legal Lore DC), rather than
the contracts’ item levels.
We’ve already defeated your devils; you have nothing
to invade with. “Ah, but I can conscript more after I
kill you. The inconvenience is, at best, temporary.”
We’ll never make an agreement with you! “Are you
sure about that? Consider carefully. Turning down my
offer most likely means your death.” Urevian gestures
meaningfully to his barbazu bodyguards.
If the heroes take Urevian’s offer, he uses his Draft
Contract ability to summon a contract for them to sign in
blood. Urevian drafts an honest offer: upon his receipt of
Carman Rajani (or his soul) from the heroes, he will leave
the Material Plane along with all his devils remaining
in the Abomination Vaults. His departure immediately
removes the barrier in area G3. Before leaving, he will, if
the heroes wish, order any ﬂeshwarps to clear the staircase
leading down from area G1. His departure otherwise
doesn’t affect the ﬂeshwarps or other creatures in the
prison, leaving the heroes to deal with them. Heroes who
sign are compelled to work toward delivering Carman to
Urevian, as from a geas ritual (Core Rulebook 412).
If the heroes ultimately decline Urevian’s offer, he
sighs in disappointment before saying, “What more
should I have expected from mortals?” He then orders
his barbazus to attack. He casts ﬂame strike before
entering melee with his diabolic quill.
Convinced the heroes are mere mortals who can’t
overcome diabolic soldiers in combat, the barbazus ﬁght
to the death. The more injured Urevian becomes, the
more he tries to convince the heroes to accept his deal.
However, Urevian breaks off combat only if the heroes
agree to accept his terms. If he’s slain, the magical barrier
in area G3 vanishes, though the stairs remain blocked.
ASKING ADVICE
Your players might not spent a lot of time heavily
considering the moral question of whether to turn
over Carman Rajani over to Urevian. But perhaps
they thoughtfully debate the issue or even seek other
opinions. NPCs in Otari are split on the matter.
Vandy Banderdash thinks it’s wrong to bargain
with a devil using another person’s soul. She believes
that everyone deserves a chance at redemption, even
Carman. However, she holds a particular contempt
for thieves, as she never really recovered from the
betrayal of her sister stealing from her years ago. She
doesn’t push the heroes if they disagree with her.
Wrin Sivinxi also opposes the deal since she ﬁnds
limiting a soul’s freedom to be abhorrent.
Captain Longsaddle happily releases Carman to
the heroes so they can turn him over to the devil.
He considers this choice a straightforward way to
eliminate a serious threat to his town.
For once, Yinyasmera agrees with the guard
captain. She’s had so many past problems with
Carman that she’d also like to see him gone, especially
knowing that doing so would save the town.
Mayor Oseph Menhemes doesn’t take a position but
backs whatever choice the heroes make, especially
if they’ve been helping his daughter. The mayor
believes that the heroes are capable and trustworthy
decision-makers. If his opinion serves as a tie-breaker,
he leans toward showing Carman mercy.
Morlibint doesn’t oﬀer a direct opinion but
recommends several stories about dealing with devils
(virtually all of which turn out very poorly for the
mortals involved).

Draft Contract ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine, manipulate)
Urevian produces an infernal contract for a single
living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of
abilities and eﬀects, akin to the power of a wish spell but
fulﬁlled to the letter by Urevian. To receive any of those
beneﬁts, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to
the contract. At that point, the mortal’s soul is bound to
Urevian and to Hell.
While the contract is in eﬀect, the mortal can’t be re-
stored to life except by wish or similar magic. If the mortal
is restored to life by those means, Urevian knows which
mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures
who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the eﬀects
of a locate spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of
an infernal contract is diﬃcult and often dangerous.
Infernal Wound (divine, necromancy) Urevian’s Strikes also
deal 2d6 persistent bleed damage that resists attempts
to heal them. The ﬂat check to stop the bleeding starts
at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding
creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery.
The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an
infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item
using healing magic on a creature suﬀering from an in-
fernal wound must succeed at a DC 28 counteract check
or the magic fails to heal the creature.
Right of Inspection Urevian can cast his innate scrying
spell at will, but only to target a creature with which he
has a contract, a speciﬁc creature named in a contract
he has, or a descendant of any of those creatures. The
outcome of the target’s saving throw is one step worse
than the result it rolled.

RECOVERING CARMAN
How easily the heroes can recover Carman depends on
his fate in Chapter 5. If they released him, the heroes
likely ﬁnd him still brooding in Smuggler’s Refuge, as he
hasn’t yet summoned the courage to depart. He certainly
won’t go with the heroes willingly if they explain what
they want with him, but the heroes could trick him. If
Carman knows what he’s in for, he does his best to ﬂee
the area, and the heroes probably have to work with
Urevian to scry his new location—which the contract
devil certainly makes them pay for, one way or another.
If Carman is in jail, the heroes can simply fetch him
from custody. Longsaddle doesn’t mind turning him
over to the heroes, as they captured him in the ﬁrst
place. If they’re up-front about why they want Carman,
he’s surprisingly agreeable to turning the scoundrel over
to the devil (see the sidebar on page 136).
If Carman is dead, the heroes must go to the place
of his death to trap his spirit. Urevian explains that
the heroes must perform the call spirit ritual (which
he can teach them) while holding a specially-prepared
gemstone (that he also provides). The heroes are
responsible for performing the ritual and paying its
cost. If they call Carman’s spirit, it’s automatically
drawn into the gemstone.
Delivery: If the heroes bring Carman Rajani to
Urevian alive or give him a soul gem with Carman’s
soul inside, Urevian ﬂicks a hand toward his desk.
All the contents magically pack themselves into smaller
and smaller boxes, eventually into a single valise that
one of the barbazus picks up. The other barbazu takes

Carman (or the gem) in a ﬁrm grip, and both barbazus
disappear. “It was a pleasure doing business with you,”
says Urevian, “I will look you up again, perhaps in
a few years or decades. And if you have died in that
time... well, I can come ﬁnd you anyway. You are so
delightfully useful. I shall be in touch.”
XP Award: Award the heroes 120 XP if they make a
deal with Urevian and get the devil to depart.
G11. NEXUS
LOW 7
This chamber forms a large octagonal pyramid and has four
exits on opposite walls. Bright, blood-red light shines down
from the top of the pyramid in a perfect circle on the ﬂoor.
Hazard: Urevian constructed a magical trap here to
capture invaders and summon reinforcements.
PARALYZING LIGHT TRAP
HAZARD 8
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC +18 (expert)
Description When any creature other than a devil enters
the light, the magic interwoven in the light holds the
creature in place and rings an alarm.
Disable DC 26 Thievery (master) to distort or diﬀuse
the light, keeping the light cone intact but preventing
the trap from triggering, or dispel magic (4th level;
counteract DC 26) to dispel the light, leaving the room
in darkness
Stasis Field Ǻȓ (enchantment, incapacitation, mental,
occult) Trigger A non-devil creature moves into the light;
Eﬀect The light expands to ﬁll the room, and each non-
devil creature within the room must attempt a DC 26
Will save. A high-pitched chime sounds in the barracks
(area G15), audible in this room as well. The trap then
rolls initiative.
Critical Success The target is unaﬀected.
Success The target is stunned 2.
Failure The target is paralyzed for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target is stupeﬁed 2 for 1d4 rounds
and paralyzed for 1 round.
Routine (1 action) All stunned and paralyzed creatures in
the room take 1d10 mental damage (DC 26 basic Will
save). Creatures who fail also become paralyzed for 1
round but can use a reaction to mentally ﬁght oﬀ this
stasis; creatures who do so take 5d10 mental damage
but are no longer paralyzed.
Reset The stasis magic in the light builds up over the
course of an hour, after which the trap can trigger again.
Reinforcements: When the alarm goes off in
area G15, half of the enemies in the barracks (one
mulventok and one dreshkan) make their way here
immediately. If they don’t come back in 3 rounds, the
other two ﬂeshwarps in area G15 realize something
must be wrong and come to provide help as well.
G12. ARENA WALK
LOW 7
A long hallway, stretching north to south, ends in a
staircase at the southern end that branches left and right.
The north and east walls each have a door with small,
sliding windows. A raised portcullis at the northeastern
end here has metal points crusted with dried blood.
Not all combatants in Belcorra’s arena participated
willingly. Prisoners intended for the gladiatorial games
were kept here brieﬂy before being sent upstairs to
meet their fates. The sliding windows allow the heroes
to peek into the cells.
The stairs lead up to area F10.
Creatures: Two will-o’-wisps patrol this corridor,
killing whatever unfriendly creatures they ﬁnd. They
spontaneously appeared in the Abomination Vaults
decades ago and drifted to this level. When the devils
assumed they served Belcorra, the wisps simply agreed,
even though they’ve never met her. Urevian assigned
the creatures to keep watch here. They also suggested
subjecting the ﬂeshwarp in area F10 to the slow curse,
as it lets them sup on the creature’s fear as often as
they’d like.
The will-o’-wisps ﬁght intruders tenaciously to
maintain their favored position. If one is destroyed,
the other attempts to ﬂee to area G15 and warn the
creatures there.

CREATURE 6

G13. EMPTY CELL
Dust and cobwebs cover this forgotten cell. The heroes
ﬁnd its door unlocked. Since the devils never check it,
this cell makes for a safe, if cramped place to rest.
G14. IMPRISONED BOUNTY HUNTER
Most of this cell has received very little care in the past
several decades, but the manacles on the wall appear
carefully polished.
The devils have recently put this cell back into
service. A tieﬂing bounty hunter named Cynemi
hangs upside down, her ankles bound by the
manacles. She looks clearly weakened from ill
treatment and neglect.

Through infernal contracts, Cynemi learned
that a contract devil named Urevian had offered a
high bounty for a speciﬁc target.
Cynemi made her way here and
agreed to retrieve Carman
Rajani for a healthy sum.
However, Carman proved
too
cunning,
hustling
Cynemi out of her magic
armor and leaving her stranded
on a leaky boat on the Inner Sea.
By the time Cynemi swam back
to shore, the time she negotiated
with Urevian to catch Carman
had run out, so an erinys dragged
her back. She has been here since,
fed only irregularly and often
hung by her feet. She suspects
she has spent months or even
years imprisoned. Her manacles
open easily, but Cynemi can’t
reach them. If you need Cynemi’s
stats, use those of a bounty hunter
(Gamemastery
Guide
226),
except
Cynemi is neutral evil and has darkvision.
Side Quest: Cynemi requires urgent care, as she’s
on the verge of death from dehydration. A hero must
succeed at a DC 23 Medicine check while providing
water and food to Cynemi to save her; on a critical
failure, the bounty hunter dies. Even if saved, she stays
distant and suspicious; her starting attitude is unfriendly.
If the heroes can improve Cynemi’s attitude to at least
indifferent (usually, a hero must succeed at a DC 22
Diplomacy check to Make an Impression, although
you might allow other skills at this DC to get Cynemi
to open up), she shares her story. She emphasizes how
urgently Urevian wants to capture Carman Rajani, and
that the contract devil is willing to cut a deal for just
about anything to get him. Regardless of her attitude
toward the heroes, Cynemi wants the heroes to help
free her and to get far away from here.
Cynemi is a criminal wanted by Absalom authorities.
A hero who succeeds at a DC 23 Society check recalls
seeing a wanted poster for her (heroes from Absalom
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check). Of course,
Cynemi doesn’t volunteer this information.
Getting Cynemi out of the Abomination Vaults—
whether or not the heroes place her in their custody—
completes this side quest.
Treasure: If the heroes turn Cynemi over to the Otari
Garrison, they earn a 30 gp reward. If they have the
Otari Garrison’s support, Captain Longsaddle gives
them an additional 30 gp.
G15. BARRACKS
SEVERE 7
This old prison block has been converted into a makeshift
barracks with several shoddy cots pushed into the cells
and against the walls. The three cell doors have been
chained open. Foot lockers sit near each cot.
Creatures: When not drilling with the barbazu
or performing other menial tasks, the devils’
ﬂeshwarped soldiers relax here. They ﬁght to
the death.

G16. PRISON OFFICE
This old prison oﬃce is full of ﬁlth and cobwebs. A single
door exits to the north.
A hero can locate the secret door in this room
by succeeding at a DC 28 Perception check while
Searching. If the heroes clean the dust and cobwebs
from this room ﬁrst, this DC drops to 24. Tiny cracks
form the subtle shape of a manacle and chain on the
wall. The spaces between the chain links are buttons
that, when pressed, cause the secret door to slide open.
Beyond the secret door, a narrow hallway has several
peep holes ﬁlled with one-way transparent stone for
spying on prisoners, along with a door to area G21.
Characters can clearly see the secret doors leading out
of this hidden hall (to areas G16 and G18).
Ysondkhelir didn’t like the fact that a secret tunnel
led directly into his suite of rooms, so he installed a trap
to keep any nosy creatures away. He pressed Urevian
to help with the ruse, so the devil had the erinyes
start a rumor about the prison ofﬁce being haunted.
Virtually all other creatures on the prison level believe
this rumor, especially the ﬂeshwarps who bunk just
outside the room, which has given Ysondkhelir the
peace he desires.
Hazard: The magical trap in this room triggers
when anyone steps inside.

PAINFUL SUGGESTION TRAP
HAZARD 8
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 26 (expert)
Description A hidden rune on the ﬂoor under the ﬁlth, just
past the threshold, triggers an ersatz ghost.
Disable DC 28 Thievery (expert) to remove the rune without
triggering it, or dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC
26) to dispel the rune
Counterfeit Haunting
Ǻȓ
(auditory,
enchantment,
incapacitation, linguistic, mental) Trigger A living
creature moves over the rune; Eﬀect A frightful moan
echoes through the room, and a hoarse telepathic
voice shouts, “Get out!” This shout deals 6d12 mental
damage to creatures in the room (DC 26 basic Will save).
Creatures who fail this saving throw must immediately
leave the room and can’t willingly reenter it for 1 minute
(1 hour on a critical failure).
Reset The trap automatically resets after 1 hour.
G17. STASIS CHAMBERS
MODERATE 7
Fifteen transparent pillars ﬁll the center of this 30-foot-high
room. A bright light shines down into the center of each
chamber. A catwalk 10 feet above the ground circles around
the edge of the room without handrail or banister; at the
western side, each stops at a staircase leading down.
Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior
to teleporting them via Gauntlight’s beam. Each cell is
10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent
stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own
column, held in suspended animation outside the ﬂow
of time. The creatures haven’t aged and ignore any
effect from the normal timestream as long as they stay
imprisoned within their stasis chambers. However,
such effects can work on the pillars, which are made
of transparent, magically enhanced stone (Hardness 18,
HP 76).
Ten pillars are occupied. Nine contain living
creatures: a chuul (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 64), a
drider (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 159), three
ghonhatines (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 2
119), a gibbering mouther (Pathﬁnder
Bestiary 176), a gibtanius (page 239),
and two gugs (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 198).
One contains a dead gogiteth because
of a ﬂaw in its chamber’s magic. If a hero
breaks the pillar around one of the creatures,
roll a DC 3 ﬂat check; on a success, the collapsing
stasis effect messily kills it. On a failure, the
creature returns to normal time and attacks anything
in sight until destroyed. (High-level monsters, such
as the ghonhatines, pose a serious danger even for
7th-level characters!)
Of the ﬁve empty stasis chambers, two are
noteworthy. The northwest chamber appears badly
blackened, as though from soot on the inside. After
the error with the gogiteth, Belcorra appointed a
hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical
expertise would prove invaluable in maintaining the
stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend the hag to do
this job in life. Belcorra trapped the hag in this pillar,
burned her to death, and bound her spirit as a witchﬁre.
A creature entering a square adjacent to this blackened
pillar receives a brief telepathic ﬂash of Belcorra burning

the hag alive and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to
saving throws against the witchﬁre’s spells and abilities
for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to that pillar can also
just make out the objects inside it (see Treasure below).
The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.
The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest,
looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top
and ﬂoor are both illusions. An open area below the
chamber’s “ﬂoor” leads to a 5-foot-wide crawl space to
the open trapdoor in area G21. The wisp in area G21
comes and goes this way while invisible.
Creature: The witchﬁre still guards this room.
Three rounds after anyone enters, she materializes and
attacks. Creatures who must pass through this room
regularly, such as the denizen of Leng Ysondkhelir or
the zebubs who report to him, do so quickly.
Urevian has tried to make deals with the witchﬁre
time and again, but the witchﬁre simply won’t listen
to him. He knows the creatures in stasis are valuable
to his invasion plans, so he has postponed his invasion
until he ﬁgures out how to reliably free them.

Treasure: The soot-blackened pillar still contains a
few items left behind when the hag died: type I bracers
of armor and a type II bag of holding containing a
dozen cheap, broken clocks.
G18. WAR ROOM
MODERATE 7
This small chamber features a large map of the Inner Sea
painted on the north wall, though the listed countries seem
long out of date. A large cushion rests in the room’s southwest
corner. On the west wall, overlapping scraps of paper create a
much newer map of the town of Otari and the area around it.
This chamber has seen little use as a war room and
has been repurposed for its current inhabitant’s personal
agenda, as evidenced by the out-of-date maps on the
north wall, but the much more focused and updated
map of Otari on the west wall.
The paper maps conceal a secret doorway to a hall
that connects to areas G16 and G21. A hero Searching
this room locates the secret door with a successful DC
28 Perception check. If the heroes remove the papers,
this DC drops to 24. This secret door opens the same
way as the one in area G16. The secret doors leading
out of the hidden hallway (to areas G16 and G18) are
obvious from within it.
Creatures: Belcorra appointed the ageless and
mysterious denizen of Leng named Ysondkhelir as
her chief strategist. After Belcorra died, Ysondkhelir
lost interest in planning troop movements, though he
convinced Urevian that he was still doing so and that
he would have plans ready by the time the devil chose
to march on the surface. Ysondkhelir insisted that
Urevian’s zebubs keep scouting the surface and report
back to him, which has allowed the denizen to make
the exceptionally detailed map found here.
Instead of planning troop movements, Ysondkhelir
seeks powerful latent psychics whom he can torment
and, by means of eldritch invocations, send physically
into the Dimension of Dreams so that other denizens
of Leng can make use of them. He has had little
success in the last ﬁve centuries—not only is true
psychic potential very rare, but Ysondkhelir is as likely
to drive his victims to insanity as to successfully send
them to his extraplanar compatriots. He had most
recently manipulated the addled skulk Jedzeli (area
F12). Ysondkhelir abandoned Jedzeli as a lost cause
to prey upon Dorianna Menhemes instead, and his
schemes with her near completion.
Ysondkhelir likes to claim a hand from creatures
he has corrupted. As he hasn’t ever met Dorianna in
person, he instead stole a psychic imprint of her right
hand and manifested it as a massive, gnarled claw.
This giant crawling hand obeys Ysondkhelir loyally
and does its best to defend him.
If the heroes simply barge in, Ysondkhelir and the
hand ﬁght back. The hand tries to keep foes from
reaching Ysondkhelir, who retreats into the doorway
of either adjacent room to keep out of melee range. He
prefers spells that debilitate his foes, such as hypnotic
pattern and phantom pain.
If the heroes come to him with knowledge of
Dorianna, the denizen knows his latest plot has put him
in signiﬁcant jeopardy. He attempts to calm the heroes
and convince them that he’ll release Dorianna from
his clutches—an outright lie—if one of them willingly
accepts his Leng ruby.
If the heroes fall for this ruse, he relocates to another
part of the prison level (which you can determine); he
continues to afﬂict Dorianna and begins tormenting the
hero who took his ruby as well.
If Ysondkhelir is slain, he eventually reforms in
Leng and gives up his Material Plane plots—for now.

A small desk covered in the stubs of burned candles stands
against the east wall. The west wall has severed hands
from more than a dozen creatures nailed to it, each badly
withered and displayed palm outward.
Ysondkhelir
performs
his
research in this room, but it
primarily serves as his gruesome
trophy hall—it bears the hands of
creatures he has corrupted over the
years, including Jedzeli’s. He spends hours
examining them, mesmerized by the intricate
details upon each hand that tell an entire life’s story.
Treasure: The desk drawer contains two scrolls of
dream message.
G20. RITUAL ROOM
A ﬁlthy silk pillow rests at the center of this room,
surrounded by several unlit candles. Several charcoal
depictions drawn directly on the stone walls feature the
same teenage girl. A small wooden box sits in the corner of
the room with a few more candles inside.
Ysondkhelir performs his dream rituals here, using his
magic to invade and twist Dorianna Menhemes’s dreams.
His drawings of her help him to focus on her mind.
Treasure: The box contains several candles
made of rare waxes worth 50 gp in total.
G21. THE SECRET VOID

MODERATE 7
The ﬂat, black walls of this chamber
reﬂect an eerie emptiness. An open
trapdoor against the east wall leads to
a narrow crawl space.
This chamber was built for a high priest of
Nhimbaloth to sleep and meditate in. The only
entrances are concealed and the room’s black
walls simulate the void of oblivion granted to
those consumed by the Empty Death.
Creature: Sacuishu, a will-o’-wisp priest
of Nhimbaloth, occupies this chamber.
She’s a variant form of will-o’-wisp who has gained

extra powers from her devotion to the Empty Death.
Sacuishu was sent from the lower levels to check on the
prison by Lady’s Whisper, a patient and silent servitor
of Nhimbaloth (area I61) While the gug Aulr—who’s
angry, direct, and abrupt like Belcorra—has mostly
failed to get any answers after being sent to the
prison level by the sorcerer, Sacuishu found more
success in her delving. She has learned a great
deal about the inhabitants of the middle and
even upper levels of the Abomination Vaults,
and she rests here between her invisible
excursions. Sacuishu can’t return, as
Urevian blocked the ways down in area
G3, but she thinks it’s just a matter of
time until the way opens again.
Because of her frequent wanderings, you
can have Sacuishu encounter the heroes
nearly anywhere; she attacks to learn
their tactics and abilities but retreats to
this area when reduced to fewer than 40
Hit Points.
While here, Sacuishu ﬂoats, very still,
near the center of the ceiling, washing
the room in a pale glow and basking in the
emptiness. The presence of outsiders in her
secret room offends her; she immediately Goes
Dark and casts darkness before attacking. If any
of the heroes openly carry the tome The Whispering
Reeds, Sacuishu is appalled that the sacred book
has fallen in the hands of a nonbeliever and targets
whomever carries it.
If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Sacuishu casts
sanctuary and retreats to area G3, hoping it has
opened; if it’s blocked, she makes her last stand there.

another use of this action. If she uses her shock attack
while invisible, the arc of electricity lets any observer
determine her location, making Sacuishu hidden to
observers only until she moves.
G22. MAGICAL COMMUNICATOR
A bowl of ﬁlthy swamp water rests upon a crude altar.
Priests once used this scrying bowl to communicate
with Belcorra before it became inactive upon her
death. It regained a fraction of its power now that
she has returned. The ﬁrst creature to look into
its waters sees Belcorra’s hateful visage glaring
back. The creature takes 9d6 mental damage (DC
33 basic Will save). A creature that fails its save
is also stupeﬁed 1 for 1 minute. After this initial
appearance, Belcorra’s image doesn’t reappear, but
she remembers the hero who called upon her in this
way in future encounters.
Treasure: The following items lie next to the bowl: a
gallows tooth, a transparent elemental gem, and a grim
trophy in the form of seven ears impaled on a nail.

CHAPTER 8:
Decaying Gardens
Gauntlight is active, but its true power is yet to be
realized. Belcorra penetrated deep underground to
build Gauntlight’s foundation, following the psychic
pull of the Empty Vault, a place sacred to Nhimbaloth
at the heart of an ancient, subterranean temple.
Gauntlight draws upon the energies of the Empty Vault
as its foundation and the source of its powers. Within
the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum
lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above,
focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s
full power. But the fulcrum lenses are dangerous; they
invite Nhimbaloth’s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra
can’t withstand the scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus,
though they hold great power, the fulcrum lenses are
also Belcorra’s greatest weakness.
Belcorra repurposed the massive natural caverns
above the Empty Vault for her needs. The eighth level
made a lush cavern of fungus growths and freshwater
lakes that teemed with subterranean ﬁsh, while the
ninth level was a wilderness where predators and prey
alike could thrive. Heroes must descend through these
levels to reach the Empty Vault.
Children of Belcorra
Uninterested in administering these vast caverns
herself, Belcorra enthralled deep gnomes already
living there, compelling them with threats and favors
to tend her subterranean farm. She dubbed these loyal,
diminutive gardeners the Children of Belcorra.
The Children of Belcorra disbelieved rumors of
Belcorra’s death as some sort of trick or test and
didn’t waver in their duties. But as the years passed,
more and more feral monsters made their way into
the level and made their mission in the farm more
difﬁcult. Believing that Belcorra (or, perhaps, some
other Haruvex) would return, the Children chose to
become undead to combat their dwindling numbers
and increasing age. They immured each other in
the muddy shores to rise again as bog mummies or
undertook difﬁcult transformations into other, more
powerful, undead.
Eventually, their timeless lives and lack of
direction took their toll. Many Children fell into
a torpor or retreated into obsession or isolation.
The farm they’d carefully tended became infested
