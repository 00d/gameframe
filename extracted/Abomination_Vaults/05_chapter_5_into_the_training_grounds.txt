CHAPTER 5:
Into the Training Grounds
While the upper levels of Belcorra’s massive dungeon
were primarily for her personal use, she designed the
middle levels for work. Belcorra trawled the Darklands
for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations,
but their feral power wasn’t enough for her. She needed
to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis
of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces
forged for battle, in body and in mind. The ﬁfth level
thus included a massive arena and training grounds
where gladiators would ﬁght for the right to lead her
monstrous troops.
In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike
aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious
eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth
level—formerly support rooms for her monsters and
their trainers as well as a “preserve” where she kept
large beasts—as laboratories. There, the seugathis
sought to perfect ﬂeshwarping to create ﬂawless
monsters under the guidance of their leader, Jafaki.
Belcorra constructed the smaller seventh level as a
prison. She didn’t intend to keep many captives, since
creatures who displeased her could serve as raw ﬂesh
for Jafaki’s experiments or as food for her monsters.
However, one of Belcorra’s chief administrators, the
contract devil Urevian, insisted on building the prison.
Before long, the level became a warped mirror of Hell.
A decade into building her dungeon and honing her
preparations, Belcorra died at the hands of the heroic
Roseguard, who had no idea about these subterranean
machinations. The Abomination Vaults fell into
disarray almost immediately. Urevian attempted to
assert control, but Jafaki’s aberrant creations fought the
devil’s forces to a standstill. A sort of stalemate settled
over the middle levels, and the borders of control have
shifted only slightly over the centuries. Jafaki merely
wanted peace to continue their experiments; Urevian
idly prepared for the surface invasion as his contract
required of him, even though he knew it was almost
impossible for him to complete his contract because
Belcorra had died.
Word of the seugathis’ skilled ﬂeshwarping spread.
Before long, arrogant or desperate creatures came
to the Abomination Vaults seeking remarkable
transformations, though few ultimately considered

their changes to be improvements. The people of
Otari have no idea that this trafﬁc exists, because it
comes from the Darklands far below into the
dungeon’s middle levels.
When Belcorra returned as a ghost only
a few years ago, the Abomination Vaults
hummed with the power of her return.
The signiﬁcance of this event was lost on
the research-focused Jafaki, but not on
Urevian; the devil realized he could now
ﬁnally fulﬁll his contract with the sorcerer.
Yet Urevian had already spent centuries
contemplating a well-drafted loophole that
would allow him to simply return to
Hell without providing her any
aid at all. To do so, Urevian
needs a speciﬁc mortal soul:
that of Vol Rajani, one
of the Roseguard. Vol is
long dead, of course, but
the clause can still apply if
Urevian receives the soul of
Vol’s last descendant, Carman Rajani. Urevian
couldn’t collect the soul while Belcorra was merely
dead, but now that she has returned, Urevian is willing
to abandon his extensive preparations if someone can
get Carman’s soul for him—and he selects the dungeon
delvers from Otari to handle this matter on his behalf.
The Spectral Seal
A spectral barrier blocks the only passage from the
fourth level of the Abomination Vaults to the ﬁfth.
As the heroes learned from the ghost of Otari Ilvashti
in area D18, only icons of all four members of the
Roseguard can pierce it.
RETRIEVING THE ICONS
It shouldn’t take the heroes too much asking around
in town to ﬁnd out about the Roseguard’s icons. The
Roseguard founded Otari and consisted of the rogue
Otari Ilvashti, the cleric Aesephna Menhemes, the
wizard Zarmavdian, and the ﬁghter Vol Rajani. The
best place to learn about the Roseguard is Menhemes
Manor, the residence of the town’s mayor and his family
(all descendants of Aesephna Menhemes). The manor’s
eastern wing contains a public museum of the town’s
history. Although this museum contains replicas of the
Roseguard’s adventuring gear and even a few common
items that the adventurers once owned, the speciﬁc icons
Otari Ilvashti’s ghost described to the heroes aren’t here.
Mayor Oseph Menhemes, Vandy Banderdash at the
Dawnﬂower Library, or Wrin Sivinxi at Wrin’s Wonders
can point the heroes in the right direction.
The icons are described on page 217. Aesephna
Menhemes’s hunter’s brooch is in a locked
shadowbox in the music room of Menhemes
Manor. If the heroes honestly and openly
tell Oseph Menhemes why they need it,
he permits them to borrow the brooch
for as long as they’d like. For being
honest with him, they automatically
earn the Menhemes’s support (as
described on page 10), which allows
the heroes to Earn Income by tutoring
the Menhemes children and, more
immediately pertinent, lets them meet
Dorianna Menhemes and aid with
her malady (page 91). If the heroes
previously earned the Menhemes’s
support, Oseph lets them keep the
brooch in exchange for all they’ve
done for him and the town.
The bookseller Morlibint keeps
Zarmavdian’s Thresholds of Truth
in his academic collection at Odd
Stories. If Odd Stories already
supports the heroes, Morlibint gladly allows them to
borrow the book. If not, they must promise Morlibint
that they’ll take special care of the spellbook before he
loans it to them. Convincing Morlibint might require
extensive promises, a demonstration on the proper care
of ancient tomes, or both. Either way, Morlibint wants
to get a full account of what they do with it (and any
related magical phenomena).
Vol Rajani’s longsword, the Cooperative Blade, is
normally on display at the entrance to Dawnﬂower
Library, but it was stolen the previous night.
CARMAN’S BACKGROUND
Carman grew up on stories of Vol’s bravery, dedication,
and skill. As a boy, Carman didn’t understand why his
family’s sword was hanging in the Dawnﬂower Library
and not in their house. It was theirs, or so his parents
insisted. As Carman grew older, he ﬁrst worked at
Otari’s blacksmith’s shop, Blades for Glades, and later
won the shop in a lucky wager against the prior owner.
Yet he couldn’t forget his family’s sword. Ofﬁcially, the
Menhemes family claimed ownership over Vol’s ancient
blade but “allowed” it to stay in the library in an act
of purported generosity that Carman found offensive.
The summer his parents were waylaid and slain by
bandits on the road from Absalom, Carman became
a broken man. His work at the smithy became erratic,
and he stopped relaxing with his friends and helping his
community. With no other direction, Carman squandered
his inheritance, spending the money on entertainment,

ﬁne clothes, and rare whiskey. He started spending more time gambling
and drinking at the Crook’s Nook than he did at his smithy. Eventually the
inheritance money ran out, and Carman was faced with a sizable debt. Several
owed favors later, he started grifting travelers or hustling them at the knife-
throwing board at the Crook’s Nook. But his vices still outpaced his earnings
from petty cons, and soon he took to outright thievery under Yinyasmera’s
tutelage. The “Ace of Blades” is the moniker given to the best knife thrower in
the Crook’s Nook, and Carman Rajani has held that title for so long that it’s
become his nickname among fellow members of the Osprey Club.
Within a few years, Carman had settled into his new life, working
as a smith during the day, carousing at the Crook’s Nook at night, and
occasionally engaging in some petty larceny when his coin purse started to
get light. When he heard rumors that people thought he was wasting his life,
though, it stung his pride. He resolved to run for mayor against Oseph, to
show the whole town that his family was the equal of the Menhemes family.
Everyone thought Carman’s candidacy was a joke. The second time he
ran, his platform became nothing more than sharp personal attacks against
the Menhemes family; the townspeople felt the joke had gone sour and
considered it a waste of their time. He met their jibes with violence, getting
into brawls to prove he was the better man. The third time he ran for ofﬁce,
he actually put in effort to help the community. Though he lost by much
smaller margin, he took the loss as proof that kindness can’t get you any
further than your ﬁsts can. The fourth time, he tried to force a successful
campaign with open bribes and blackmail.
Oseph won by a landslide, showing up on Election Day wearing the
Cooperative Blade as part of his celebratory regalia. Carman ﬁnally decided
that the magic sword must be the key to his success. Everyone in town
knew it brought Otari good luck, so whoever held the sword had the town
in their pocket. As Vol’s heir, he deserved the sword. He begged Oseph to
sell the weapon, but Oseph suspected it was some new scheme—or worse,
connected to one of Carman’s rumored crimes or debts—and countered
with delays, excuses, and price increases.
Finally, Carman decided he’d had enough. If he wanted his family’s sword
back, he’d have to take it.
THE THEFT
While the heroes were off in the Abomination Vaults, Carman crept into the
Dawnﬂower Library and started a small ﬁre in the book restoration room.
While the ﬁre distracted the staff, he broke the Cooperative Blade’s display
case and ﬂed with the sword.
After an hour, the staff had put out the ﬁre without any serious injuries
and only a few lost books—a miracle the acolytes attribute to Sarenrae’s
protection. By the time anyone discovered the theft, Carman was already
on his way to a local cave called Smuggler’s Refuge. It didn’t take long for
the town guard to realize that the missing Carman Rajani was the prime
suspect. He had pestered the mayor about the sword for years, after all, and
a few witnesses saw someone matching his description absconding from the
library, clutching his cloak over some long object.
Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of the Dawnﬂower Library, meets with
the heroes when they come to ask about the sword. She can barely contain
her rage, although she seems more angry about the theft than the ﬁre. She
asks them to ﬁnd Carman and bring him in alive to face trial and receive an
appropriate punishment.
CHAPTER 5 SYNOPSIS
The chapter begins with the heroes
seeking the ﬁnal icons needed to
enter the Abomination Vault’s middle
levels, but a recent theft complicates
this task. The heroes confront the
thief, Carman Rajani, in a remote
cave, where they must decide what
to do with him—a choice they don’t
yet realize will have meaningful
repercussions later. They can
then explore the ﬁfth level of the
Abomination Vaults, which contains
masterless horrors and malevolent
spirits, and address a mystery
regarding the mayor’s daughter.
Environmental Cues (Smuggler’s
Cave): dripping water, mineral tang
in the air, broken crates, moldy
bedding, old campﬁres
Environmental Cues (Arena level):
dust with strange tracks in it, gouges
along walls, broken links of chains,
splintered furniture, unidentiﬁable
bones, rusted scraps of metal, bits of
broken claw or carapace

Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted
hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or
prepare a good cover story. The Otari Garrison can’t
provide much help; Captain Longsaddle points out
that since Carman isn’t in town or along the roads,
the guards don’t have jurisdiction to pursue him.
He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that
troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s
good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture
Carman but happily takes him into custody if the
heroes bring the smith into town.
Blades for Glades: The heroes ﬁnd Carman’s
blacksmith shop, Blades for Glades, closed; they won’t
ﬁnd any clues here. If the heroes already had the
support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman
mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a
likely hideout.
Combing the Town: If the heroes ask about Carman’s
location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go to
the Crook’s Nook. A hero who succeeds at a DC 20
Diplomacy check to Gather Information hears about
the Smuggler’s Refuge from townsfolk and recalls that
Carman spent time there in his youth (as did many
people in Otari).
Crook’s Nook: Asking around at the Crook’s Nook
brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly
asks for a 10 gp “special fee” for food and drinks; heroes
who pay up (or succeed at a DC 20 Diplomacy check to
Request information) get her to open up about Carman.
The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in
her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She
mentions that Carman has likely gone into hiding at
Smuggler’s Refuge outside of town. If Yinyasmera has
a favorable opinion of the heroes from their previous
actions, she gives this information for free.
SMUGGLER’S REFUGE

This cave is only about an hour outside of town, just a
short walk through the forest, north of an abandoned
ﬁsh camp. Though it’s too far inland for transporting
heavy cargo, this cave once saw a lot of use from

one of the cave’s many niches, planning to come back
for it at a later time, or used the site as a drop point for
transactions with a buyer. Today, with the recent decline
in smuggling, Otari’s young people camp in the cave
when they need a break from the lumber town.
The map of Smuggler’s Refuge appears on page 88.
Rotted crates, forgotten clothes, and other debris suggest
this cave is occasionally used but rarely cleaned. A cold
campﬁre surrounded by logs sits at the cave’s center. Faint
smells of mildew and smoke hang in the still air.
Like many visitors before him, Carman initially built
a ﬁre here but put it out when he realized there isn’t a
good place for the smoke to vent. A few old cots, heaps
of discarded clothes, and empty crates show that this
cave is occasionally inhabited. Carman uses the best of
the cots and the freshest clothes for bedding.
The east wall of the cave contains an exceptionally
well-hidden secret door that leads into the ﬁfth level
of the Abomination Vaults. A hero Searching this area
must succeed at a DC 28 Perception check to ﬁnd it.
Even if discovered, however, the secret door doesn’t
open from this side. The door’s mechanism causes the
heavy stone wall to swing inward, and it can’t do so
because of a cave-in just on the other side of it. The
heroes might clear this entrance from the other side
later (area E7).
Creature: If Carman isn’t aware of the heroes,
he sits on his cot, chewing on some dried ﬁsh and
turning the Cooperative Blade over and over in
his hands while he thinks. He wonders whether
to return the sword and hope for nothing more
than a stiff ﬁne, or ﬂee to his ancestral homeland
of Nidal.
If Carman knows of the heroes’ presence, he
hides behind a crate and uses Stealth for initiative.
Carman knows the heroes by reputation. He
assumes they’ve come here to take him prisoner,
and he puts up a ﬁght. While defending himself,
he shouts to them, “You’ll never take me alive!”
and “This is my sword! I only took what’s rightfully
mine!” He surrenders if the heroes plainly don’t
reciprocate his aggression, or when he’s reduced to
fewer than 30 Hit Points.

TALKING WITH CARMAN
If Carman has a chance to explain himself before the
heroes take him into custody, he tries to justify stealing
the sword. Read or paraphrase the following.
“It’s mine, I tell you! The sword is mine! How can I steal
something that already belongs to me? It belonged to Vol
Rajani, and I’m her only surviving descendant. That uptight
mayor says the sword belongs to his family just because a
pack of kobolds had their hands on it for a while, and his
ancestor snatched it from them. He says an heirloom is an
heirloom, and he’s right, but it’s my heirloom! Look, I tried to
buy it oﬀ him, but every time I saved enough coin, he raised
the price—ﬁfty gold, then one hundred, then two hundred.
Then he said it wasn’t for sale! I had no choice but to take
it. It belongs to Vol—to the Rajani family. It belongs to me!”
Carman pleads for the heroes to let him go and
steadfastly claims his right to take the sword. He
answers their questions as best he can. Likely inquiries
and his responses follow.
Why is the sword so important to you? “It belonged
to my family, to Vol. She was the best of the Roseguard
and the best of the Rajanis... and I wanted to be mayor.
I’ve tried four times but always lost to Oseph. If I had
the sword, well—people say that it gives the town good
luck! If I had it, they’d want me to be mayor so that I
could give them luck.”
Why do you want to be mayor? “To be in charge!
There’s no reason a Menhemes should always run this
place. Oseph says it’s because his family is descended
from heroes. Well, so am I, and I can do a much better
job than that old bastard.”
Why did you set the fire at the library? “The ﬁre was
just a distraction. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, and they
should’ve put it out soon enough. It’s not like I burned
anything other than some paper.”
Even if the sword is rightfully yours, you committed
arson. Don’t you think you deserve to go to jail? “Arson?
Heh. Vandalism maybe. I’ll pay a ﬁne for starting the
ﬁre, but the sword is mine.”
Why should we let you go? “Because I’ll pay you. Fifty
gold coins—a hundred, even. Take it all. But I get to
keep my sword.”
How did you get that much gold? “Saved it, borrowed
some. Okay, borrowed most of it. Look, I just had to
get that sword.”
If we let you go, what will you do? “I don’t know.
Stay here a while, maybe, and think it out. I guess I
can’t really go back to town now. Maybe I’ll head to
Nidal. They say Vol was from there—some say she was
royalty, and maybe I can get the life that’s due to me.”
If we let you go, can we borrow the sword first? “As
long as you’re not taking it or me back to town, I’ll go
with you to do whatever you need to do.”
CARMAN’S FATE
The heroes decide what to do with Carman. He likely
goes along with any of the heroes’ demands, particularly
if they already proved they can beat him in a ﬁght.
Let Him Go: Even if the heroes are willing to let him
go, they still need the Cooperative Blade to breach the
barrier in the Abomination Vaults. Carman goes with
them for this task since he doesn’t want to let the sword
out of his sight, but he doesn’t ﬁght in the Abomination
Vaults if the heroes get into trouble. After the barrier
goes down, Carman retreats to the cave to consider
what to do and likely stays there for a few days.
Turn Him In: If the heroes turn him over to the Otari
Garrison, Captain Longsaddle tosses him in a cell and
jokes about throwing away the key. Longsaddle lets the
mayor know that the heroes have the Cooperative Blade;
the mayor is ﬁne with the heroes borrowing it, as long as it
ends up back with the town. Longsaddle takes Carman’s
money as a pool to repay any costs from his crimes but
lets the heroes keep Carman’s other equipment.
Kill Him: If the heroes kill Carman in combat, people
in town understand that’s a risk when apprehending
a criminal. Oseph arranges for Carman’s burial in
the Otari Cemetery and lets the heroes borrow the
Cooperative Blade.
Treasure: Apart from what Carman carries on him,
his adventurer’s pack near the ﬁre contains a week of
improvised rations and two waterskins. A hero who
succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check while Searching
the cave ﬁnds a long-forgotten bottle of Old Law
Whiskey hidden in a pebble-covered niche. The aged
alcohol is worth 3 gp.

Dorianna’s Dreams
Although the heroes can ﬁnd plenty of
adventure in the Abomination Vaults,
other mysterious events are afoot
in Otari. The most signiﬁcant of
these occurrences centers around the
mayor’s eldest daughter, the teenaged
Dorianna Menhemes. Dorianna is
on the cusp of developing psychic
powers. While no one on the surface
is aware of this, a denizen of Leng
named Ysondkhelir (area G18) has
become aware of her power. With
the barrier to the lower levels down, he
can twist her dreams into nightmares
and take the role of her savior. He
intensiﬁes this long plan over weeks
of nighttime adventures with her in
the Dimension of Dreams. Ysondkhelir
intends to eventually thrust Dorianna
physically into the Dimension of Dreams
to augment other denizens’ plots.
Two nights after the heroes open the seal
to the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, Dorianna
Menhemes begins having horrifying nightmares.
She awakens several times each night, screaming
and clutching a stuffed griffon she hasn’t touched
in years. When asked, she doesn’t recall the speciﬁcs
of these nightmares beyond her fear and the
appearance of a man shrouded in mismatched fabric
who comforts her.
If the heroes have earned the support of Menhemes
Manor, they’ve met Dorianna, and they hear about
her nightmares from the other children. Otherwise,
the mayor seeks out whichever hero is best known
as a healer or as an authority on Occultism. He
mentions his daughter’s nightmares and the “motley
man” who acts as a protector and savior within
them. He asks them to discreetly look into the
matter and help his daughter.
Asking Wrin: Mayor Menhemes views Wrin
Sivinxi of Wrin’s Wonders as an unreliable eccentric,
so he doesn’t think to involve her in his family’s
troubles. However, she’s an expert in Occultism;
she gladly accompanies the heroes to help Dorianna
if they ask, so long as she doesn’t need to meet with
the beleaguered girl indoors. If the party lacks
someone with Occultism training to get to the
bottom of these mysteries, Wrin’s involvement is a
possible solution.
EXAMINING DORIANNA
Even the ﬁrst time the heroes examine Dorianna, she
already appears gaunt and pale as if she had caught a
severe malady. A character who succeeds at a DC 15
Medicine check veriﬁes that she’s nevertheless
in good physical health. The heroes initially
ﬁnd no evidence of any magic or curse upon
her. A search of Dorianna’s room discovers
that several of her childhood toys have
been brought back out for her to play with.
Dorianna states vaguely that she just missed
them and wanted to play with them again.
Dorianna’s nightmares are tenacious; any
magic the heroes use to help Dorianna
get a good night’s sleep fail unless
the caster succeeds at a secret
DC 27 counteract check.
XP Award: Award the heroes
30 XP for taking the care and time
to help Dorianna, even if they can’t
ﬁgure out what’s wrong just yet.
DORIANNA’S DECLINE
Dorianna’s condition worsens over time.
Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she
feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins
to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend
even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else.
Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she
often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings
don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents
ﬁnd her hard to put up with. She’s been afﬂicted by
Ysondkhelir’s outcast’s curse spell, which the heroes
might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir
casts it on her again the following night.
With a successful DC 26 Diplomacy check, the heroes
gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If
they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have
a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Only one hero
can attempt this check each day (on a critical failure, they
must instead wait 1d4 days). On a success, Dorianna
insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of
the following two subjects with them (on a subsequent
day’s success or an initial critical success, she reveals both).
Gifts: The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form
of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the
stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that
something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters
who open it up ﬁnd a large, ﬂawless ruby worth 30 gp.
Even if the heroes take this ruby, the next time Dorianna
dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from
wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave
her for long.

Wrist Writing: Dorianna absently points out several
bruises on her right wrist that she can’t remember
getting. A hero trained in Occultism who
views the bruises can attempt a DC 22
Occultism check to Decipher Writing.
A hero who speaks Aklo gains a +2
circumstance bonus to this check. On
a success, the hero notes that the words
are related to some dream-traveling
rituals; on a critical success, the hero
notes the word “Leng” among the
bruises.
Either of these clues points to
the involvement of a malevolent
extraplanar
creature
called
a denizen of Leng. Leng is a
terrifying extraplanar location
just past the Dimension of
Dreams, where cruel and sinister
people called denizens of Leng
live. A hero who succeeds at a DC
24 Occultism realizes the nature of
the creature plaguing Dorianna; if the heroes obtained
both clues, then any hero trained in Occultism realizes
this without a check. Though the heroes might identify
the source of Dorianna’s trouble, there’s not much
they can do for her yet, because Ysondkhelir doesn’t
ever physically get anywhere near her.
XP Award: Award the heroes 80 XP if they discover a
denizen of Leng is involved in Dorianna’s malady.
DORIANNA’S MADNESS
About the time the heroes ﬁnish their exploration
of the laboratories level and start to investigate the
prison level, Dorianna’s condition suddenly gets
worse. She sleepwalks most of the time and is unaware
of events around her, as though seeing the world in a
hazy dream. Her right hand withers for no discernible
reason. Mayor Menhemes takes his daughter to Vandy
Banderdash at the Dawnﬂower Library, but the clerics
there can’t aid her.
The heroes hear about all of this on their next
return to Otari. Everyone else in the Menhemes family
is beside themselves with grief. If the heroes haven’t
previously gained Dorianna’s trust, they can now
attempt to do so, but the DC for the Diplomacy check
is 27, and they gain no bonus for having the support of
Menhemes Manor—Dorianna is beyond caring about
her former friends.
If the heroes have Dorianna’s trust, she describes
great adventures with the Motley Man in a fantastical
land of forests, palaces, and snowﬁelds. The Motley
Man told her they would soon be together on their
adventures forever, but he wanted her right hand as
a token. Dorianna didn’t hesitate to offer it to him,
and when she awoke her hand was withered. She
doesn’t consider it a particularly serious loss,
since her best friend wanted it so much.
Dorianna doesn’t know how long it will be
until she and the Motley Man are together
forever, and this timetable is intentionally
left vague so you can prompt your players
to action without punishing them if they
fail to reach Ysondkhelir quickly. They
should have, at a minimum, a week before
Dorianna vanishes.
Dorianna’s connection to Ysondkhelir
is now so strong that the heroes can
discover him through this link. A
hero trained in Occultism realizes
they can learn more by examining
Dorianna’s
psychic
patterns
while she is dreaming. This is an
exploration activity that takes 8
hours and requires a DC 23 Occultism
check. With a successful check, the hero learns the ﬁrst
fact below they don’t already know; with a critical
success they learn two facts; and with a critical failure,
they learn a false fact of your invention.
•	 There is a strong link between Dorianna’s mind
and the Dimension of Dreams. A denizen of Leng
has strengthened this conduit; unless that creature
is destroyed, Dorianna will eventually be drawn
wholly into that dimension and lost to this world.
•	 The hero gains images of the denizen’s lair: a stone
chamber with a very old map of the Inner Sea
region painted on it across from a map consisting
of several tattered pieces of paper that, together,
constitute a detailed map of Otari.
•	 The hero knows the denizen’s name is Ysondkhelir
and gains an accurate mental image of him.
•	 The hero can use the ruby in Dorianna’s possession
to track Ysondkhelir and can use the following
activity with the ruby. Even though Dorianna
doesn’t care if they take it, it’s still attuned to her
and returns to her each night. The heroes must
therefore return to Otari to recover it each day.
Activate 10 minutes (envision); Frequency once per
day; Eﬀect You focus on the ruby, which casts a
5th-level locate spell that only targets Ysondkhelir.
Treasure: After the heroes defeat Ysondkhelir, the
ruby no longer returns to Dorianna and becomes an
unusually shaped wand of locate. Dorianna swiftly
recovers afterward. Mayor Oseph effusively thanks
the heroes and arranges for each of them to receive an
Dorianna Menhemes

XP Award: Award the heroes 120 XP for freeing
Dorianna from Ysondkhelir’s clutches.
Arena Features
Once the heroes recover all four of the icons and place
them on the altar in the Upper Temple of Nhimbaloth
in area D13, they are able to enter the ﬁfth level of the
Abomination Vaults. Belcorra used this level to test the
resolve of her minions and her prisoners, and hoped
to someday establish a premier facility for gladiators,
from which she would take the best combatants for
her forces. Presently, Jafaki and the other seugathis use
this level as a dumping ground for failed experiments.
The ceilings on this level are 15 feet tall unless
otherwise indicated. Areas not described as having
light are completely dark. The doors are made of wood
banded with iron, and virtually all of them bear gouges
or scarring from violent beasts smashing their way
through in the past. The doors are weighted to swing
closed after a few moments if they aren’t propped open.
The Arena map appears on page 84.
E1. UPPER SHAFT
MODERATE 5
A crumbling staircase leads to a cracked and badly stained
mosaic tile ﬂoor. To the south, a walkway encircles a round,
gaping pit, leading to a spiral stairway that clings to the edge
of the pit. A twisted iron banister follows the edge of the
walkway and stairs. The acrid smell of chemicals and rot,
with just a tinge of sulfur, wafts from the pit’s darkness.
Strange moaning echoes up the shaft.
The circular pit is 80 feet deep and ringed with
a spiral staircase. The laboratories level is 40 feet
below (area F1), and the prison level is at the bottom
(area G1).
Creatures: The seugathis deposited some rejected
experiments here to keep them out of the way. Two
grothluts lurk around the bends, just out of sight of
the stairs, and a gibbering mouther sprawls on the
walkway near the door leading east. They attack as
soon as they detect any creatures in the area, moaning
and gibbering as they do. (The grothluts are immune to
the mouther’s gibbering, but the mouther isn’t immune
to the grothluts’ piteous moan.) These creatures ﬁght
until destroyed, but they don’t bother pursuing anyone
who retreats up the stairs.

E2. LARGE MONSTER HOLDING
MODERATE 5
Rusted iron chains hang from the ceiling of this room, each
ending in an oversized manacle. The octagonal eastern end
of the room contains a circular pit covered by a rusted iron
grate. Torn bolts and scrap metal dangle from the ceiling
above the pit. Piles of scrap ﬁll the four alcoves that open
oﬀ the wide hall that constitutes the room’s west end.
A velstrac named Cratonys once prepared large
monsters for ﬁghting in the arena in this part of the
dungeon. She kept them in the cells in area E3, where
she tortured them to enhance their aggressiveness and
scarred them to augment their ferocious appearance
using the now-rusted contraptions in the alcoves.
When it came time for the creatures to ﬁght, she
lowered them into the chamber below (area F2) using
a heavy winch in the ceiling, which is now inoperable
and unstable.
The heroes might have met another evangelist
velstrac named Vaulgrist on the level above this one.
Cratonys and Vaulgrist were once as close as sisters,
but each has fallen into her own independent malaise.
Hazard: The rusty and unstable grate over the pit
collapses as soon as any signiﬁcant weight is placed
upon it. The remains of the dangling winch mechanism
fall into the pit moments later. The Athletics DC to
Climb the pit is 20.

The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage
(20 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use the
Grab an Edge reaction to avoid falling. Whether or not
the creature Grabs an Edge, the rusty winch above
crashes down atop the triggering creature, dealing
3d10 bludgeoning damage and dislodging its grip (DC
24 basic Reﬂex save). The creature can still try to Grab
an Edge again.

Creature: Belcorra’s magic binds Cratonys to this
level, preventing the velstrac from leaving. After
centuries surrounded by mindless aberrations and the
twisted logic of the seugathis, she has gone feral and lost
all sense of purpose. She doesn’t speak or respond to
any who try to communicate with her, but lashes out in
a desire to inﬂict pain. She ﬁghts from the room’s west
end, using the rusty chains to strike her foes.
If any hero obviously bears the silver-handled +1
ghost touch whip that once belonged to Vaulgrist,
Cratonys recognizes it and appears taken aback by its
presence. She refuses to attack anyone carrying it, and
anyone holding out the whip can compel her to cease
her attacks for at least a few minutes with a single
Interact action; however, Cratonys doesn’t become
any less violent or more prone to speak.

Rusty Chains When Cratonys damages a creature with her

VELSTRAC TETANUS
DISEASE 6
DISEASE
VIRULENT
Velstracs sometimes intentionally infect their chains with
dangerous diseases, such as this aggressive form of tetanus.
Tetanus can produce stiﬀness, muscle spasms strong enough
to break bones, and ultimately death.
Saving Throw DC 21 Fortitude; Onset 1d4 days; Stage 1
clumsy 1 (1 week); Stage 2 clumsy 2 and can’t speak (1
day); Stage 3 paralyzed (1 day); Stage 4 death
XP Award: If the heroes get Cratonys to stand down
by displaying Vaulgrist’s whip, award them 60 XP as
though they defeated her in combat (if they later ﬁght
her anyway, they don’t gain any XP for doing so).
E3. MONSTER HOLDING
MODERATE 5
Three cells line the south wall, their bars only a few
inches apart. Each cell contains a heap of rotted
ﬂesh and shattered bone.
The locks on these cell doors have all
seized shut due to age. Opening one requires a
hero to succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check to
Force it Open or a single DC 20 Thievery check
to disable the jammed mechanism.
The center cell holds the only item of interest:
a copper key that glitters within the ﬂeshy
muck. This spare key can open the locked supply room
(area E11). The creature in the cell consumed the key’s
last bearer decades ago but couldn’t digest copper.
Creatures: In each cell, the ﬂeshy detritus has
coalesced into a strange creature called a shanrigol,
a nearly mindless amalgamation of undeath and
twitching life. These three shanrigol heaps remain
motionless until one of them is disturbed, at which
point they all slither forward to attack. The shanrigols
don’t need to open the cell doors to get out, as they
can ooze between the bars with their Undulating Step.

E4. SURGICAL SUITE
MODERATE 5
Lanterns hanging from the ceiling shine bright circles of
light over three stone tables topped with metal slabs. A
single lightweight chain dangles near each table. The
remnants of a dead morlock lies on one slab. Dried splatters
of blood cover the walls, ﬂoor, and ceiling.
The three lights in this room are magical; they
illuminate the tables with bright light but provide only
dim light to the rest of the room. The metal slabs at
the top of each table have hinges on the sides. A tug
on the hanging pull-chain causes the table’s hinged
slabs to fold down then back up, dumping anything
on the table into a 40-foot-deep shaft to area F6. The
slabs easily fold down from the underside, so anyone
climbing up one of the shafts can open the slab and get
out. The Athletics DC to Climb the pits is 20.
Jafaki previously used this chamber for ﬂeshwarping
trials, dumping failed experiments and waste from his
surgeries into the pits for the oozes below to devour.
He eventually deemed this location too inconvenient
and virtually never uses it anymore.
Creature: The last time Jafaki came here, he
abandoned a morlock whose arms and legs he had
amputated (and disposed of). The creature died in
agony and its spirit arose as a specter. The specter wants
only to inﬂict its interminable agony upon others, and
it still harbors a visceral fear of the operating tables.
The bright lights shining on the tables activate its
sunlight powerlessness.

E5. MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Shelves of dusty bottles and surgical equipment line
the walls in this room. Cobwebs and dust hint that this
chamber has remained untouched for quite some time. At
the center of the room stands a solitary pushcart.
Jafaki kept spare parts, alchemical reagents, and
tools organized in this room. He hasn’t visited this
room in decades, so many reagents have spoiled.
On a successful DC 15 Perception check, a hero
Searching this room locates an unusual key that fell
behind one of the shelves. The key has a round shaft
tipped with several teeth of varying length; it opens
one of the locks in the plinth room (area F7).
Treasure: The shelves contain two sets of healer’s
tools, a set of expanded healer’s tools, and alchemical
reagents worth 10 gp.
E6. HALLWAY
A steep staircase descends underneath a footbridge,
which crosses this hall at 20 feet above the ground.
From this side, the double door to the south is
barricaded with several bars of twisted metal scrap and
a sturdy wooden shelf. The footbridge’s wrought iron
railing prevents anyone on it from easily falling off.
With a successful DC 20 Athletics check, a character
can climb up onto (or down from) the footbridge.
E7. SECURITY CHECKPOINT
MODERATE 5
The heroes might have some difﬁculty reaching this area
from the east since a closed portcullis ﬂanked by arrow
slits blocks the hall, but a character can lift this portcullis
with a successful DC 30 Athletics check. Some of the
bars near the north arrow slit have partially melted and
twisted, perhaps caused by powerful acid. A Small or
smaller creature who’s trained in Acrobatics can Squeeze
through the opening with a successful DC 18 Acrobatics
check, but the opening is too small for larger creatures.
This central octagonal room is ﬂanked on the north and
south by single iron doors, each with a narrow viewing port
and archery slit. The stone double door to the east features
an emblazoned carving of a dripping skull, its mouth
stuﬀed with weeds. The western double door is made of
iron pitted with rust.
This area acted as a gateway for Belcorra’s scouts to
go out into the world and as an egress point for her
army of well-trained champions. The double door to
the east leads to a passage that ends at a cave-in behind
the well-hidden secret door in Smuggler’s Refuge. The
cave-in and secret door are obvious from this side.
Clearing the cave-in requires 40 hours of manual labor,
but the heroes can divide up this task (four characters
can clear it in 10 hours, for example).
The two guard chambers (areas E7a and E7c) and
archer stations (areas E7b and E7d) were looted
centuries ago but still bear empty weapon racks.
The east wall in area E7b has a lever that raises and
lowers the portcullis. Although rusty, it still works.
Any creature squeezing past the gap in the portcullis
can see the lever in the archer station.

Area E7c has a secret door in its west wall that
opens by manipulating a hook on the room’s weapon
rack. With a successful DC 20 Perception check, a
hero Searching this room locates identiﬁes this door
and how to open it.
Creature:
Belcorra’s
chief
assassin,
Siora
Fallowglade, tried to ﬂee the Abomination Vaults
during the chaos following Belcorra’s death. She
murdered the two guards stationed here to hide the
evidence of her ﬂight, but one of the guards managed
to inﬂict a mortal wound. Siora died before reaching
the other end of the tunnel.
At Belcorra’s death, a surge of negative energy swept
through this area, tethering Siora’s soul to this area as
a shadow. Siora is eager to create minions to serve her.
She thus focuses on one enemy at a time; she steals
their shadow, marks them for death, then murders
them. She retreats if badly damaged, but only to set up
an ambush later. An implacable foe, she continues her
attacks until destroyed.

XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP if they reopen
the passage to Smuggler’s Refuge, which they can use
to more easily come and go from Otari.
E8. ASSASSIN’S QUARTERS
The secret doors providing entrance to this room—one
at the end of the hall that leads north and another at
the end of the hall leading south—are both obvious
from this side.
Dust and neglect cover this chamber’s narrow bed,
warped wooden wardrobe, and large footlocker.
Siora Fallowglade once lived here, but
no one has come here since her death
centuries ago. The bedding and clothing
have all decayed into threadbare
scraps.
Treasure:
The
footlocker
contains
a
wide-brimmed
red hat with a large black
feather (a greater hat of
disguise), a pouch of tiny
emeralds worth a total
of 25 gp, and Siora’s
poison codex. This book contains the formulas for
hunting spider venom, giant scorpion venom, giant
wasp venom, and malyass root paste. The book is

exceedingly fragile; the ﬁrst time a creature opens
it, they must succeed at a DC 20 Thievery check
or a random formula is destroyed as some pages
disintegrate. On a critical failure, the entire book is
destroyed. Consulting the book thereafter doesn’t
risk further disintegration unless the handler is
intentionally careless.
E9. ELITE VIEWING ROOM
MODERATE 5
The curved east and west walls contain tables with small,
built-in ovens. Wood fragments, heavily dented pewter
serving dishes, silver ﬂatware, and crystal shrapnel litter
the ﬂoor. A wide alcove to the south ends at a cloudy
window overlooking a much larger space. An array of
magical glyphs glows next to the window.
This elegant meeting room is where Belcorra’s guests
watched arena matches and enjoyed the
food cooked in the kitchen below (and
kept warm in the ovens).
Most of the debris scattered across
the ﬂoor is worthless, but it creates
difﬁcult terrain across the entire room. The
staircase leading down to the Warped Brew
Tavern (area F11) is choked with trash and is
greater difﬁcult terrain instead.
The south wall overlooking the arena (area E26)
isn’t glass, but transparent stone. The glyphs on the
wall control the magic infused in this stone. A hero
Investigating the glyphs who succeeds at a DC 20
Arcana or Occultism check understands how to use
them. A creature manipulating the glyphs can make
the wall ethereal (it still resembles transparent stone,
but creatures and objects can pass through it), render
it opaque, or change it back to transparent stone,
as well as control what part of the arena it shows.
Each change is a 2-action Interact activity with the
manipulate trait.
Creatures: When Belcorra died, two of her
guests—squabbling aristocrat siblings—let their
fear of being trapped in the Abomination Vaults
overwhelm them. They murdered each other in
a panicked rage and arose again as poltergeists,
who continue their ﬁght to this day. Their hurled
accusations against each other invariably escalate
into hurled debris, and these frequent rages have
produced the wreckage throughout this room.
The poltergeists put their differences aside to ﬁght
intruders, but they soon fall back into their endless
squabbling again if the heroes retreat. As they
ﬁght, they mutter phrases like “can’t get out” and
“trapped here forever.” They ﬁght until destroyed.

key to putting the spirits permanently to rest. Anyone
who responds to the poltergeists, even during combat,
might get them to expand upon their worries with
statements like “We have no way out of the arena!”
or “There’s no path to escape!” If the heroes establish
a clear exit path of open doors that lead to the surface
and then describe this path to the poltergeists, the
spirits immediately cease their attacks, concentrate
on the avenue of escape the heroes describe, and
vanish for good.
Treasure: Hidden among the debris is a dented,
lead-lined steel box. A character must succeed at a DC
20 Thievery check to disable the jammed mechanism
that keeps it shut. No amount of force can get the box
open; the poltergeists have been hurling it about for
centuries already. It holds a type I ring of wizardry
with the symbol of Nhimbaloth on it.
E10. GRAND CONCOURSE
MODERATE 5
This stately hallway stretches from a single door to the
north to a wide exit to the south. Frescoes depicting
powerful creatures in battle with each other adorn the
walls. Pinpoints of light glimmer in the vaulted ceiling,
illuminating the hallway with a pale radiance. Balconies run
the length of the hallway, twenty feet above the ﬂoor, their
low railings rusty and twisted in places. A stone bridge
connects the balconies across the hallways to each other,
providing access to the tunnels out of the hallway to the
east and west from the balcony. Several badly damaged
statues decorate the south end of the hall.
The vaulted ceiling reaches 20 feet over the
balconies and 40 feet over the ground level. The
pinpoints of light are irregularly spaced and at ﬁrst
appear to replicate stars in the night sky. A hero
trained in Nature realizes that the lights are unlike the
night sky from anywhere on the surface of Golarion
and instead represent what the night sky looks like
on some incredibly distant world.
Characters must succeed at a DC 20 Athletics check
to Climb up onto (or down from) the footbridge.
Most of the statues at the south end of the hall
resemble exceptionally lifelike ﬂeshwarped creatures,
such as grothluts, driders, and mulventoks (page 237).
All have been toppled, and most have been partially
eaten. Two statues remain in reasonable condition, as
described in Restoring the Statues below.
Creatures: A mated pair of basilisks has a nest at
the south end of this hall. The seugathis occasionally
send a ﬂeshwarped creature to clear them out, or a
creature wandering through the area crosses their
path. All have thus far fallen to the basilisks’ petrifying
gaze. When the heroes arrive, the basilisks lurk amid
the statutes of their victims. They viciously guard their
territory but don’t pursue foes who ﬂee.
BASILISKS (2)
CREATURE 5
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 38
Initiative Perception +11
Restoring the Statues: All but two of the statues are
too damaged to be restored, whether by basilisk blood
or other means. One appears to be a pale, vampire‑like
humanoid known as an urdefhan (Pathﬁnder Bestiary
2 272), but the other looks like a far brawnier version
of one. The larger creature is a mulventok (page 237),
a type of ﬂeshwarp created from an urdefhan; it has
lost its connection to its inherent purpose while
petriﬁed and, if restored, attacks in a frenzy until slain.
If the heroes restore the urdefhan, he shouts, “War
Chieftain Khurfel! Belcorra has need of the eye!” in
Undercommon, screams in pain from internal injuries,
and dies.
Treasure: The equipment here is too damaged to be
useful, save for the urdefhan’s +1 striking composite
shortbow and the mulventok’s +1 tamchal chakram.
The heroes can recover these weapons if they restore
those statues.
XP Award: If the heroes restore the mulventok and
defeat it, award them 80 XP for the combat encounter.
E11. LOCKED SUPPLY ROOM
Both doors leading into this room are locked. A hero
without the key (Jafaki carries one; the other is in the
debris in area E3) can Force Open each door with a
successful DC 25 Athletics check or Pick the Lock with
four successful DC 25 Thievery checks.
This room’s shelves are well-stocked with jars of preserved
organs, crates ﬁlled with bones wrapped in rags, and
surgical tools. Two armor stands ﬂank a weapon rack to
the south, but they bear only a pair of gnarled sticks in
leather sheaths.
Belcorra’s quartermaster once stored valuable
supplies here—usually armor and weapons. All were
removed in the chaos following Belcorra’s death, and
this room sat empty for a long time. Jafaki recently
discovered a key and decided to repurpose this room
to store spare parts for his experiments, as well as
magical equipment he doesn’t need. He visits the room
only every few months, as needed.
Treasure: The shelves here contain a moderate
bestial mutagen, a moderate juggernaut mutagen,
and a moderate quicksilver mutagen. The two wands

E12. SENTENCING CHAMBER
MODERATE 5
The ﬂoor of this room contains several open square pits:
one in each of the three alcoves to the north and two larger
pits in the middle of the room. A dais at the room’s west
end contains a stone throne with two rusty levers jutting
from the ﬂoor next to it.
In Belcorra’s day, prisoners were brought to this room
for the sorcerer to pronounce judgment against them.
Nearly always, this judgment involved feeding them to
the hydras below. The two levers correspond to the two
pits; each lever once released the supports on a false stone
trapdoor, dropping anyone standing on it into the water
55 feet below (area F4). The hinges to the trapdoor broke
away long ago, and the fallen trapdoors now rest at the
bottom of the pool. The rusted levers are currently useless.
The pits in the alcoves never had trapdoors; they
simply drop into the water below and were used to
dispose of multiple creatures in quick succession. The
pits are narrow enough that a Medium creature falling
into any of them can Grab an Edge automatically.
The Athletics DC to Climb these pits is 20.
Creatures: Jafaki trapped two gibtas bounders in
this room; his efforts to mutate or train them proved
entirely ineffective, so he has given up on them for
the time being. The gibtas bounders attack intruders,
but they don’t coordinate their tactics. They’re smart
enough to avoid the pits, and a gibtas reduced to fewer
than 40 Hit Points starts trying to Shove opponents
into the pits with its bouncing slam.
GIBTAS BOUNDERS (2)
CREATURE 5
Page 238
Initiative Perception +13
Into the Pits: A hero who falls into a pit and fails to
Grab an Edge lands in area F4, awakening the hydras
there and potentially getting into a very tough ﬁght. If
a gibtas falls into the pit, it brieﬂy ﬁghts with the hydra
under the water, biting off a head and cauterizing the
stump with its acidic saliva before the hydra’s other
heads rip it to pieces. The heroes see only roiling water
followed by a cloud of green blood and pieces of the
gibtas’s corpse ﬂoating to the surface.
Treasure: The stone throne contains a secret
compartment in the back. A hero Searching it who
succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check ﬁnds the
compartment and its contents: a climbing bolt, a dragon
turtle scale, and 31 gp.
E13. GLADIATOR READINESS ROOM
LOW 5
Weapon racks stand in the northeast and southeast
corners of this room. The southeast rack is empty, but the
northeast rack holds a hatchet made of dark crystal. Two
alcoves between the racks on the eastern wall each have
an open hatch and a ladder leading down. Additional exits
lead out to the north, west, and south.
Gladiators readied themselves for aquatic battles in
this room, climbing down the ladders to the shallows
in the pool below. The exit to the north leads to
a supply closet; the door fell off the hinges decades
ago, and a mimic recently took the door’s place. The
weapon rack with the hatchet is another mimic, the
hatchet merely a part of its camouﬂage.
The hatches leading down into the water below (area
F4) are open. Several of the ladder rungs are missing,
so a character must succeed at a DC 10 Athletics check
to Climb either ladder.
Creatures: A pair of mimics recently entered this
room. One settled in the northeast corner, disguising
itself as a weapon rack identical to the one in the
southeast corner. The second mimic wedged itself
into the northern door frame, disguising itself as a
door that collapsed inward into the storage closet. If
the heroes approach this area with great stealth, they
might overhear the two mimics murmuring about the
ﬂavors of the dungeon’s various denizens.

room or handling the bottle recognizes the runes on its
base, which label it as bottled air.
E14. LOUNGE
A counter wrapped around the northern and northeastern
wall bears a few cracked serving dishes. A dusty and
shattered display case features only grime and broken glass.
This room once hosted gladiators looking to
compete in the pits, where they fought to eventually
become leaders of Belcorra’s army. A hero who
Searches the display case ﬁnds the words “They Are

Anyone examining this carving can attempt a DC 20
Perception check; on a success, they realize that the
words are near a hidden hinge, and the entire case
swings aside as a secret door.
E15. WAITING ROOM
Mounds of white fungus blossom from what was once
padded furniture in this small waiting room.
Tiny fungal spores drift throughout this room. A
hero who succeeds at a DC 22 Nature check to Recall
Knowledge realizes the danger the spores pose and
that limiting time in the room to less than a minute
provides the safest way to prevent exposure.
Hazard: For each minute a creature spends in this
room with any exposed skin, it must attempt a saving
throw to avoid contracting fungal rot.
FUNGAL ROT
DISEASE 6
DISEASE
This fast-acting disease causes tiny spores to take
root under the skin and blossom in the lungs or in the
bloodstream. You become easily winded and incapable of
moving quickly. You can’t reduce your sickened condition
while aﬄicted with fungal rot.
Saving Throw DC 22 Fortitude; Onset 1 hour; Stage  1
sickened 1 (1 day); Stage 2 slowed 1 and sickened 2
(1 day); Stage 3 slowed 2 and sickened 3 (1 day); Stage 4

Treasure: In the cushions of the sofa are 13 assorted
silver pieces, minted centuries ago by a long-shuttered
mint that are worth 4 gp each to a collector.
E16. ADMINISTRATOR’S ANTECHAMBER
This sitting room glows from the light of a ﬁre, crackling
pleasantly in a web-choked ﬁreplace on the east wall. A
large divan has been pushed up against the door to the
northwest. Several pitons pounded into the gap between
the stone door and its frame ensure it remains shut.
The magic that sustains this ﬁre has lasted centuries.
Several harmless spiders inhabit the ﬁreplace and have
ﬁlled it with their webs over the years because the light
attracts insects.
Removing the divan from the door is simple enough,
but the heroes must spend 10 minutes with a crowbar
or similar tool to pry the pitons out of the door to open
it. The door’s stone is magically enhanced and difﬁcult
to smash through (Hardness 18, HP 76). Most attempts
to bypass the door using magic fail, due to magical
protections placed upon the room beyond (area E17).
E17. IMPRISONED ADMINISTRATOR
SEVERE 5
This room’s occupant placed magical defenses on the
room to prevent teleportation effects or ethereal travel
from accessing it.
A glowing circle of runes covers the ﬂoor in this chamber.
Parchment covered with cramped writing sits on a desk
situated against the north wall, and the splintered remains
of a bed are piled in a corner.
In the chaos following Belcorra’s fall, someone
locked the arena administrator, Chafkhem, in his
room. As Chafkhem had previously warded his room
against interdimensional travel, he was effectively
imprisoned. Before he succumbed to starvation, the
erudite wizard cobbled together reagents to mummify
himself with parchment paper, hoping to one day
escape his bounds and inﬂict revenge on Jafaki, whom
Chafkhem believed ordered him to be imprisoned in
his room.
In his isolation, Chafkhem has attempted to devise
a means of escape by creating a temporary portal
through the wall. A simple mistake in his assumptions
rendered all his calculations incorrect, and he has failed
to get the spell to work—a point of great frustration
for the vainglorious mummy.
The magic circle at the center of the room assists
Chafkhem with maintaining magical energy. The
circle gives him a +2 status bonus to skill checks when
performing rituals. Additionally, he’s quickened while
within the circle but can use the additional action only
to Sustain a Spell.
Creature: When the heroes unseal his chamber,
Chafkhem holds up his parchment-wrapped arms to
show he means no harm. He’s genuinely thankful for
his release and quite charming by nature. Unfortunately,
he’s as bossy in undeath as he was in life, and he soon
starts demanding, rather than requesting, information
from the heroes about the current status of the seugathis
and the Abomination Vaults. If the heroes don’t indulge
Chafkhem, he decides to kill them and animate them as
undead who don’t talk back nearly as much.

If the heroes get on Chafkhem’s good side, he
speaks with open contempt about the seugathis that
Belcorra permitted to operate their ﬂeshwarping
laboratory on the next lower level, as they displaced
arena functions Chafkhem controlled. He doesn’t
know precisely how many seugathis remain, but he
describes their leader as an alchemist and ﬂeshwarper
named Jafaki, whom he blames for locking him in

this room to die several centuries ago. Chafkhem
wants revenge against Jafaki, and he suggests that the
heroes seek it on his behalf.
Chafkhem knows Belcorra is long dead, although he
expresses concern if the heroes let him know that she
also returned as an undead creature. Chafkhem makes
plans to depart the Abomination Vaults and return to
his native Osirion; whether the heroes want to let an
evil mummy go free is up to them.
Chafkhem takes 2d4 days to put his papers in
order and carefully replicate the arcane patterns of his
magic circle before he leaves. If the heroes return in
that time with proof that they’ve slain Jafaki or that
the imp Szek orchestrated Chafkhem’s imprisonment,
the mummy expresses his gratitude and rewards
them with information. He sketches out the entirety
of the Arena level for them, including all its secret
doors and passages, and provides the heroes with the
magical passphrase to disable the trap in area E20. He
doesn’t have any blank parchment, so he writes on
his spellbook page containing freedom of movement;
the heroes can later Learn a Spell from that page, in
addition to having the useful map.
Treasure: Chafkhem’s desk contains hundreds of
pieces of parchment with writing covering every bit
of space. For many years, Chafkhem only had access
to this parchment, and he has made full use of it.
These papers not only serve as Chafkhem’s spellbook,
allowing heroes to Learn a Spell from them, but also
contain the awaken portal and create undead rituals.
Any hero who spends time Investigating these papers
discovers both rituals.
E18. LEVEL 5 PORTAL CHAMBER
The door to this room is locked, and Chafkhem has the
only key. A hero can Force it Open with a successful
DC 25 Athletics check or Pick the Lock with four
successful DC 25 Thievery checks.
Swirling runes carved into the stone and ﬁlled with silver
cover the walls of this circular chamber. The ﬂoor is
polished smooth, as is the ceiling 10 feet above.
The heroes might have discovered the inactive
network of permanent teleportation circles Belcorra
installed to move quickly throughout the Abomination
Vaults in the dungeon’s upper levels. The heroes
could have even started restoring the network if they
discovered the awaken portal ritual (if they didn’t ﬁnd
this ritual in area C35, they can ﬁnd it in Chafkhem’s
notes in area E17). This room contains yet another
inactive teleportation circle that the heroes can connect
to others they’ve already reawakened.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for using the
awaken portal ritual to reactivate this room’s magic.
E19. SPYING CHAMBER
This unadorned room’s most notable feature is the
secret door that leads to the grand concourse (area
E10). The secret door isn’t obvious from this side, so a
character must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to
locate it. A hero who knows the series of knocks that
opens the door in the grand concourse can also open
the secret door from this side, making the door ghostly
and incorporeal.
A window of one-way transparent stone allows
anyone from within this room to view events in the
grand concourse. The stone appears opaque from
the concourse side, and the window is undetectable.
Anyone touching the transparent stone from this
side can hear anything in the concourse through a
permanent clairaudience effect.
E20. SECRET HALLWAY
SEVERE 5
Bones and dismembered limbs lay scattered throughout
this irregular, branching hallway.
Belcorra and Chafkhem spied on gladiators from
this secret hall, paranoid about insurrection. When
neither Belcorra nor Chafkhem was present, they
activated a deadly trap to protect the hall from
intruders. The severed limbs here once belonged to
seugathis, skulks, and several ﬂeshwarped creatures
who tried and failed to contend with the trap over the
past several years.
The jagged halls contain several blocks of one-way
transparent stone offering a view into the gladiators’
quarters. The stone appears opaque from within the
rooms and can’t be detected. Anyone touching a
transparent stone from this side can hear in the room
through a permanent clairaudience effect.
The two secret doors in this branching hall (leading
to areas E14 and E24) are obvious from this side.
Hazard: Originally intended to keep intruders out
of the secret hall, a scythe trap currently interferes
with the seugathis’ efforts to explore this area.
The 15-foot-by-25-foot area where the branching
hallways connect contains dozens of pressure plates
that trigger the trap when someone moves anywhere
in the area.
None of the three narrow halls have any pressure
plates, though the blades pass through them. The
trap lashes out with its blades, then retracts them
and moves them around secretly so the blades’ next
Strikes are hard to predict.

SHUFFLING SCYTHE BLADES
HAZARD 8
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC +18 (expert)
Description Six long blades, hidden in grooves in the walls
and ﬂoor, zigzag through diﬀerent parts of this hallway
when any pressure plate in the hallway intersection is
depressed; there are so many plates it’s impossible to avoid
them when moving through the room. The blades retreat
into the ﬂoor and move through the hidden grooves before
swinging out from the wall again in a diﬀerent location.
Disable DC 26 Thievery (expert) to disable each blade, or
utter the magical passphrase (which only Chafkhem
knows) to deactivate the trap for 10 minutes
AC 27; Fort +19, Ref +13
Scythe Blade Hardness 16, Scythe Blade HP 30 (BT 15);
Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Dicing Scythes Ǻȓ Trigger A creature steps in the 15-foot-
by-25-foot area where the branching hallways connect;
Eﬀect The trap uses Scythe Shuﬄe; each blade makes a
scythe Strike against each creature in its region, then it
uses Scythe Shuﬄe again. The trap then rolls for initiative.
Scythe Shuﬄe Ȱɵ The blades travel erratically throughout
the hallway’s branches, out of sight under the ﬂoors or
behind the walls. For each blade, roll 1d4 to determine the
region in which it next makes scythe Strikes. A creature
can Seek (DC 22) to learn clues about blades in the region
they’re currently occupying. On a success, the creature
knows how many blades are currently in its region.
1. Main intersection (the 15-foot-by-25-foot area where
the hallways connect, as marked on area E20)
2. North branch (from the main intersection to the secret
door to area E14)
3. Central hall (from the main intersection to the secret
door to area E24)
4. South branch (from the main intersection to the wall
shared with area E25)
Routine (7 actions) The trap spends 1 action for each of
its blades; a blade makes a scythe Strike against each
creature in its region. With its ﬁnal action, the trap uses
Scythe Shuﬄe. Reduce the number of actions the trap
can take by 1 for each destroyed blade.
Melee Ȱɵ scythe +20 (deadly 1d12), Damage 1d12+8
slashing; no multiple attack penalty
Reset The trap resets when no creatures remain in area
E20. Damaged or destroyed blades aren’t repaired when
the trap resets.
E21. STAGING AREA
Large, dark discolored patches of dried ﬂuids adorn the ﬂoor
of this oddly shaped chamber. A stone desk stands against
the west wall and holds tools, bottles, and jars of a variety
of substances.
Here, Belcorra’s agents kept notes about the
gladiators they spied upon. Recently, Jafaki’s
minions have spent time and resources trying to
disable the scythe trap in the hallway to the north,
and they stage their attempts here. Parchment
marked with tick marks indicates how the blades
shufﬂe around the hallway when triggered. The
seugathis have sought a pattern in the randomness
without any luck.
The doorway to the southeast opens to a cramped
and steep staircase, which leads down to the
observation gallery (area F8).
Treasure:
The
heroes
can
ﬁnd
expanded
alchemist’s tools and three moderate tanglefoot
bags on the table.
E22. SLUDGE-FILLED ROOM
MODERATE 5
Several feet of thick, black sludge ﬁll this room. The
sludge is a creature, but that’s not obvious upon a
casual look (such as viewing the room through the
one-way stone in area E20). Several weeks ago, Jafaki
caught one of Urevian’s devils poking around, lured
them into this chamber, and sent in an alchemically
modiﬁed black pudding. The ooze killed the devil and
dissolved them completely.
Creature: If disturbed, the black pudding rouses
from its torpor to feed, pursuing prey relentlessly.
VISCOUS BLACK PUDDING
CREATURE 7
Variant black pudding (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 255)
Initiative Perception +9
Adjust Shape Ȳ˓ A viscous black pudding is thicker than
most black puddings and can heap its body upon itself
or spread itself out again. The pudding changes its size
to Medium, Large, or Huge. If the pudding is Medium,
its density reduces its Speeds to 10 feet, but this ability
doesn’t otherwise change its Strikes or its Speed. If the
viscous black pudding Splits, both of the new puddings
have the same size as it had at that time, until they
Adjust their Shape.
E23. EMPTY GLADIATORS’ QUARTERS
These chambers include nothing more than a single
bed, an empty footlocker, and a metal chamber pot.
Anything of value was stripped long ago, and each
room has signs of being used as a prison.
A metal bolt was once mounted on each door’s
interior side for privacy, but some time ago, each
of the bolts was relocated to the exterior to keep
creatures trapped inside. This remounting has
somewhat loosened the bolts, however, and a
character who succeeds at a DC 20 Thievery check
can open a bolted door from the inside.

E24. HALL OF HEROES
A giant mural wraps around this entire chamber; this
mural depicts mutated and ﬂeshwarped warriors,
grotesque and powerful, standing in a round room within
a beam of eerie blue light. The blue light originates from
a tall lighthouse, and the inhuman champions spring
forth from the light to slaughter humans, elves, and other
surface-dwelling creatures.
The mural portrays how the arena’s greatest warriors
would be sent into battle by Gauntlight’s magic. The
display was intended to spur the gladiators to ﬁght more
fervently, which could have earned them the right to
battle on the surface in Belcorra’s name. The heroes likely
remember this function of Gauntlight from the artifact’s
recent test ﬁring that awakened Otari’s dead and sent a
scalathrax into the heroes’ midst in Chapter 2.
A hero Searching this room discovers a secret door in
the west wall that leads to area E20 with a successful DC
20 Perception check. Poking two buttons in the eyes of
a powerfully mutated ogre shown in the mural causes a
section of the wall to slide upward into the ceiling.
E25. GLADIATORS’ MEAD HALL
MODERATE 5
Overturned tables and benches, all made of petriﬁed wood,
lie scattered around the edges of this expansive chamber.
Pale bones are interspersed with these furnishings. Several
preserved monster heads and silver plaques adorn the
walls. A glowing circle of runes is etched on the ﬂoor of an
alcove to the east.
Belcorra’s gladiators spent their leisure time in this
room. The preserved monster heads display creatures
killed for sport, including a basilisk, a chimera, and
three manticores. The plaques commemorate victories
in the arena; many bear dates, and all occurred within
a 10-year period from 4235 ar to 4244 ar. The sturdy
furniture, though upended, remains intact.
The door to the south leads to a very steep staircase
descending to the testing grounds (area F9). Rarely did
anyone descend these stairs, though losers from the
ﬁghts below ascended them.
The circle of runes marks a permanent, active
teleportation circle that connects to the circle in the
testing grounds directly beneath it. This teleportation
circle functions both ways but doesn’t connect to the
portal chamber network throughout the Abomination
Vaults. A creature stepping into the teleportation circle
appears in the training grounds amid a blast of pale
blue ﬁre and a loud clanging noise (the ﬁre is principally
for dramatic effect and isn’t bright or hot enough to
cause damage). Anyone using the teleportation circle
to travel to the testing grounds appears with a sigil on
their forehead that reads “challenger” in Aklo. Anyone
using the teleportation circle to return here receives a
sigil that reads “victor” instead. A new casting of sigil
by the teleportation circle replaces any old one.
Creature: The scattered bones of gladiators,
slaughtered here shortly after Belcorra’s fall, still
hold on to the grim memory of death and combat.
When a living creature approaches, they rattle and
slide across the room, forming a massive gladiator
made from the assorted bones of several
humanoids. It tries to pursue
foes that ﬂee, but it can’t ﬁt
through any of the doors leading
out of this room, which allows
others to escape it fairly easily. It
ﬁghts until destroyed.

E26. ARENA BALCONY
This section represents only the top half of a massive
arena. The arena ﬂoor (area F26) holds the majority of
the threat here.
A wide walkway around this cavernous chamber looks out
over a stone arena ﬂoor thirty feet below. Six balconies
with built-in seating provide the best view. Each balcony
has a bright torch jutting from it, illuminating the
entire arena while leaving this viewing level shrouded
in shadows. An enormous metal gong on the eastern
end of the chamber hangs on thick chains. Two steep
staircases lead down from the central balcony on the
north side of the arena ﬂoor.
Belcorra and her guests watched the blood
sports from sumptuous seating here, cheering
on the gladiators as they faced off against each
other or against terrifying monsters. The north central
balcony has two large levers and crank wheels to
control each of the portcullises at the bottom of the
stairs that lead to the arena ﬂoor. Anyone exploring
this balcony likely draws the attention of the basilisks
lairing nearby in the grand concourse (area E10).
The heroes can easily see the gargantuan shanrigol
behemoth on the arena ﬂoor from here. Unless
they make an absurd amount of noise or attack the
shanrigol, it remains dormant (probably for the best if
the heroes are still only 5th level).
A secret door on the eastern balcony is difﬁcult to
spot. A character who succeeds at a DC 25 Perception
check locates it, and they also determine the special
series of knocks that turns the door ghostly and
incorporeal, allowing the heroes to pass through.
Treasure: The six torches burning at the balconies
are all everburning torches and take a minimal amount
of effort to remove.

CHAPTER 6:
Experiments in Flesh
Under Belcorra, the Abomination Vault’s sixth level
was split between support for the arena above and the
laboratories that created new and terrible monsters.
The two activities weren’t all that separate since
the most powerful of the monsters created in the
laboratories fought in the arena, where the survivors
joined Belcorra’s growing ranks of monsters to assault
Absalom. Conversely, failures in the arena became
fodder for further experiments in the laboratories.
When Belcorra died, the overbearing control of a
bone devil named Tarkannah initially kept inﬁghting
on this level at a minimum, but many creatures chafed
at Tarkannah’s control. The seugathi ﬂeshwarper
Jafaki organized a coup and murdered the bone devil,
taking control of the entire ﬂoor. Since this rebellion,
Jafaki has maintained the level as the seugathis’
domain, believing their resources are better spent
on the relentless reﬁning of experiments rather than
expanding territory.
Due to Jafaki’s relatively relaxed disposition toward
administration, creatures on this level tend to look
after themselves. Many are more recent arrivals who
have come seeking the seugathis’ skills and are willing
to risk experimentation for the chance of becoming
stronger. Creatures who haven’t been slated for
ﬂeshwarping yet spend most of their time drinking
and relaxing in a large, central chamber that has
long served as a tavern called the Warped Brew. The
urdefhan Vischari manages the Warped Brew, keeping
cooks, bartenders, and even a band on retainer.
Laboratories Features
This level feels more cramped than the lofty arena
level above because of its lower ceilings, which average
10 feet high in halls and 15 feet high in rooms, unless
otherwise indicated. None of the rooms on this level
have light, as the denizens can all see in the dark.
The stone doors throughout this level have sturdy
iron hinges; most can be simply pushed open, which
the seugathi do to move around. The smell of acrid
chemicals lingers throughout this level, except near the
Warped Brew Tavern (area F11), where the smell of
spilled fungus beer replaces it instead.
The map for this level appears on page 106.
