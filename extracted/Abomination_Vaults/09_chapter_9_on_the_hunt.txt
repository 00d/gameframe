Content Warning
While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathﬁnder action
and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism,
body horror, and human experimentation. Before you
begin, understand that player consent (including that of the
Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for
everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning
and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.
