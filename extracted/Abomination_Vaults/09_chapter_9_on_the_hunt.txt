CHAPTER 9:
On the Hunt
As any explorer of the Darklands can tell you, the
farther you descend, the wilder and stranger things
become. As Belcorra dug the Abomination Vaults
deeper, she found an extensive system of caverns.
Unlike the self-contained Farm level, these caverns
were truly wild. At ﬁrst, she fought against the ﬁerce
denizens and tried to close off the passages to deeper
places, but the task was futile. She dubbed the place
the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save
for building alliances with the communities there.
Belcorra established only a few strongholds in the
area, including a lodge, a vault, and the entrance to the
Gate of Nhimbaloth, the subterranean temple holding
the Empty Vault and the source of Gauntlight’s power.
The Urdefhan Cult
Urdefhans are vampire-like humanoids who largely
pursue lives of violence and slaughter. As brutal killers
obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the
urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves
to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds
were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for
her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming
attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer
called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened.
Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard
of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the
Emerald Fulcrum Lens to the war champion as a token
of her favor until then. Generations passed, and the
war champions passed down the fulcrum lens as their
symbol of leadership.
Drow Allegiance
With the deep gnomes cowed and the urdefhans awed
by her power, Belcorra next turned to the drow of
the Hunting Grounds. From their secure stronghold
of Yldaris, the drow ranged through the caverns like
deadly apparitions, retreating in the face of signiﬁcant
danger. Belcorra knew that she must trap the drow into
an alliance, so she captured and imprisoned more and
more of their hunters until Yldaris’s leader agreed to
meet with her. She traded the captives for a promise that
the drow would keep the Ochre Fulcrum Lens safe and
provide aid in her attack on the surface.

Belcorra’s Return
When Belcorra arose as a ghost, she visited the Hunting
Grounds ﬁrst. She checked her treasure vault to ensure
its most important contents remained secure and then
sent the vault’s graveknight guardian to retrieve the
valuable books she’d left on an upper level. She next
visited the urdefhans, who still told vague legends of
the quasi-mythical sorcerer. Their new war champion,
Khurfel, carried the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and agreed
to follow their Ghost Queen to raze the surface world.
The urdefhans have since stepped up their summoning
of daemon allies, preparing for the pending assault.
Belcorra’s visit to the drow of Yldaris went less well.
Quara Orshendiel, the granddaughter of the leader
from whom Belcorra extracted a promise to serve, had
little idea who Belcorra was. Still, Belcorra nevertheless
accepted Quara’s hastily-given (and not entirely
genuine) renewal of her grandfather’s promise.
Hunting Grounds Features
The numerous interconnecting caverns in the Hunting
Grounds are dark, but glowing fungus illuminates
enough areas to provide a sense of the caverns’ great
size. Ceiling height varies widely: large caverns are 40
feet high, smaller caverns are 20 feet high, and areas
worked for humanoid habitation—such as Yldaris, the
calignis’ lodge, and the Gate of Nhimbaloth—are 12
feet high. Doors in most areas are made of stone or
sturdy fungal wood. Entrances to inhabited areas are
often thicker or otherwise reinforced for defense.
The map of this level appears on page 166.
I1. GUARDED INTERSECTION
TRIVIAL 9
The passage upward to the Farm level is fairly secure,
but the cautious drow keep a guard here regardless.
Creatures: A surly drow hunter named Rikizlia sits
here on a stool, carving a bit of fungus wood with a
small carving knife. If the heroes arrive without escort,
she speeds toward area I2 for help. If other drow
accompany the heroes, she watches them with open
curiosity but doesn’t stop her whittling.

I2. CARAVAN STAGING
MODERATE 9
Several bags, barrels, and crates line the walls between
this cavern’s three exits.
Caravans going between Yldaris and Lozardyn load
and unload in this cave. It isn’t always busy, as the
caravans are on an erratic schedule, but usually at least
a few drow linger here. The passage east leads to a
network of twisting Darklands caverns.
Creatures: When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, six drow
are unloading cargo from a large, harnessed pack
lizard. If the heroes are under guard, or have otherwise
gained the trust of Yldaris, the drow don’t confront
or question them; otherwise, they mobilize a quick
defense. A warden takes 2 Interact actions to unhitch
a riding lizard to ﬁght alongside it. When combat
starts, one of the hunters races to area I3 to rally the
creatures there to join the attack. Drow who are badly
outnumbered or injured ﬂee into the caverns to the
east and don’t return for a few days.

This cavern contains pens for half a dozen giant lizards. A
jumbled pile of harnesses sits near the corrals.
Creatures: Three drow wardens are usually here,
guarding and feeding Yldaris’s riding lizards. The
lizards can climb out of the pens along the walls, but
they don’t do so unless directed to ﬁght.

Yldaris hunters use to come and go from the caverns.

Characters who Search this dead end can discover the secret door with a
successful DC 26 Perception check. Any character who is Detecting Magic
or is an expert in Survival automatically ﬁnds it, as the secret door is magical
in nature, and there are several subtle tracks leading right to it.
The rubble swings aside when an invisible magical wall panel is touched
by someone speaking any words in Elven. Magic reinforces the secret door,
so it’s impossible to break through.
I5. YLDARIS ENTRY
TRIVIAL 9
Iron sheets cover the outside of the western door, with a slot at drow eye
level covered by a sliding plate on the inside. The door has no keyhole or
handle and is reinforced by heavy bars. Anyone seeking entrance must
either burst through the door (Hardness 15, Hit Points 60) or supply
the secret knock known to all of the outpost’s drow (which occasionally
changes) and wait for the guard to open it.
The door to the east, leading into Yldaris, uses the same construction, but
it’s normally open and unbarred.
Creature: A drow warden named Taklitur stands guard inside the
door, ready to admit anyone who gives the proper knock. If the warden
hears the wrong knock, he ﬁrst ignores it, thinking another drow is just
misremembering. If the beats persist, or if he realizes someone is trying to
break down the door, he opens the slot to take a shot at anyone on the
other side, shuts it, and raises the alarm.

I6. WATCH CHAMBER
MODERATE 9
A table and chairs sit in the northeast corner of this large room. The walls feature
words carved in a ﬂowing script underscored with hash marks. Of the four doors
leading out of this chamber, the door leading west looks sturdier than the others.
The words on the wall are drow aphorisms in Elven about staying alert
and protecting one’s home. The hash marks record times the drow have
repelled invaders and lived up to these sayings.
Creatures: When the heroes ﬁrst arrive, a drow shootist named Yrorix
and a pair of hunters are playing cards with a drow version of a harrow
fortune-telling deck. In the event of an assault, they knock on the three
doors leading deeper into Yldaris to alert more defenders, but they make
their stand here.
If the heroes are allies of Yldaris, the drow cheerfully invite the heroes
into their game. The stakes aren’t high, and the drow cheat relentlessly, but
it might be an enjoyable way for the heroes to pass the time.
If the heroes rescued the drow rogue Falxi Orshendiel from area F12,
he’s also here gambling. Falxi is well-regarded because he’s a distant
cousin of Yldaris’s leader, but he’s fundamentally lazy. He greets the heroes
warmly and insists to his companions that they can be trusted.

A Peaceful Meeting: If any drow led the heroes to
meet with Quara, they stop here and ask the heroes to
leave their weapons for the duration of that meeting.
Falxi (or, in his absence, Yrorix) promises to watch over
their gear personally. As it’s forbidden to bring armed
strangers before their leader, the drow don’t negotiate
this point. If the heroes balk, the drow usher them out
and invite them to return if they change their minds.
Treasure: The deck of harrow cards is well worn
but features unusual drow iconography. It’s worth 15
gp. Stacks of wagers worth 24 sp sit around the table.
I7. TANIETH’S ABODE
TRIVIAL 9
This small room has a bed and table next to it. A ceramic
mug and a modiﬁed hand crossbow sit next to the bed.
This is the sleeping quarters for a solitary shootist
named Tanieth. Tanieth is a loner; when he isn’t resting
here, tinkering with his repeating hand crossbow
with parts from another, inoperable repeating hand
crossbow, he’s ranging the Hunting Grounds alone.
His good looks and remote demeanor make him
something of a heartthrob among some Yldaris drow.
Creatures: Tanieth doesn’t like being disturbed. He
tends to shoot ﬁrst and ask questions later, even if it’s
another drow who bothers him.
TANIETH
CREATURE 8

Treasure: Tanieth has hidden several treasures
under his mattress, including a small sack with 50 gp
and three opals worth 100 gp each.
I8. HUNTERS’ MESS
Tables, chairs, dirty dishes, empty bottles, and utensils
litter this chamber. It’s evident that creatures eat their
meals here but very rarely clean up afterwards.
Yldaris’s hunters are skilled at their craft and keep
their equipment in good working order but tend to be
slobs in their day-to-day living. They usually avoid this
place unless they’re eating.
I9. HUNTERS’ QUARTERS
LOW 9
The ﬁve bunk beds in this area are a mess of blankets
and furs. A trio of locker boxes is stacked at the foot of
each bunk.
While not in the total disarray of the adjacent
mess hall, this room is remarkably untidy.
The beds are unassigned; hunters simply grab
a bunk when they can. Unlike the beds, each
padlocked locker box belongs to a speciﬁc hunter.
Each padlock requires ﬁve successful DC 30 Thievery
checks to unlock or a single DC 30 Athletics check
to Force Open. Most hunters carry their keys
on their person.
Creatures: At least three hunters are
usually resting here. They’re quick to rouse
and confront danger.

I10. TARGET PRACTICE
LOW 9
A cluster of stools takes up one corner of this room, but
most of it’s empty space with several reed-stuﬀed dummies
dangling from the ceiling on the south wall. The dummies are
full of holes, a few bolts still lodged in them.
The shootists engage in close-range target practice
here. A secret door conceals a storage closet to the
west; a hero who Searches the room and succeeds at a
DC 25 Perception check locates it. One of the hooks
for hanging dummies, when pulled, causes the door to
slide open. The closet holds discarded dummies and
some atrocious fungus wine.
Creatures: There are typically a pair of shootists
practicing here. Fiercely competitive, they ignore any
sounds outside this room, as they’re so focused.

I11. SHOOTISTS’ QUARTERS

Four bunk beds are crammed into this room. In front of
each sits a trio of sturdy, padlocked boxes.
The shootists tend to be much more orderly than the
hunters, but this is still a communal space. Shootists
come and go when they aren’t doing other tasks in
and outside of Yldaris and sleep where they’d like. The
lockboxes are similar to those in area I9.
Creatures: There are typically a pair of shootists
resting here at any given time. They’re quick to
respond to any alarm or sounds of trouble.
DROW SHOOTISTS (2)

Treasure: Each locked box has personal items, 3d10

I12. WARDEN BARRACKS
TRIVIAL 9
This room contains a pair of bunks and a low table.
Like the hunters and the shootists, drow wardens
dwell in these barracks. The more regimented wardens
insist on assigned bunks, but they don’t have lockboxes
and thus keep their valuables with them and their
personal items tucked inside their blankets.
Creatures: There’s typically at least one warden
resting in each room. When any are in danger, they
call out for the others, who quickly come out of
their rooms. Encountering these wardens together
constitutes a Trivial challenge for 9th-level characters
(if Salaisa Malthulas is present in area I14, she joins
the ﬁght, making this a severe challenge).

I13. OVERFLOW LODGING
This room contains a pair of bunks, each with a carefully
folded bedroll atop the mattress. At the foot of each sits a
pair of strongboxes with padlocks and keys.
As with any border outpost, Yldaris’s population
waxes and wanes with caravans coming and going at
any given time. These rooms are set aside for visitors,
and Quara offers them to the heroes. The empty locker
boxes and padlocks are like those in area I9.
I14. MASTER WARDEN’S QUARTERS	 MODERATE 9
Master Warden Salaisa Malthulas keeps the door to
her bedroom locked and carries the only key. It requires
ﬁve successful DC 30 Thievery checks to unlock or a
single DC 33 Athletics check to Force Open.
This room is tidy and clean. It contains a bed, a small desk,
and a large trunk.
Yldaris drow all look to Salaisa for leadership when
Quara isn’t around. If something happens to Quara,
Salaisa becomes Yldaris’s next leader.
The desk contains extensive notes about the wardens
of Yldaris: their names, schedules, personal quirks,
and other evidence that Salaisa is watching them all
very closely. The trunk contains only personal items.
Creatures: Salaisa is continuously on the move and
rarely uses her room for anything but sleep. The heroes
might encounter Salaisa anywhere in or near Yldaris. She
isn’t nearly as friendly with the heroes as Quara is, and
she’s concerned that having unknown surface dwellers in
Yldaris puts the whole community at risk.
In a ﬁght, Salaisa quickly seeks aid from any nearby
drow. She’s reluctant to let opponents ﬂee because she

BEFRIENDING THE DROW
If the heroes dealt peacefully with the drow and
earned an audience with Quara, wary drow wardens
escort them here and ask them to wait. Various staff
bring in chairs from the common area (area I15) and
food and fungus wine from the kitchen (area I16).
The wardens are curious and talkative, as they have
little experience with surface-dwellers, but they avoid
conversation that sounds like an interrogation—
that’s Quara’s prerogative. If the heroes are reticent
or rude, the drow simply wait in silence. If the heroes
unwisely attack, the wardens call for backup.
Before long, Quara arrives to greet the heroes,
radiating calm command and curiosity. She’s joined by
the stern-looking Salaisa Malthulas, commander of the
outpost’s wardens, and the strange twin drow cavern
seers, Bhazrade and Klathor, who remain quietly at a
distance. Quara does the talking.
“You have the look of surface dwellers. I’ve never met any
of your kind, but I’ve seen artwork. Strange, you are not
nearly as ugly as our art makes you out to be. I am Quara
Orshendiel, leader of this outpost. Let’s ﬁgure out whether
or not we can help one another.”
If the heroes rescued Falxi, Quara adds her thanks
for rescuing her cousin from “one of the scrapes he
keeps getting himself into.”
Quara is sincere in her words and her goals. The
seers foretold that surface dwellers would come as
potential allies, and Quara wants to believe it.
Quara invites the heroes to tell their story. She
sympathizes with hardships, laughs at humorous
parts, and asks questions when she doesn’t understand
something. If the heroes mention the fulcrum lenses
or show her one, she takes an obvious interest. Quara
overlooks petty slights or rudeness, but she chastises
any overt aggression calmly—once. Her patience isn’t
inﬁnite, and overly obnoxious heroes are asked to
leave Yldaris and not return.
At the end of the conversation, Quara says, “You’ve
given me some things to think about. Thank you.” She
then invites the heroes to stay in the overﬂow lodging
(area I13) until she makes up her mind. Quara spends
a few hours thinking, then gambles on an alliance.
She calls the heroes back into this room, either a
few hours later or the next time they return to Yldaris.
Bhazrade and Klathor are, as before, lurking at the
edges of the room. Quara explains the following.
“I believe you’ve been truthful with me, so I’m going to be
truthful with you. Yldaris only exists at Belcorra’s pleasure.
It was here when she ﬁrst created her vast dungeons; at the
time, my grandfather was its leader. Belcorra made allies of
several groups, including drow, urdefhans to the west, and
the deep gnomes above, who have embraced undeath. To
each, she gave a large magical lens with strange powers.
For safekeeping, I believe. Ours was the Ochre Fulcrum
Lens, and it could manipulate emotions.
“But there was more to the lens. My grandfather told
my father, Larathols, who became Yldaris’s leader after
him. But my father never told me.” Quara sighs. “I was
never meant to lead. My older sister was to succeed my
father. They both embarked on a secret expedition a few
years ago. On an island in the great lake, the urdefhan
warlord Khurfel caught and killed them. Their expedition
had something to do with the lens, I believe, and I suspect
my father had it with him. Perhaps he hid it someplace;
perhaps Khurfel took it. I don’t know.
“Belcorra came to me as a ghost shortly afterward.
She insisted I swear Yldaris’s support and aid in a surface
invasion that drives her even in death. For the good of
DROW AID
Gaining the drow’s trust is a tremendous boon to the
heroes’ mission in the Hunting Grounds and beyond.
Not only do they gain a safe place to rest, but they
can also use the outpost’s forge and workspace
(area I17) to repair or even craft items. Furthermore,
traders can sell them any common items up to 7th
level including alchemical items, gear, and weapons
from the Adventure Toolbox. Items they don’t have
on hand require a week or so to fetch from Lozardyn.
Lastly, heroes who learn from Yldaris’s shootists
gain access to the drow shootist archetype (page 227).

Yldaris, I renewed the vows my grandfather made. But I’ve
never felt bound by mere words. I won’t help her. I’ll help
you. You’re welcome in Yldaris as long as you’d like.”
The heroes can ask Quara more questions if they’d
like, but she knows little else. Before the conversation
winds down, however, Bhazrade and Klathor speak.
“There is more…” one of the twins says. They move their
mouths in unison, making it hard to tell which is speaking.
“…you should know,” the other drow continues.
This plainly piques Quara’s interest, and she motions for
the brothers to go on.
“The ochre lens lies in a dark and wet place. Khurfel didn’t
claim it. Larathols dropped it in the water to deny it to his
enemy. He died attempting to learn more of its purpose,
more than the partial truth we know,” one twin speaks.
“We have seen in a vision that the stones both empower
the Ghost Queen and hold the key to her demise. They are
slivers of something ancient, alien, evil, and hungry,” the
other continues.
“We saw eyes of Empty Death!” they cry in unison.
“She separated the lenses because, together, they draw
the baleful attention of the Empty Death. Even the Ghost
Queen cannot withstand the Empty Death when their
powers are joined within her. The secrets to the lenses are
in the old treasure vault, which overlooks the lake.”
“Find the lenses and the answers Larathols sought.”
The twin seers fall silent again, and Quara looks
back to the heroes. She explains, “I would say you
get used to Bhazrade and Klathor, but one never
does. Let me assure you that when they do
speak, it’s important. This is all news to me, but
when their words beneﬁt Yldaris, and you as well.”
Consulting the Whispering Reeds: The heroes
might have recovered a book of Nhimbaloth’s lore,
called The Whispering Reeds, from higher in the
Abomination Vaults. A hero who consults this tome
ﬁnds references to the fulcrum lenses without a check
to Recall Knowledge and without suffering from
the book’s curse. The Whispering Reeds speaks
of slivers of Nhimbaloth’s essence existing in the
fulcrum lenses, perhaps as a means to contact the
Outer God. The fulcrum lenses possess different and
powerful (but, in the text, unspeciﬁed) abilities. Yet the
fulcrum lenses are dangerous in close proximity, and
even Nhimbaloth’s worshippers fear to bring more
than two or three together. Using their powers draws
Nhimbaloth’s scrutiny and invites destruction.
Side Quest: Finding the fulcrum lenses and using
them against Belcorra is the primary goal of the
Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. But Quara has
a side task that’s personally important to her: she’d
like Khurfel killed and his rhoka sword brought to her
as a trophy. As pragmatic as Quara is, she carries the
common drow vice of vengeance. She emphasizes to
the heroes that Khurfel would never part with the lens
while he draws breath, so defeating him is necessary
in any case.
XP Award: Award the heroes 120 XP for
allying with Quara and the Yldaris drow.

I18. SEERS’ QUARTERS
MODERATE 9
This large room contains only two thin sleeping mats. The
ceiling is painted with patterns resembling constellations.
Bhazrade and Klathor live here. The twins receive
enigmatic divinations by communing with the stone
of the Darklands, focused through the patterns in the
ceiling. They share this wisdom with their allies in
whatever way they believe best beneﬁts Yldaris.
Creatures: When here, the twins are usually
meditating or resting. In a ﬁght, they use their occult
powers to harry and incapacitate foes one at a time.

I19. QUARA’S CHAMBER
Both doors along this hallway are locked, and Quara
carries the keys. Picking a Lock requires ﬁve successful
DC 30 Thievery checks or a successful DC 33 Athletics
check to Force Open. The inner door bears a glyph
of warding containing a 4th-level sound burst (DC
28 basic Reﬂex save; DC 28 to notice and disarm
the glyph). The glyph triggers if the door is opened
without the key.
An unmade bed piled with pelts sits next to a table stacked
with papers and a half-eaten meal on a plate. A chest sits
crookedly in the corner with clothing spilling out of it.
This chamber has always housed Yldaris’s leader;
it was most recently Larathols’s room, and now it’s
Quara’s. This fact sits uneasily with her, as she still
considers the room to be her father’s private space.
The north wall contains a cunning secret door, which
Quara can use to slip into the common area to ﬁnd
reinforcements or escape from trouble. Locating the
secret door requires a successful DC 30 Perception check,
and opening it involves pushing the correct sequence of
hidden wall panels to cause the wall to slide outward.
Treasure: Within the open chest, amid personal
items and changes of clothes, is a small iron box
containing 50 gp, a gold and opal bracelet worth 75
gp, and 5 tiny diamonds worth 30 gp each. The chest
also contains two black cloaks of elvenkind and two
pairs of boots of elvenkind. Quara loans these items to
her people during particularly sensitive missions in the
Hunting Grounds. She might loan them to heroes on
especially good terms with her.
I20. MEDITATION CAVE
This massive cavern is stunning. Among its gray stones cut
veins and growths of crystals in lustrous shades of pearl
white, dark purple, glimmering blue, and brilliant scarlet.
At the center of the chamber waits a shallow pool, its
bottom and sides made of the same glittering crystals.
This chamber is the closest thing that the outpost
has to a temple, though few Yldaris drow are religious.
Bhazrade and Klathor perform their rituals here.
I21. LODGE ENTRY
This large stone structure is ﬂanked on one side by the
massive Gauntlight footprint to the north and on the
other by the enormous iron ladder descending from
the chasm in the Farm level. Belcorra built this lodge
so those hunting in the wild caverns could relax in
relative safety. In the earliest days, urdefhans, drow, and

various mercenary hunters all used the lodge in a series
of uneasy truces enforced by Belcorra and her Children.
These fragile truces fell apart when Belcorra died, and
the lodge has changed hands several times since then.
The calignis currently holed up within are insular and
reclusive. They only rarely leave to hunt, as their leader
Galudu takes care of most of their needs. The heroes’
best way to meet them peacefully is to speak with Dulac
in the shrine (area H8). Otherwise, the calignis view
anyone barging in here as a threat, and the heroes must
be especially diplomatic to placate them.
The door had a massive lock, but it was smashed
long ago. Now, the calignis bar the door from the
inside. It can’t be Forced Open, but it can be destroyed
(Hardness 15, Hit Points 60). It’s also protected by the
glyph described below.
Glyph of Warding: Galudu placed a glyph of warding
on this door that affects any non-caligni who touches
it. It contains a 5th-level lightning bolt (DC 26 basic
Reﬂex save; DC 26 to notice and disarm the glyph).
I22. GREAT HALL
SEVERE 9
This large hall was once grand and impressive. Now the
walls’ murals are chipped and stained, the ﬂoor is covered
with mud, and the few pieces of furniture look like they’ve
been hastily repaired many times. A ﬁre pit sits at the
center of the chamber.
Once a lively meeting place and
banquet hall for hunters, the
area now serves as an outpost
where caligni refugees keep a
careful watch for intruders. The two smaller
doors of the area are unlocked, but the large double
door to the west is barred from this side.
Creatures: Three calignis try to contain intruders
and keep them from penetrating any deeper into the
lodge. If possible, a defender moves to the smaller
doors and knocks on them, alerting the other
calignis to an attack. This brings the calignis in area
I23; together, this makes up a Severe encounter for
9th‑level characters. If Custodian Dulac accompanies
the heroes, the calignis grudgingly point her toward
area I25 to speak with Galudu.

This room is ﬁlthy and smells stale. Rags and tattered rugs

This sleeping chamber is dimly lit, as the cracks
around the door to area I24 glow.
Creatures: The two calignis resting here respond to
commotion in the great hall. If outclassed, a defender
opens the door to area I24 to set the undead free.

MODERATE 9
If the heroes examine the glow in the door’s cracks, it
shifts as if the light source within is moving around.
A stack of dusty urns is heaped against the east wall of this
small room. Each is covered with jagged runes.
The caligni keep out of this room due to its strange
occupants, a pair of rare undead calignis called bright
walkers. Only Galudu regularly comes here to speak
with them; the other calignis only open the door if
they need serious and immediate aid.
The urns are left over from when this place was a
lodge for hunters. There are 11 urns in total, each 3
feet tall. They were used to magically preserve creature
parts taken as trophies, but their magic expired long
ago. Four urns contain shriveled claws or bones.
Creatures: The two bright walkers pace restlessly
in this room, but Galudu does her best to keep them
grounded and calm. When they see non-calignis,
they assume the lodge is under attack and ﬁght until
destroyed, or until Galudu calls them off.

Piles of broken furniture, rags, and other rubbish litter this

Galudu sometimes meets with others here, rather
than in her private chamber to the south. If the heroes
are with Custodian Dulac, Dulac asks them to wait
here while she privately informs Galudu about them.
I26. GALUDU’S ROOM
MODERATE 9
A large bay window of transparent stone overlooks
the wilderness outside the lodge, but it’s so covered in
grime that it’s diﬃcult to see through with any clarity. A
makeshift table has been erected near the center of the
room, and a sleeping mat is rolled up to one side of it.
Creatures: Galudu spends most of her time here.
She isn’t only the leader of the calignis but their chief
provider, feeding them with conjured food and water
when hunters return empty-handed—or not at all.
If the heroes fought their way through the lodge,
Galudu uses her spells to drive them off. With nowhere
else to go, she ﬁghts to the death.
If Custodian Dulac led the heroes here, Galudu is
wary but welcoming; if the heroes aided Dulac and her
band of foolish cultists, they might be able to help her
as well. She listens to the heroes but quickly introduces
the topic of her side quest on page 179.

Side Quest: Galudu explains that the calignis here
are all refugees, ﬂeeing from some calamity deeper in
the Darklands that she doesn’t explain. Several calignis
died before they made it safely to this lodge; only the
strongest now remain. She quickly glosses over the
schism that led to Dulac occupying the upper levels
as Cult of Urthagul; Galudu considers Dulac and her
cult to be simpletons clinging at misplaced hope and
doesn’t care about their fate. She’s more interested in
ﬁnding a safe exit for herself and her caligni defenders;
the cultists are welcome to come along if they don’t
slow Galudu down.
Galudu explains that there are two ways to leave,
but both are blocked by powerful monsters: a daemon
to the south (area I31) and a dragon to the west (area
I51). Furthermore, hunting bands of urdefhans can—
and have—whittled down the calignis’ numbers. If the
heroes agree to eliminate either monster (or, better yet,
have already done so) and escort the calignis there,
Galudu gives them her magic wand as payment.
Galudu doesn’t know that area I42 also leads out of
the Hunting Grounds, but she’s happy to take that
passage if the heroes clear the way. The heroes are
on their own to defeat the creature they choose and
can come back to escort the calignis. As the defenders
in area I22 don’t let them in through area I21, they’ll
have to return to the Farm level and descend through
the shrine to return to Galudu.
URDEFHAN ATTACK
SEVERE 9
If the heroes accept the side quest, the journey isn’t
without incident. Urdefhan death scouts are waiting
for the calignis to come into the open. The denizens of
areas I35 and I36 come together to assault the group.

This is a Severe encounter for 9th-level characters,
but they have the calignis on their side.
I27. LADDER BASE
LOW 9
A large, iron ladder stretches upward into the darkness. Its
chains and rods are cracked and ﬂaked with rust.
This ladder leads over 100 feet up to area H34.
Creatures: Four ceustodaemons prowl amid the
rubble and fungus at the ladder’s base. They’re so
eager for violence that they ﬁght anyone they see to
the death.
CEUSTODAEMONS (4)
CREATURE 6
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 71
Initiative Perception +14
I28. CENTRAL PIT
A ribbon of twisting light extends from a circular hole in the
ceiling to a matching hole in the ﬂoor. The stone near the
light looks pockmarked and infected. The rounded walls are
decorated with snarling stone heads of fearsome monsters.
Gauntlight’s interior can’t be reached from this level;
the only access is from 100 feet above (area H37) or
100 feet below (area J20). A living creature that ends
its turn within the 5-foot-diameter ribbon of light takes
9d6 negative damage (DC 24 basic Reﬂex save). The
stone heads are simply decor that Belcorra liked; they
constitute a checklist of sorts for aberrations. They
include chuuls, ﬂeshwarps, gugs, and other monsters
the heroes have likely already encountered. They aren’t
made of the same invulnerable stone as Gauntlight and
thus can be removed or destroyed normally.
I29. BOATHOUSE
MODERATE 9
This squat stone building, only eight feet high, hugs the
shore. Two wooden docks jut from the building into the dark
waters of the massive underground lake. The doors are caked
with mold and lichen, as if they haven’t been opened in years.
The Children of Belcorra once tended to this lake as
they did the one above, but the urdefhans routed them
centuries ago. During this rout, the urdefhans drove
Beluthus, a powerful occultist among the Children of
Belcorra, back to this boathouse and locked him in.
Beluthus has remained inside ever since, succumbing
to torpor like many of the other undead gnomes. In
addition to being caked with mold, the doors have
makeshift planks nailed across them on the outside.
The planks are easy to pry off, but doing so is noisy
and alerts Beluthus. Inside, an old but serviceable
rowboat hangs from the ceiling on short chains.
Creatures: Beluthus wakes when anyone pries open
the doors or intrudes into the boathouse. He lashes out
with fury, eager to recover more souls after his long
torpor and rejoin the other Children of Belcorra.

I30. LIZARD RUN
LOW 9
The ceiling of this cavern sports many crystal growths and
stalactites. A pattering drizzle drips from these formations,
and paths wind though thick fungus growing on the ground.
THE CAVERN VAST
Most of the Hunting Grounds is a wilderness of rock
formations, crystal growths, mineral springs, and
vast swaths of towering fungi. Its denizens aren’t
always found in their respective encounter areas.
Every 15 minutes that the heroes spend traversing
the cavern, make a secret DC 5 ﬂat check. On a
success, they face one of the following random
encounters. If the result would be a creature the
heroes have already faced, treat it as no encounter.

The Yldaris drow cultivated this area with a thick,
fast-growing fungus developed by drow mycologists
in distant communities. These mushrooms hide drow
movements and provide the community with a ready
source of food.
Movement in this area is challenging, as the thick
mushrooms conceal stalagmites and crystalline growths
on the ground. For Yldaris drow and their riding lizards,
who know the terrain, the ground is difﬁcult terrain; for
all other creatures, it’s greater difﬁcult terrain.
Creatures: The drow let their riding lizards run free
in this area. The predators of the cavern sometimes
catch and kill an errant lizard, but the drow don’t
mind the loss, as they can study the site of the kill
and learn more information about creatures hunting
near their home. Four riding lizards currently reside
here, all just reaching maturity. As two of their siblings
were recently killed by urdefhans, they’re aggressive to
non‑drow humanoids. A lizard reduced to fewer than
25 Hit Points ﬂees the area.
RIDING LIZARDS (4)
CREATURE 5
Giant frilled lizard (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 229)
Initiative Perception +11
Treasure: While the giant frilled lizards have no
treasure, 87 gp and 120 sp are scattered near the
remains of a spider’s web. A dead drow in the web
wears greater healing gloves and a cloak of elvenkind.
I31. THE BARRENS
SEVERE 9
The fungus growth thins in this cavern, giving way to
barren rock and rubble. Amid the dull gray stone, strange
clouds of thick, grayish-black fog hug the ground.
The Yldaris drow skirt the north stretch of this
cavern when they come this way, knowing of the
dangers that lurk deeper in. The drow call this place
the Barrens; if the heroes have earned their aid, they
warn the heroes of its risks: the fog is deadly, and the
cavern harbors a dangerous monster.
The fog imposes a –2 circumstance penalty to
Perception checks. Everything beyond 10 feet is
concealed, and visibility ends at 30 feet.
A narrow passage leads south to distant, equally
treacherous Darklands caverns outside the scope of
this adventure.
Hazard: The fog’s effects are tied to the daemon’s
miasma. When a non-ﬁend, non-urdefhan creature
ventures halfway into the cavern, the mist solidiﬁes
into life-draining mouths. If the derghodaemon is
killed, this hazard disappears in minutes.

HAZARD 10

Description The fog solidiﬁes into tiny, gnawing creatures

DROW TO THE RESCUE
If the heroes have gained the aid of Yldaris and
indicated they were going against Khurfel, the drow
might have followed at a distance to keep an eye on
them. If the heroes are in over their heads, a group
of two drow hunters and two drow shootists come
to their aid. The drow won’t enter melee if they can
avoid it, but they’re happy to pick oﬀ urdefhans at a
distance. If the heroes have truly shown their worth
to Yldaris, Quara might come to their aid as well.

Creatures: A derghodaemon lurks in the fog at the
south end of the cavern. It keeps an eye on the deeper
Darklands passages to protect the urdefhan hunting
grounds from anything that might come from that way.
It scuttles forth whenever anyone triggers the hazard, or
when it otherwise hears intruders come close.

Fungus grows wild and tall throughout this enormous

the heroes when they ﬁrst enter this area, descending
from the mushroom tops high above. They pursue foes
as best they can and ﬁght until destroyed.

LOW 9
This wide cavern entrance is a disgusting sight. The
walls are splashed with ocher and scarlet images in
a riot of violent and obscene symbols. Stakes around
the entrance hold up skulls and dismembered parts of
strange creatures.
This is the main entrance of the cavern complex
where the urdefhans live. Intelligent creatures in
the Hunting Grounds avoid this place, knowing the
urdefhans ruthlessly protect their territory.
Creatures: Two urdefhan lashers stand guard,
while two death scouts lurk amid the gruesome
displays of skulls and body parts. They’ve been
directed to shout an alarm in the face of powerful
or numerous foes, but they jump eagerly into a
ﬁght as soon as they detect any enemies. If any
three urdefhans are defeated, the survivor suddenly
realizes they should’ve called for help sooner and
ﬂees to area I34 to raise the alarm.

they’re ﬁrst replaced with death scouts and lashers
from area I34, then with a pair of nervous urdefhan
warriors from the same area.
I34. URDEFHAN HORDE
SEVERE 9
This massive cavern holds a jumble of low-lying tents
made of stitched-together pelts and blood-streaked
leather. Most of the tents surround a natural stone
pillar decorated with strange symbols in brown and
red paint, amid skulls tied or spiked to the pillar. Hides
of various creatures cover the entrances to three
caves to the southeast, each with a narrow
wooden door.
Most
urdefhans
in
the
Abomination Vaults dwell in this
enormous cavern. They sleep in small,
cramped tents but spend their time
awake eating, sparring, or working with
their weapons. Other accouterments
to support their camp, such as food
storage and mundane supplies, are in
the tents.
Traversing this war camp to face
Khurfel is difﬁcult. With their craving
for destruction, the urdefhans are
always ready for battle. As they spend so
much time sparring and ﬁghting among
themselves, the denizens of the adjacent
caves (areas I35, I36, and I37) don’t respond to the
sounds of combat here. The heroes might have an
easier time bypassing these forces if they use stealth
or trickery, but keep in mind the daemons here have
a constant see invisibility.
Creatures: Nearly 20 urdefhans can be found here
at almost all times, along with two ceustodaemons
who stoke their bloodlust. About a third of the
urdefhans are sleeping, but they’re quick to grab their
weapons and join in a ﬁght if other urdefhans raise
a hue and cry. All the urdefhans ﬁght with growling
whoops and revel in the battle, even if they’re losing.
If the heroes defeat all the foes here other than
urdefhan warriors, the urdefhan warriors all break
and ﬂee together.
If the heroes retreat from this battle, most of the
urdefhans let them go; 1d6 urdefhan warriors follow,
screaming for the heroes’ blood.
If the urdefhans defeat the heroes, they don’t kill
them, but rather take them alive and hand
them over to the tormentors in area I35,
where they might have a chance to
escape before being sacriﬁced.

This cavern slopes upward to a ﬂat area. A metal box

lid pressed against the wall to prevent it from opening. A
bloody circle surrounded by runes is painted on the ﬂoor.
Dedicated to bringing more daemons into their
midst, the urdefhans use this chamber for vile
KHURFEL ON THE MARCH
If the heroes assault the urdefhan camp and retreat or
escape, Khurfel is active in his retribution. He doesn’t
wait for the heroes to return. Instead, he leads a
lasher, a death scout, and four urdefhan warriors in
the search for them. The next random encounter the
heroes have is an encounter with Khurfel’s war party.
Alternatively, you can have the war party show up
whenever the heroes are traveling outside of Yldaris.

summoning rituals. They currently keep one prisoner
they intend to sacriﬁce: a deep gnome rockwarden
named Calinth Narogblom (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 75).
The unfortunate Calinth came to the Abomination
Vaults searching for evidence that an offshoot of
his people were still living here. He never even met
up with the Children of Belcorra—whose current
state would horrify him—before being captured by
an urdefhan raiding party. They keep Calinth in the
metal box pushed against the wall so he can’t meld
into stone and escape.
Creatures: Three urdefhan tormentors chant and
wail, casting a lengthy summoning ritual with the
assistance of a scarred and cruel blood mage. The
tormentors hope to empower their daemonic pact
ritual to bring in a more powerful daemon; whether
or not they succeed is up to you. All four urdefhans
attack any intruders that interrupt their rite. They ﬁght
to the death.

Side Quest: Calinth carries no gear, but he
nevertheless still wants to ﬁnd out about the deep
gnomes living here. If the heroes show him evidence
of the Children of Belcorra—even their corpses from
past ﬁghts—Calinth is sad but his curiosity is satisﬁed.
If the heroes lead him to one of the exits to the
Darklands, he can make it back to his people. A week
later, Calinth sends them a token of his appreciation:
a jet and opal complete set of the Dark Chase board
game, worth 120 gp. If the heroes told Calinth that
they’re friendly with the Yldaris drow, he sends it by
the caravan route between the outpost and Lozardyn.
Otherwise, he searches the heroes out himself, even
braving the surface world if he must.
I36. THE BLOOD TEMPLE
LOW 9
A raised platform with a bloody altar stands on the east
side of this roughly triangular cavern.
A constant orgy of bloodletting goes on in this
chamber, all part of the strange and gory urdefhan
religion. If interrupted, the participants are anxious to
cover their altar with fresh blood.
Creatures: Two tormentors guide two lashers in the
rites. All of them attack nonbelievers who interfere with
their gruesome rituals and ﬁght to the death.

I37. KHURFEL’S TENT
MODERATE 9
At this cavern’s center sits a single fur-and-skin hovel. A
path to the hovel is ﬂanked with skull-topped spears.
It’s the tradition of this urdefhan cult that the war
champion dwells apart and lives in a home no more
elaborate than that of other urdefhans. The skulls all
belong to rivals that Khurfel defeated to obtain and
maintain his position as war champion. Their teeth are
gone, having been used for the shauth weapons these
urdefhans use (page 226).
Creatures: Once Khurfel notices the heroes, he looks
pleased, his face contorting in a terrifying grin. He calls
out, “We meet on a good day to kill” in Undercommon
as he draws his rhoka sword and strides forward. As
his blood visions foretold his ﬁght with the heroes, he
doesn’t shy away from it, and he neither offers nor
accepts quarter. He keeps the Emerald Fulcrum Lens
on his person at all times, strapped across his back so
it doesn’t get in the way during a ﬁght. He has invested
the lens, so harm spells cast on him heal additional
Hit Points.
Two tormentors advise Khurfel and join any battle
with him. They’re careful not to get in their war
champion’s way, and they use their harm spells to keep
him in the ﬁght. They ﬂee if Khurfel is defeated.

Reinforcements: If the guards
are defeated, they’re replaced by
the ceustodaemons in area I34.
If the daemons are defeated, this
area remains unguarded.
I39. DEADLY LAKEMODERATE 9
The murky waters of this massive lake
shift ominously.
Though not covered with a cloying, sickly mist
like the large lake in the Farm level, this lake is
hundreds of feet deep in its center and harbors
strange aquatic life.
Creatures: A total of six deepwater dhuthorexes
swim in this lake. Two quickly come to investigate any
disturbance in the water. This attack should occur the
ﬁrst time the heroes venture into the lake, but you can
have another pair of dhuthorexes attack during later
excursions if you choose. The dhuthorexes attack
singly or in pairs and are shockingly aggressive; they
pursue foes on land and ﬁght to the death.

I40. CRYSTAL SHORE
The stone along the shore here sprouts large growths of
pale‑green crystals. The crystals hang from the ceiling, climb
up the wall, and reach toward the water in long strands.
While some of these crystals are pointed, they aren’t
hazardous. However, if a creature touches one of
the crystals, it begins to vibrate, which starts a chain
reaction of resonant, ringing sounds among the crystals.
The sound is loud but not unpleasant. The noise piques
the attention of the cauthooj nesting in area I41, which
swims over to investigate.
I41. ISLAND NEST
SEVERE 9
A mix of green crystals and grayish stone make up the
mass of this island. A few patches of fungus grow across
the rocks, with a particularly thick patch near the island’s
eastern shore.
The thick patch is a cauthooj nest
holding two eggs.
Creatures: A cauthooj recently
came to this island to lay its eggs
and stockpile corpses to feed the
hatchlings. When it detects the
heroes, it attacks immediately
to secure a source of food. If
reduced to fewer than 40 Hit
Points, it ﬂees the island and
abandons its eggs. It’s wary of a trap
and doesn’t pursue anyone who ﬂees
into a narrow passage, such as to areas
I38 or I43.
CAUTHOOJ
CREATURE 12
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 55
Initiative Perception +22
Finding the Lens: Quara’s father dropped the
Ochre Fulcrum Lens in the water near the eastern
shore of this island during his battle with Khurfel.
Spells like detect magic locate it easily; otherwise, a
hero Searching the water ﬁnds it with a successful
DC 28 Perception check. If the heroes haven’t already
encountered deepwater dhuthorexes in area I39, those
monsters might harass anyone spending a lot of time
searching this area.
Treasure: The two cauthooj eggs are valuable
to the right buyer, but ﬁnding one can be difﬁcult.
Worliwynn, who runs the Stone Ring Pond just
outside of Otari, has contacts who offer 400 gp or
any common permanent magic item that’s 8th level or
lower for the eggs.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for recovering
the Ochre Fulcrum Lens.
I42. STEEP EXIT
This rubble-ﬁlled passage slopes steeply downward. The
passage’s ceiling undulates as an echoing chitter ﬁlls the air.
The passage leads deeper into the Darklands, but
the going isn’t easy. The steep and rocky decline slopes
downward for 80 feet before reaching a sheer, 300‑foot
drop. Several disused natural passages radiate outward
from its base, but where these passages might lead is
beyond the scope of this adventure.
Hundreds of tiny subterranean bats lair here. They
don’t pose a threat to high-level characters, even with
Ochre Fulcrum Lens

their staggering numbers and tendency to swarm
around the heads of intruders. The bats sometimes
hunt in the Hunting Grounds, or in deeper Darklands
caverns, but are just as often food for larger creatures.
I43. SANCTUARY
A thick growth of fungus blocks this narrow cave entrance.
The harmless fungus can easily be pushed aside. It
conceals an out-of-the-way cavern with a small spring
of fresh water. This cavern makes a perfect place for the
heroes to rest, as wandering monsters ignore it.
I44. DIGGER’S CAVERN
SEVERE 9
A jumble of fungus grows in the center of this roughly
square cave. A large lizard’s corpse lies amid the fungus.
The giant frilled lizard barely escaped the roper
in area I45 but collapsed and died in this harmless
fungus patch.
Creatures: When the heroes examine the lizard or
the fungus, the entire cavern starts to shake as a shuln
chews its way through the north wall. The enormous,
rodent-like shuln scented the dead lizard and was
coming to eat it, but it’s more excited for living prey.
It’s hungry and ﬁghts until slain. It pursues foes that
run away but doesn’t like the water, so it gives up
chasing anyone that ﬂees into the lake.
SHULN
CREATURE 12
Pathﬁnder Bestiary 294
Initiative Perception +20
I45. DEAD ROPER
A rocky depression at the south end of this chamber contains
a thick stalagmite toppled over in a pool of dark ichor.
Upon closer inspection, the stalagmite is a dead roper.
The shuln in area I44 burrowed up from beneath it and
bit off its lower third before deciding its taste was wholly
unpleasant and leaving the rest of the body behind. A
hero who succeeds at a DC 20 Nature or relevant Lore
check realizes that a Huge burrowing beast came up
beneath the roper and bit it, but the burrowing creature’s
tunnel has collapsed behind it and is now impassable.
I46. PUDDING WALLOW
A pool of thick black goo coats a large patch of the ﬂoor
in this cave.
A black pudding stripped most of the fungus in this
room clear before it was defeated by another predator.
Its gooey remains rest in a shallow pit.
I47. CORRUPTED GARDEN
LOW 9
An ancient and crumbling stone bridge stretches across
the water to an island teeming with reeking fungus.
The old stone bridge is still stable enough to traverse
safely, though it’s slick with slime and moist lichen that
make it difﬁcult terrain. The island used to be a tended
garden, but it’s now greater difﬁcult terrain thanks
to the dense, slick fungus. The slime growing on the
fungus emits a terrible smell, but one overwhelmed by
the stench of the island’s denizen.
Creatures: An ofalth dwells on the island. The fungus
and the layer of ﬁlth it grows from fuels the creature’s
Filth Wallow ability. It treats the slime-covered fungus
as difﬁcult terrain rather than greater difﬁcult terrain.
OFALTH

Initiative Perception +18
I48. HORRID CARNAGE
Bones and discarded viscera are strewn across this cavern
as if some horrifying battle recently occurred here. A trail
of the gruesome remains winds to the northeast, up a
narrow tunnel.
The carnage is the result of gogiteth feeding. The
gnashing, nightmarish aberration lairs in area I49, but
it sometimes lurks in the passageway to ambush prey.
When the heroes approach this area, make a secret
DC 15 ﬂat check. On a success, it’s watching from the
passageway and is prepared to strike.
I49. GOGITETH CAVE
SEVERE 9
If the heroes haven’t already defeated the gogiteth
lairing here, as they approach, they hear its clacking
and popping legs as it moves about. Any hero who
succeeds at a DC 30 Occultism check recognizes the
sound as that of a gogiteth.
Creatures: If the gogiteth is here, it’s tearing up an
urdefhan corpse. It drops the dead urdefhan with a
sickening plop to skitter forward and feast upon the
heroes. It doesn’t pursue prey out of areas I48 and I49.

I50. COINS AND SLIME
Hanging streamers of mold dangle from the ceiling here.
Several coins protrude from a shelf of stone to the north.
A traveler left the coins in the wall here long ago,
hoping to keep them safe, though they never returned.
A patch of green slime grew from the streams of mold,
particularly over the coins, where it could fall upon
greedy treasure-seekers, dissolve them, and slither up
the ceiling to await a new victim.
Hazard: The green slime is hard to spot amid the
hanging mold. It drips upon anyone who tries to pull
the coins free.
GREEN SLIME
HAZARD 9
Gamemastery Guide 78
Stealth DC 30 (expert)
Treasure: There are only 15 sp stuck in the ﬂoor,
and breaking out each coin requires a few minutes’
chiseling or shape stone or similar magic (which is
how the coins got stuck in the stone in the ﬁrst place).
I51. RAVIREX’S FEN
MODERATE 9
A morass of mud sprouting thick fungus and clinging vines
makes up the ﬂoor of this large cavern. A few boulders
protrude from the mud.
Not long ago, a black dragon named Ravirex moved
into the swampy cavern at the edge of the Hunting
Grounds to make his lair. He initially thought to
dominate the area but soon ran afoul of powerful
creatures like the derghodaemon in area I31, the
gogiteth in area I49, and the drow hunters who have
proven impossible to pin down. Ravirex quickly
realized the need to be much more circumspect in the
Hunting Grounds, and these days he primarily works
on sculpting the growth in his wide cavern to his
liking. He’s too arrogant to consider defense, assuming
that even the other dangerous creatures of the Hunting
Grounds know better than to attack a dragon.
Belcorra appeared to Ravirex a short time ago to

open negotiations about aiding an attack on a surface
city that Ravirex doesn’t know, and the dragon awaits
her next visit to learn more. She mentioned something
about entrusting a colored magical lens to Ravirex,
so he’s keeping an eye out for those in the hopes of
currying favor with Belcorra.
Two passages lead out of this area to wild Darklands
areas to the west. Swamp water ﬂoods the southern
passage entirely, while the northern passage is clear
but very narrow.
Creatures: While not working to sculpt the fungus in
its lair or out hunting, Ravirex rests upon his hoard in the
alcove to the north. He defends his lair ferociously and
works hard to drive intruders away so he can preserve
his privacy. If he learns that the heroes have any of the
magic lenses he believes Belcorra wants, he targets the
heroes who carry them and tries to take them.
RAVIREX
CREATURE 11
Male adult black dragon (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 105)
Initiative Perception +22
Treasure: The dragon’s hoard consists of 260 gp,
1,412 sp, 4,303 cp, a golden goblet worth 200 gp, a
+2 striking mace, an iron medallion, a scroll of spirit
blast, and a mummiﬁed bat.
I52. VAULT LEDGE
The lake’s water laps lazily on a wide stone ledge
surrounding a structure built into the cavern wall. The
ledge is thick with lichen and barely wide enough to stand
on. A single iron, vault-like door with a metal handle and a
keyhole leads into the structure.
Belcorra built this secure vault as a place to gather
the treasures she planned to use to fund her assault on
Absalom. Beneath the profusion of lichen, the ledge
holds several cleats for securing boats.
The vault door looks formidable but is, surprisingly,
unlocked. The vault’s only intelligent occupant, a
graveknight named Caliddo, recently traveled to the
third level of the Abomination Vaults to recover some
books Belcorra wanted, and he neglected to lock the
door when he returned.
Hazard: The vault door isn’t locked but is trapped.
BLAST TUMBLER
HAZARD 10

Disable DC 32 Thievery (master) to disarm the rune, or
dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 28) to counteract
the rune’s magic.
Force Blast Ǻȓ (evocation, force, occult) Trigger A
non‑undead creature opens the door or critically fails an
attempt to disarm or dispel the rune; Eﬀect A 30‑foot
cone of force issues forth from the lock. Creatures within
the cone must succeed a DC 29 basic Fortitude saving
throw or take 8d12 force damage. Those who fail the
save are pushed 10 feet, and those who critically fail are
pushed 20 feet and are stunned 2.
Reset The rune resets 1 minute after it triggers.
I53. VAULT ANTECHAMBER
LOW 9
The dust is thick in this room, save for footprints that lead
to and from the southernmost of three iron doors, which
look similar to the vault’s entrance.
On the south side of the chamber is a hardened clay
statue sculpted to resemble Belcorra.
Each door leads to another vault. The doors to
areas I54 and I55 are both locked, and Caliddo the
graveknight has the keys. The locks require six
successful DC 40 Thievery checks to Pick a Lock to
open, and they can’t be Forced Open. The door to area
I56 is unlocked; this is where Caliddo went.
Creatures: The statue is a clay golem charged
with attacking any creature other than Belcorra or
Caliddo. It ﬁghts until destroyed, its old clay grinding
as it attacks. The sound quickly brings Caliddo to
ﬁght as well. Together, they’re a Severe encounter for
9th‑level characters.

I54. COIN VAULT
Three iron chests, all in diﬀerent sizes, are lined up against
the north wall of this room.
The boxes hold a mass of treasure that Belcorra
accumulated in life to aid in her assault on Absalom.
Treasure: The largest box contains 8,000 sp, and
the next largest holds 500 gp. The smallest has 100
pp. All these coins were minted centuries ago.
I55. ALCHEMICAL VAULT
This door is difﬁcult to open, even once unlocked,
because the inside has been warped by an explosion.
Inside the vault is a tangle of ancient wood and shattered
glass and pottery. Scorch marks scar the stone walls.

Belcorra stored a variety of alchemical bombs in this
vault. As the centuries passed, the wooden shelves that
held some of them collapsed, creating a chain reaction
of explosions and leaving the room and its vault door
in its current state. Nothing of value remains.
I56. CALIDDO’S VIGIL
LOW 9
This small, bare room contains more vault doors, just
as in area I53; Caliddo Haruvex carries these two keys
as well. There’s also a remarkably well-hidden secret
door here; a hero Searching this room discovers the
hidden switch to open it with a successful DC 30
Perception check.
Creatures: A warrior in archaic armor stands in
this room, clutching a greatsword. This is Caliddo
Haruvex, a skilled mercenary who came to serve
Belcorra when he heard how powerful his distant
relative had become. Belcorra accepted Caliddo’s
offer of aid and promptly killed him, raising him as
a graveknight eternally bound to serve her. Caliddo
proved his worth and loyalty to Belcorra many times,
so she entrusted him with guarding her vault. He kept
a silent vigil here for centuries.
When Belcorra returned, she put Caliddo to work
fetching several books she wanted out of the
hands of others who might use them against
her. For the ﬁrst time in centuries, Caliddo left the
vault. He recovered the texts from an upper level
of the dungeon and locked them in area I58.
Caliddo remains at his post and assaults anyone
who enters. If the heroes don’t face him with the golem
in area I53, he’s encountered here. Caliddo ﬁghts until
destroyed, but he doesn’t leave his post in the vault
unless Belcorra expressly orders him to.
CALIDDO HARUVEX
CREATURE 10
Male graveknight (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 191)
Initiative Perception +19
Items composite longbow (20 arrows), +1 resilient full plate,
greatsword, keys to Belcorra’s vault (areas I52 to I59)

Caliddo’s Return: Destroying Caliddo for good
proves difﬁcult because his armor rebuilds him. If he
rejuvenates after the heroes have plundered the vault,
he pursues them in an attempt to recover the items. He
doesn’t have any special connection to the treasures,
though, so he might have to search around a lot to
ﬁnd out where the heroes went. Caliddo isn’t likely
to negotiate, but he’s most interested in reclaiming his
keys and returning the books to the vault (as those
were the last things Belcorra expressed particular
interest in and, he assumes, the most valuable to her).
Heroes who turn over the keys and books might avert
Caliddo’s retribution and keep the other treasures.
I57. DERELICT ARMORY
Ancient weapon racks have collapsed over time, leaving
many swords, spears, and axes jumbled on the ﬂoor.

Belcorra hoarded dozens of weapons for her
campaign in this room, intending to arm the humanoid
warriors who fought alongside the aberrant monsters
in her attack. While most of the weapons are merely
well-made, a number of them are genuinely superior.
Treasure: Amid the weapons are a standard-grade
adamantine warhammer and a +2 striking battle axe.
A fallen armor stand is tangled up with the +2 resilient
chain shirt that was once displayed on it.
I58. VAULT OF SECRETS
The shelves of this room contain several old books and
various odds and ends. In the center of the room is a dusty
mechanism of copper and silver. It’s missing its lenses
but otherwise looks like the framework of a lantern that
belongs in the top of a lighthouse. The dust in this room
has been recently disturbed.
This is Belcorra’s most protected vault, holding her
treasures and secrets of her past. The books that have
been most recently shelved here—as evidenced by
the trails in the dust—are research journals Belcorra
penned when she was alive. They’re centuries old,
but careful magical preservation has kept them from
falling apart. These journals describe four fulcrum
lenses (in crimson, ebon, emerald, and ochre) that
focus Nhimbaloth’s soul-extinguishing gaze across
space and time.
Belcorra’s journal details how she built Gauntlight
and created a special framework called the Fulcrum
Lattice to ﬁt the four lenses and harness their power. A
diagram of the Fulcrum Lattice makes it clear that the
device is the very one sitting here. Belcorra expresses
some trepidation at using the fulcrum lenses; they each
contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence, and bringing
them in close proximity can be dangerous. More
speciﬁcally, the lenses impart Nhimbaloth’s essence
into those who use or are touched by them. Having
all four essences imbued at once is sure to bring
Nhimbaloth’s dreadful scrutiny. Belcorra had her
talented apprentice, Volluk Azrinae, fashion mundane
lenses that would allow Gauntlight to function at a
diminished capacity until the Fulcrum Lattice and
the fulcrum lenses could be installed, on the eve of
Belcorra’s assault on Absalom. The Fulcrum Lattice
allows all four of the large, heavy lenses to be carried
with ease.
Belcorra’s journals explain that she used only the
Ebon Fulcrum Lens in the Empty Vault at Gauntlight’s
base, deeming the essence within one fulcrum lens a
minimal risk. She gave the other lenses to trusted groups
in the lower vaults: the emerald lens to the urdefhans,
the ochre lens to the drow, and the crimson lens hidden
where her undead gnome minions could protect it.
She trusts that the groups won’t work together, much
less learn that bringing the lenses together to imbue a
single creature with all four splinters of Nhimbaloth’s
essence would impart total annihilation.
Other Books: The other books are aging tomes full
of occult knowledge; they’ve been in the Haruvex
family for generations. They hold a wealth of occult
lore about ghosts, Nhimbaloth, and the Haruvexes. A
hero who peruses these tomes for at least an hour gains
a +2 item bonus on checks to Recall Knowledge on
these subjects when using the Investigate exploration
activity here.
Treasure: Belcorra keeps many valuables here,
including a skull-shaped key worth 30 gp that unlocks
the doors to the Gate of Nhimbaloth (area I60) and
two signet rings that each bear the symbol of a tentacle
wrapped around a skull with a moss-ﬁlled mouth. One
is a ring of lies, and the other functions as a greater
pendant of the occult. The Fulcrum Lattice is also
here, and it’s surprisingly lightweight for its size. If
the heroes have discovered any fulcrum lenses so far,
they ﬁt neatly into the lattice, and the lattice grows no
heavier for their weight.
XP Award: Award the heroes 80 XP for uncovering
the lore of the fulcrum lenses and learning how to
destroy Belcorra.
I59. LEVEL 9 PORTAL CHAMBER
Spiraling runes ﬁlled with silver cover this chamber’s curved
walls. The same silvery metal covers the ﬂoor and ceiling.
This room contains another inactive teleportation
circle that the heroes might connect to others in the
Abomination Vaults with the awaken portal ritual.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for using the
awaken portal ritual to reactivate the teleportation
circle here.
I60. EBON DOORS
These massive double doors are made of black and green
stone. An oxidized bronze lock has a keyhole but no handles.
This door leads to a structure called the Gate of
Nhimbaloth, an ancient temple made of black stone
streaked with a greenish, nauseating hue. Belcorra
didn’t build this place; she found it and incorporated
it into her ever-expanding dungeon. Whether the
Gate of Nhimbaloth always existed underground or
was once cast down from the surface is a mystery,

as are the cultists who once inhabited it. In any
case, its entry is now seamless with the stone of
the Abomination Vaults. The Gate of Nhimbaloth
includes not only the rooms beyond it, but most of
the lower level as well.
The door’s ancient lock is incredibly complex. Six
successful DC 40 Thievery checks are required to Pick
the Lock, and the door can’t be Forced Open at all.
The skull‑shaped key located in area I58 opens this
door. When it does, the key’s carving changes to show
moss sprouting from the skull’s mouth.
I61. HALL OF PRIESTS
MODERATE 9
This large chamber is made of the same black stone as
the imposing ebon doors to the north. Eight alcoves, four
on each side, line the east and west walls. Each alcove
contains the remains of jade-colored statues. All of the
ﬁgures have been deﬁled; none have any heads remaining,
most are missing hands, and one is just a pair of bare feet
upon a pedestal. An enormous stone throne carved out
of heavy blocks stands in a domed chamber opposite the
black doors.
Well before Belcorra’s time, this served as a
semipublic area of worship for a cult of Nhimbaloth.
Those seeking vengeance, an enemy’s obliteration, or
assurance that a lost loved one would return as a ghost
left offerings and sacriﬁces around the throne and the
creature sitting on it, who was called Lady’s Whisper—
the creature that sits there still. Aspirants hoped the
shrouded skeleton would rise and lead them through
one of the three doorways to take the tests to become
an initiate in the cult. Lady’s Whisper sometimes
remained still for years, or ushered in new cultists for
days on end. Although even the senior cultists never
understood the connection between Lady’s Whisper
and Nhimbaloth, none questioned the skeleton’s role
as gateway to cult membership.
The cultists did know, however, that only those
Lady’s Whisper ushered into the eastern door would
join the cult. The western doors lead to grim fates
reserved for those unworthy to even be tested for
admittance to the cult.
Creatures: Lady’s Whisper is a unique undead
creature distantly related to the lesser deaths that
serve the Grim Reaper (Pathﬁnder Bestiary 196). For
reasons long lost, the skeletal creature is irrevocably
tied to Nhimbaloth. It knows that the heroes are
here to face Belcorra and are ill-suited to join the
now‑nonexistent cult, but it decides to put them
through the initiation trials anyway in the hopes
of weakening and killing them. Lady’s Whisper
commands the allegiance of the many dread wisps
within the Gate of Nhimbaloth, but there are none
here to defend it when the heroes ﬁrst arrive, so it
deals with the heroes cautiously.
Lady’s Whisper rises and holds forth both hands,
gesturing for peace. It then points to the eastern
door and whispers the names of each
hero, one by one. It steps toward
the eastern door, gesturing for
the heroes to follow.
If the heroes attack, Lady’s
Whisper lashes out with its claws
to teleport heroes away, preferably
into the adjacent chambers with
dangerous wisps and traps. It ﬂees if it
takes more than 50 points of damage but
tries to lure the heroes deeper into the Gate
of Nhimbaloth as it does.

to open or shut. If Lady’s Whisper wills a door closed, it
must be Forced Open or battered down.
Unwilling Teleportation (conjuration, divine, teleportation)
When Lady’s Whisper hits and damages a creature with
its claw Strike, it can choose to teleport that creature to
any open space within 15 feet, even if Lady’s Whisper
can’t see the destination. The target can attempt a DC 30
Will saving throw to resist this eﬀect.
I62. OBLIVION FALL
Made of the same dark stone as the rest of the temple, this
passage opens into a rectangular chamber.
Hazard: The chamber at the end of the hall has no
ﬂoor. It’s a bottomless pit that, unlike the hazard in
the Core Rulebook, has no trapdoor; nevertheless,
because it’s set into reﬂective black stone, it’s still
difﬁcult to notice. Lady’s Whisper led aspirants whom
it judged to be useless to Nhimbaloth’s cause into this
pit—forcefully, when necessary.

A black-stoned passage opens into this octagonal chamber.
The room is a riot of foul-smelling swamp weeds.
Creatures who made it into the Gate of Nhimbaloth
but were, in their hearts, too afraid to undertake
the initiation tests below were brought here. Often,
Lady’s Whisper gave them comforting words about
how they could simply rest and depart in peace,
but this was a lie—creatures were brought here to
be killed, their blood and essence used to fuel the
cavern’s sunless garden.
Creatures: A single dread wisp ﬂoats in this room,
desperate to feed for the ﬁrst time in many, many years.

SEVERE 9
The walls of this room are carved from black stone and
feature four large alcoves, two to the east and two to the
west. Three contain large stone basins ﬁlled with reeds,
moss, and other swamp plants. The basin in the fourth
alcove is empty. Stairs lead downward to the north.
The stairs lead down to area J1.
Creatures: Three dread wisps hover here over
three of the stone basins (the fourth dread wisp
once stationed here was slain long ago, and its basin
now contains only desiccated soil). If the heroes are
accompanied by Lady’s Whisper, two of the dread
wisps follow it and the heroes at a distance, ready to
intervene if the heroes become violent. If the heroes
aren’t with Lady’s Whisper, the dread wisps attack.

CHAPTER 10:
To Draw the Baleful Glare
Perhaps a few of the vaults’ inhabitants know the true
story of Nhimbaloth’s ancient temple—notably Lady’s
Whisper and maybe a dread wisp or two—but none
will tell the tale. Was it the hub of a cult cast deep into
the earth by some ancient enemy, or the headquarters of
a Darklands cabal? No matter its original purpose, the
complex series of initiation trials are the last challenges
that the heroes must face to confront Belcorra. The ﬁrst
is the Challenge of Souls, where unworthy initiates were
poisoned, tormented, and had their souls extracted. The
second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced
their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the
Swamp, where initiates demonstrated their mastery over
swampland dangers. The heroes are likely to face these
in order only if guided by Lady’s Whisper; otherwise,
they’re free to tackle them in whatever order they’d like.
Beyond lies the Empty Vault, Belcorra’s domain and the
source of Gauntlight’s powers.
Temple Features
The temple is wholly dark, except where otherwise
noted. Ceilings are generally 15 feet high but reach
60 feet in the main chambers (areas J1, J9, J14, J18,
and J20). The stone doors all bear intricate carvings,
such as a moss-ﬁlled skull, swirling mists, or detailed
swamp scenes, as well as clusters of seven divots.
Lady’s Whisper controls the doors here.
The map of the Temple level appears on page 194.
J1. FIRST CHALLENGE
A basin ﬁlled with reeds and moss stands in an alcove
between doors that lead to the north. Two metal tubes
jut into the room from the east, each sealed oﬀ by some
iris-like mechanism a foot or so inside the pipe. No method
of opening these mechanisms is visible. Black stone doors
lead south, and a single gray stone door carved with shapes
of swirling mist leads west. None of the doors have handles
or latches.
The tests begin with the Challenge of Souls through
the western door. The metal tubes slant downward
and drain into the swamp (area J15). They’re just large
enough for a Medium creature to slide down. If the
