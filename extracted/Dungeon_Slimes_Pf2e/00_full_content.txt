The common Dungeon slime is typically formed
from the residue of magical creatures or abandoned
magical alchemical ingredients.
They do not possess any special abilities, but their
oobleck-like form is quite bouncy. It is rare to see
even the lowliest of adventurers fall to such a sim-
ple creature.

Cave slimes are typically more bottom-heavy and
are created through the interaction of magical
natural flora and liquids in isolated locations. Over
time, influenced by the ambient magic of the area or
the surrounding ecosystem, they gradually take on
a distinct form. These slimes tend to become more
magic-hungry as they develop and seek to consume
magical grass or rocks. Due to their nature, they
often form in caves, hence their name.

Acidic slimes are relatively uncommon compared
to other types. They are typically created by the
magical properties of creatures and items that have
melted in a pool of acid, with the remaining magic
dispersing within the acid pool, giving rise to an
acidic slime.
Usually, only strong and chaotic magics can endure
in acidic liquids, imparting a chaotic and aggressive
nature to the slime formed by such magic.

Poison slimes are exceedingly rare, and their cre-
ation involves very specific methods. Often, they
originate from other slime types that have perished
and become filled with poison gas or natural fumes.
Another common method is the deliberate creation
by an alchemist who specializes in poisons or in
toxic underground caves and dungeons.
