ELEMENTAL CREATURES
Not all elementals are lumbering,
humanoid-shaped creatures. Some
take on the forms and natures
of animals and beasts from the
Material Plane. These creatures
often behave in ways similar to
their Material Plane counterparts,
even though as elementals they
lack the animalistic instincts
mortal creatures have when it
comes to hunting, reproducing,
and the like. Elemental creatures
are favorites of conjurers due to
their small size, relative ease of
summoning, and varied abilities.

XULGATH TREASURE
Xulgaths are relatively primitive,
using tools and weapons of stone
and other materials scavenged
from the surface. These can
replicate most simple and a few
martial melee weapons, as well as
simple thrown ranged weapons.
An advanced tribe of xulgaths
might be able to craft low-level
magical talismans, such as a
potency crystal or a
returning clasp.
Xulgath
Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths
(known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in
their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival
groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They
occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty
leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like
nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with
a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath
is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the ﬁrst
intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty
empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this
era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some
of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins,
venerating their ancestors’ accomplishments, while others consider these areas
taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don’t
agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result
of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the
corruptive inﬂuence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.
Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this
day, paying homage and offering live sacriﬁces to terrible creatures from
the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser
demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into
occultism might summon a more powerful ﬁend that either tears the
xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.
Xulgath Warrior
Xulgath warriors strike with fury and eager cruelty, always ready for
the next ﬁght. The taking of prizes from battle—including weapons and
items stolen from defeated foes along with grislier trophies harvested
from fallen victims’ ﬂesh—is a popular pursuit among these vicious
reptiles, and those whose armor and scales are most adorned are
awarded the greatest respect (and perhaps fear) from their kin.

status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura,
the creature takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves to recover
from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save
is temporarily immune to all xulgaths’ stenches for 1 minute.

XULGATH SOCIETY
Xulgaths respect strength, and the
leader of a community is usually the
strongest of all of them. The leader’s
dominance is rarely questioned
until a potentially stronger xulgath
believes it’s time for a change in
rulership. The two xulgaths then
face oﬀ in a ﬁght to the death, with
the victor claiming rule.
Xulgath Skulker
Xulgath warrens are patrolled—some might say “haunted”—by the community’s
skulkers. These xulgaths specialize in stealth, striking swiftly from the shadows
and otherwise ambushing foes.

YETI TREASURE
Lone exiles of yeti clans have little
use for treasure and leave the gear
of their slain victims behind where
it is quickly covered by snowfall.
Clan-based yetis, on the other
hand, create beautifully carved
stonework, some of which they
shape into protective talismans of
rare beauty.
Yeti
Nearly a myth, the yeti is rarely seen—and even when it is, it is often too late.
Yetis dwell amid the highest, most remote peaks of the world, coming down
from their snowy mountain holds to raid, steal livestock, and sometimes feed
their insatiable urges for slaughter and destruction. Those folks who live at the
foot of a yeti-ruled mountain warn of the “abominable snowmen”: monstrous,
fur-covered humanoids who leave strange and bloody tracks in the snow.
Normally yetis seek to protect the world rather than hunt its other civilized
denizens. They do so by lairing near eldritch portals that form links between
the Material Plane and other, much stranger dimensions of reality. From within
these snow-covered arches and ancient stone doorways, aliens, living nightmares,
ﬁends, and worse can emerge through dimensional networks into the world. Yetis
who guard these portals sometimes succumb to these horrors and are corrupted,
taking on the bloodthirsty urges and horriﬁc behaviors of the very monsters they
strive to protect the world against. Yetis who manifest such violent tendencies
are driven out of their clan and forced to wander the mountaintops alone, thus
giving rise to the myth of the legendary abominable snowman. Forced to fend
for themselves, these exiled yetis often fully embrace the corrupting elements that
caused their exile in the ﬁrst place, growing more powerful and more deadly as
a result. The most vile of these yetis turn to cannibalism, not out of need, but
out of a sheer joy at the terror they inﬂict upon their kin. Invariably such
cannibalistic yetis attract the attention of wendigos, which makes a bad
situation all the worse.
