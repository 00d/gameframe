Jungle Drake
Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters
equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or
their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that
allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in ﬂight
and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run
tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their
victims off to ﬁnish their meals as they please.

DRAKE HUNTERS
The allure of hunting a dragon
is diﬃcult to resist for many
adventurers, but accomplishing
such a task is fraught with peril.
Unscrupulous adventurers have
been known to instead hunt drakes
and use trophies harvested from
these creatures to deceive locals.

Wyvern
A wyvern is a venomous drake with a well-earned reputation for impatience and
aggression. As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern’s
resilient body allows it to crash talons-ﬁrst into large prey without serious risk
to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with
searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks
the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to
lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before
it descends to pick apart the carcass.
Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature
typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or
demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and
tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by
the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment,
and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging
from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful
humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a
few weeks before the wyvern’s pride, malice, or insolence inspires
it to ﬂee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a
wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns
are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid
helping others.

# JANNI
================================================================================


Bestiary
Genie
A unique type of genie exists for each Elemental Plane, and the bodies of genies
are formed out of elemental matter corresponding to their native plane: djinn
are formed from wind, clouds, and storms; efreet are ﬁre made ﬂesh; marids are
beings of water; and shaitans are composed of metal, gems, and stone. Lastly, the
jann are formed out of all four elements, and are the weakest of geniekind.
Genie Nobles
Genie nobles with titles unique to their kind (as detailed in each sidebar) rule genie
society. Genie nobles are generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example
of their kind. In addition to the increased statistics afforded by their higher levels,
genie nobles gain additional spells. But the most wondrous (and
notorious) of a genie noble’s powers is their ability to grant
wishes. Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power)
can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within
a year’s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles
to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic. However,
once a genie noble grants a third wish to a single creature, they are
freed from service to that creature forever.
Janni
Jann are genies composed of all four elements, meaning they are not
quite home on any of the Elemental Planes. Instead, jann reside on the
Material Plane, making only brief forays to the other parts
of the Inner Sphere. Although they are human in size and
appearance, jann are not at all related to humans and
bristle at any claims to this effect. They are a proud people
and take great care to maintain their honor—restoring that
honor with the edge of a sword, if necessary.

Frequency Once per day. Eﬀect The janni changes a creature’s
size. This works as a 4th-level enlarge or shrink spell but can target
an unwilling creature (DC 21 Fortitude save negates).
DJINNI VIZIERS
Djinni viziers prefer to manifest
wishes in physical, often gaudy
displays, but cut corners in
quality. Wished-for gold, for
example, might only be gold
plated (and still valuable), not
solid gold. Djinni viziers add the
following to their innate spells:
5th summon giants, tongues.

================================================================================

EFREETI MALIKS
Efreeti maliks take pleasure in
fulﬁlling wishes in pedantic ways
that cause suﬀering, regret, or
pain. A wisher for a thousand
pounds of gemstones might have
the gems delivered as a bonecrushing avalanche. Efreeti maliks
add the following to their innate
spells: 5th ﬁreball (at will); 7th
volcanic eruption.
Djinni
Benevolent genies from the Plane of Air, djinn value art, culture, knowledge, and
trade. They also love new experiences, succulent dishes, and heady wines. Of all
geniekind, they are most likely to approach humans and other mortals, interacting
with them on friendly terms. Still, djinn are proud of their genie heritage and have
a tendency to be patronizing toward mortals, a habit that has earned them a
reputation for arrogance.
Djinn get along with jann and marids, but they ﬁnd shaitans too stiff and
harbor undying hatred for efreet. Although djinn are formidable combatants,
they despise war and prefer to eschew violence in favor of dealing with their
opponents using magic or subterfuge (making an exception, of course, when
they encounter efreet).

# JINKIN
================================================================================

(1st) prestidigitation
Jinkin
Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great
pride in their power to curse precious objects. They hold grudges and
create convoluted plans for revenge whenever they feel slighted, such as
when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to
wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and
murder, though they prefer to lead
victims into traps designed to capture
or incapacitate rather than kill outright.
Deep pits are favorites, since victims
who survive the fall face a slow death from
starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering
at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

Sneak Attack The jinkin deals 1d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed creatures.
Tinker (curse, primal, transmutation) A group of six jinkins can work together
for an hour to imbue an item with a curse at a range of 60 feet. While this
process is lengthy, it’s also unobtrusive and can be performed while Hiding. Jinkins
prefer to use this ability on magic items. The curse makes the item unreliable (DC
5 flat check or waste any action to Interact with or Activate the item), adds
a bizarre requirement to use the item, or imparts some other curse of a
similar caliber.

Griffon
Griffons are regal beasts revered as symbols of freedom and strength in many
cultures. They are physically striking, with the hindquarters of a lion and the
head, wings, and forelimbs of a great bird of prey—typically an eagle, but some
instead bear the features of a hawk, falcon, or even osprey or vulture. In rare
cases, the griffon’s hindquarters may resemble those of a different great cat,
such as a leopard or tiger. The variations seem to conform to the environment
in which the griffon lives—for instance, the especially rare griffons of northern
Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy
owl—though this is not always the case. Some griffons lack wings altogether.
These wingless griffons, known as alces, result from a rare mutation. Among a
clutch of other griffons, the alce is typically considered the runt, so few of these
offshoots survive their ﬂedgling stage. Those alces that do make it to adulthood
tend to be tougher, more violent, and more aloof than most griffons.
Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen
eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground
and grab up their victims is shocking. They may tear open victim’s ﬂesh with
their razor-sharp beaks, but usually just take their prey to a high, secluded
location where they can enjoy their feast without interruptions. On the ground,
they take cover and leap out to ambush prey, then ﬂy off with their prize. The
exception to this is when a griffon is hunting to feed its offspring, in which case
it will almost never purposefully bring a living creature back to its nest for fear
of endangering its chicks.
Skilled animal trainers long ago learned how to raise griffons as mounts
for military forces or powerful individuals. Such mounts are known for their
strength, bravery, and unfailing loyalty. They are among the smartest of animals
and possess a wisdom not normally afforded most animals; it is
thought that a griffon chooses its rider as much as a rider chooses
the griffon. The process of training a griffon to accept and carry
a rider in ﬂight is a long and expensive ordeal. Griffon trainers
charge rich sums for their services, and a ruler who can
boast of owning a stable of griffons is the subject of great
respect and envy.
