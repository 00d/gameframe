Change Shape Ȳ˓ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) Once per round, a veiled
master can take on the appearance of a humanoid of Large, Medium, or Small size or
resume its true form. While in humanoid form, the veiled master’s Speed is 30 feet, and it
loses its mucus cloud aura and swim Speed.
If the humanoid form assumed lacks
the aquatic trait, the veiled master
loses its own aquatic trait as well. In
humanoid form, the veiled master can
use weapons, or it can make Strikes
that work like its tentacle attack but
use the reach of its current form. If
the assumed form has fangs or claws,
the veiled master can also make such
Strikes, but these attacks lack the veiled master’s slime.
Consume Memories (mental, occult) When a veiled
master makes a fangs Strike against a creature,
it can consume some of that creature’s memories. The target must succeed at a
DC 37 Fortitude saving throw or become stupeﬁed 1. A veiled master regains 5
Hit Points each time it successfully consumes memories. When
a veiled master consumes memories, it learns some of the
creature’s memories (subject to the GM’s discretion).
Delayed Suggestion (enchantment, occult) When a veiled master
successfully casts dominate on a creature, a suggestion
spell triggers when the dominate spell ends. This suggestion
usually causes the target to return to the veiled master, so
the creature can cast dominate again, but a veiled master can
set the suggestion to diﬀerent orders if it wishes.
Slime (curse, occult, virulent) As alghollthu master, but DC 36.
Tentacle Flurry ʚʖ The veiled master thrashes about with its tentacles. Make
a tentacle Strike against each creature within its reach. Roll only one attack
roll, and roll the damage only once for all targets.
Thoughtlance (curse, enchantment, occult) A creature touched by the
veiled master’s tentacles, whether those tentacles deal damage or not,
must attempt a DC 34 Will save, becoming slowed 1 on a failure or
slowed 2 on a critical failure. Each time the aﬀected creature ends its
turn, its slowed value decreases by 1.
OTHER ALGHOLLTHUS
While the veiled masters are the
rulers of alghollthu society, they are
not the most powerful of their kind.
Greater, more mysterious creatures
that function as organic thought
networks, immense aquatic engines
of war, or specialized extractors
of forgotten secrets dwell among
their sunken cities. Meanwhile,
the world above remains infested
with creatures that were originally
created by the alghollthus but have
long since drifted away from their
aquatic progenitors to become their
own sinister monstrosities.

Angel
The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs
based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and
live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels,
including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell
on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers
possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
Cassisian (Archive Angel)
The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more
powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect,
cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most
cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from
fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.

# VAMPIRE BAT SWARM
================================================================================


Bat
A wide range of bats dwell throughout the world. Most of these nocturnal animals
are harmless insectivores, but deadly breeds of vampire bats and oversized bats
the size of horses pose much more signiﬁcant threats to adventurers.
Vampire Bat Swarm
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose
a signiﬁcant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can
feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats
is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of
inﬂicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short
span of time.

Blood Feast Ȱɵ Each enemy in the bat swarm’s space takes 1d4 piercing damage (DC 16
basic Reﬂex save). Creatures that fail this save also take 1 persistent bleed damage.
Giant Bat
While big bats are certainly not uncommon in dark caves and abandoned ruins
and may instill fear in squeamish spelunkers, the so-called giant bat is a true
monster, weighing well over 100 pounds and having a wingspan of nearly 15
feet. It primarily eats fruit and bugs, but can be incited to violence through fear
or hunger. Giant bat attacks can quickly give rise to rumors
of more dangerous monsters—many mistake these massive
animals for some sort of demon or vampiric monster. But like
other bats, giant bats are simply social and intelligent mammals.
They are sometimes used as mounts by smaller humanoids,
commonly those who hail from or dwell in mountainous or
underground regions.

# VROCK

WHAT MAKES A SIN?
Some classify sin into seven
categories—envy, gluttony, greed,
lust, pride, sloth, and wrath. While
these sins embody some of the most
powerful and numerous demons, far
more than seven demons exist. Any
act of cruelty or destruction a mortal
takes to gratify the self at others’
expense is, in eﬀect, a sin, and any
such act can spawn a
demon from a soul in
the afterlife.
The target must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be aﬀected by a suggestion to submit
to more actions of passion rather than trying to Escape.
Profane Gift ̂ˬ (divine, enchantment, mental); Frequency once per day. Eﬀect The
succubus on can give a willing humanoid a profane gift. That creature gains a +1 status
bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. As long as the gift persists, the
succubus can communicate telepathically with the target at any distance, see through
the creature’s senses, and target the creature with suggestion through the telepathic
link. In addition, the creature uses an outcome one degree of success worse than it rolls
on saving throws against the lust demon’s suggestions.
A humanoid can’t have more than one profane gift at a time, and a succubus can’t
grant more than one profane gift at a time. Removing the gift requires an atone ritual. The
succubus can remove the gift as a free action to give the recipient a permanent stupeﬁed
3 condition. A 4th-level restoration spell is required to reduce this stupeﬁed condition by 1.
A summoned succubus can’t grant a profane gift.
Vrock (Wrath Demon)
When the gates to the Abyss swing wide, the ﬁrst demons through are often
vrocks, vulture-headed scions of rage who wheel through the air on black wings
or dance with the exultation of their ﬁendish power. Their hatred for mortals is
matched only by their desire to inﬂict suffering through
their horrible screech or their devastating dance.
Vrocks form from the souls of hateful mortals
who are thus given another chance to inﬂict their
rage on the world.
Vrocks often travel in small groups so as to make the
best use of their dance of ruin ability, but they rarely
appear in groups larger than four. Against small groups
and individuals, they swoop down without fear, hoping
to play with their prey before going for the kill. Against
formidable foes, they are just as happy to ﬂy above, using
their dance of ruin to cast a storm of lightning down on them.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ If the vrock is ﬂying and a creature triggers an
attack of opportunity, the vrock can make 2 Strikes with its talons against
that creature instead of 1 Strike.
Peace Vulnerability A vrock’s wrath is the heart of their essence, and forcing
peace upon them wrenches at their soul. If they fail a save against calm emotions
or a similar eﬀect forcing them to be peaceful, a vrock takes 4d6 mental damage.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 35 feet

Dance of Ruin ̂ˬ (divine, electricity, evocation, manipulate, move) The vrock dances
in ﬂight and chants to create a ruinous explosion of electricity. If more vrocks within
30 feet want to join the dance, the vrock can delay the dance to wait for more vrocks;

DEMONIC POSSESSION
Some demons specialize in the art
of possessing creatures or objects
to spread fear and chaos. In such
cases a demon gains a powerful
disguise with which to work its
evils upon the world, a subterfuge
that delights the demon.
in that case, the eﬀect occurs after the last vrock uses Dance of Ruin or one of the
vrocks chooses to complete that round of the dance. Each non-demon creature in a
20-foot emanation from any of the dancing vrocks takes 2d12 electricity damage
(DC 28 basic Reﬂex save). For each additional vrock that joins the dance, the damage
increases by 1d12 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four vrocks dealing
5d12 damage with a DC 31 save). The vrocks can continue dancing by using Dance of
Ruin each round, for up to 3 rounds in total. The emanation’s size increases by 20 feet
each round, and the damage increases by 1d12 per vrock each round.
Spore Cloud Ȱɵ (disease, poison) The vrock emits a cloud of spores from their body,
dealing 2d8 poison damage to all adjacent creatures. Each creature damaged this way
must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2d8 persistent piercing damage as the
spores penetrate its skin and grow into thick, green vines. The vines cease growing
after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved oﬀ before then. The
vines can be destroyed if the creature is aﬀected by a good spell or if holy water is
applied to the vines (with an Interact action). Once the vrock uses Spore Cloud, the
ability can’t be used for 1d6 rounds.
Stunning Screech Ȱɵ (auditory, divine, incapacitation, sonic) Frequency once per minute.
Eﬀect The vrock emits a shrill screech. Each non-demon creature within a 30-foot
burst must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is stunned 2,
and on a critical failure, it’s stunned 3.
Glabrezu (Treachery Demon)
Glabrezus are looming behemoths who revel in the act of twisting
mortal desires into their ultimate ruin, betraying and manipulating as
easily as they breathe. Desires granted by a glabrezu always come to
fruition in the most destructive way possible, turning a wish or hope
into a potent and devastating act of betrayal—although the long-term
repercussions are not always immediately apparent. For example, a
struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only
to ﬁnd that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the
weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted
in the form of a lost love returned to “life” as a vampire. Glabrezus
are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal’s needs.
These massive demons have enormous pincers and
a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their
chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess
formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the
souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.

Leaping Charge Ȱɵ The velociraptor Strides up to 10 feet,
ignoring diﬃcult terrain as it leaps over obstacles. It then
makes a Strike with its talons, gaining a +1 circumstance
bonus to its attack roll.
Pack Attack The velociraptor deals 1d4 extra damage
to any creature that’s within reach of at least two of the
velociraptor’s allies.
Deinonychus
Deinonychuses are wily hunters that attack in groups of up to a dozen
individuals, ripping apart their prey with sharp talons and powerful jaws. They
are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps
them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don’t use their dexterous
clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside
small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most
have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is
about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.
However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures—which stand
taller than a human—are called megaraptors.

PAGE 98

DINOSAUR RESOURCES
As animals, dinosaurs have little
interest in treasure (although
velociraptors and deinonychuses,
like their bird cousins, enjoy
keeping sparkling baubles in
their nests), but the remains of
adventurers strewn about their
lairs often still have valuable gear.
Dinosaurs can also be harvested
for rare and valuable trophies such
as teeth, talons, armor plates, and
the like.

# VOIDWORM

CREATURE 1

TINY
MONITOR
PROTEAN
Perception +4; entropy sense (imprecise) 30 feet, darkvision
PROTEAN NAMES
Individual proteans have two
names: a traditional name in
their hissing, confusing language;
and an honorary title. The latter
is easily translated to other
languages, but a protean’s
traditional name can only rarely be
uttered in any tongue other than
Protean. As such, most proteans
tend to go by their titles when
dealing with outsiders, referring to
themselves as, for example, “Song
of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry
of the Storm.”
OTHER PROTEANS
Many other proteans beyond
those presented here dwell in the
Maelstrom, including the spectral
pelagastrs, the nearly humanoid
shapechanging ourdivars, and the
incredibly powerful izﬁitars.

================================================================================
PAGE 268
================================================================================

BORN FROM CHAOS
The Maelstrom, home of all
proteans, is the whirling mass
of turbulent primal energy,
planar waves, and soul-stuﬀ
that surrounds the Outer Planes.
Planar scholars theorize that all of
reality was originally formed from
the Maelstrom in the early days
of the cosmos—a theory proteans
don’t necessarily dispute.
Languages Abyssal, Protean
Skills Acrobatics +7, Deception +6, Religion +4, Stealth +7
Str –1, Dex +4, Con +0, Int –1, Wis –1, Cha +1
Entropy Sense (divination, divine, prediction) A voidworm can anticipate the most likely
presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and
chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature
under the eﬀects of nondetection or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and
predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense.
AC 17; Fort +5, Ref +9, Will +6
HP 16, fast healing 1; Resistances precision 3, protean anatomy 5
Protean Anatomy (divine, transmutation) A voidworm’s vital organs shift and change
shape and position constantly. Immediately after the voidworm takes acid, electricity,
or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts
for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in
which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes ﬁrst.
The voidworm is immune to polymorph eﬀects unless it is a willing target. If blinded
or deafened, the voidworm automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new
sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.
Speed 20 feet, ﬂy 40 feet; freedom of movement
Melee Ȱɵ jaws +9 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage
1d8–1 piercing plus 1d4 chaotic
Melee Ȱɵ tail +9 (chaotic, ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 1d4–1
slashing plus 1d4 chaotic and confounding lash
Divine Innate Spells DC 16; 4th read omens; 2nd blur (self only),
obscuring mist; 1st detect alignment (at will; lawful only); Cantrips (4th)
dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation; Constant (4th) freedom of movement
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentration, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The voidworm takes
on the appearance of a Tiny animal. This doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and
damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its
Strikes deal.
Confounding Lash (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A
creature hit by the voidworm’s tail Strike is stupeﬁed 1 for 1
round (stupeﬁed 2 on a critical hit). A successful DC 16 Will
save negates this eﬀect and grants temporary immunity
to confounding lash for 1 minute.
Naunet
Pugnacious and powerfully muscled, naunets serve
as scouts and rank-and-ﬁle troops of protean armies.
Resembling a thick salamander with a wide head, a powerful tail, and
tentacles tipped with snapping jaws in place of rear legs, naunets are the
most bestial of the proteans and occupy one of their lowest castes. Naunets
are 12 feet long and weigh 900 pounds.
All proteans are prone to unpredictable ﬁts and unexpected action, but
compared to most others, naunets are much more bestial. Always ready
for a ﬁght, naunets pride themselves in acting swiftly and striking
before unpleasant distractions like diplomacy can blunt a
combat’s beginning.

the target’s eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the
vampire’s level (Core Rulebook 503), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily
immune to that vampire’s Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends
the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insuﬃcient to break
the spell.

WARG LEGENDS
Wargs are the subject of many
grim tales and campﬁre stories.
Frightening accounts of wargs
gobbling up children whole have a
disturbing basis in fact, for these
ravenous creatures have jaws that
can unhinge like those of a serpent
to gulp down small prey while the
victim yet lives.
Warg
The warg is an intelligent and malevolent wolf that dwells among goblins,
hobgoblins, orcs, and other violent humanoids.
Warg
Wargs hunt in packs and surround their prey like common wolves, but their
cunning and penchant for taunting victims makes them easy to distinguish from
their less-intelligent cousins. But despite their intelligence, wargs have simple
desires for food and shelter, making them easy for evil humanoids such as orcs
and hobgoblins to recruit to protect their camps or join them in battle. Most
wargs are amenable to this arrangement, but if food should run out, wargs are
more than willing to integrate goblinoid ﬂesh into their diet.
