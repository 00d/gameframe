Confessor’s Aura (aura, divine, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. Creatures in the balisse’s
aura are subject to zone of truth (DC 23). Additionally, if these creatures choose to
honestly express their own conﬂicted feelings, the aura makes it easier for them to
put words to those feelings.

Brand of the Impenitent ʚʖ (curse, divine, evocation)
Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The balisse marks
an evil creature within its confessor’s aura as
irredeemable. It can only do so after a failed
attempt to convince the creature to repent. The
touched creature takes a –1 status penalty to AC
and saves, reduces its resistances by 2, and gains
weakness 2 to good damage. The duration depends on
the target’s DC 26 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaﬀected.
Success The duration is 1 round.
Failure The duration is 1 day.
Critical Failure The duration is permanent.
Flaming Armament (divine, evocation) Any
weapon gains the eﬀect of a ﬂaming property
rune while a balisse wields it.
Guiding Angel Ȱɵ (divine, transmutation)
While invisible, a balisse can spiritually
attach itself to a non-evil mortal. When it
does so, it merges with the mortal’s body and
is unable to use any of its spells and abilities
other than to interact with the mortal. It must
use Guiding Angel again to leave the mortal. While
merged with the mortal, the balisse can take a form
of its choice that only the mortal can see, such as a
small angel on the mortal’s shoulder. Alternatively, it
can communicate with the mortal using a bodiless
voice only the mortal can hear.
Astral Deva (Emissary Angel)
Astral devas are the elite messengers and
emissaries of the celestial realms, serving
deities and celestial armies by delivering messages,
performing reconnaissance, and providing support for
those in need of aid. They watch over planar
travelers and take powerful mortals under
ANGELIC TREASURE
Many angels wear exquisite
armor or wield beautiful and often
magical weapons. While they are
not hampered by mortal sins like
greed or pride (save for the very
rare and tragic exception), they do
enjoy the beauty of ﬁne clothing,
exquisite jewelry, and works of art.

their wings to mentor them. Astral devas carry scrolls containing important
messages and other celestial secrets.
Astral devas can form spontaneously from the souls of exceptional
good-aligned mortals, but are also sometimes created from such souls
intentionally by deities or demigods. In the later cases, astral devas often bear
physical features that mark them as closely afﬁliated with that deity. An astral
deva created by Sarenrae, for example, might have hair made of ﬁre, while one
created by Torag might look more dwarven, and one created by Desna could
have butterﬂy wings instead of feathered wings. It’s not unusual for astral devas
created by lawful good or chaotic good deities to share their creators’ alignment.

# BANSHEE
================================================================================


Bestiary
BORN FROM TRAGEDY
The banshee represents one of the
most tragic of undead, a soul so
wracked with agony and fury over
a betrayal in life that, in death, it
lingers on as a great evil. That most
of those who become banshees
were not evil in life only deepens
this tragic theme, and many elven
adventurers see it as their duty
not only to put banshees to rest,
but to right the wrong that
saw their creation in the
ﬁrst place.
Banshee
Banshees are the furious, tormented souls of elves bound to the Material Plane
by a betrayal that deﬁned the ﬁnal hours of their lives. Some banshees arise from
elves who were slain by trusted friends and allies, or whose loved ones betrayed
them on their deathbeds. Others spawn from elves whose treacherous deeds
shortly before their deaths left a stain upon their souls. Regardless of their origin,
banshees despise the living. This hatred of life is all too often a horriﬁc inversion
of their personalities in life. Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf
(and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.
Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt
thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many
banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, speciﬁcally in Tanglebriar,
the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees
can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as
plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.
Banshees’ mere touch inﬂicts pain and primal fear, and those
exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.

Vengeful Spite Ǻȓ (evocation, occult); Trigger A foe critically hits
the banshee, or the banshee critically fails their save against a foe’s
damaging eﬀect. Eﬀect The banshee lashes back at their tormentor,
dealing 4d10+14 mental damage (DC 38 basic Will save) and applying
the eﬀects of terrifying touch based on the results of the same Will save.

Melee Ȱɵ hand +32 (ﬁnesse, magical), Damage 4d10+14 negative plus
terrifying touch
Spectral Ripple When a banshee Strides at least 10 feet, they’re
concealed until the start of their next turn.
Terrifying Touch (emotion, enchantment, fear, occult) A creature damaged
by the banshee’s touch that isn’t already frightened must attempt a DC
38 Will save (DC 43 if the attack was a critical hit). If the creature fails
its save, it’s frightened 2; on a critical failure, the creature also cowers
with fear and is stunned 4. If the creature is protected against fear by a
spell or magic item, the banshee’s touch ﬁrst attempts to counteract the
protection eﬀect, with the eﬀect of a 9th-level dispel magic spell.
Wail ʚʖ (auditory, concentrate, death, necromancy, occult) The banshee
unleashes a soul-chilling wail of the banshee (DC 38). This Wail overcomes
silence and similar eﬀects of 5th level or lower. The banshee can instead
use Wail as a three-action activity to overcome such eﬀects of up to
8th level.
The banshee’s Wail resonates for 1 round, and any creature that comes
within the area during that time must attempt a save against the eﬀect. A
creature can’t be aﬀected more than once by the same Wail. The banshee
can’t Wail again for 1d4 rounds.

MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS
All too often, those who study
stranger monsters make the
assumption that they were
created by powerful but ill-advised
wizards or are the result of ancient
manipulations from the alghollthu
empire. In the case of the baomal,
extensive research suggests that
neither of these explanations are
accurate. No ancient texts have yet
been recovered in which a wizard
claims to have created the ﬁrst
baomal. And while the alghollthu
of today use them as warbeasts,
ancient carvings suggest that in
the earliest days, baomals were
ravenous hunters of alghollthus.
Baomal
Few sea monsters are as dreaded and feared as the two-headed baomal. These
massive predatory beasts typically dwell in the deepest waters and compete with
krakens and other monsters for food. They feed on whales and other large sea
creatures, sometimes following them to the water’s surface. Near the surface,
baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty
morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships’ hulls,
then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.

Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ
Double Opportunity A baomal gains an extra reaction each

It must use a diﬀerent head for each one it attempts, and
it can’t make more than one Attack of Opportunity for the
same triggering action.
Psychic Static Aura (aura, divination, mental, occult) 120 feet.
All creatures, except aberrations, that begin their turn in
the area take 5d6 mental damage.
Two Heads Any ability that would sever
a baomal’s head (such as a critical hit
with a vorpal weapon) severs one
head at random. Losing one head
doesn’t kill a baomal, but it does
prevent the baomal from making Strikes
with the lost head and from using Double
Opportunity or Two-Headed Strike.

Ranged Ȱɵ tsunami jet +38 (brutal, range 500 feet), Damage 4d10+18
bludgeoning plus Push 40 feet
Breath of the Sea Ȱɵ (attack) A baomal can inhale tremendous
amounts of water, drawing everything in the sea nearby
closer. All creatures and objects in the water within
60 feet of the baomal (including ships) are
pulled toward it. Creatures must succeed at
a DC 42 Athletics check or be pulled up to
20 feet toward the baomal (40 feet on a critical failure). For ships, use the captain’s
Sailing Lore in place of Athletics. Unattended objects are automatically pulled.
Shell Rake Ȱɵ (move) The baomal Swims or Strides alongside a creature or the hull of a
vessel, dealing damage with the strong spikes on its shell. Each creature or ship the
baomal is adjacent to at any point during its movement takes 6d6+10 slashing and
piercing damage (DC 42 basic Reﬂex save). Against vessels, Shell Rake ignores the
ﬁrst 5 Hardness and creates an explosion of splinters that deals 3d6+5 damage to
every creature within 10 feet of the deck’s edge (DC 42 basic Reﬂex save).
Two-Headed Strike ʚʖ The baomal makes a Strike with each set of jaws, each against a
diﬀerent creature. These Strikes count as one attack for the baomal’s multiple attack
penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after both attacks.

Barghest
Barghests are lupine ﬁends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk
the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago,
barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu
abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in
time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests’ loyalties
and philosophical nature changed signiﬁcantly. Today, while barghests retain their
connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.
Barghest
Typical barghests are ravenous gluttons of life who feed and grow on the fat of
mortals, their bodies changing in ways none can predict as they use the ﬂesh and
blood of their victims to achieve grisly transformations into greater barghests.
Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes of
goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent
wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for
itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation)
The barghest takes on the shape of a goblinoid (a goblin, hobgoblin,
or bugbear) or a wolf, or it transforms back into its true form. When
the barghest is a goblinoid, it loses its jaws and claw Strikes, it
becomes Small if it is a goblin, and its Speed changes to 20 feet.
When the barghest is a wolf, its Speed changes to 40 feet and
its jaws gain Knockdown. Each individual barghest has only one
goblinoid form and one wolf form.
Feed Once per month, a barghest can spend 1 minute to devour a
corpse, gaining a permanent +1 status bonus to its checks and DCs.
Each subsequent time it feeds, this bonus increases by 1. The fourth
time a barghest feeds, it sheds its skin and mutates into a greater
barghest, and the status bonus ends.
Greater Barghest
Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a
greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to
leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss,
there joining other ﬁends as yet another of that
plane’s horrors. As barghests have no innate
ability to travel the planes, though, the
time it takes for most greater barghests
to engineer such a return can
usually be measured in years, if
BARGHEST HERO-GODS
The four barghests stolen from
Hell’s kennels by the deity
Lamashtu were not the originals of
their kind, but they were then and
remain today the most powerful.
Now they are denizens of the
Abyss, dwelling in their own realm
adjacent to Lamashtu’s domain,
and are heavily worshipped by
goblins across multiple worlds as
“hero-gods.” These four barghests
include Hadregash the slaver,
Venkelvore the torturer, Zarongel
the dog slayer, and Zogmugot
the scavenger.

not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of
gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few
grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the
end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make
such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new
abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.
In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests,
the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations
that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon
their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options
detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for
barghest mutations—feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with
new mutations of your own design.

# BASILISK
================================================================================


Bestiary
Basilisk
The basilisk is an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability
to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like for the
cockatrice, the ﬁrst basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and
incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence
to this claim.
A basilisk prefers to eat petriﬁed ﬂesh. Once a victim has been turned to
stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets
its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow
and inefﬁcient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as
if in mid-petriﬁcation itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a wellfed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful
nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has
much need for speed.
An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300
pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to
a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary
creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports
of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these
unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.
For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare,
and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order
to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a
basilisk’s blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this
is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of
previously petriﬁed creatures or body parts.

(arcane,

stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. That
creature must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. If it
fails and has not already been slowed by Petrifying
Glance or this ability, it becomes slowed 1. If
the creature was already slowed by this ability
or Petrifying Glance, a failed save causes the
creature to be petriﬁed permanently.
A creature petriﬁed in this manner that
is coated (not just splashed) with fresh
basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk
that has been dead no longer than
1 hour) is instantly restored to
ﬂesh. A single basilisk contains
enough blood to coat 1d3 Medium
creatures in this manner.
BASILISK LAIRS
Basilisks can be found in almost
any terrestrial environment,
including forests, hills, mountains,
plains, and swamps. They tend
to dwell in caves or sheltered
areas, and their hides often bear
complexions that allow them
to more easily blend with their
environments. As a result, forestdwelling basilisks may have scales
of a verdant emerald color to
match surrounding vegetation,
while a basilisk that lives in the
desert may be a sandy brown or
shale color.

Bat
A wide range of bats dwell throughout the world. Most of these nocturnal animals
are harmless insectivores, but deadly breeds of vampire bats and oversized bats
the size of horses pose much more signiﬁcant threats to adventurers.
Vampire Bat Swarm
Although the typical vampire bat has a wingspan of 7 inches and doesn’t pose
a signiﬁcant threat to larger prey alone (and indeed, these blood-drinkers can
feed without their sleeping victims ever noticing), some unusually aggressive
species of these bats hunt in deadly swarms. A churning cloud of vampire bats
is much more dangerous than the sum of its individual parts and is capable of
inﬂicting an overwhelming number of bleeding wounds in a frighteningly short
span of time.

================================================================================
# BOAR
================================================================================


BOAR RESOURCES
A boar’s carcass typically provides
enough meat for 100 meals or
more, as well as hide and bristles
that can be used for crafting.
Boar
While domesticated pigs are a staple of farm life, wild boars are much more
dangerous. Foul-tempered warthogs are relatively common, while the lumbering,
primeval beasts known as daeodons are less so. Voracious eaters, boars can
ravage the countryside in which they live. Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars
can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as
they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.
Boar
Boars are omnivorous mammals, hunted heavily because their meat is considered
a delicacy. Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or
during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra
inch of tissue to protect their organs as they ﬁght off rivals. Of course, in some
cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can ﬁll the
roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they
can become true terrors of the region.

Daeodon
Where the typical boar is merely ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the
towering daeodon is legitimately hateful and ruthlessly violent. Although
omnivorous, the daeodon (known in some regions simply as a giant boar)
prefers to feed on ﬂesh. Primarily a scavenger, the daeodon isn’t adverse
to attacking creatures it encounters while searching for easier meals, or
to protect any perceived encroachment into its lair or feeding grounds.
Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond of using daeodons as
mounts or war-trained battle beasts; orc cavalry mounted on
daeodons is a fearsome force indeed.
A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet tall at
the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.

BOGGARD VILLAGES
Boggards prefer to dwell in
swamplands and mires. Though
they are at home in the water, they
prefer to spend most of their lives
on land, and build villages of mud
huts. They often keep guardian
beasts, such as bloodseekers
(page 42), crocodiles (page 67),
giant frogs, or other feral animals
tamed (if only just barely) to serve
as protectors.
Boggard
Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes,
and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, ﬁercely
competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3
years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the
rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare—everything needed to survive in their
might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking
swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
Boggard Scout
Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to

terrifying croak. Any non-boggard within 30 feet becomes frightened 1 unless they
succeed at a DC 17 Will save; those who critically succeed are temporarily immune for

Tongue Grab If the boggard scout hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes

it can’t move beyond the reach of the boggard’s tongue. A creature can sever the
tongue by hitting AC 13 and dealing at least 2 slashing damage. Though this doesn’t
deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it

DOMINION OF THE BLACK
Brain collectors typically hunt
alone, yet some adopt morbid
cults that include followers
who hope to have their own
brains harvested by these alien
invaders. The Dominion of the
Black includes a wide array of
monstrous aliens, of which the
brain collectors are merely the
most commonly encountered on
terrestrial worlds. Many of these
aliens have aﬃnities for stealing
thoughts, inhabiting bodies, or
feeding on memories—the focus
on the consumption of brains and
of identities suggesting disturbing
truths about their coalition.
Brain Collector
The grotesque brain collectors (or neh-thalggus, as they call themselves) originate
from worlds far beyond the known solar system, and are part of a conglomeration
of hostile aliens known collectively as the Dominion of the Black. Whether driven
by their own schemes or directives from sinister overlords, brain collectors arrive
in living starships to harvest the brains of intelligent creatures. These aberrations
draw no nutrition from brains, instead storing them for analysis and as vessels for
occult magical energies.
A brain collector’s form evokes that of a tailless scorpion, but the pulsing
brain-ﬁlled blisters that glisten along its back make them impossible to mistake
for merely oversized arachnids. Baleful eyes glare from the joints on their legs,
and the unsettling, intrusive whisper-thoughts they telepathically broadcast
into the minds of those they seek to feed on can be interpreted as threats or
promises alike.
Brain collectors have very little empathy for the denizens of any world they
visit, despite the fact that certain cults venerate them, or the Dominion they hail
from, as if they were gods. To brain collectors, terrestrial creatures are simply
resources for their magical needs and occult powers. They have little interest in
worshipping gods or being worshipped themselves, yet they do practice strange
forms of religion of their own, in which they consider the primordial forces of
deep space as worthy of faith and fear.

BUGBEAR LAIRS
Bugbears live in small gangs that
often prowl together, working as a
group to sow torment. They keep
their lairs in hard-to-ﬁnd places
deep in the forest or hills.
BUGBEAR TREASURE
Though bugbears don’t have much
concern for treasure, they’re prone
to keeping gruesome trophies.
Some might keep a leather cord
strung with ears from their victims,
while others collect severed ﬁngers
or noses. Bits of valuable jewelry
can sometimes remain on these
grisly prizes.
Bugbear
These stealthy and cruel goblinoid creatures delight in spreading fear and
tormenting their victims. Bugbears are the monsters lurking in the closet and
hiding under the bed. Preying on remote farmsteads, bugbears reveal their
presence with thumps in the night or creaks of boards to build lurking dread and
arouse suspicion and fear.
Bugbear Thug
The more common bugbear thug specializes in the art of lurking in the shadows.

BULETTE APPETITES
Although bulettes will eat almost
any living creature that they
can catch within their vicious
jaws, most of them have a
particular fondness for the ﬂesh
of halﬂings or horses. Lacking
other food, a bulette might gnaw
upon vegetable matter or even
inanimate objects, although they
don’t gain actual nourishment from
doing so, this need to feed being
merely an extension of a deeply
compelling instinct.
Bulette
Bulettes are fearsome predators that roam just beneath the surface of desolate
wilderness areas. When they burrow through the ground, only the ﬁn of their
thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out
and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal ﬁn have earned
the nickname “landshark.”
A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles.
When it ﬁnds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that
area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe
entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are ﬁercely competitive creatures that
battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid
contact or conﬂict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate.
Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life—a mated pair of bulettes being
the only known exception to the creature’s penchant for solitude. They rear
their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young
bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill
and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its
ﬁrst successful hunt.
The ﬁrst bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as
frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for
their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history,
and multiple conﬂicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards
claiming to have been the ﬁrst inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages
postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf—a theory born out
of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature,
seem to ﬁnd elf ﬂesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a
bulette’s path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder,
simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.

BUNYIP TREASURE
Bunyips have no use for treasure,
and do not actively collect it,
but the ﬂoors of their lairs are
sometimes littered with the
possessions of their humanoid
victims. A bunyip’s teeth can be
collected and sold (most bunyips
have about 50 teeth at any one
time). Alternatively, due to their
elusiveness and fabled nature, a
high-quality taxidermic bunyip
could easily command a high price
from a collector.
Bunyip
Bunyips are dangerous aquatic predators that resemble a cross between a shark
and a seal. Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips
hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents
and ﬁsherfolk.
Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with
loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted
by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years,
bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now
that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular
bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited
shapechanging abilities are no doubt a signiﬁcant part of the reason for this air of
mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids,
preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except
when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point
the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree
that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the
result of unreported bunyip aggression.
In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the
chum and garbage discarded by ﬁshing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk
close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and
small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms
hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.

CALIGNI TREASURE
Many calignis hide shiny
baubles and trinkets beneath
their dark rags, keeping them
out of sight of their greedy kin.
They also keep several doses of
black smear poison on hand to
incapacitate foes.
Caligni
Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make
mischief. Each caligni serves in a speciﬁc role and grows into a speciﬁc form as
determined by supernatural traditions and inﬂuences in caligni society. Regardless
of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale ﬂesh and white eyes. Some
surface dwellers call the caligni “dark folk,” a term they dislike because it doesn’t
reﬂect either their appearance or character, only their environment.

Caligni dancers serve as intermediaries between caligni clans.

restrained it. A creature that hits a balor with an unarmed Strike takes 3d6+10 ﬁre
damage, and weapons that hit a balor take 3d6+10 ﬁre damage.
Attack of Opportunity Ǻȓ The balor can use Attack of Opportunity when a creature within
their reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to its normal trigger. They can disrupt
triggering concentrate actions, and they disrupt actions on any hit, not just a critical hit.
Death Throes (death, divine, evocation, ﬁre) When a balor dies, their body explodes in
a 100-foot aura of intense demonic ﬂame. All creatures and objects in range take
16d10 ﬁre damage (DC 45 basic Reﬂex save). Because the ﬂame is infused with
Abyssal energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual ﬁre resistance.
Creatures with immunity to ﬁre use an outcome one degree of success better than
what they rolled, instead of gaining the usual beneﬁt of immunity. The bodies of

the target of the triggering Strike.
Infuse Weapons (divine, evocation) Any weapon a balor wields becomes a +3 major
striking vorpal weapon made of cold iron and silver while the demon holds it. A
weapon that isn’t eligible for the vorpal rune doesn’t gain its eﬀects. The balor can
change its evil damage to chaotic whenever it attacks. The demon can conjure a whip
made of ﬂames with an Interact action. This whip gains the same beneﬁts as other
weapons the balor wields.
Lifedrinker Ȳ˓ (divine, healing, necromancy) Trigger The balor kills a living creature that
is at least 15th level. Eﬀect The balor drinks the triggering creature’s life force and
regains 10d8+80 Hit Points.
Whip Reposition When a balor grabs a creature with a whip Strike, they can move the
creature to any space in the whip’s reach. The balor can move without ending the grab
as long as the creature remains within the whip’s reach, and the balor can move the
creature to any other space in the whip’s reach with an Interact action.

THE SUN! IT BURNS!
Deros are ﬁxated with curing their
allergy to sunlight. To understand
how the surface dwellers can
withstand the light of the sun,
deros conduct late-night raids on
surface cities, abducting victims and
performing terrible experiments on
them. Those who survive are often
returned with much of their memory
erased and their bodies bearing
mysterious scars. When these
repressed memories surface, they
lead to wild, hazy recollections of
being abducted.
Dero
Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin,
and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious
type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are
the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world’s surface
races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and
twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs
approximately 70 pounds.
Dero Stalker
Dero stalkers are those charged with exploring the surface world by night and
seeking out new victims to abduct.

FIENDISH RELATIONS
Devils view daemonsʼ constant
hunt for souls as a short-sighted
waste of potential, and demonsʼ
chaotic destruction of society
and ﬂesh as uncivilized and
obnoxious, but they do not loathe
their ﬁendish counterparts.
Indeed, most devils are more
than willing to take advantage
of daemons and demons as they
can to further their
own machinations.
Barbazu (Bearded Devil)
Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous ﬁends
who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s
armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into
battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inﬂict jagged gashes that resist
healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too
close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver
a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s
strength being slowly devoured from within.
Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords
from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they
disseminate murder, misery, and anguish
as they see ﬁt.

an ally successfully assists with the recovery.

DIABOLIC LOCATIONS
The nine layers of Hell are the
planar home of all devils, and
they much prefer its tyrannically
ordered environs to anywhere else
in the multiverse. Yet devils can
be encountered anywhere mortals
can be tempted by infernal
bargains or seek diabolic aid. On
Golarion, the nation of Cheliax is
particularly aligned with Hell. Its
government is based upon Hellʼs
organization, and the state church
is that of Asmodeus.
Erinys (Fury Devil)
Erinyes exact vengeance and bloody justice for a creature’s crimes, torturing
and punishing their victims in ironic fashion before allowing them the escape
of death. While an erinys appears as a fallen angel and the ﬁrst erinyes shared
that origin, erinyes now originate in myriad ways, some promoted from lesser
devils and others shaped from lemures themselves forged from the souls of
torturers and persecutors. The erinyes’ origin is entwined with Eiseth, herself a
fallen angel and one of Hell’s most powerful demigods. The ﬁrst erinyes were all
considered to be Eiseth’s metaphorical daughters, but erinyes formed since that
time are no longer limited to a single gender.

HOLLOW WORLDS
Another classic place that
dinosaurs are found in ﬁction are
in “hollow worlds.” Some campaign
settings might not contain entire
isolated worlds within them, but
many, such as Golarion, have
expansive underground lands. The
deepest region of the Darklands
of Golarion—a realm called Orv—is
an optimal place to ﬁnd a hollow
world. Typically infused with magic
that allows for jungles to grow
deep underground (and sometimes
even sunlike orbs that illuminate
the lands from above, simulating
a day‑night cycle), areas such as
Deep Tolguth of Orv make perfect
places for dinosaurs to roam.
Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of
which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these
dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it’s likely that even larger
behemoths exist.

as most humanoids—in a single gulp. Although they can subsist on

exceptional balance. Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other
than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim’s ﬂesh with
their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long.
As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to
take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully
train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous
beasts with a steady diet of meat.
Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of
primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of
war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs
as part of executions or ritual sacriﬁces. Some xulgath cults even revere
tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their
part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in
this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers.
Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.
Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such
as the allosaurus, or even larger dinosaurs like the ravenous giganotosaurus.
Even the smallest tyrannosaurs, such as the nanotyrannus, are never smaller
than Large in size, yet despite this smaller stature, they are no less ferocious,
and those who would assume that a nanotyrannus is "safer" to train would
do well to think again!

OTHER ELEMENTALS
When energies from elemental
planes mix, unusual elemental life

magma elementals, while air and
water can create ice elementals.
Lightning elementals form from a
conjunction of ﬁre and air, while
water and earth give birth to mud

the vastness of the Great Beyond,
even more unusual elementals
might exist, although they are as

Water elementals can be very destructive, but often not intentionally so; just as

MEGAFAUNA MOUNTS
Orcs are known for riding strange
and fearsome beasts, particularly
megafauna like dire wolves
(page 334) and smilodons (page
53). Given the opportunity, orcs
also enlist drakes, manticores, and
anything else big and frightening
enough to suit their needs.
Orc
Orcs are violent, monstrous humanoids that live by the rule that might makes
right. They amass in brutal warbands both large and small, decimating and
robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements,
outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose fecundity and
sheer destructiveness leave an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. Survivors
of orc invasions are as likely to be fed to the orcs’ war beasts as they are to be
taken as slaves. Unspeakable atrocities await any outsiders brought back to orc
encampments, and to many, death is a far more preferable outcome compared to
capture by orcs.
Physically, orcs tower over most humanoids and look practically
custom-made for violence with their rough ﬂesh, sturdy bone, and iron‑hard
muscle. For all their tough looks, however, orcs are far from invincible.
They lack the discipline to conduct large-scale campaigns, for one thing,
and they typically lose their heads in the heat of battle. Even their skin scars
easily—though this is a source of pride to the orc people, since scars signify
strength and experience in battle. To orcs, the crisscross of old wounds are a
much a badge of pride and honor as any beheaded foe or claimed trophy.
Orcs are a people of violent passions in all that they do, not just war. Bonds
of blood are especially strong among orcs,
and lineage is important. The strongest
orc bands are typically made up of
brothers and sisters in more than
arms; orcs ﬁght harder when they
are protecting their own kinsfolk, and
orc warriors will ﬁght tirelessly to avenge fallen
family members. This emphasis on bloodlines is not
an altruistic one, however, and is in fact a double-edged
sword. Orcs whose families have been killed ﬁnd themselves
at the bottom of the clan’s totem pole, and even a famous
chieftain can become powerless overnight if their brethren aren’t there to
back them up.
The chaotic and fractious nature of orc culture results in a great
variety of beliefs, superstitions, and legacies among different clans. This
cultural divergence causes substantial inﬁghting among orc bands,
in many cases preventing the rise of larger orc nations. It can also
frustrate many attempts at diplomacy, as the taboos of one band
may be commonplace and thoroughly accepted practices among
others. Navigating a speciﬁc band’s culture can often mean the
difference between life and death to those who deal with
orcs off the ﬁeld of war. Although orcs, as a rule, rarely
deal with outsiders, they recognize the beneﬁts of trade
and willingly swap resources with other violent peoples
like hobgoblins, drow, and many humans.
Orc Brute
If orc armies are rarely well organized, this shortcoming can
likely be traced to the furious and undisciplined rank-and-ﬁle
brutes who make up the bulk of an orc warband.

SNAKES IN MYTHOLOGY
Snakes appear frequently
and prominently in the myths
and legends of many cultures
throughout the Inner Sea region.
In Ancient Osirion, snakes were
revered and associated both with
the evil serpent god Apep and the
good goddess Wadjet, the Green
Empress. Perhaps the best-known
example of snakes in Golarion’s
legends are the serpentfolk—
serpentine humanoids who ruled
vast swaths of the world in
prehistoric times and worshipped a
foul snake deity called Ydersius.
Giant Viper
The giant viper’s fangs are a frightening sight, with injection tubes as long as
daggers. The sheer amount of venom injected by a giant viper can cause severe
blood clotting and leave a victim utterly drained of vitality.
