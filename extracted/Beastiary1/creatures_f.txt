# FACELESS STALKER
================================================================================


Faceless Stalker (Ugothol)
Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols—also known as
faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to inﬁltrate settlements
and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing
unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and
eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend
alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their
aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today,
most faceless stalkers—like the less dangerous ulat-kinis—pursue programmed
goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live
as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures
themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers
of coastal towns.
By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in
humanoid societies, then guide inﬁltrated settlements down paths of destruction.
Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become
a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and
violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker inﬁltrators lead their followers
to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on—either because its true nature
is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all
local resources.
An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking
tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major
arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the ﬁrst clues found
to uncover a faceless stalker’s presence, though sometimes they are
overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.

ANCIENT INFLUENCES
The veiled masters inﬂuenced the
ancient Azlanti, and it was they who
invoked the apocalypse of Earthfall
to destroy Azlant when humanity
grew too prideful. That this act also
called down the magical Starstone,
an artifact capable of transforming
mortals into gods, was an ironic
turn of events considering the
alghollthus’ intolerance for faith.

Alghollthu Master (Aboleth)
Aboleths form the core of alghollthu society, and while they are the “common folk”
of their own societies, they see themselves as masters of all others. Unlike their
leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their
monstrous forms, appearing as primeval ﬁsh with tentacles. Masters of psychic
manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when
it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all
other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential
slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.

Flame Drake
The distant kin of red dragons, ﬂame drakes thankfully
lack the intelligence and ambition of their larger cousins,
but are no less territorial or violent. Flame drakes dwell
near volcanoes and magma, but it’s not unheard of for
one to drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills.
Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky
blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.

Jungle Drake
Believed to be related to green dragons, jungle drakes are dangerous hunters
equipped with a debilitating venom delivered by a large barbed stinger or
their noxious phlegm. Their wings are equipped with vestigial claws that
allow them to deftly maneuver through thick jungle foliage both in ﬂight
and on foot. Jungle drakes prefer to ambush their prey using hit-and-run
tactics, picking off the weakest members of a group and dragging their
victims off to ﬁnish their meals as they please.

================================================================================
# FROST DRAKE
================================================================================


Bestiary
Frost Drake
Frost drakes pose an immense danger in the frozen reaches they call home,
where they roam far and wide to hunt for prey such as caribou, wolves, small
bears, and tundra-dwelling people. Related as they are to white dragons, these
drakes share many habits and facets of their disposition with their draconic
cousins. Indeed, just as white dragons are among the most bestial and craven of
dragonkind, frost drakes are among the most depraved and openly malicious
of the drakes. They are also especially insolent, and are less likely to back
down from a ﬁght compared to other drakes. Many frost drakes have met their
ends trying to enact cruelties beyond their means, such as singly taking on an
entire castle or well-fortiﬁed township. Although a frost drake can wreak much
destruction on its own, tales of village-dwelling northerners banding together to
defend their homes from these rogue menaces are fairly common.
A frost drake’s hunting grounds are quite large. Those frost drakes that live
upon the permanently frozen peaks of high mountains have been known to
swoop down to snatch up prey from the lowlands, leaving frozen swaths of earth
from their breath as the only sign of their passing. Their frost-covered scales range
from deep royal blue to crisp cyan and sometimes feature sporadic patches of
violet. Their hides are thinner than most drakes’; when a frost drake is inhaling
in preparation to launch its signature frozen breath, the monster’s ice-blue blood
can be seen beneath its scales.

of liquid up to 60 feet that explodes
into a 20-foot-burst cloud of freezing
mist. Those in the burst take 8d6 cold
damage (DC 25 basic Reﬂex save). The mist
cakes all surfaces in the area with a sheet of
slippery ice that turns the area into diﬃcult
terrain for 2d4 rounds. It can’t use Freezing Mist
Breath again for 1d6 rounds.
Ice Climb A frost drake can climb on ice as though
it had the listed climb Speed. It ignores diﬃcult terrain
and greater diﬃcult terrain from ice and snow and doesn’t
risk falling when crossing ice.

DRAKE RESOURCES
While every adventurer knows
that dragon hide can be crafted
into potent armor or weapons,
drake hide holds no such intrinsic
value. Nonetheless, drake
scales and horns are physically
impressive, and to the uneducated
buyer, might seem at ﬁrst glance
to be legitimate. Unscrupulous
leatherworkers have been known
to use drake hides to craft and
sell counterfeit dragonhide
armor, so potential buyers
should remain on the
lookout for scams.

Desert Drake
Distant cousins of blue dragons that lack their relatives’ magical talents and
intelligence, these desert-dwelling drakes are nonetheless dangerous ambush
predators, preying upon isolated desert travelers and outposts for food and
supplies. They retain their true-blooded forebears’ resistance to electricity and
afﬁnity for sandy environs. Desert drakes’ scales range in coloration from rustbrown to light tan and ocher shades, mimicking the colors of the dunes they
call home.
Desert drakes are among the lightest and most compact of the drakes, though
this shouldn’t be mistaken for frailty. Their swooped-back horns and featherthin wings are adapted to make burrowing as easy as possible. Indeed, a desert
drake’s powerful neck makes wriggling through sand and other loose scree as
easy as walking for it.

lava), ooze mephits (which spit out
foul-smelling acid), salt mephits
(who can draw moisture out of the
environs and nearby creatures),
and steam mephits (which can call

Water Mephit
Water mephits are consummate jokers who are always happy to trade a favor
for a good laugh. Just as ﬁre mephits are the ones who cleave closest to evil
without fully crossing over into true villainy, water mephits are the friendliest
of the mephits and therefore the closest to good. Still, one should take care
in making assumptions about a water mephit’s benevolence, for no one can
reliably count on them to keep their inborn need for pranks and trickery at bay
for long. Water mephits have blue-green skin that shimmers in light like ﬁsh
scales. Though water mephits’ wings look more like webbed ﬁns than limbs
capable of ﬂight, they can ﬂap their wings to ﬂy through the air as easily as any
other mephit. Water mephits prefer to swim, when possible, and they leave the
water only when they must.

FAILED FLESHWARPS
Not every ﬂeshwarp emerges
from its vat capable of survival.
Many perish within minutes, as
organs fundamental for life simply
fail or collapse in on themselves.
Fleshwarpers can usually recycle
failed ﬂeshwarps back into the mix
quickly enough, but now and then,
remnants known as ﬂeshdregs are
stable enough to live pain-wracked
lives of their own. These foul
creatures often infest ﬂeshwarper
holdings, like rats or other vermin
do in less awful locations.
Fleshwarp
Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies.
They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying
transformative technique known as ﬂeshwarping. Though the ﬂeshwarping
process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow
torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their ﬂesh
and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of ﬂesh
results in countless variations of ﬂeshwarps, and the following are just a couple
of examples of these horrors.
Grothlut
Sluglike abominations, grothluts are ﬂeshwarps that were once humans. While
their head and torsos are vaguely human, their arms are rubbery and move
awkwardly at their sides. Wretched creatures, they moan piteously when other
creatures are near, perhaps as the last remnants of their shattered human
consciousness pleads to be free from their horrid warped form.
Many ﬂeshwarpers consider the grothlut to be a failure of a creation, as the
transformation all but stamps out the human consciousness. Others disagree,
arguing that warping the creature’s mind makes it all the more useful, since
its stupidity makes it pliable and easy to herd. Drow typically use grothluts
as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position,
grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces
before more-valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been
nauseated by the grothluts’ exploded organs and ﬂesh.

Frost Giant
Frost giants are remorseless marauders who
pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near
them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely
territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend
it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in
search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are
ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and
prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim
themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from
their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to
be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the
current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which
the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the
victorious challenger assumes control.
Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their
appearance is reﬂective of a people weathered and hardened by
relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear
metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain
beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their ﬂesh ranges
from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or
dirty yellow color.
A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs
approximately 2,800 pounds.

Cloud Giant
The graceful and regal cloud giants have skin of milky white to powdery blue.
Unlike most giants, cloud giants are quite morally diverse. A handful are neutral,
but of the others, roughly half are good, while the other half are evil. Good cloud
giants are often civic-minded builders of roads and settlements, and are interested
in trading goods as well as cultural innovations. It’s not uncommon for such
giants to approach their neighbors with diplomacy and build strong relationships
with other peaceful peoples. Conversely, evil cloud giants are often isolationist
and xenophobic. Preferring hidden mountain valleys and settlements in the caves
and among the crags of lonely peaks, they raid for what they want and treat other
creatures like inconsequential insects. These opposing philosophies can generate
a great deal of strife among neighboring cloud giant communities, and the raiders
often threaten the trade deals of their peaceful cousins.
Legends persist of ﬂoating cities ruled by magically gifted cloud giant
queens and kings. While most cloud giants plainly state that such claims
are pure fantasy, others are mysteriously tight-lipped or evasive about
the matter.

Alchemical Golem
This golem is a walking alchemical nightmare capable of inﬂicting all
manner of painful wounds. Its ability to follow orders is granted
by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that ﬂoats in its
dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used
in its creation might retain fragments of memories or
even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem
with a personality and agenda of its own.

LICH CRAFTING
Liches spend a good deal of their
downtime crafting magic items. In
particular, a lich will create items
that help it defeat and overcome
known problems. This fact can
prove especially dangerous if the
PCs encounter a lich but fail to
destroy its phylactery, for the next
time they encounter the lich, it will
likely have just the right tools to
overcome their defenses.
Lich
To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue
immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of
a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the ﬁnal step by imbibing
a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich.
While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulﬁll some long-term
plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulﬁll some malevolent
purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries
with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves
and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich’s new power.
After its metamorphosis, a lich often ﬁnds some quiet place to dwell, typically
protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich
requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals
(if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason
begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane,
further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the
more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly
puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich’s servants and guardians are absolutely
loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of
compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a
lich’s lair is a good indicator of the undead’s current mental state.
For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to
guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells
doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difﬁcult to bargain with, though the threat of
damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.
Creating A Lich
A lich can be any type of spellcaster, as long as it has the ability to perform a
ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a
spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a lich, follow these steps.
Increase the spellcaster’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows.
• Increase spell DCs and spell attack roll by 2.
LICH ABIlITIES
A lich gains the undead trait and becomes evil. Liches lose all abilities that come
from being a living creature.
A lich gains the following abilities.
Darkvision
Saving Throws +1 status bonus to all saves vs. positive
Negative Healing
Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately
transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery
is found and destroyed.
Immunities death eﬀects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious
Resistances cold 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning)
Frightful Presence (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 30
Hand of the Lich All liches have a hand unarmed attack that deals 1d8 negative damage
for every 3 levels and inﬂicts a paralyzing touch. This attack has the ﬁnesse trait.
Drain Phylactery Ȳ˓ Frequency once per day; Eﬀect The lich taps into its phylactery’s
power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest level the lich can cast, even if the spell
being cast is not one of the lich’s prepared spells. The lich’s phylactery doesn’t need to
be present for the lich to use this ability.
Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the
lich’s hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich’s spell DC – 4. The
creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is
paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals
the victim is alive.

LICH TREASURE
The lair of a lich is usually ﬁlled
with several magical treasures,
particularly items that the undead
can use based on its spellcasting
abilities. Scrolls, wands, and
staves are quite common,
as are books of lore and
tomes containing entirely
new spells.
AlTERNaTE LICH ABIlITIES
Although the abilities on page 220 are standard for a lich, you can create a
more unusual lich by substituting any one of the following abilities for frightful
presence, hand of the lich, Drain Phylactery, or paralyzing touch.
Blasphemous Utterances (arcane, aura, enchantment, mental) 10 feet. The lich is
accompanied by a constant echo of blasphemous murmurs and tainted whispers. A
creature in the aura takes a –2 circumstance penalty to saves against mental eﬀects
and can’t take actions that have the concentrate trait unless they succeed at a DC 10
ﬂat check. Failing this check wastes the action.
Cold Beyond Cold The lich’s hand Strike deals cold damage instead of negative, and
instead of being paralyzed, the target is slowed 2. A successful Fortitude save reduces
this to slowed 1 (or negates it on a critical success).
Dark Deliverance The lich has resistance to positive equal to its level.
Siphon Life Ǻȓ Trigger The lich deals damage with its hand Strike. Eﬀect The lich regains
Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt.
Void Shroud (aura, death, necromancy) 30 feet. The lich is surrounded by an aura of death,
drawing forth souls to be consumed by the lich’s constant hunger. Living creatures in
the emanation take a –2 status penalty to saves against fear and death eﬀects. In
addition, any creature that starts its turn in the area gains the doomed 1 condition
unless it succeeds at a Will save against the lich’s spell DC – 4.
Lich
A wizard whose insatiable desire for arcane power eclipsed their
mortal life, the lich is a truly devious and versatile spellcaster.
