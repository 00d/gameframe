Pleroma
Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation
of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is
a constant state of ﬂux between these two poles, their forms a shifting
cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects ﬂit in and out of
existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature,
self-contained universe.
Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and
malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They
believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this
essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of
the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

Envisioning Pleromas care little for communication with other creatures,
but when they do convey information, they do so wordlessly through a
series of psychic projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100
feet but is understandable to all creatures regardless of whether they have
a language, though the aeon’s meaning to non-aeons can be vague and is often
mysterious. An aeon can use this ability to communicate ﬂawlessly with any other
aeon on the same plane as itself.
INEVITABLE FATES
The fact that the aeons known
as inevitables seem to be on the
decline is taken by some planar
scholars as metaphysical proof
that entropy is on the rise and the
Great Beyond is past its prime and
on the way to the end of this cycle
of reality.

Energy Touch A pleroma’s touch deals its choice of positive or negative damage, but
neither energy can be used to heal a creature.
Sphere of Creation ʚʖ (incapacitation, magical) Three
times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-footdiameter sphere of white energy that hovers
above its left hand. By using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can
cause the sphere to ﬂy 10 feet. The sphere can
move in any direction, ignoring diﬃcult terrain,
but it can’t move farther than 300 feet away from
the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves
behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either
new terrain (the pleroma’s choice of normal, diﬃcult, or greater
diﬃcult terrain) or a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural
substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). The sphere can enter the
space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC
43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful
save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM’s choice away
from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 positive damage (even
if they are living) and are pushed away as a success. Those who
critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure,
become one with the new material and can be restored only via a
10th-level spell. A pleroma can have only one Sphere of Creation
in existence at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in a
ﬂash of blinding light after 1d4 minutes. All creatures within 30
feet of the sphere of creation when it vanishes must succeed at
a DC 43 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded.
Sphere of Oblivion ʚʖ (incapacitation, magical) Three times
per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of
complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right
hand. It can move and control the sphere in the same
manner as its Sphere of Creation. The sphere is an
empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing
in on itself and winking out of existence. Once
manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged
attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any
unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed.
Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube
per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with eﬀects similar
to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage (even to undead) on
a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the creature into material. Such a
destroyed creature can be restored only by a 10th-level spell.
OTHER AEONS
Aeons are among the least
understood of the Great Beyond’s
immortal creatures, and they
have a wide range of powers
and abilities. Far more aeons
exist than those presented here,
including guardians of time like the
four-armed bythos and the weirdly
symmetrical theletos, which
moderates the duality between
freedom and fate.

Alghollthu
In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult
powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained
countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their
slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative
magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this
meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further
shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the
heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these
societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horriﬁcally
transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.
In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave
societies and sought to wipe the slate clean—both starting anew and punishing
those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical
power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they’d
manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of
their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew
strong once again—this time without alghollthu inﬂuence.
Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation
of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic
realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their
plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a
frightening possibility—that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the
surface once again.
Skum (Ulat-Kini)
The most numerous of the alghollthus are the
ulat-kinis, a servitor race created from human stock
to serve as rank-and-ﬁle soldiers in alghollthu armies.
At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed
massive legions and enjoyed signiﬁcant power over other species. When the
alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering
ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battleﬁeld defeats and purposeful
exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society
degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist
in the depths of the earth or along isolated
coastlines. Few remember their own species’
name, instead using the epithet their foes
gave them: “skum.”

# PURPLE WORM

Bestiary
Cave Worm
Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world,
eating whatever material they ﬁnd. Named for their distinctive colorations, these
worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms
of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales
speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray
worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
Purple Worm
The purple worm is the most common and infamous of the cave worms, a
much‑feared monster wandering the twisting tunnels of the Darklands that is capable
of carving out entire cave systems. Tunnels bored by a purple worm don’t always last
long after these creature’s passage, and areas where they nest are maddening mazes
of passageways that lead nowhere, yet navigating the labyrinth to ﬁnd the worm’s
central nest often yields amazing treasures left behind by the worm’s prior victims.

The adventure need not end simply

them in a cavern far oﬀ from
where they started. Whatever
the speciﬁcs, you can easily draw
from folklore and popular ﬁction
to create your own "belly of the

wind up on the wrong side of the
monster’s scales.

================================================================================

RAVENOUS TUNNELERS
Cave worms are infamous for
being nearly unstoppable and for
swallowing their prey whole. A
cave worm also ingests earth and
minerals as it tunnels. The worm
processes some of these minerals,
resulting in its armored hide and
toxic sting, while it leaves others
behind—often including treasure or
other valuables that incidentally
serve to lure explorers into the
worm’s proximity and, more often
than not, its gullet. While not
completely mindless, cave worms
are diﬃcult to train, and most
attempts to domesticate them (in
theory, a cave worm would make
an excellent mining resource)
result in disaster.

enfeebled 2 (1 round); Stage 3 8d6 poison damage and enfeebled 2 (1 round).
Regurgitate The purple worm can violently regurgitate a creature or boulder it has
swallowed to make a ranged Strike. The Strike deals bludgeoning damage depending
on the size of the projectile: Tiny deals 2d6+13, Small 3d6+13, Medium 4d6+13,
Large 5d6+13, and Huge 6d6+13. A regurgitated creature takes falling damage from
the height of the target or from 20 feet, whichever is greater.
Boulders occupy space in the worm’s stomach as a creature of equivalent size, and
purple worms often have several boulders swallowed. A purple worm can use a single
action to swallow a new boulder.
Rock Tunneler A purple worm can burrow through solid stone at a Speed of 20 feet. It
can leave a tunnel if it desires, and it usually does.
Swallow Whole Ȱɵ Huge, 3d6+9 bludgeoning, Rupture 24
Thrash ʚʖ The worm makes a Strike once against each creature in its reach. It can
Strike up to once with its jaws, up to once with its stinger, and any number of times
with its body. Each attack counts toward the worm’s multiple attack penalty, but the
multiple attack penalty doesn’t increase until after it makes all the attacks.
Azure Worm
The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in ﬂooded tunnels
than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie in
wait within the walls, ﬂoor, or even ceiling of ﬂooded caverns, ready to spring
out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is
particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact
that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from
the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an
azure worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing
a hunting party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.

INFERNAL CONTRACTS
The infernal contracts created by
contract devils are not the only
ways a devil can engage a mortal in
a binding agreement, but they are
the most convenient. Other devils
must perform complex rituals or
jump through bureaucratic hoops to
organize a contract with a mortal,
and in most cases the easiest
solution for devils in this situation
is to simply enlist the aid of a
contract devil.
prices seemingly lesser than their soul all at once, though in this case, the devil
carefully manipulates the price to drive the signatory toward the forces of
law and evil, and therefore ultimately to Hell anyway. Contract devils are tall
creatures with skin tones that range from bronze to crimson and large curving
horns extending from their bodies, over which they often drape favored or
important contracts.

Draft Contract ̂ˬ (conjuration, divine, manipulate)
The contract devil produces an infernal contract for
a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide
range of abilities and eﬀects, akin to the power of a
wish spell but fulﬁlled to the letter by the contract
devil. To receive any of those beneﬁts, the mortal must
willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that
point, the mortal’s soul is bound to the contract devil
and Hell.
 While the contract is in eﬀect, the victim can’t be
restored to life except by wish or similar magic. If
the mortal is restored to life by those means, the
contract devil knows which mortal came to life and
can locate the creature or creatures who restored
the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the eﬀects of a
locate spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms
of an infernal contract is diﬃcult and often dangerous.

FIRE AND ICE
The classic depiction of Hell
is of a burning wasteland of
magma and volcanoes, a searing
landscape rife with the screaming
souls of the damned. Yet those
who have visited Hell know the
awful truth—for its torments do
not cease at eternal burning.
Some regions of hell are perpetual
frozen reaches of razor-sharp ice
and ﬂesh-scouring wind, while
others are miasmic swamps ﬁlled
with poison and disease. Hell does
not limit its torturous toolbox
merely to the ﬁres for which it is
so well known!
Gelugon (Ice Devil)
Insectile ice devils are strategists and masterminds in Hell’s armies, using their
superior intellect to strike against their enemies and spread Hell’s inﬂuence
throughout the planes. An ice devil rarely breaks their solitary contemplation of
strategy save to pursue a plan they have devised. They can be enticed otherwise
only by an exchange of services to be determined at a later time, adding to
the pieces they can play on the board. Occasionally, a mortal strategist of
outstanding skill might amuse an ice devil enough for the gelugon to agree to
a contest of strategy, typically a strategic board game like chess, to decide a
dispute. In the unlikely event the devil loses such a contest, they inevitably go to
great lengths to later obtain that mortal’s services for their own infernal ends.

DEZULLON VENOM
The dezullon is most well known
for the psychoactive eﬀects of
its secretions. Aﬀected creatures
suﬀer amnesia, brieﬂy forgetting
where they are and why they are
in pain. Some creatures, desperate
to escape the past, willingly
expose themselves to a dezullon’s
amnesia venom in an eﬀort to
make their painful memories fade.
Dezullon
Dezullons are dangerous carnivorous pitcher plants that dwell in forested
regions with thick canopies. They hunt for meat along the forest’s understory
when not sunning themselves in the boughs above. Dezullons are smart enough
to notice that some creatures are attracted by shiny things, and sometimes use
such objects to set up ambushes. To assume that the dezullon’s ambulations are
slow simply because the creature has a root structure is a foolish mistake; many
an adventurer has been crushed to death by this surprisingly agile plant. In
addition, these dangerous plants are expert climbers, making their pursuit even
more difﬁcult to escape from.
A hungry dezullon keeps prey off-balance by spilling its putrid, psychoactive
digestive juices from its central pitcher. In addition to being highly acidic, the
enzymes in a dezullon’s digestive tract, once expelled, inﬂict a victim with powerful
hallucinations and amnesia. This secondary effect makes dezullons highly sought
after in some circles, including avid drug users, experimental doctors, and
criminals who deal in poisons.
Many varieties of dezullon exist, including lumbering giants of
incredible size, those that have tiny, cup-shaped pitchers that
proliferate along lengths of creeping ivy like suckers on a squid’s
tentacles, and others with hundreds of blood-red, razor-sharp
leaves that protrude from the inside of their pitchers like
a leech’s teeth. This latter variety is especially dangerous,
since the leaves can all but eviscerate creatures that become
ensconced inside their pitchers.

Jinkins are sadistic tinkers who steal and sabotage items and take great

when a creature dares to remove one of their curses. Rarely content to
wreak simple mayhem, jinkins also take immense pleasure in torture and
murder, though they prefer to lead
victims into traps designed to capture
or incapacitate rather than kill outright.
Deep pits are favorites, since victims
who survive the fall face a slow death from
starvation and thirst. Jinkins enjoy gathering
at the edge of pits to mock, tease, and torment.

# PEGASUS
================================================================================


Bestiary
CORRUPTED PEGASI
When a foul inﬂuence from the
ﬁendish planes, a necromantic
blight, or any other sinister
inﬂuence spreads through a
wilderness, pegasi can become
corrupted. These neutral evil
pegasi have the same statistics
as those presented here, but are
much more violent.
Pegasus
The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an aerial mount.
Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild
creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively
resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an
unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the
shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet.
Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and
honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and
offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who
seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time
coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts
a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle
interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical.
In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish
territories on remote mountains where they
are relatively safe
from hunters and
slavers. They mature at the
same rate as horses and can even
breed with other equines, though the
outcome of such unions is typically a foal with
the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions,
the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in
a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an

SERVANTS OF SARENRAE
While phoenixes are not denizens
of the Outer Planes, they have
long been associated with the
goddess Sarenrae. Indeed, many
phoenixes view the Dawnﬂower as
their patron and subscribe to her
mission of redeeming those who
have fallen to evil.
Phoenix
The phoenix is a primordial bird made of heat and ﬂame that dwells in the
most inhospitable regions of the desert. Though highly intelligent and brimming
with compassion, the phoenix is best-known for its iconic ability to resurrect
itself when slain, emerging reborn from the ashes of its own corpse. Phoenixes
are often sought out for their knowledge or healing abilities, as they cannot
abide the sight of suffering and deny their succor only to the most foul and
irredeemable of creatures.
Phoenixes enjoy the company of metallic dragons, and when the two dwell in
close proximity, they can forge lifelong friendships, sharing their resources and
words of wisdom while keeping each other updated on regional news.
While most phoenixes are benevolent, they are not infallible. When a
phoenix loses its way or falls under the inﬂuence of evil, it still retains its strong
appetite for knowledge. Evil phoenixes are known
to assault universities and libraries in their pursuit
for power—not only to gain new information, but
also to set ﬁre to the texts and thus hoard that
knowledge for themselves.

OTHER PLANAR SCIONS
As many types of planar scions
exist as planes of existence, and
even then there are signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between scions
depending on the exact nature of
their extraplanar forebears. Angelic
scions are known as aasimars,
ﬁendish scions are called tieﬂings,
and monitor scions are urobians.
Planar Scion
Many immortals dwell upon the other planes of the Great Beyond. Some are
benevolent and kindly, like angels. Others are cruel and destructive, like demons.
And some ﬁt roles outside of morality, like psychopomps. It’s far from unheard
of that mortals and immortals alike become entangled romantically, and the
children of such engagements carry a supernatural element in their bloodlines
for generations to follow. After the ﬁrst generation, this otherworldly inﬂuence
usually lies dormant, but now and then, the inﬂuence can manifest strongly in
descendants many years later. These inheritors of extraplanar legacies are known
collectively as planar scions.
Tiefling
Tieﬂings are planar scions with ﬁendish blood. One of the most common types is
pitborn, who bear a demonic corruption infesting their mortal bloodline. Some
strive to live above their forebear’s ﬁendish reputation, but many, such as this
tieﬂing adept, simply accept their label and delve fully into evil.

POLTERGEIST TREASURE
A poltergeist needs items to
hurl as weapons, and over the
centuries of use, only durable
objects survive its rampages.
Silver dinnerware, hatchets, and
books might all be found in a
poltergeist’s collection.
Poltergeist
When a creature dies, and for whatever reason its spirit is unable or unwilling
to leave the site of its death, that spirit may manifest as a poltergeist: a restless
invisible spirit that is still able to manipulate physical objects. Many poltergeists
perished in a way that resulted from or has led to extreme emotional trauma.

Rejuvenation (necromancy, occult) When a poltergeist is

only if someone determines the reason for its existence and
sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.

Eﬀect The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a
skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Each creature within 30 feet
must attempt a DC 21 Will save, becoming frightened 2 on a failure.
On a critical failure, it’s also ﬂeeing for as long as it’s frightened. On
a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. At the
start of its next turn, the poltergeist becomes invisible again.
Telekinetic Storm ʚʖ (concentrate, evocation, occult); The
poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects,
such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either
spreading them out among multiple foes or directing
them at one target.
•
When this eﬀect is spread out among multiple foes,
the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a
–2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These
count as one attack for the poltergeist’s multiple attack
penalty, and the penalty doesn’t increase until after all
the attacks.
• When this eﬀect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object
Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 damage
on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure.
DISTURBED REST
One of the most common ways
for a poltergeist to form is when
its burial site is desecrated by
the construction of a dwelling.
This is usually an accident, but
some evil creatures seek out such
burial sites, intentionally creating
poltergeists to serve as guardians.

WHAT IS A KAMI?
The spirit creatures known
collectively as kami were originally
protectors of the natural world,
especially those things unable to
protect themselves. Over time,
though, their remit has grown,
and now kami protectors extend
their services to include artiﬁcial
structures and items. In theory,
any animal, plant, object, or
location could be served by its own
kami, but not everything has yet
been blessed with such protection.
The classiﬁcation of which objects
warrant kami protection—and
those that don’t—is confusing and
complicated to all save the kami,
who ﬁnd the organizational system
perfectly logical.
Poracha
Porachas are feline beasts native to the mystical Forest of Spirits in Tian Xia. In their
natural form, these graceful eight-legged creatures sport a gray tabby coat of fur
streaked with lines of olive green, but they are rarely seen this way. Even the youngest
porachas are capable of hiding within objects, making them incredibly elusive and
rarely seen except on their own terms. Because porachas can so effortlessly blend in
with the forest and emerge from its dark corners in an instant, superstitious locals
believe these beasts are related to kami—nature spirits who embody individual trees,
stones, or other elements of nature in the Forest of Spirits. The truth is that while
porachas frequently associate with kami, they are their own breed of mysterious
monster with powers over time and space that set them apart from nature spirits.
The poracha’s most iconic feature is its ability to bend reality to teleport, or jaunt,
short distances. But a poracha can also rest within objects, allowing it to safely sleep
inside. Given that a poracha experiences time very slowly while hiding within objects,
it can sleep inside of one for an extended period. Once it wakes, a poracha departs to
play in the living world. Porachas especially enjoy resting inside roadside milestones,
to maximize their chances of coming across travelers.
Porachas rarely tread humanoid-occupied lands, preferring the company of the
kami and their natural habitat in the Forest of Spirits. Though they enjoy occasional
conversation, they’re extremely sensitive to sound; they speak softly and request the
same from those they speak with. Their territories span vast swaths of the wood,
making them ideal allies for hunters or treasure seekers who would otherwise become
lost in the dense trees. But porachas are nothing if not ﬁckle, and typically demand
inscrutable favors in return for their aid, such as the planting of a rare sapling in a
particular grotto or the clearing of an invasive monster species around a treasured
spring. Any attempt to coerce or trick a poracha into service is ill advised, for these
sacred beasts have many friends among the kami as well as others of their kind.
Though they generally don’t travel in groups, porachas know where to ﬁnd more of
their kind in times of need, and an organized pack of porachas is a disorienting threat.

PROTEAN DIVINITIES
The most powerful of all proteans
are a group of demigods known
collectively as protean lords.
Yet even their vast might pales
in comparison to that of the
mysterious Speakers of the
Depths. The Speakers are the most
enigmatic of the Maelstrom’s gods—
even their exact nature is unknown,
and scholars disagree as to whether
they are even divinities or just
aspects of the Maelstrom itself.
Protean
Guardians of disorder and natives of the primal plane of chaos known as the
Maelstrom, proteans consider it their calling to spread bedlam and hasten entropic
ends. The most powerful proteans are demigods known collectively as the protean
lords, although they are mysterious entities whose cults on the Material Plane
tend to be obscure and secretive.
Proteans divide themselves into a loose caste system and possess a dizzying
variety of powers. Most proteans have a serpentine body with the head of a
primeval beast. Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact—that scions of
dissolution and disorder would share so many features—pointing out that even in
the purest chaos there is some semblance of order. Others note that the serpentine
form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the
dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have
little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion
and lack of consensus surrounding their kind. After all, if even chaos cannot be
trusted to be chaotic, would that not be the purest form of entropy?
Warpwaves
Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and
space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves.
When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and
consult the table below for the speciﬁc effect on that creature. Unless indicated
otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect
negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.
D8
Warpwave Eﬀect
Clumsy 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Confused and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points
Dazzled (permanent on a critical failure)
Enfeebled 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Immobilized by ﬁlaments of energy
Quickened (Stride, Strike, or Step only)
Slowed 1
Stupeﬁed 2 (3 on a critical failure)
Voidworm
Other proteans don’t consider the ﬂying, iridescent beings known as voidworms
to be part of a protean caste at all, but instead merely a shameful side effect of
the Maelstrom’s constantly churning energy. To call a voidworm a protean in
the presence of a more powerful protean is as sure a way to instigate combat
as any.
Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as
proteans. They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in
schools of up to 20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities.
Elsewhere (such as on the Material Plane), voidworms are mesmerized by the
principle of object permanence; many latch onto speciﬁc features of a region
(such as a hillside or pond) and ﬂit through the air around it for months or even
years as they wait for the object of their curiosity to change. Minor changes—
such as a tree’s change of color in the fall, a corpse’s slow decay, or periodic
venting of steam from a geyser—all fascinate voidworms. A voidworm is about
2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.

JINX EATERS
In the pirate-controlled archipelago
of the Shackles, tengus occupy a
unique social niche, since many
pirates believe that a tengu’s
presence on board a ship wards
oﬀ bad luck. Known as “jinx
eaters,” these tengu are treated as
mascots by their pirate crews. Jinx
eaters don’t mind this treatment,
however, since it allows them
to escape much of the drudgery
associated with working on a
ship. When a tengu is sailing with
pirates afraid of ill fortune, the
claim that “hunger leads to bad
luck” secures comfort and respect
for the jinx eater more eﬀectively
than any bribe.
Tengu
Crow-like humanoids, tengus are a canny and clever people who can be found
across all of Golarion. Tengus are used to being minorities and facing suspicion
wherever they travel, so by necessity many possess a knack for languages as
well as for blades. They live on the fringes of society and tend to ﬂock toward
less-than-legal occupations, earning them their reputation for being streetwise
and unscrupulous—a label that, in turn, perpetuates the tengus’ oppressive cycle
of discrimination and illegitimate work.
Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many
would say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have
strong, thick beaks, as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs.
Most of a tengu’s body is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark
brown and midnight blue to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not
unheard of. Like many avian creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them
much lighter than other humanoids of their size, although few tengus possess the
wings necessary to ﬂy naturally. A tengu’s speech might be punctuated by quick
clucks or throaty cawing, and many tengus practice conversation diligently to rid
themselves of these involuntary ticks. Rufﬂing of the feathers and compulsive,
jerky movements of the neck are other trademark habits. Tengus reproduce by
laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches in diameter and 16 inches
tall and takes 4 months to hatch.
Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger
kingdoms and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually
distinctive than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and
persecuted more often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus
tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and
people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and
those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city
quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world is not a
friendly place and that they must look out for themselves.
