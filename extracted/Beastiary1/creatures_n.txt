plus Grab
Bonds of Iron ʚʖ (attack, conjuration, occult) Once per day, an annis
hag can cause a cage built of cold iron ﬁngernails to spring out of
nothingness at a range of up to 30 feet, attempting an Athletics
check to Grapple against the target’s Fortitude DC; if the target has a
weakness to cold iron, the annis hag gains a +2 circumstance bonus
to this check. Unlike a normal Grapple, the annis hag doesn’t need
to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful
attempt lasts until the creature escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to
crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by
attacking it. It has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.
Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, occult, polymorph, transmutation) The
hag can take on the appearance of any Medium female humanoid. This
doesn’t change her Speed or her attack and damage bonuses with her
Strikes but might change the damage type her Strikes deal (typically to
bludgeoning).

Night Hag
Night hags are thieves and merchants of mortal souls.
These foul creatures collect souls in dark gems or
crystalline jars to sell in ﬁendish markets, and are
themselves empowered by potent magic jewels known
as heartstones. They haunt the Ethereal Plane, where
they prey upon mortals in their dreams, debilitating
them with horriﬁc nightmares as they rest. A night
hag may ﬁnd a particular target and haunt them
continuously over the course of weeks, slowly and
cruelly breaking down the victim’s will and ability to
resist, until their soul is forfeit.
A night hag is a canny mastermind and soul broker, willing to
consider any deal as long as she is convinced she has the upper hand.
Although a night hag ﬁnds it easy to travel the Ethereal Plane and
prey upon helpless souls that can’t ﬁght back, these souls are also the
least desirable to the evil outsiders the night hag bargains with, and
so a night hag gathers allies and minions that allow her to prey on
more potent souls without personally risking herself. Their favored
minions are nightmares, with whom they share a special bond.
Above all, night hags avoid ﬁghting foes that can harry them on the Ethereal
Plane, picking ﬁghts only when they are certain they can escape.

Dream Haunting (enchantment, occult, mental) If a night hag is

HARPY EXILES
Most harpies are cruel and
sadistic, but now and then a harpy
manages to escape from its family
and becomes exposed to the
wider world. Eyes opened, these
harpy exiles are almost always
more mild-mannered,
cleanly, and open
to non-combat
interactions.
Harpy
Harpies are ﬁlthy amalgamations of human and bird, resembling feral humans
with wings, talons, and mouths full of sharp teeth. They use captivating songs
to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transﬁxed. They enjoy
causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a
savory ﬂavor in the ﬂesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient
prey—humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if
sufﬁciently hungry, they dislike their ﬂavor and avoid eating them if possible. This
doesn’t comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.
Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters
of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with
danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep
clean, though these efforts have mixed results.
Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They
are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall
and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use
relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in
learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of
war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of
the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among
their kind and terrors among their victims.

HOBGOBLINS AND MAGIC
Hobgoblins generally distrust magic,
especially arcane magic, which
they derisively call “elf magic.”
In the absence of magic, they
wholeheartedly embrace alchemy,
combining it with their natural
aptitude for engineering to great
destructive eﬀect. They grudgingly
accept divine magic, due to a
grudging respect for the power of
healing magic in times of war.
Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins may appear to outsiders to be the most civilized of goblinkind, but
their civilization is hardly one of kindness and equality—instead, they revel
in all that is militaristic, tyrannical, cruel, and destructive. Hobgoblins are
singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and
maintaining conﬂict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle.
Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efﬁciently and effectively in
groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or
a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before
declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or
territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray,
ashen skin.
Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin
is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a
rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and
obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that
they’re fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes
is an individual hobgoblin’s best hope for promotion through the ranks, but
failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though
brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless
of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers
based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat
roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers,
quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that
support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the
rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger
whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and
most efﬁcient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so
is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as
dead weight. Hobgoblins don’t usually engage in trade
with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes,
preferring to take what they want by force.
Hobgoblin Soldier
Soldiers make up the bulk of hobgoblin society,
whether that society is a village or a military unit.

================================================================================
# NILITH
================================================================================


FROM THE DREAMLANDS
The nilith’s association with the
remote and little-understood
Dreamlands, also known as the
Dimension of Dreams, is unusual.
They draw power from a latent
dreaming connection to that
realm, but they are native to the
Material Plane.
Nilith
The sleek, dark niliths resemble hairless, emaciated tree sloths. These creatures
are intensely dangerous and fearsome, with red glowing eyes, wicked claws, and
mouths full of needlelike teeth. Niliths feed off the emotions, fears, and ﬂesh of
the living, and folktales posit that those who have nightmares of these creatures
are fated to one day be eaten by them. Niliths draw intense joy from tormenting
sapient creatures, often focusing their predations on the pious and the just, from
whom they draw forth their most basic fears and worst thoughts and revel in their
victims’ subsequent terror. More often than not, these despicable manipulators
wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the
patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a
nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts
and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its ﬂesh and moving onto the
next victim.
Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant
dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding
machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected. Scholars
and dimensional travelers have attempted to uncover the exact mechanisms of
this mysterious connection, but they have yet to decipher the truth. Indeed, many
who investigate the nature of the nilith’s bond are driven to madness before
getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help
explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for
thousands of years.
Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of
their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to
taste the horrors they bring to others.

INSPIRATIONS FOR ART
Nymphs are living manifestations
of beauty and grace, and as such
they are often the subjects of
art—sculpture and paintings in
particular. Promising a nymph
to immortalize them in a work
of art can be an excellent way to
secure that nymph’s favor, but one
should take care to ensure that the
nymph admires and is proud of the
artistic eﬀort’s ﬁnal result, lest the
nymph be insulted and lash out
with her powerful magic.
Nymph
Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven
features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common
of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many
other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All
nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a speciﬁc tree or pond,
or even—in the case of nymph queens—whole forests or massive bodies of water.
Naiad
Naiads protect streams, ponds, springs, and other natural bodies of fresh water. While
most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs
congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic
and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads’ bonds to their bodies of water
permit more ﬂexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids
and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally
become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise
threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature.

Dryad
Dryads are fey guardians of the trees and creatures who dwell in wooded areas.
They prefer using indirect methods to dissuade those who would harm their sacred
groves and beloved forests, but they are not above using enchantments to enlist
the aid of allies when evil threats cannot be dissuaded with words alone. In times
of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at
harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.
Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied
to a speciﬁc tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree
are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to
match their ward. For instance, kraneiai, or cherry-tree dryads, have beautiful pink
coloration and concern themselves with the fragile beauty of life.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentration, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The naunet can
take the appearance of any Small, Medium, or Large animal, beast, or humanoid. This
doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes but might
change the damage type its Strikes deal.
Confounding Slam (divine, emotion, enchantment, mental) A creature hit by the naunet’s
tentacle Strike is stupeﬁed 2 for 1d4 rounds (DC 24 Will negates). If the creature
was already stupeﬁed in this way, the duration extends by 1 round instead. A chaotic
creature is only stupeﬁed 1 instead.
Constrict Ȱɵ 1d8+8 bludgeoning, DC 26
Keketar
The ruling caste of the proteans, keketars orchestrate attacks against the bastions
of law and adjudicate protean disputes conﬁdently and capriciously. A keketar
resembles a shimmering, serpentine creature with spines, claws, and
a dragon-like head. A keketar’s actual appearance is in constant
ﬂux, but they generally stay about 18 feet long with a
weight of around 1,500 pounds. While their physical
forms can vary, two things remain constant: First,
a keketar’s eyes are always a piercing shade of
amber or violet. Second, the keketar’s mark of
ofﬁce—a crown of shifting symbols that hovers
above its head—never changes. A keketar cannot
remove its crown but can suppress it, although most
are loath to do so and consider such an act one of
cowardice or shame.
Keketars ﬁll a role in protean society of a
sort of priesthood, operating as intermediaries
between the other proteans and the Speakers of
the Depths. All other proteans defer to keketars,
treating them in a way similar to how citizens
of a mortal city would treat respected nobles;
even more powerful proteans defer to the will
of the keketars. As with many religions, dogma and
theology are prone to interpretation and change, and
among the proteans the situation is perhaps even
more pronounced. Whatever the nature of and
desires held by the mysterious Speakers of
the Depths, individual keketars may come
to dramatically different conclusions as to
their will and intent. To the proteans,
though, this inherent dissonance is
a strength rather than a weakness.

DEFENDING CHAOS
Where proteans go, chaos follows.
To proteans, there is no purer form
of existence than entropy, and
they constantly seek to oppose
the establishment of order in the
Great Beyond. However, proteans
don’t see life as being incompatible
with chaos; rather, they simply
believe beings—immortal or
not—deserve complete
freedom on their
own terms.

PSYCHOPOMP DIVINITIES
The most powerful of the
psychopomps are unique demigods
known collectively as “ushers,”
each of whom has its own cult.
These psychopomp divinities
include Atropos, the Last Sister;
Barzahk, the Passage; Ceyanan,
the Shepherd; Dammar, the
Denied; Imot, the Symbol of Doom;
Mother Vulture, the Flesheater;
Mrtyu, Death’s Consort; Narakas,
the Cleansing Sentence; the
Pale Horse; Phlegyas, Consoler
of Atheists; Saloc, Minder
of Immortals; Teshallas, the
Primordial Poison; and
Vale, the Court of the Ancestors.
Psychopomp
Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead native to the Boneyard,
the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal
rewards or damnations. Psychopomps ensure that the dead come to terms with
their transition from mortality and are properly sorted into the appropriate
afterlife. They also protect souls from being preyed upon by supernatural
predators. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks, especially when they’re likely to
be interacting with mortals, although the types of masks they wear are as varied
as the psychopomps themselves. The courts of the Boneyard preside in Requian, a
somber yet melodic language spoken slowly with various tonal shifts.
Nosoi
A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy
leather plague doctor’s mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the
Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the
administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois
are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their
individual assignments to be.

Change Shape Ȱɵ (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The nosoi takes the
appearance of a raven or songbird. This doesn’t change its Speed or its attack and
damage modiﬁers with its Strikes.
Haunting Melody Ȱɵ (auditory, concentrate, divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental)
The nosoi croons an entrancing song. Each living or undead creature within a 60-foot
emanation must attempt a DC 18 Will save. The eﬀect lasts for 1 round, but a nosoi
can use this ability again on subsequent rounds to extend the duration by 1 round for
all aﬀected creatures. A creature that succeeds at any save is temporarily immune
for 24 hours. Despite being a mental eﬀect, this ability aﬀects mindless undead.
Psychopomps are immune to this ability.
Failure The creature is fascinated.
Critical Failure As failure, and the creature must spend each of its actions
on its turn to move closer to the nosoi as expediently as possible while
avoiding obvious dangers. If a fascinated creature is adjacent to the nosoi, it
stays still and doesn’t act. If the creature is attacked, the fascination ends.
Spirit Touch A nosoi’s Strikes aﬀect incorporeal creatures as though etched
with a ghost touch property rune and deal 1d6 negative damage to
living creatures or 1d6 positive damage to undead.
Morrigna
Bounty hunters and investigators, morrignas seek out
creatures that thwart death or interfere with the natural
ﬂow of souls. Morrignas dress in ﬂowing spider silk and
