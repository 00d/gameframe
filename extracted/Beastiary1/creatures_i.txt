ARCHDEVILS
At any one time, eight archdevils
rule the eight upper layers of Hell,
while the deepest layer is ruled
by Asmodeus. Each archdevil is a
unique demigod with a dedicated
role in guiding the infernal machine
forward. Barbatos is the doorwarden
of Hellʼs uppermost layer, while
Dispater rules Hellʼs largest city.
Mammon guards Hellʼs treasuries,
and Belial designs new weapons
for Hellʼs legions. Geryon is the
oldest archdevil and keeper of many
secrets, while Moloch leads Hellʼs
armies. Baalzebul is a brooding
archdevil who has fallen from
Asmodeusʼs favor, while mighty
Mephistopheles was formed from
the plane of Hell itself.
Imp
Imps are inﬁltrators and corruptors who, despite their diminutive stature, are
more than capable of subtly inﬂuencing a weak-willed individual into performing
increasingly evil acts over time. An imp will often agree to serve a mortal and
act docile and loyal in a long-term plot to eventually damn its master’s soul to
Hell. Imps are born directly from Hell itself, rather than from mortal souls, and
thus they serve outside the usual diabolic hierarchy, granting them leeway to
pursue their specialties. Despite standing a mere 2-feet tall, imps can be vicious
combatants, ﬂying out of reach and turning invisible to escape should the odds
turn against them.

luck if the creature accepts. The boon lasts for 1 hour once
accepted. If the creature dies while the boon is in place, its soul
travels to Hell, where it is bound for eternity and unable to be raised
or resurrected except by wish or similar magic. Once during the hour, the
creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and use the higher result.

FIENDISH RELATIONS
Devils view daemonsʼ constant
hunt for souls as a short-sighted
waste of potential, and demonsʼ
chaotic destruction of society
and ﬂesh as uncivilized and
obnoxious, but they do not loathe
their ﬁendish counterparts.
Indeed, most devils are more
than willing to take advantage
of daemons and demons as they
can to further their
own machinations.
Barbazu (Bearded Devil)
Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous ﬁends
who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell’s
armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into
battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inﬂict jagged gashes that resist
healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too
close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver
a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim’s
strength being slowly devoured from within.
Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords
from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they
disseminate murder, misery, and anguish
as they see ﬁt.

ELEMENTAL BEINGS
The Elemental Planes—primordial
realms deﬁned by aspects of air,
earth, ﬁre, or water—are home to
a diverse group of beings known
as elementals. Spellcasters on
the Material Plane call upon
elementals for aid, though these
enigmatic creatures can also
travel to the world of mortals via
interplanar gateways and rifts.
The elementals on these pages
exemplify the creatures of the
Elemental Planes, but this list is by
no means exhaustive.

PAGE 146
================================================================================

PRIMAL ELEMENTALS
The most well known of all
elementals are the primal
elementals, creatures composed
entirely of air, earth, ﬁre, or water
with roughly humanoid shapes.
Many primal elementals are
named after natural disasters,
ranging from those relatively
small in scale (and roughly the
size of Medium humanoids) to
much larger ones (often the
size of small buildings). Primal
elementals can often be found
in areas where their namesake
disasters have recently struck.
Naturally Invisible The invisible stalker is invisible at all times, though when it takes
a hostile action of any kind, it is hidden instead of undetected until the start of its
next turn, as the vague outline of its humanoid form is faintly visible for a short
period of time.
Speed 25 feet, ﬂy 25 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +18 (agile, ﬁnesse), Damage 1d10+5 bludgeoning
Sneak Attack The invisible stalker deals 2d6 extra precision damage to ﬂat-footed
creatures.
Swift Tracker The invisible stalker moves at full Speed while Tracking.
Storm Lord
Storm lords wage battles to claim important territory within the Plane of Air.

its movement. A creature can attempt to bar the way by succeeding at a DC 34
Fortitude save. On a critical success, the resisting creature takes no damage;
otherwise it is damaged as if hit by the golem’s ﬁst.
Slowing Pulse Ȱɵ (arcane, concentrate, transmutation) Each creature in a 10-foot
emanation must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be slowed 1 for 1 minute. The
golem can’t use Slowing Pulse again for 1d4 rounds.
Iron Golem
Traditionally crafted into the forms of giant suits of armor or powerful animals,
iron golems are products of exquisite artistry and skill. Their articulated joints
and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft,
and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don’t rust over the ages. With proper
care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being
passed down for generations, as long as they aren’t destroyed by meddlesome
adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a
potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire
groups of opponents.

deactivates its Breath Weapon for 1 minute.
Vulnerable to Rust Magical rusting eﬀects, like a rust monster’s
antennae, aﬀect the iron golem normally.
Speed 20 feet
Melee Ȱɵ ﬁst +28 (magical, reach 10 feet), Damage 3d10+12 bludgeoning
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (arcane, necromancy, poison) The iron golem
exhales poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius centered on the corner of one
of the iron golem’s squares. The gas persists for 1 round. Any creature in
the area (or that later enters the area) is exposed to the iron golem’s poison.
The golem can’t use its Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.
Inexorable March Ȱɵ The iron golem Strides up to its Speed, pushing back each
creature whose space it moves into and damaging them if they try to stop its
movement. A creature can attempt to bar the way by succeeding at a DC 37 Fortitude
save. On a critical success, the resisting creature takes no damage; otherwise, it is
damaged as if hit by the golem’s ﬁst.
Iron Golem Poison (poison); Any drained value from this poison is reduced by
1 every hour. Saving Throw DC 33 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 4 rounds;
Stage 1 2d6 poison and drained 1 (1 round); Stage 2 4d6 poison and drained 2
(1 round); Stage 3 8d6 poison and drained 3 (1 round).
Adamantine Golem
Crafted from a nigh-indestructible metal of great rarity,
adamantine golems can’t be destroyed except by the most
powerful foes. Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity
of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires
mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane
of Earth, or an Outer Plane.

================================================================================

ADAMANTINE GOLEMS
The incredible amount of
adamantine necessary to create
a single adamantine golem is
worth more than many nations’
treasuries. The powerful heart
of an adamantine golem can be
turned into a legendary forge for
blacksmithing.

# ICE LINNORM
================================================================================


DEATH CURSES
The death curses of the linnorms
are often the subjects of tragic
sagas, and those who would think
themselves vanquishing heroes
for slaying a linnorm often meet
their dooms soon thereafter,
succumbing to these curses well
after the death of the linnorm
responsible for bestowing it.
Ice Linnorm
The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks,
or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.

Primal Innate Spells DC 38; Constant (8th) freedom of
movement; (7th) true seeing
Breath Weapon ʚʖ (cold, evocation, primal) The ice linnorm
spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot
cone that deals 15d6 cold damage to creatures within the
area (DC 38 basic Reﬂex save). The freezing ooze clings
to those struck and hardens into thick sheets of ice. A
creature that fails the saving throw is immobilized by
the ice until it succeeds at a check to Escape or it or
an ally Forces Open the ice (DC 34 for either case). At
the start of its turn, a creature still immobilized by the
ice takes 4d6 cold damage. Another creature can free a
frozen target by dealing a total of 20 ﬁre damage to the
frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in
1 minute on its own. Creatures with the ﬁre trait can't be
frozen in place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures fall if
frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward
the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per round. An
ice linnorm can’t use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds.

OTHER LINNORMS
Linnorms exist in a variety of
forms beyond the four detailed
here. The gaunt cairn linnorm,
the spiny taiga linnorm, and
the aquatic fjord linnorm each
terrorize their own specific
regions of the Material Plane.
Tarn Linnorm
Although more powerful linnorms exist, the multi-headed tarn linnorm can wreak
an awe-inspiring amount of devastation.
