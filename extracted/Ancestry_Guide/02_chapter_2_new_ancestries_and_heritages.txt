Chapter 2:
New Ancestries and
Heritages

================================================================================
PAGE 67
================================================================================

Overview
66
Golarion is a world filled with unique people and strange
magic, resulting in an incredible diversity of heritages
across the Inner Sea. The new ancestries and versatile
heritages (which can be applied to any ancestry) in
the following pages represent a small portion of these
unique and incredible peoples. Many of these ancestries
have deep, historical ties to specific locales, making
them less likely to be found outside of those regions.
Several of the ancestries presented in this section are
therefore uncommon for adventurers. This rarity trait
applies specifically to the rules for playing a member of
this ancestry, and it’s separate from the rarity trait that
determines how obscure information about a creature is.
In addition, some ancestries and heritages have
incredibly small populations, their existence the result of
brief meetings between disparate realms. These ancestries
are only rarely spotted anywhere on Golarion, and thus
are rare for adventurers. As with uncommon ancestries,
this rarity trait applies specifically to the rules for playing
a member of this ancestry, and it’s separate from the rarity
trait that determines how obscure information about a
creature is.
While these ancestries are uncommon or rare in the
same way as a magic item, a feat, or a spell, you choose
an ancestry at the beginning of the campaign. Specific
campaigns might grant access to a set of uncommon or
even rare ancestries that are particularly appropriate
for that setting, such as androids in a campaign set in
Numeria or an all-sprite party for a campaign in the First
World. In other games, these ancestries can be as available
as your group desires and the GM deems appropriate.
SPECIAL RULES
Some of the new ancestries and heritages presented in
this book require unique rules to fully represent their
capabilities. Most of these rules are described in the
applicable ancestry sections but are also collected here
for reference.
Flying PCs: Certain ancestries, such as strix or sprites,
have wings. The presented ancestry rules intend to
provide a good combination of story and game balance
for most groups. However, some players might have
character concepts that don’t fit this assumption and
might wish to fly from initial character creation. At the
GM’s discretion, the GM can grant these PCs a 15-foot
fly Speed, replacing any other abilities that involve flying,
such as the strix’s Wings ancestral trait. In this case, any
feat that upgrades the PC’s flying capabilities, such as
the strix’s Fledgling Flight and Juvenile Flight feats,
might instead upgrade this Speed by an additional 5 feet.
However, GMs who allow this option should be aware
that a PC who can constantly fly can trivialize many
low- and mid-level challenges, consistently outshining or
leaving other characters behind; the GM should consider
this option very carefully before allowing it and adjust
the game accordingly.
Riding PCs: A Tiny PC weighs so little and takes up
so little Bulk that it wouldn’t be a space issue to hitch a
ride in a sack, on a shoulder, or otherwise be carried by a
fellow PC. However, this requires a tremendous amount of
coordination to ensure the Tiny PC doesn’t get in the way,
or the two PCs don’t jostle each other into losing actions.
As a result, for most parties, this tactic is less favorable
than the Tiny PC just using their own mount. If a Tiny
PC rides along with another PC or similar non-minion
intelligent creature, roll both their initiatives and use the
lower of the two results. The two PCs act in either order
on the same initiative count. While traveling in this way,
the PCs each gain two actions at the start of their turns,
instead of three, since the larger PC spends one action
keeping the smaller one balanced on their back, and the
Tiny PC spends one action maintaining their grip.
Tiny PCs: PCs are typically Small or Medium size, but
some ancestries, such as most sprites, are Tiny instead!
Being Tiny comes with its own set of rules about space
and reach. A Tiny PC can enter another creature’s space,
which is important because their melee Strikes typically
have no reach, meaning the PC must enter a creature’s
space to attack it. Like other Tiny creatures, the PC
doesn’t automatically receive lesser cover from being in
a larger creature’s space, but circumstances might allow
them to Take Cover in this instance. They can purchase
weapons, armor, and other items for their size with the
same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons
have a reach of 0 for them (or a reach 5 feet shorter than
normal if they have the reach trait). Remember to adjust
the Bulk of items and the PC’s Bulk limit for Tiny size
(Core Rulebook 295).
Android (rAre Ancestry)
Brought to Golarion by a starship crash in the land
of Numeria, androids are half-organic, half-machine
lifeforms produced by alien technology. Though often
looked upon with fear by superstitious communities
surrounding the crash site, changing politics and the rise
of the android goddess Casandalee have led to androids
expanding their influence in nearby regions.
Aphorite (Uncommon heritAge)
Aphorites are beings with a mortal base infused with the
pure essence of law by the enigmatic axiomites of Axis.
Originally designed to form a diplomatic bridge between
the perfect logic of the axiomites and the constant
contradictions of free-willed creatures, aphorites’ ability
to choose has seen them grow beyond their original intent
and into their own people.

================================================================================

67
BeAstkin (rAre heritAge)
While most werecreatures are cursed with bloodlust at
the sight of the full moon, some of their kin are born
without this dire affliction. These beastkin are a source
of respect and envy among their fellows, as they also lack
werecreatures’ burning vulnerability to silver.
Fetchling (Uncommon Ancestry)
Fetchlings are scions of Ancient Azlant who escaped the
cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing to the Shadow Plane.
As generations passed, more and more supernatural
gloom seeped into these refugees until they evolved into
something beyond their human origins.
FleshwArp (rAre Ancestry)
Fleshwarps are beings transformed either by magic or by
technology beyond Golarion’s ken. Most commonly, they
result from drow or other sinister forces transforming their
victims out of sadism, yet fleshwarps can also be created
from scratch through magical or alchemical manipulation
of raw tissue.
gAnzi (Uncommon heritAge)
Born wherever and whenever they’re least expected, these
scions of chaos rarely conform to any overarching culture
among themselves. Ganzi reside in the greatest numbers
in the nation of Holomog, with their influence spilling out
into Nex, Geb, and the Mwangi Expanse.
geniekin (Uncommon heritAges)
Kin to the elements and infused with the power of the
planes within the Inner Sphere, geniekin live scattered all
over the world, especially wherever extreme environments
provide a conduit to primal energy. Most commonly found
in Katapesh and Qadira, many geniekin gather in small
communities both within and outside of major cities.
kitsUne (Uncommon Ancestry)
Kitsune change shapes as easily as clothing, often
living undetected among other peoples. Though these
mischievous tricksters almost never gather in numbers
large enough for political clout, their natural charisma
and cunning mean they can have a significant impact on
worldly events.
sprite (rAre Ancestry)
As denizens of the First World, sprites sometimes tire
of their realm where choices hold no permanence and
consequences don’t matter. These Tiny fey venture into
the Material Plane in hopes of making their own mark.
strix (rAre Ancestry)
These avian humanoids maintain small populations
within Cheliax and the surrounding environs. Long
persecuted by the humanocentric rule of House Thrune,
strix have been enemies of the Chelaxian state for almost
a century.

Android (Rare)
Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living
souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but
comfortable in stillness and solitude.
68
Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of
Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of
Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria.
While some android survivors of this crash still walk
Golarion today, most were created from the technological
pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the
starship’s wreckage. Androids birthed
from these mechanical wombs
possess mature bodies and
newborn souls, both organic
and synthetic; they emerge
knowing only their creators’
language and the motor
skills necessary for survival.
They have no understanding
of their surroundings, origin,
or purpose. Most learn
how to behave through
keen observation while
wandering Numeria.
Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and
contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to
understand themselves and the world around them,
androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They
have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both
in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant
and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds,
they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.
If you want a character that’s a synthetic foreigner in
a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality
and society through the powers of observation and logic
alone, you should play an android.

• Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to
exploit or harm you.
• Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for

• Calculate the repercussions of your actions,
inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.

• Assume you understand how to operate technology
and that you can capably communicate with
constructs and robots.
• Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal
youth and vigor.
• Think you have no feelings and that you can’t
form emotional connections with others.
physicAl description
Androids were created in humanity’s image; thus,
foundries produce androids that represent all
humankind. Androids display great diversity in
coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape,
and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and
sleep like a human, although they’re incapable
of biological procreation. Their bodies contain
microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too
watery to be blood, that manage their organic
processes. These nanites are controlled through
biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and
is typically located along an android’s hands,
forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can
harness their nanites to increase their bodies’
efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.
Androids don’t grow old. Instead,
their organic appearance becomes less

convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most
androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the
Boneyard to face Pharasma’s judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering
a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their
synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new
soul enters the android’s form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called
Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by
violence can’t Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and
their brethren from harm.
society
Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their
Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep
their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a
nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind.
Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid
danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.
Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen
understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and
lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their
world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves
relocate when discovered.
Alignment And religion
Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their
companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship
Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular
deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.
nAmes
Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while
those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes
Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation
to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a
kind of homage to their bloodline.
sAmple nAmes
Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun,

ANDROIDS OF THE INNER SEA
Androids can be found throughout the Inner Sea in small numbers, hiding
among humanity, though the vast majority reside in Numeria. Aware that new
androids are still birthed in forgotten foundries, most prefer to stay nearby to
mentor their newborn kin rather than leave.
Traditionally, Numerian androids encounter two major enemies. First are
the nefarious Technic League, greedy spellcasters who claim all technology in
Numeria as their own; under Technic League rule, androids lived enslaved as
technological marvels for the curious to disassemble and understand. Second
are the local Kellids, who believe all technology must be buried or destroyed—
androids included. But change has come to Numeria. The Technic League is
shattered, and the spellcasters that remain have allied with local gangs and
warlords. Most Kellids still view androids as taboo but no longer kill them on
sight. In the hinterlands, some citizens are slowly shaking loose their fear and
prejudice, as the faiths of Casandalee and Brigh pave the way for reconciliation.
A few leaders, including the Black Sovereign, have offered androids the hand
of friendship, welcoming them into their lives and communities. Despite this
promising turn, however, most androids remain cautious.

AndroFFAn
Androids have long sought to uncover their history and purpose, but Androffan
androids take this search a step further. They seek not just knowledge, but
information of their former home of Androffa to revive their lost culture.
Androffans delve into technological ruins for clues to their people’s past and
purpose, to hunt for foundries, and to unlock the mysteries of space travel. They
wear clothing and jewelry modeled on attire scavenged from starship wreckage:
work boots, flight suits, wristbands, identification cards, and military insignia.
Unlike most android enclaves, some Androffans live within the ruins they
explore. Most individuals are nomadic, traveling from site to site to perform
archaeological excavations, but the largest groups are sedentary, living along the
slopes of Silver Mount in the effective heart of Androffan society.
chAsm
While most survivors from the Rain of Stars found themselves wandering
Golarion’s surface, Chasm androids escaped the wreckage into the depths of
the Darklands. Isolated, afraid, and with few resources at their disposal, they
became scavengers, repairing and repurposing scrap and salvage to survive.
Wall panels, wires, and torn nylon became material for clothes, rope, and tools;
plastic became armor and dishes; and the few bits of functioning technology
they found became cultural touchstones—the last vestiges of when their people
flew across the stars.
Alien in appearance, Chasm androids have modified their bodies to better
function in the Darklands. They have larger ears and eyes and slender bodies;
they can also throw their limbs in and out of their joints.
mAny-soUled
Android philosophers have long wondered
about the miracle of Renewal—while it’s
well-known that a Renewed android is a wholly
new person with no memory of their body’s
previous experiences, many androids dream of
their past lives. Many-Souled androids believe that
nanites are the key to this mystery, housing their
former memories and intelligences.
Many-Souled androids live as if their body serves as
a shared vessel for two symbiotic beings. They meditate
often, hoping to commune with the nanites within them.
Many-Souled androids that choose to form life-bonds
with another android—typically bonds of friendship,
love, or mentorship—swap nanites, each urging clouds of
nanites to leave their bodies and reenter the body of their
intended. In this way, they become family, sharing blood
and memories along with their nanites.
sovereign
When the Technic League was overthrown, the Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul
opened the doors of his palace to androids, offering them a home. Touched by
his generosity, some androids entered his halls, becoming honorary Kellids. In
the following years, these androids have dedicated themselves to adopting the
Kellid way of life. They no longer hide their heritage, instead openly embracing
their dualistic android and Kellid identities.
Sovereign androids live primarily in Starfall, the capital of Numeria and
home of Kevoth-Kul, though many have left the city to join nomadic clans
loyal to the Black Sovereign. They worship both Casandalee and traditional
Kellid gods, including Desna, Gorum, and Erastil. Sovereign androids often
become mentors, teaching their clanmates mathematics and science, while
learning about Kellid culture and faith from clan elders.
Android Adventurers
Most androids become adventurers
to protect their kin from harm or to
research the history of their people,
typically by exploring technological
ruins. Androids survive through
deception, stealth, and subterfuge,
which leads many down the path of
the rogue. Others embrace their thirst
for knowledge and understanding by
becoming alchemists, monks, or wizards.
Typical android backgrounds include
hermit, nomad, scholar, and tinker.

PAGE 72
================================================================================

Android Settlements
Androids are primarily found in
Numeria, where they hide among
humans or travel as nomads. A large
number live openly in Starfall under the
protection of the Black Sovereign. The
slopes of Silver Mount house multiple
android enclaves and archaeological
teams, including Enseffa, the center
of Androffan society. In the town
of Hajoth Hakados, the locals help
androids secretly flee Numeria for lands
where they face less hatred. Hidden in
a series of tunnels and caverns beneath
the Numerian Plains, the androids of
Szamrak’s Haven believe androids are
a superior life-form. They hunt for
foundries with the intent of liberating
all androids, conquering Numeria to
found an android-only nation, and
eventually returning their people to
their home amongst the stars.
ANDROID HERITAGES
An android’s heritage reflects the purpose for which they were originally
created. Choose one of the following android heritages at 1st level.
ArtisAn Android
Your body was originally designed to create works of art, complex tools, or
maintain advanced machinery. You become trained in Crafting (or another
skill if you’re already trained in Crafting), and you gain the Specialty Crafting
skill feat in a specialty of your choice.
impersonAtor Android
Your body was augmented with processes and an appearance intended to blend
in with humans more easily. You become trained in Deception (or another skill
if you’re already trained in Deception). You don’t require a disguise kit when
attempting Deception checks to Impersonate a human. In addition, you gain a
+4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you’re a human
version of yourself, rather than an android. This bonus doesn’t apply to other
checks to Impersonate humans.
lABorer Android
Your body is adapted to endure physical hardships or perform hard labor for
long periods of time. You become trained in Athletics (or another skill if you’re
already trained in Athletics), and you gain the Hefty Hauler skill feat.
polyglot Android
You were preprogrammed with a multitude of linguistic proficiencies, likely
to act as a translator. You learn two new languages, chosen from
common languages and any uncommon languages you have
access to. These languages take the same form (signed
or spoken) as your other languages. If you select the
Multilingual feat, you learn three new languages
instead of two.

Casandalee and Androids
Once an artificial intelligence cloned
from the mind of an alien android,
Casandalee recently ascended as the
goddess of artificial life, free thinking,
and intellectual apotheosis. Despite the
small size and relative obscurity of her
religion, the androids of Numeria have
embraced Casandalee as their own.
They seek to better bridge the gap
between artificial and organic lifeforms,
thereby improving the lives of androids.

Your nanites are programmed to automatically revive you. You’re restored
to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and unconscious conditions, and can act
normally on this turn. You gain or increase the wounded condition as
normal when losing the dying condition in this way.
Thoughts on Androids
Other people view androids through a
lens of magic and superstition. Most
consider androids eccentric spellcasters,
often confusing them with tattooed
Thassilonian wizards. Others see an
android’s glowing circuitry and assume
they’re planar scions. In the River
Kingdoms, androids are often thought to
be fey that imperfectly took on human
form and thus can’t stand the touch of
cold iron. Peoples in Ustalav frequently
confuse androids for spirits, believing
they can be held back by salt circles or
banished through pious prayers.

Once perfectly identical beings who bridged the gap between Axis’s perfect order and
mortals’ unrestricted existence, aphorites are now lit more by the spark of free will than
the beacon of cosmic law.
Aphorite
74
Aphorites were first forged by axiomites, the primary
inhabitants of the Eternal City of Axis, the plane of pure
law. The original aphorites served as liaisons between
their lawful progenitors and frustratingly unpredictable
mortal allies. Marrying the logical thought processes of
conformity to law and the gift of self-determination,
early aphorites spread across the Material Plane to serve
as Axis’s proxies and enact its will. Over time, their
appearances and personalities grew to resemble
their mortal comrades as they were increasingly
born among mortals. Aphorites still exhibit Axis’s
touch in their metallic skin coated in crystalline dust,
aptitude for logic, strength in artisanship, and
propensity for order and cooperation. But
despite these links to their purpose-built
origins, contemporary aphorites are
undoubtedly their own masters.
If you want to play a character
intrinsically tied to the underlying
order of the universe, walking
the thin line between calculated
predestination and free will,
you should play an aphorite.

• Believe you’re rigid in your
beliefs or habits.
• Think you never act before

• Assume you easily grasp complex

physicAl description
The first aphorites appeared as
perfectly
identical
humanoids
with
metallic
complexions;
modern aphorites are far removed
from such rigid biological structures. Their size, shape,
and features now vary, but they still visibly bear the
influence of Axis. Eyes, hair, and complexions with
a metallic sheen are almost universal. These tones
usually vary between copper, gold, and silver, though
cobalt, viridian, and carmine aren’t unheard of. Other
manifestations include skin infused with shimmering
crystalline motes or glowing symbols appearing
across the body in a consistent rhythm.
society
While still relatively rare, aphorites are increasingly
born into families with no direct aphorite
ancestors, and have thus spread across
the Material Plane. They acculturate
like any other mortal, picking up
local customs and mannerisms
over time. Most aphorites intuit
an underlying sense of order
or pattern that supersedes
mortal law or custom. Some
pursue this through cultural
norms, while others balk at
what they see as poorly
constructed systems.

religion
The gift of free will means

of a stable society. Desna appeals to
some aphorites’ desire to break from
tradition. For aphorite artisans, Shelyn’s

attractive; the Bronze Lady’s views
on awakened constructs also appeal
to axiomite-forged aphorites.

APHORITES OF THE INNER SEA
Aphorites originally served as linguists, emissaries, and liaisons between the
axiomites and other mortal groups. Axiomites sent small contingents to bastions
of order in the Inner Sea region, like Nantambu and Taldor. These aphorites’
legacies intertwined with those of their host communities, and aphorites of all
ancestries are more likely to be born in these regions. Aphorites can also arise
near smaller-scale loci of order, like solstice altars, locations of significant truces
or agreements, industrial sites, and convergences of axiomatic ley lines.
Axis’s touch tends to accentuate dwarves’ already-angular facial features, as
well as mark their skin with runic or other culturally significant shapes. Aphorite
dwarves arise most in the Five Kings Mountains and Rahadoum, as well as
among the Pahmet and Paraheen peoples (of Osirion and Qadira, respectively).
Aphorite elves’ large pupils shine with opalescent lines and symbols when
viewed at certain angles, and their features typically attune to their local
environments in a matter of days. Aphorite elves include the mithral-skinned
elves of Jinin.
Aphorite gnomes’ hair trends toward geometric shapes, often growing
in multicolored and starkly delineated strands. When their emotions rise,
pulsing symbols manifest on their skin or drift out with their breath.
Axis’s orderly nature manifests in goblins through more durable,
metallic-sheened teeth and nails. Aphorite goblins are often a
head taller than their peers, with less stout proportions.
They often appear in the cities of Absalom and
Magnimar, as well as the nation of Isger.
Aphorite halflings’ eyes twinkle with metallic flecks. Their feet
develop thicker calluses in right-angled patterns and are topped
by uniform-length hair that rarely tangles. Aphorite halflings seem
to be born once every three generations, or every six in Cheliax.
The bodies of aphorite humans trend toward extreme symmetry:
moles, vein patterns, wrinkles, and even fingerprints on one side have
perfectly mirrored partners on the other.
Aphorite cUstoms
Though aphorites come from myriad backgrounds and cultures, a few
practices have spread among aphorites throughout the Inner Sea region.
Some aphorites use thin metal rods to mark progress toward a long-term
goal. Working diligently on such a project is called carving the hours, since
after an hour’s labor, the worker makes a horizontal notch in the rod,
assesses their progress, and considers how to proceed. Rest is marked with
vertical lines. The rods are typically incorporated into the task’s end result.
Dustware is any handmade object that incorporates an aphorite’s crystalline
dust, from shimmering enameled dishes to music penned in crystalline ink.
Dustware gifts are signs of immense respect, given to recognize an impressive
achievement or express heartfelt thanks.
Some aphorites connect the symbols that appear on their bodies with
piercings, tattoos, or other less permanent ornamentation. The sequence of
symbols can be purely aesthetic or reflect a personal belief or conviction.
Aphorites often live, love, or work in groups of three, originally in imitation
of an efficiency-minded axiomite organizational practice. Contemporary
trinities leave these roots behind, though the phrases “achieved by the Three”
or “spoken by the Three” still indicate a strong agreement or commitment.
Aphorite (Uncommon heritAge)
You were born with a connection to Axis, the Plane of Law. You gain the
aphorite trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain
low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has
low-light vision. You can choose from aphorite feats and feats from your
ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Aphorite Adventurers
Many aphorites share backgrounds in
the trades. Artisans and tinkers all find
fulfillment in the intricacies of their
work. Some aphorites instead navigate
laws and other social structures; these
might work within the legal system as
barristers or emissaries. Acrobat and
scout aphorites enjoy the interplay
of mind and muscle, as do hunters,
martial disciples, and warriors. The
aphorite eye for detail leads many to
become investigators APG or rangers.
Similar faculties lead them to become
alchemists, oracles APG, or wizards.

APHORITE FEATS
The following feats are available to aphorite characters.
1ST LEVEL
AXIOMATIC LORE
FEAT 1
APHORITE
You possess a strong understanding of process among mortals and lawful outsiders
alike. The source of this knowledge might be intuition, study, or a childhood spent
among other aphorites. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Diplomacy and
Society. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your
background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your
choice. You also become trained in Axis Lore.
INTERNAL COHESION
FEAT 1
APHORITE
Axis’s order suffuses your body and helps it maintain coherency. You and your allies
can Treat your Wounds without healer’s tools. Once per day, when someone rolls a
failure or a critical failure on a check to Treat your Wounds, you can focus on your
internal cohesion to increase the degree of success by one step.
INTUITIVE CRAFTING
FEAT 1
APHORITE
Your affinity with process and order makes you a natural artisan. You gain the trained
proficiency rank in Crafting (or another skill of your choice, if you’re already trained
in Crafting). You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat in a specialty of your choice.
LEMMA OF VISION
FEAT 1
APHORITE
You’ve solved a tiny stepping stone in your self-discovery, awakening
new depths in your sight. You gain darkvision.
5TH LEVEL
CRYSTALLINE DUST [two-actions]
FEAT 5
APHORITE
Frequency once per day
You’ve learned to disperse the crystalline motes coating your body as
a haze. You become concealed, though you can’t use this concealment
to Hide or Sneak, as normal for concealment where your position is still
obvious. The motes stay within an inch of your skin, move with you,
and last for a number of rounds equal to half your level.
INTERCORPORATE [one-action]
FEAT 5
APHORITE
Frequency once per day
Requirements You’re afflicted by a disease or poison, or are taking persistent damage.
Your ordered physiology rejects unwelcome elements. Choose one.
Disease or Poison Attempt a saving throw against the affliction at its current
stage. On a failure, the affliction’s stage doesn’t increase, but you suffer the effects
of the stage you were already on. On a critical failure, the stage only increases by 1.
Persistent Damage Attempt a DC 10 flat check to recover from the
persistent damage.
OFFENSIVE ANALYSIS
FEAT 5
APHORITE
You can enhance your senses and mental state to consider every aspect of an
attack. You can cast true strike as a divine innate spell once per day.
Aphorite Settlements
A few sites around the Inner
Sea region host aphorites in
greater-than-average concentrations.
Egorian: The order of Hell is
omnipresent in Cheliax’s capital. This
rigid structure also attracts Axis’s
influence, and a fair few aphorites
excel among the infernal contracts and
complex political machinations of the
City of Thorns.
Nantambu: The ancient Song-Wind
City maintains a complex web
of diplomatic and professional
relationships throughout the Mwangi
Expanse. Aphorites help spin these
silk-strong strands, while others
study the multiverse’s nature at the
Magaambya Academy.
Order’s Berth: An aphorite majority
populates this agglomeration of
boats and barges. The fleet plies Lake
Encarthan’s waters, seeking out those
most affected by the region’s conflicts
and offering their aid as artisans,
physicians, and negotiators.

PAGE 78
================================================================================

77
9TH LEVEL
ANALYZE INFORMATION
FEAT 9
APHORITE
You can stoke your mind into a burst of analytical prowess. You can cast 3rd-level
hypercognition once per day as a divine innate spell.
ANCILLARY MOTES
FEAT 9
APHORITE
Prerequisites Crystalline Dust
You can use Crystalline Dust one more time per day.
Special You can take this feat more than once, gaining one more use of Crystalline
Dust per day each time.
CRYSTALLINE CLOUD
FEAT 9
APHORITE
Prerequisites Crystalline Dust
When you use Crystalline Dust, you can spend one additional action
to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you
instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait. All
creatures within the cloud become concealed, and all creatures
outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.
PREEMPTIVE RECONFIGURATION [reaction]
FEAT 9
APHORITE
Frequency once per day
Trigger You would take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
Your body anticipates the blow. The impact area briefly reorganizes into a
strengthened tissue lattice that blunts the attack. You gain resistance equal to your
level to the triggering damage type, which applies against the triggering damage.
If you have the Crystalline Dust feat, you can use Preemptive Reconfiguration
without expending a usage of the reaction for the purpose of the feat’s Frequency
limit. Instead, the usage counts toward your number of Crystalline Dust uses
per day, as if you had used that feat instead.
13TH LEVEL
IMPOSE ORDER [reaction]
FEAT 13
APHORITE
FORTUNE
Frequency once per day
Trigger You would critically fail a skill check or suffer an effect with the
misfortune trait.
You shift the underlying fabric of reality to impose a baseline of order.
If the trigger was a skill check, you instead receive a result of 10 +
your proficiency bonus (don’t apply any other bonuses, penalties,
or modifiers). If the trigger was an effect with the misfortune
trait, the misfortune and fortune effects cancel each other
out as normal, negating the triggering misfortune effect.
17TH LEVEL
CHANNEL THE GODMIND [two-actions]
FEAT 17
APHORITE
Frequency once per day
You tap into the Godmind’s collective cognitive well, rapidly
parsing near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute,
you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see invisible
creatures and objects, and you gain the effects of a 9th-level true seeing.
Relations with Axis
The ancient bonds between aphorite
and axiomite are still encoded within the
minds of the aphorites’ creators. Few of
Axis’s hybrid children are called to fulfill
these contracts’ terms, but the Godmind,
the collective consciousness that rules
Axis, can still reach between worlds to
draw aphorites to the Eternal City. Some
individuals serve as interpreters for the
rigid axiomites and their more chaotic
allies. Others have their mental faculties
tapped, providing mortal imagination for
the Godmind’s calculations.

Beastkin
78
Beastkin is a blanket term for any person who has gained
the ability to partially or fully transform into an animal
through any number of means, while maintaining a
balance with their humanoid side. Most beastkin are
born of werecreatures or have a werecreature ancestor in
their lineage. The curse might not always fully manifest
in the child of the werecreature pairing, giving the child
the transformative nature of their lineage without a
weakness to silver or a loss of control during the full
moon. Born or made, werecreatures usually hold such
beastkin in high regard, as they embody many of their
strengths without any of their weaknesses.
Aside from werecreatures, there are various other
paths to becoming a beastkin. In some cases, a deity or
a nature spirit may grant a chosen individual the power
to transform. Others have gained the powers of beastkin
through a trick of the fey or an unusual reaction to
polymorph magic. There are even rumors that some rare
beastkin might be shapeshifting animals that somehow
gained the form of a sapient ancestry, rather than the
other way around.
If you want a character that treads the boundaries
between rationality and instinct, at home in both society
and the wilds yet set apart from both, you should play
a beastkin.
yoU might...
• Prefer the companionship of a close group of friends.
• Feel an attachment to your inherent animal and
seek that animal out to understand them better.
• Wrestle with your animalistic side and choose
to isolate yourself from those who may not
understand your unique nature.
others proBABly...
• Believe you practice primal magic or have a direct
connection to the natural world.
• Assume that you love animals, especially those of
the same kind as your inherent animal.
• Worry that you will lose yourself to your feral
instincts and attack others.
physicAl description
Beastkin come in all shapes and sizes due to the countless
combinations of ancestry and inherent animal. Most
beastkin resemble a typical member of their base ancestry
so closely that they are indistinguishable as a beastkin
when in their humanoid form. On rare occasions, a
beastkin is born with features that belie their animalistic
nature at all times.
A beastkin’s nature is more obvious when they are
transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting
to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The
manifestation of these features varies from beastkin
to beastkin, but typically, their teeth become more
Beastkin have extraordinary abilities derived from the animal world, allowing them to
partially or fully transform into animals, granting them deadly fangs, refined senses, and other
such traits. A beastkin treads the line between nature and society, living with a foot in each.

prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes
reshape. Beastkin that can transform into actual animals keep some traits that
tie them to their humanoid form, such as retaining their eye color.
society
Beastkin typically weave themselves into their ancestral societies, hiding their
true nature as much as necessary. Some societies, particularly nomadic or
frontier societies, are more accepting of beastkin, allowing them to live in
their preferred form without judgment. Beastkin tend to live in independent
communities with other beastkin and werecreatures with the same inherent
animal, finding that their association with the same animal instills a sense of
fellowship. These communities usually reside in or near environments that
match the habitats of their inherent animals. Other beastkin instead live
on the fringes of society or away from it altogether, preferring to live on
their own.
Most people don’t understand that beastkin don’t have to contend with the
curse of moon frenzy and loss of self, nor do they have any way of telling
beastkin apart from werecreatures by appearance alone. Because of this, many
people treat beastkin just as they would a werecreature who wasn’t free of the
curse and might eat them on a full moon. People who know of beastkin and
can identify them as such are usually much less apprehensive about associating
with them. Beastkin are sometimes given the misnomer of “skinwalkers” by
those who are only mildly aware of their existence. This name is derived from
ignorant rumors about the evil origins of beastkin, but beastkin reject this
name both to distance themselves from the evil associations and to clarify the
diversity among the countless beastkin types throughout Golarion.
Alignment And religion
Most lean toward neutral alignments, but beastkin can be
as varied in alignment as there are animals in the world. Due
to their association with nature and the animal world, many
beastkin worship nature deities like Gozreh. Some adhere to the
Green Faith, while others worship deities of hunting, transformation,
or travel like Erastil, Alseta, and Desna.
BeAstkin (rAre heritAge)
The blood of a beast flows through your veins, granting
you the ferocity and might of animals. Only creatures
with the humanoid trait can take the beastkin versatile
heritage. Choose a type of animal such as bat, eagle, shark,
spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp, or wolf. This is the type
of animal tied to your heritage and is known as your
inherent animal. You gain the beast and beastkin
traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry.
You gain the Change Shape ability (see below). You
can choose from beastkin feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you
gain an ancestry feat.
CHANGE SHAPE [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
POLYMORPH
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
You change into your humanoid or hybrid shape. Each shape has a specific,
persistent appearance, and most beastkin remain in their hybrid shapes by
default. In hybrid shape, you appear as a mix between your ancestry and
your inherent animal. While in hybrid shape, you gain a jaws unarmed Strike
resembling the features of your inherent animal (fangs for bats, beaks for
eagles, mandibles for wasps, and so on). Your jaws deal 1d4 piercing damage,
have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits, and are in the brawling weapon
group. In your humanoid shape, you retain the appearance of your original ancestry.
Beastkin Adventurers
Common beastkin backgrounds
include animal whisperer, farmhand,
herbalist, hunter, nomad, scholar,
and scout. Because most societies
tend to fear beastkin, they often
become outcasts and are also known
to have the banditAPG, charlatan,
criminal, hermit, prisoner, refugeeAPG,
scavengerAPG, and street urchin
backgrounds.
Beastkin often become barbarians,
druids, fighters, rangers, rogues,
sorcerers, and witchesAPG.

1ST LEVEL
ANIMAL SENSES
FEAT 1
BEASTKIN
You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: darkvision,
low-light vision, or scent (imprecise) 30 feet. You must have low-light vision before
you can gain darkvision with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn’t typically have
a specific type of sense, you can’t gain that sense with this feat.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.
CRITTER SHAPE
FEAT 1
BEASTKIN
Once per hour, you can use Change Shape to enter a critter shape. While in critter shape,
you gain the effect of a 1st-level pest form, except you can only transform into an animal
matching your inherent animal. You can remain in critter shape for up to 10 minutes,
after which you transform back into your hybrid shape and can’t enter your critter
shape again for 1 hour. You can instead use Change Shape to return to your humanoid or
hybrid shape at any time during the duration of Critter Shape. If your inherent animal is
normally larger than Tiny, you transform into a smaller, younger version of the animal,
such as a Tiny bear cub. If your inherent animal has a fly Speed, you can turn into that
animal (unlike normal for 1st-level pest form), but you still don’t gain a fly Speed.
QUICK CHANGE [free-action]
FEAT 1

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves to resist diseases
and poisons.
GREATER ANIMAL SENSES
FEAT 5
BEASTKIN
Your senses advance to match those of your animal aspect. You gain
one of the following senses available to your inherent animal:
echolocation (imprecise) 30 feet or tremorsense (imprecise)

9TH LEVEL
ANIMAL MAGIC
FEAT 9
BEASTKIN
Your shapeshifting grants you a magical connection to the animal world. You can
cast animal messenger, calm emotions (animals only), and speak with animals
Ulfen Beastkin
Unlike most people of Golarion,
Ulfen do not see a werecreature’s
affliction as a curse, and this mindset
extends to beastkin. Most Ulfen see
a werecreature or beastkin’s abilities
as a badge of honor. Ulfen warriors
take pride in fighting alongside
beastkin, especially those whose
inherent animals are from native
Ulfen lands such as bearkin, lynxkin,
and wolfkin. Groups of warriors that
include beastkin often offer prayers
to Yrmidar the Old Bear, a werebear
frost giant deity of camaraderie,
shipbuilders, and the hunt.
During full moons, Ulfen
settlements are particularly
accommodating for werecreatures
who struggle with the moon’s curse.

BEASTKIN
You can share your power with others, but they can’t escape the werecreature’s
curse as easily as you can. You can cast a 5th-level moon frenzy as a primal innate
spell once per day. At 15th level, you cast a 6th-level moon frenzy instead. At 17th
level, your 6th-level moon frenzy grants its standard effects, except the temporary
Hit Points increase to 15 and the silver weakness increases to 15. At 20th level,
you cast a 10th-level moon frenzy instead.
The spell uses your class DC or spell DC,
whichever is higher.
17TH LEVEL
ANIMAL SHAPE
FEAT 17
BEASTKIN
You have full control over your shape and can transform into your inherent animal.
You can use Change Shape to enter an animal shape. When you gain this feat,
choose either aerial form, animal form, or dinosaur form; after you choose a form,
you can’t change the form. While in animal shape, you gain the effects of a
5th-level casting of your chosen form spell, except you always transform into
an animal matching your inherent animal and can use your humanoid form’s AC
if it’s higher than what the animal form grants. If your inherent animal isn’t among the
animals listed in the form, you default to the statistics and abilities of the bird battle
form, cat battle form, or deinonychus battle form for aerial form, animal form, and
dinosaur form, respectively (at the GM’s discretion, you instead default to
a different form that is closest to your inherent animal). You can
remain in animal shape indefinitely and can use Change Shape to
return to your humanoid or hybrid shape at any time.
If you have the Critter Shape feat, you can choose to gain the
effects of a 4th-level pest form, can remain in critter shape indefinitely,
and can return to your critter shape at any time after leaving the shape,
just as you can with Animal Shape.
ANIMAL SWIFTNESS
FEAT 17
BEASTKIN
You move like an animal. Your Speed increases by 5 feet. In addition,
you gain one of the following Speeds available to your inherent animal:
climb, fly, or swim. You gain this Speed only while in your hybrid shape.
The new movement is as fast as your standard Speed; for example, if you
have a 30-foot Speed, you can gain a 30-foot climb Speed. If your inherent
animal doesn’t typically have a specific type of Speed, you can’t gain it
with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn’t typically have a climb,
fly, or swim Speed, your Speed increases by 10 feet instead.
Werecreatures as PCs
Groups that wish to include playable
werecreatures, with all the ensuing
drama and drawbacks, can use beastkin
as a starting point but also include the
weakness to silver and moon frenzy
ability common to werecreatures. GMs
and players should work together
when doing this, however, as the
moon frenzy will cause a player to
lose control of their character for
some time; setting boundaries and
expectations is important. Additionally, a
werecreature’s curse has the potential to
steal the spotlight from other PCs or the
campaign’s story and should be included
only after serious consideration.

Once human and now something apart, fetchlings display the Shadow Plane’s ancient influence
through monochrome complexions, glowing eyes, and the casting of supernatural shadows.
Fetchling (Uncommon)
82
Physical DescriPtion
Most of the Shadow Plane appears as an altered version
of the Material Plane but leeched of color. These same
forces in the Shadow Plane have touched fetchlings,
whose skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from
stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray
between. Their bodies are just as
diverse in shape and size as humans,
though most display a certain
fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting
shadows. Fetchlings’ reflective, pupilless
eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling’s most
notable feature is their shadow, which almost
never faithfully reflects their body. Instead,
fetchling shadows might have incongruous
shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of
their own accord, or imitate the shadow
of another nearby creature.
society
Most fetchlings remain close to
Golarion on either the Material or
Shadow Planes, either forming
majority-fetchling communities or
forging solitary paths. Both planar
groups tend to be insular; many
fetchling cultures preserve memories
of
their
early,
perilous
days
confronting the Shadow Plane’s
hostile or beguiling denizens.
Their predilection for forming
tight
communal
bonds
and
adapting to local customs has
spread to become part of broader
fetchling culture, reinforced by two
major fetchling groups—the Estlaris
and Sharedars—who live in the shadow
of more powerful entities.
alignment anD religion
A culture of survival passed down through
generations means many fetchlings prefer to
maintain a cautious worldview and adapt
to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many
trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some
choose to join with local powers for personal
or communal advancement, or to tear systems
down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter
what they see as fetters that bind them and
their communities.
Fetchlings are a striking people whose skin appears
entirely drained of color. These lithe and shadowy
beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They
see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and
have strange occult powers. Some fetchlings develop
their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and
Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper
about figures that emerge from shaded corners and
then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other
means, they’ve spread across Golarion and the planes
beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.
The first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago,
when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and
cast the world into darkness, one small group
of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious
hooded figure known as the Widow answered
their call, slicing open a passage into the
Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through,
trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep
shadow. As they navigated the plane’s strange
environs and dangerous inhabitants, its
nature slowly worked monumental changes
on the survivors.
If you want a character more at home in a
mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral
gloom, and who embodies the dualities of light
and darkness, you should play a fetchling.
you might…
• Live and work in gloomy areas of dim light
with plenty of shadows, only providing
bright light when expecting visitors.
• Look to people’s shadows as a way of
identifying them, alongside features
like stature or facial structure.
• Maintain composure when faced with
strange creatures and circumstances.
others Probably…
• Believe you have shadowy
powers, such as the ability
to consume light as food,
melt into darkness, or travel
between planes.
• Expect you to be cautious,
reserved, and a loner.
• Express interest in your
ancestral physiological
connection to the
Shadow Plane.

No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods’
powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection
and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of
Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort
of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while
Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the
world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called
the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.
names
Fetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same. These names
commonly include phonetic qualities from multiple languages or are simply
local cultural names that fetchling families find compelling. Other dominant
naming conventions include flowing sounds, harsh or hissing consonants, and
surnames that refer to important relatives or community traits.

FETCHLINGS OF THE INNER SEA
Fetchlings are an uncommon sight in the Inner Sea region, as the majority reside
in the Shadow Plane. A large portion of the region’s fetchling diaspora arrives
from Shadow Absalom—which they call Beacon—before using Absalom’s
ports to reach greater Golarion. Some formerly Nidalese fetchlings escape
the predations of the Umbral Court and lead freer lives. Other fetchlings
hail from remote enclaves on the Material Plane or arrive via supernatural
phenomena that thin the barriers between the Material and Shadow Planes.
Thanks to their reflective eyes and relative rarity, fetchlings around the
Inner Sea tend to stand out. Some attempt to hide their distinctive qualities,
imitating local fashions and wearing clothing that covers their telltale skin.
Others take pride in their differences, donning traditional garments or clothes
that accentuate their monochrome nature. A recent fashion trend emphasizes
lighter-colored garments that contrast with fetchlings’ unique shadows.
Fetchlings’ origins profoundly impact their interactions. Some, particularly
those from Beacon and Nidal, have spent much of their lives in fear or danger.
These individuals see the wider Inner Sea region’s relative freedom and
diversity as a way to spread their wings and establish a new identity. Others
hang on to their pragmatic reservations and sense of caution.
brightsorrow
Brightsorrow fetchling enclaves live on Somal’s Tears, a chain of islands
suspended between Shadow Golarion and its barely visible moon. The isles are
well-lit by Shadow Plane standards, with ambient light in a narrow pre- and
post-dawn range. This illumination brightens during irregular Lacrimosas,
days when a ring of pale sunlight shines from behind the obsidian moon. The
light makes small portions of the islands flare and disappear—along with any
people in the area—only to reappear at a later Lacrimosa.
Brightsorrows greatly value self-sufficiency and preparation. Many
garments incorporate pouches or rucksacks to hold necessities like preserved
foods. Songs, stories, and rhymes that convey life lessons and tradecraft are
cherished for similar reasons. Weaving is a particularly prestigious craft, as
intricately woven bridges span the void between isles.
Brightsorrow skin tones occupy the middle of the gray scale spectrum.
Their eyes fluctuate over months between pale yellow and the orange of a
setting sun, and their hair usually grows in springy, black-and-gray coils.
Portions of Brightsorrows’ shadows frequently drift away and dissolve,
though surrounding shadows quickly fill the newly empty sections.

estlari
Most of the fetchlings who live in Beacon—better known to those on Golarion
as Shadow Absalom—are Estlaris, a fetchling sect that traces their origins to
the city’s founding days. Centered on the light of the Glare, a stable interplanar
portal inside a mysterious stonework cathedral, those first fetchlings built the city
alongside the insectile d’ziriak. Despite historically unstable alliances, the two
groups have made Beacon an interplanar metropolis—if a somber and dangerous
one. The masked umbral dragon Argrinyxia rules with a tight grip, though she
loosens it enough to encourage the flow of goods and peoples from across the
multiverse. Many Estlaris work as merchants and negotiators as a result.
Color and light are hallmarks of Estlari culture, the former influenced by the
d’ziriak practice called light weaving. Magical lights or ornate candles mark
important occasions. Estlaris also see personal fashion as an important means of
expression. Popular trends include: angular, d’ziriak-inspired designs; vibrantly
dyed hair; and muted outfits that incorporate a single, colorful accessory.
Estlari skin tones tend toward lighter shades like alabaster and ash, and their
eyes are usually shades of yellow. Their hair is predominantly straight, fine,
and pale. Many are slender and long-limbed, appearing almost stretched.
Estlaris’ crisp-edged shadows often look darker than would be expected
for prevailing light conditions.
rikmirit
Rikmirit fetchlings dwell in the forested hollows and sheltered valleys of
the southeastern Five Kings Mountains, near the borders of Andoran,
Taldor, and Galt. Folk tales relate how an ancient “Surgeon’s Spire”
drew Rikmirits from the Shadow Plane and into the mountains. Their
communities are nestled behind wooden palisades, and they arrange their
steep-roofed, gray- and green-tiled buildings to take advantage of what
little sunlight reaches these locations.
Family, community, and hospitality are key cultural values for the
insular Rikmirits. Almost all settlements feature a central all-hearth—a
large building with room for communal work, socialization, and guest
lodging. Most regional travelers know they can count on the
hospitality of the wary but welcoming fetchlings. Refugees and
expatriates from surrounding countries, particularly Galt, have
become increasingly long-term residents of Rikmirit towns.
Rikmirits have complexions from slate to charcoal and
tend to shape their thick hair with intricate bindings. Their
eyes usually shine in misty shades of gray or white. Rikmirit
shadows bend subtly toward the sun.
shareDar
Fetchlings living in Nidal are called Sharedars. The Nidalese are bound to
and deeply fear Zon-Kuthon, the Midnight Lord, and this fear extends to
the shadowy Sharedars, particularly in rural areas. Many of these fetchlings
dwell in Nidal’s major cities: Nisroch, Pangolais, and Ridwan.
These cities are no less unkind to fetchlings. The ruling Umbral
Court enforces strict residency quotas, forcing a portion of the Sharedar
population to live near Kuthite temples. The Court provides housing
and reagent-laced food. This sustenance ripens Sharedars’ supernatural
connection to the Shadow Plane, which can then be metaphysically
harvested in Kuthite rituals that sap their supernatural vibrancy. Even
though this exploitation is known, if not understood, some still opt for
the stable livelihood of bigger cities. Other Sharedars fight back. The
term “eave” refers to any fetchling who supports their community
through clandestine subversion of the state. Eaves smuggle, broker
information, or siphon resources from bureaucratic duties. Other
eaves help smuggle comrades to freedom abroad. The spoils of
Fetchling Adventurers
Fetchlings have a well-earned reputation
as travelers. Their merchants and
emissaries ply many roads, while
nomads and sailors seek what lies over
the next horizon. Charlatans, criminals,
and street urchins carve livelihoods from
inhospitable environs. Many fetchlings
leverage their natural litheness as
swashbucklers or rogues. The Shadow
Plane’s caress awakens hidden power
in many fetchling bards or sorcerers
(especially those of the shadow
bloodline) or drives them to study
deeper mysteries as witches or wizards.

Fetchling Settlements
Many fetchlings congregate in these
two cities.
Beacon (Shadow Absalom): Estlaris
ignore their city’s official name on
Golarion and instead call their home
Beacon. Velstracs and intelligent
undead prowl the city’s sparsely
traveled streets, but business thrives
behind closed doors and in towering
d’ziriak hives. Ships cross the parched
Bay of Dusk to bring diverse wares
that fuel warring factions, while the
Glare at Beacon’s heart can send
visitors back to the exact spot from
which they entered the Shadow Plane.
Candlease: This island of terrace
farms, natural spires, and colorful
woven bridges floats in the sky
beneath Shadow Golarion’s moon. In
the Tallow amphitheater, the timely
gleaming of obsidian standing stones
helps predict the Lacrimosas that
both take and replace Somal’s Tears.
Candlease also hosts storytelling
contests and Brightsorrow moots.
resistance are shared at “the local kayalhi,” gathering places named for a
fetchling-majority town in Nidal’s hinterlands.
Sharedars tend toward either the exact middle or the extremes of the
monochrome spectrum, and they typically have yellow, gray, or black eyes.
Their shadows appear smaller than the bodies that cast them and seem to
loom, gaunt and tall, when viewed indirectly.
FETCHLING HERITAGES
Fetchlings’ extraplanar past shaped them in many ways. Choose one of the
following fetchling heritages at 1st level.
bright Fetchling
Your body proves that shadow can’t exist without light. Perhaps your eyes
glow brighter or your veins occasionally pulse with light. You emit dim light
within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action,
which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your
shadow to glow and cast dancing lights and light as occult innate cantrips.
Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
DeeP Fetchling
Your predecessors dwelled in the Shadow Plane’s deepest, most treacherous
regions. You might cast a denser shadow, have a slower pulse, or find comfort
in the embrace of darkness. You gain cold or negative resistance equal to half
your level (minimum 1), chosen when you gain this heritage.
liminal Fetchling
You come from a line of fetchlings with a closer connection to the Ethereal
and Shadow Planes, and you share those realms’ affinity with the in-between
and unseen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures
within 60 feet when using the Seek action. Your flat check to target concealed
creatures is DC 3 instead of DC 5, and your flat check to target undetected
creatures is DC 9 instead of DC 11.
resolute Fetchling
Your ancestors have long dealt with the horrific—in the Shadow Plane or
elsewhere—and you bear their mental fortitude. When you roll a success on
a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.
wisP Fetchling
Your ancestors’ exposure to the Shadow Plane wrought great physical changes.
Your hair or skin sometimes appears insubstantial, and you’re slighter and
more agile than other fetchlings. You’re Small instead of Medium. You gain
the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics, the Quick Squeeze skill feat, and
a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Tumble Through. If you
would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background
or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
FETCHLING ANCESTRY FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a fetchling,
you select from among the following ancestry feats.

to half your level rounded up. Successfully counteracting the light source suppresses
its ability to produce light for 1 minute, but not any other effects. If you’re in dim light
or darkness when you Extinguish Light, its range is 240 feet.

a meaning akin to “shadow people.”
Most kayals reject the term fetchling,

origins, but its use is widespread in
Nidal. To kayals in Nidal, their name

Fleshwarps (Rare)
Fleshwarps are people whose forms were created or radically transformed by magic,
alchemy, or unnatural energies. Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for
them to find a place for themselves in the world.
Fleshwarp (Rare)
88
Magic and science that can warp bone and twist
sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps
are those who have been permanently altered by such
methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole
cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly
transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.
The ancestry name “fleshwarp” is an umbrella term,
since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more
infamously well-known than are alterations caused by
uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether
practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters,
or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of
reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents.
This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only
those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be
considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their
altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever,
transformed beings living a wild and strange existence
beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.
Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the
same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and
skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a
thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic
features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves.
Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging
eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only
subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such
as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of
bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their
mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when
creating a fleshwarp character!
If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can
change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly
unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you
should play a fleshwarp.
you might...
• Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect
or fear.
• Be used to relying on yourself.
• Distrust large groups of people, particularly
mobs, based on past experiences.
others Probably...
• Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.
• Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or
occult phenomena.
• Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable—and
perhaps even dangerous—outsider.

Physical DescriPtion
Fleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under
100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their
limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs,
two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should
consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their
limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely
in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even
fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure
might look wildly different.
society
Fleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They
most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a
community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous
among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact
with people who might fear or persecute them.
Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those
who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help
each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed
can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with
anyone besides close friends or loved ones.
alignment anD religion
Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely
work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They
need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few
fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps
as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other
people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral
in alignment, for while alienation doesn’t force a fleshwarp to feel contempt
for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially
true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic
transformation. Fleshwarps aren’t often casually religious; most either have little
to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply
seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious
fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps
typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters.
names
Fleshwarps can come from—and thus have names from—any culture or
ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether
to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their
past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to
them by others, such as “Triple Handed,” “Barkfoot,” or “Many-Mouth.”
Fleshwarps don’t keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend
to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by
people they care about.

FLESHWARPS ON GOLARION
The eldritch magic and aberrant alchemy used to create fleshwarps are rare
but not unique. A number of different organizations and effects in Golarion
produce fleshwarps, and one of a fleshwarp’s most important aspects—
beyond appearance or attitude—is their origin, which influences both their
form and their attitude toward the world.

Fleshwarp Adventurers
Fleshwarps often live on the margins
of society. The hermit, hunter, nomad,
or street urchin backgrounds work
well for many fleshwarps; others
might be criminals, entertainers,
or prisoners. The need to defend
themselves leads many fleshwarps to
become barbarians, fighters, rogues,
or rangers. Champions and druids are
common callings among fleshwarps
who seek to defend and better the lot
of others of their kind.
Fleshwarps fall into two major groups: those born a member of a different
ancestry and transformed into a fleshwarp or those born as a fleshwarp,
knowing no other existence. The former sometimes hide their new forms,
seeking shelter among their prior society with those open-minded enough
to shield them from the less understanding—though unfortunately, there
are no guarantees that their friends and family members will be protectors,
rather than persecutors. These fleshwarps know best how to blend into their
erstwhile societies and might go undiscovered for a long period of time.
Fleshwarps born into their warped forms generally have a more difficult
upbringing and were likely often forced to fend for themselves, particularly
if rejected by parents who considered their form blasphemous or ill-fated.
They’re likely to accept their own bodies, as they’ve never known another.
FleshwarP origins
Drow fleshwarpers practice their horrid arts in subterranean laboratories,
using intentionally painful methods to transform unwilling victims into
surreal, if predictable, shapes. The most common final result of this process
is a drider (Bestiary 159). Shapewrought fleshwarps are the lucky exceptions
who escape before the process is complete or who survive a faulty process.
They might have some features of the fleshwarp they were destined to become,
had the transformation been completed, or might have other features entirely.
They often retain an intense fear of dark, underground places.
Cultists who serve wicked deities of transmutation, such as Haagenti or
Yamasoth, sometimes forcibly transform victims in vile rites. Whether the
victim survives is of little consequence to these cultists; it’s the transformation
itself that honors their malevolent gods. Their victims are often released after
their change, usually from indifference but sometimes to instill terror in a
local populace.
The fleshforgers of the magic-infused nation of Nex also create fleshwarps,
particularly in the cities of Ecanus and Oenopion. These processes spring
not from hatred or debased worship, but from a clinical, academic
desire to test the limits of magic with little disregard for sapient life.
Fleshwarps created in the fleshforges of Oenopion are more
likely to have others that resemble them, as some of the
processes used there are time-tested and replicable. These
fleshwarps are the most likely to have undergone their
transformation willingly, accepting enormous risks to gain greater
strength and power.
Fleshwarps sometimes originate from the laboratories of Ustalav, results
of scientific rather than magical experiments. Hidden from a suspicious
populace, these fleshwarps are rarely coddled by their scientist creators; they
are often forced to serve as laborers and may be cast out as the scientists push
for even more extreme discoveries. A few are taken as pupils by their secretive
masters, raised with a startlingly deep knowledge of alchemical or scientific
practices but limited experience with the wider society.
Some fleshwarps have no mortal hand in their creation at all, but are formed
due to some environmental accident or catastrophe. The erratic primal magic
of the Mana Wastes region is widely known to give rise to fleshwarps. This
area holds a number of small fleshwarp settlements,  so fleshwarps here are
more likely to have a stable home community.
Body-altering magic was practiced in ancient times as well. Many mages
and alchemists of ancient Thassilon practiced fleshwarping, particularly
the runelords, who regularly bound magic to flesh in the form of arcane
sigils and created magically imbued creatures whole cloth. Until the sudden
appearance of New Thassilon, this knowledge was at best fragmented
and was widely considered lost; sinspawn (Bestiary 296) and fleshdregs
seemed to be the only remaining vestiges of this once-extensive lore. Recent
discoveries in Thassilonian ruins such as Hollow Mountain and Xin-Shalast,

PAGE 92
================================================================================

Fleshwarp Settlements
No settlements consisting entirely
of fleshwarps exist openly outside
of the Mana Wastes; elsewhere,
citizens keep the secret so well
that their community’s existence
isn’t known to the world at large.
Fleshwarps are more likely to live
on the fringes of other settlements,
working in industries where their
hardy constitution is an advantage
and their uncanny appearance isn’t
a liability. Some are herbalists or
trappers, working in the wilderness
and interacting with others only
rarely. Locals might come to consider
a fleshwarp their equal or friend, and
take umbrage at outsiders who make
a big deal out of the “monster” in their
midst. Sentiment might turn quickly
upon supernatural events or strange
attacks, however, and, tragically,
more than a few fleshwarps have
been turned out of homes they’ve
occupied for decades when faced with
a misguided mob.
as well as records brought forth by the denizens of New Thassilon, have
created something of a resurgence in sin magic used to transform flesh. These
practitioners are, as in the days of ancient Thassilon, almost universally
amoral alchemists or sin-obsessed wizards, and efforts to tamp down their
renewed practices have met with little success. Most Thassilonian fleshwarps
bear twisted runes that hint at their transformation.
Perhaps the least common and least understood origin of fleshwarps on
Golarion is found in Numeria. Foul and eldritch fluids of many types collect
in pools and puddles throughout this harsh land, and the desperate or foolish
sometimes drink them. Imbibing these fluids transforms the people  who drink
them into fleshwarps in entirely new ways unconnected to magic or alchemy.
Instead, their transformation is the result of advanced chemical interactions
or reconstructive nanites. Those unhappy with the result tend to be more
hopeful than other fleshwarps of finding some way to reverse the change,
perhaps by refining and imbibing yet more Numerian fluids. That these
experiments usually lead to further transformations, or even death, doesn’t
always stop them from continuing their trials on themselves—or others.
FLESHWARP HERITAGES
The circumstances of each fleshwarp’s creation are different, but they can be
grouped into heritages based on the nature of their origin. Choose one of the
following fleshwarp heritages at 1st level. Although any fleshwarp may have
any appearance you desire, each heritage provides typical characteristics.
createD FleshwarP
You were created through occult or alchemical
processes, such as being grown in a vat or
stitched together from the body parts of other
creatures by a scientist in Ustalav. Your
manufactured body is durable; you don’t
need to eat and can’t starve. You gain a
+2 circumstance bonus to saving throws
against diseases.
mutateD FleshwarP
Transformed by uncontrolled magic, you originated in
a the Mana Wastes or another region similarly devastated by
uncontrolled magic. Due to your toughened or redundant organs,
the DC for your checks to recover from persistent bleed damage
is 10 instead of 15, and it’s reduced to 5 instead of 10 if you have
particularly effective assistance recovering from the persistent damage.
shaPewrought FleshwarP
A victim of fleshwarping, you likely bear loose flesh, bony spurs, or features
of inhuman creatures sprouting from your skin. You have nevertheless turned
the psychic toll of your transformation into a strength. You gain resistance to
mental damage equal to half your level (minimum 1).

Your transformation is due to manipulation by advanced technology, like that

Fleshwarp Motives
Fleshwarps have a variety of
reasons for taking up the life of an
adventurer. Some are turned out of
their homes by an uncaring parent or
a suspicious mob. Other fleshwarps
travel to learn more about their
own transformation or to seek out
others of their kind. A few even
actively seek the means—either
technological or magical—to undo
their transformations or adopt a new
form that won’t incite repulsion or
fear in common people. Still others
understand that a good way to earn
respect is to solve a community’s
problems—then quickly leave the
area—and therefore fall into the role
of itinerant adventurers-for-hire.

Children of chaos, ganzis are born of the roiling effervescence of the untamable Maelstrom,
the primal sea of all creation. Their blood crackles with the promise of change and the
raw power of creation unshackled.

While some ganzis have links to other creatures of chaos,
like valkyries or einherji, and some to no known beings,
a narrow majority manifest as “proteankin” ganzis.
Whether actually related to proteans or not, these ganzis
possess serpentine tails with colorful scales and feathers,
as well as patches of feather and scale in other
places. Bilateral symmetry of such features is
ubiquitous, despite their chaotic origins.
Given their dramatic physical features,
most ganzis are accustomed to drawing
attention. Some lean into this, dressing in
daring outfits and developing exuberant
personalities, while the more introverted
use
concealing
clothing
to
hide
their heritage. Regardless of social
preferences, many ganzis share
a passion for works of craft or
artistry; ganzis often seek out
craftworks as fashion statements,
from
bracelets
to
necklaces
to brooches.
society
As a highly individualistic and
geographically scattered heritage,
ganzis
have
few
widespread
traditions. The most common,
though, is the heart-name. While
ganzis are no more likely than
others to take issue with their
gift-name (as ganzis call given
names), the vast majority of ganzis
choose names for themselves,
selecting

names
that better describe their true
selves. Some use their gift- and
heart-names interchangeably; some
share a name only with close friends
While some ganzis are born of mortals who mingled
with the inchoate beings of the Maelstrom, and some
are descended from those who sailed that cerulean void,
many others are born in places where the Material Plane
frays toward chaos. Whatever their roots, all ganzis
share the same potent essence.
More than any other planar scions, ganzis are prone
to appearing in otherwise stolid and unremarkable
bloodlines. While this is sometimes cause for scandal
in less open-minded communities, most ganzi
children grow up as happy and loved as any
other child. Ganzi children often exhibit
irrepressible energy and good-natured
mischief. A few even grow out of these
tendencies eventually.

Ganzi Adventurers
Ganzis come from all walks of life.
Some find joy entertaining others
and learn the skills of acrobats,
entertainers, or gladiators. Others
focus on creative pursuits as artists
or tinkers, or as charlatans. The rogue
and bard classes suit ganzis’ love of
chaos and mischief, while those looking
for the thrill of combat often become
swashbucklers APG or even liberator
champions. Ganzis might study illusion
magic as wizards or witches APG.
or lovers; and some discard their gift-name entirely. Heart-names aren’t static,
and a ganzi might change their heart-name a day or a decade later.
alignment anD religion
Unsurprisingly, ganzis lean heavily towards chaos, favoring organizations
like the Firebrands. This is hardly universal, however—even a few suits of
Hellknight armor accommodate a feathered serpent tail. Likewise, many ganzis
find themselves suited to the service of Desna, Cayden Cailean, and other
powers that value freedom and individuality.
GANZIS OF THE INNER SEA
In regions familiar with couatls, proteankin ganzis often get
associated with the feathered serpents, whether through ignorance
or out of reverence. Many proteankin in such areas lean into
this theory. Such ganzis often seek to master wisdom and serenity,
finding meaning in emulation of the couatl.
Among dwarves, ganzis occur most often among the deep-dwelling
Grondaksen and other isolated communities. Identifiable by their
polychromatic hair or beards, ganzi dwarves are often seen as threats to
tradition and encouraged to become adventurers or emissaries. Some dwarf
communities, however, celebrate their ganzis as a divine reminder not to
become overly set in their ways.
Ganzi elves arise most often in Kyonin, as well as among the Mordant Spire
elves and the Kallijae of the Mwangi Expanse. While Kyonin’s non-ganzi
elves almost never treat their ganzi kin as lesser, many see the large number of
ganzis as a worrying sign of Tanglebriar influence. By contrast, the Spiresworn
consider ganzis to be sacred emissaries of the Voice of the Spire, while Kallijae
simply accept ganzis as kin. Ganzi elves are especially quick to act,
with many experiencing significant wanderlust as well; in addition,
ganzi elves often physically adapt to new regions more quickly than
other elves.
Ganzi gnomes, most common in Nex and Cheliax, can be
difficult to distinguish from other gnomes. Identifiable ganzis are
celebrated as beacons of creativity and excitement, though this puts
great pressure on young ganzi gnomes to live up to expectations;
it’s common for such ganzis to take up adventuring to escape
the pressure.
Ganzi goblins, most common in the Sarkoris Scar and Varisia,
deviate from traditional ganzi characteristics thanks to their
often asymmetrical physiology, with limbs or features on one
side appearing different from the other. They are celebrated among
Lamashtu-worshipping goblins for their appearance.
Ganzi halflings often have feathers instead of hair, especially on
their feet. Most common in Ravounel and Andoran, such ganzis are
called featherfoots by other halflings, with many taking the sobriquet
as their surname. Commonly seen as both champions of freedom and
disruptors of the peace, ganzi halflings are often encouraged to become
adventurers or to join the Silver Ravens or Eagle Knights.
Ganzi humans of the Inner Sea are most common in Jalmeray, Nex,
and most prominently Sarkoris and its surrounding lands. Beyond the
Inner Sea, the nations of Holomog in southern Garund, Nalmeras in
Arcadia, and Tianjing in Tian Xia all have sizable ganzi populations.
Ganzi humans most often manifest their heritage with tails, feathers,
and scales; the few that develop horns are often mistaken for tieflings
in Avistan. Ganzis in Vudra or Arcadia, however, are more commonly
presumed to be aasimars (kin of garudas or couatl, respectively), and
honored as such. Kellids of the Broken Lands consider proteankin ganzis
to possess a “dinosaur spirit” and, with it, immense heroic potential.

Ganzi Settlements
Since ganzi births tend to be
unexpected and ganzis themselves
prone to wanderlust, very few ganzi
settlements appear on Golarion. Until
recently, the best-known locus of
ganzi activity was the city of Anuli
in southern Garund; ganzi creativity
has contributed a great deal of art
(and the occasional crater) to the
celestial-blessed city.
Even before the fall of Sarkoris,
that region’s thin planar boundaries
resulted in more ganzi births
than normal. In the wake of the
Worldwound’s closure, many ganzis
have journeyed there. Some seek
to wipe out the area’s demons and
restore the land to its people, while
others wish to explore the blasted
realm or even settle in the region.
Today, the Sarkoris Scar hosts more
ganzis than anywhere else in Avistan.

The elements themselves flow through the veins of geniekin, mortals who carry the proud
legacy of their elemental ancestors.
Geniekin
98
The strength of mountains, the swiftness of wind, the
heat of flame, and the fluidity of tides—geniekin are
made of elemental energy as much as they are flesh and
blood. They are planar scions, the descendants of unions
between mortals and otherworldly creatures from
beyond Golarion. For geniekin, these planar ancestors
are elementals, most often genies, who have altered their
families and physiologies forever. Because the category
encompasses a wide range of elemental heritages,
geniekin vary greatly in appearance. All geniekin clearly
read as members of their humanoid ancestry, but some
supernatural element always sets them apart.
Occasionally, a geniekin child is born to wholly mortal
parents who were exposed to powerful elemental forces,
or their extraplanar traits might skip one or several
generations. Geniekin who grow up without the benefit
of an elemental mentor can sometimes have trouble
navigating mortal society or understanding what makes
them different.
GENIEKIN OVERVIEW
The following are the most common kinds of geniekin.
More information on each kind of geniekin is found in
the following sections from pages 100–119.
iFrit
Ifrits are geniekin descended from fire elementals, like
efreet and salamanders. If you want a character who
embodies the intensity, energy, and hunger of elemental
fire, you should play an ifrit.
oreaD
Oreads are geniekin descended from earth elementals,
like shaitans and zaramuuns. If you want a character
who embodies the strength, stubbornness, and resilience
of elemental earth, you should play an oread.
suli
Sulis are geniekin descended from jann, genies that walk
Golarion, though they are sometimes also born as the
children of geniekin parents tied to opposing elements.
If you want a character who embodies the complex
relationships between elemental energies, with an innate
planar connection to both the elemental planes and
Golarion, you should play a suli.
sylPh
Sylphs are geniekin descended from air elementals, like
djinn and invisible stalkers. If you want a character who
embodies the freedom, caprice, and speed of elemental air,
you should play a sylph.

PAGE 100
================================================================================

99
Common Terminology
The term geniekin came into common
parlance mostly thanks to tales from
Casmaron and, in particular, the
Padishah Empire of Kelesh. Many
of these folk stories, songs, and
other common tales include great
figures who have genie parentage.
The prominence and legacy of these
stories, along with the fact that the
most common geniekin are those
with genie ancestors, have cemented
“geniekin” as a common term for any
individual who manifests elemental
traits. This is true even when genies
are not part of a person’s lineage,
such as individuals descended from
elementals or sorcerers with the
elemental bloodline. Scholars have
pushed to use the more accurate
descriptor of “elemental scion,” but
the term has yet to permeate the
common lexicon.
Elemental Permutations
While other planar scions have
lineages that reflect the specific
fiends, celestials, or monitors from
which their families descend, geniekin
lineages are better described as
permutations of elemental expression.
Elements sometimes manifest in
unique and unusual ways within a
line of geniekin, regardless of the
elemental they descend from. These
permutations and their lineages are
as follows.
Air: fumesoul (miasma sylph),
smokesoul (haze sylph), stormsoul
(lightning sylph)
Earth: dustsoul (soil oread), gemsoul
(crystal oread), miresoul (mud oread)
Fire: brightsoul (radiant ifrit),
cindersoul (ash ifrit), lavasoul
(magma ifrit)
Water: brinesoul (saltwater undine),
mistsoul (vapor undine), rimesoul
(frost undine)
unDine
Undines, the water elemental geniekin, are descended from planar creatures
like brine dragons and marids. If you want a character who embodies the
adaptability, mystery, and power of elemental water, you should play an undine.
GENIEKIN FEATS

feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a geniekin

Ifrits descend from creatures such as efreet, salamanders, and magma dragons. Their
spark of ancestral flame gives them a reputation for being passionate, if not capricious.
Ifrit
100
100
Ifrits often build up personal relationships between
themselves and the idea of fire, feeling as though
they embody it mentally or spiritually, in addition to
physically. Some ifrits relate to fire’s mutable energy,
illuminating properties, or destructive nature.
Some ifrits share a connection from birth to specific
aspects of elemental fire, such as radiance, ash, or
lava; this is called an ifrit lineage. Ifrits often have the
same lineage as their parents, though sometimes ifrits
are born with lineages different from their families,
or to parents without one. Lineages can appear in ifrit
children as a reflection of where they were born—for
example, cindersoul ifrits sometimes originate from
being born in areas prone to forest fires. They can also
occur as a reflection of the ifrit’s planar ancestry, such as
a brightsoul ifrit having a fire-themed celestial ancestor
like a peri. Magma ifrits with the lavasoul lineage are
most often born the descendants of magma dragons or
other lava-themed fire elementals.
you might...
• Relate your personal identity to elemental fire
and believe fire represents core aspects of your
personality.
• Always keep yourself moving and busy, traveling
to new places or trying new things, for fear that
slowing down may dim your inner fire.
• Take great pride in your elemental lineage, especially
if you believe you are related to the mighty efreeti
nobles, the maliks.
others Probably...
• Look to you as an authority on fire magic or the
elemental planes.
• Think of you as a never-ending well of passion and
inspiration, with an inner spark that never dies.
• Assume you must be hot-headed and reckless, acting
before you think.
Physical DescriPtion
Just as their elemental origins can vary, so too can ifrits’
otherworldly appearances. Red, orange, and brass are all
common skin colors, while others have charcoal-gray,
ash-brown, or radiant white, yellow, or blue hues. Ifrit
hair often falls in untamable coils of flame that grow over
the ifrit’s lifespan. Salamander-descended ifrits can have
lizard-like scales, while those descended from efreeti may
have huge, red horns curling up from their skulls.
Many ifrits keep their skin uncovered and open to the
air, favoring loose or breathable clothes made in light
fabrics like silk and chiffon. Their styles often feature
bright colors and bold patterns paired with
metallic jewelry.
society
Ifrits are typically born into societies built by
others, where they comprise minority populations.
Most ifrits place a high value on their freedom, and
though they might live within societies and cultures
dominated by humans, elves, or dwarves, many carve
out peaceful, productive, and fulfilling places for
themselves. Because most ifrits aren’t bothered by high
temperatures, many gravitate toward workplaces that
get uncomfortably hot for other mortals, like forges.

Ifrits are fiercely independent, sometimes valuing their
personal freedoms above those of others around them.

Ifrit Adventurers
Ifrits who choose to set out as
adventurers usually have backgrounds
as artisans, artists, entertainers,
and merchants. Ifrits who choose
to become champions are often
redeemers, especially when they
enter the service of Sarenrae, and ifrit
clerics tend to worship deities who
hold fire in their areas of concern,
such as Shizuru, Atreia, and Ymeri.
detractors, ifrits who tend toward mischief are rarely motivated by malice.
The most common alignments among ifrits are lawful neutral and chaotic
neutral, with the rest typically falling into true neutrality, neutral good, or
neutral evil.
Ifrits are rarely inclined to venerate Golarion’s deities, typically resenting
the strictures and rules of an organized faith, but those who do most often
worship deities of fire or the sun, such as Sarenrae and Shizuru, or one of the
Elemental Lords of Fire, like Ymeri or Atreia.
IFRITS OF THE INNER SEA
Geniekin populations usually concentrate around geographical anomalies, and
ifrits are no exception. The Inner Sea’s volcanoes, like Droskar’s Crag, Blackpeak,
and Mount Kaltafarr, are hotbeds for ifrit births, especially lavasouls. Ifrits of all
ancestries also live in higher concentration in Qadira and Kelesh, though many
are met with scorn and fear due to Qadira’s legacy of slavery.
Ifrits of dwarven ancestry often resemble azers, dwarves from the Plane of
Fire with flaming hair and beards.
Ifrit elves exemplify their ancestry’s passion. Ifrits are more common
than other geniekin among the Vourinoi elves of
Garund’s deserts. Vourinoi, already very talkative,
respect their ifrit brethren as creative storytellers
who fill every silence with conversation.
Ifrit gnomes are disproportionately born with
the brightsoul lineage. They often have skin and
hair that glows and shifts colors, and many believe
the radiant energy that suffuses these gnomes makes
them more resilient against the Bleaching. A number of ifrit
gnomes live in Andoran near Droskar’s Crag in the fey-haunted
Darkmoon Vale, especially in the service of the Queen of Darkmoon
Vale, Syntira, one of the Eleven Eternal Monarchs.
Goblins love fire, and this love for fire leads to the birth of many ifrit goblins,
most of whom are drawn to fire magic or alchemy. Ifrit goblins are often born
with obsidian teeth, ears constantly licked by flames, or skin covered in a thin
coating of ash, which causes them to leave charcoal fingerprints and dark,
sooty trails everywhere they go.
Ifrit halflings never seem to keep still, a trait exaggerated among the
anxiety-prone Iobarian Mihrini ifrits, whose fidgeting hands sometimes cause
enough friction to create tiny sparks between their fingers.
Ifrit humans vary dramatically between cultures across the Inner Sea region.
In northern Avistan, ifrits live among the semi-nomadic Varki of Icemark.
Cindersoul ifrits live among the Shoanti and Varisians of the Cinderlands,
born with eyes that crackle like the last embers of a fire; birthmarks and
tattoos that flicker with their own flames; and dark, ashy breath.
iFrit heritage (uncommon)
You descend from fire elementals or bear the mark of the Inner Spheres, and
your features illustrate the influence that elemental fire has over you. You gain
the ifrit trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain resistance
to fire equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental heat
effects as if they were one step less severe (incredible heat becomes extreme,
extreme heat becomes severe, and so on). You can choose from ifrit feats and
feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
IFRIT ANCESTRY FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As an
ifrit, you can choose from among the following feats in addition to those
available from your ancestry.

Ifrit Settlements
The City of Brass, the largest city on
the Elemental Planes, has a population
that overshadows even the greatest
cities on Golarion. More ifrits are born
here than anywhere else, though they
are born second-class citizens.
Cinderveil, an ifrit city on the Plane of
Shadow, was founded 100 years ago
when a mountain corresponding to
the location of the Eye of Abendego
on the Material Plane erupted in ash
and dust.

The Plane of Earth’s influence runs through an oread’s family, most often from a shaitan
or crystal dragon ancestor. Oreads tend to be stoic, steadfast, and dependable, but they
contain depths not seen on the surface.
Oread
104
104
Oreads can be slow to reveal their true selves, or
perhaps more accurately, have enough depth and
mystery inherent to their beings that they can reveal
new and unexpected facets of themselves every day.
They usually feel that they personify certain aspects of
earth, stone, or other sediments or minerals, such as a
cliff’s tenacious resilience against erosion, the generosity
and nourishment of fertile soil, or the versatile utility
of metal and stone.
Oreads born with a special connection to a
specific subset of elemental earth, such as crystal,
dust, or mud, might have an oread lineage. A
lineage can be inherited along a family bloodline,
or it can manifest spontaneously in oread
children. They can be caused by where an
oread’s ancestors lived, frequently seen in
dustsoul oreads, many of whom are born
in a desert or to a family that has farmed
for generations. Lineages can also be
the result of specific planar heritages.
Gemsoul oreads often have a crystal
dragon in their lineage, and miresoul
oreads descend from the more sodden
creatures of elemental earth.
You Might...
• Relate your personal identity with
elemental earth and believe stones or
mountains represent core aspects of
your personality.
• Value moments of peace and quiet
seclusion where you can be alone
with nature.
• Take great pride in your elemental
lineage, especially if you believe
you are related to the austere
shaitan pashas.
others ProbablY...
• Look to you as an authority on
earth magic or elemental planes.
• Think you are wise and cautious,
moving into action only after
you have considered a problem
from all angles.
• Assume you are stoic and
quietly strong, keeping your
thoughts
and
feelings
to yourself.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Oreads have the same diversity in height, body type, and
physical characteristics as any other member of their
mortal ancestries, alongside a handful of other traits that
distinguish them as geniekin. Their skin is often gray or
brown, but can also resemble metals and precious stones,
with copper and iron veining or crystals that grow out of
their skin. Instead of hair, oreads often have crystals or
rocks that grow from their heads; regardless, most
oreads sculpt, decorate, or otherwise maintain the
appearance of their hair, whatever form it takes.
Almost all oreads have shimmering gemstone eyes,
beautiful and multifaceted.
Oreads usually dress in sturdy clothes that can
withstand physical labor and exposure to the
elements, like wool and leather. Many choose
clothing that will expose their unique
characteristics, tailored to show off any
crystals embedded in their rocky skin.
SOCIETY
Born and raised within the societies
of their mortal families, oread
children are often (though not
universally) described as shy and
quiet, growing up to be patient,
observant, and clever. They
gravitate toward careers that
allow them to work in peaceful
contemplation
with
their
thoughts,
present
opportunities
to work with their hands, or ideally,
both. Many oreads become miners or
crafters who work with the earth, such as
stonemasons, metalworkers, or gem cutters.
Oreads also tend to enjoy opportunities to
uphold structures or systems, and many find
their vigilance and patience well-suited for
careers as guards, wardens, or clerks. Oreads
born in rural communities find fulfillment
working and living on the land in a peaceful,
self-sufficient harmony with nature.
alignMent and religion
Oreads are known for being steadfast and
reliable, often placing high value on personal
honor and keeping their word. Many are
fiercely protective of their friends but less
concerned for the safety of those outside

Oread Adventurers
Oread adventurers usually come
from artisan, herbalist, and miner
backgrounds. Many oreads work with
their hands as craftspeople, creating
their work out of stone, metal, gems, or
other forms of their ancestral element.
Oread clerics tend to worship one of
the Elemental Lords of Earth (Ayrzul
or the still-imprisoned Sairazul) or the
dwarven god Torag, or follow the path
of the Green Faith. Druid and ranger
oreads are common, with most druid
oreads following the stone order.
their circle. The most common alignments among oreads are true neutral and
lawful neutral, with the rest typically falling into other neutral alignments like
neutral good or neutral evil.
Religious oreads find that lives of silence, contemplation, or seclusion suit
them well, and most dedicate themselves to the worship of earth and nature
deities like Torag, Ashukharma—the Vudran deity of canyons and cliffs—or
one of the Elemental Lords of Earth, Sairazul and Ayrzul. The nature-focused
philosophy of the Green Faith also appeals to many oreads, especially those
who become druids of the stone order. An oread’s contemplative nature also
aligns well with the teachings of Irori and Gruhastha.
OREADS OF THE INNER SEA
Oreads of all ancestries are most numerous in Jalmeray, Qadira, and the
Darklands, though they can be born among any ancestry anywhere in the
Inner Sea region. Like all geniekin, oread births are mostly concentrated
around geographical anomalies linked to their element, like the Emerald
Spire in the River Kingdoms (which reaches all the way down to an ancient
Orvian vault), the Crystal Womb in the Darklands, and Crystalrock in the
Mindspin Mountains.
Oreads are the most common geniekin among dwarf populations, especially
among the Grondaksen: underground dwarves who live deep among the stones.
The greatest concentration of gemsoul oreads live in the Darklands near
the Crystal Womb, which has the power to transform creatures into
oreads and is believed to contain a portal to the Plane of Earth.
Holtaksen (or mountain dwarves) living in the Mindspin
Mountains above the site also feel its planar influence, as
well as the influence of Crystalrock, near the dwarven Sky
Citadel of Janderhoff. These oread dwarves often grow
crystals from their faces instead of beards and have sharp,
squared features. They sometimes chisel traditional dwarven
patterns into their bodies as a form of stone tattooing.
Among elf ethnicities, oread Mualijae in the jungles of the
Mwangi Expanse tend to have long brown hair made of nutrient-rich
soil, able to support small plants like flowering ivy, and skin like the
bark of jungle trees.
Oread gnomes reflect the strange, oversaturated lushness of the earth
from the First World, sometimes presenting stone or sediment in colors
never seen on the Material Plane.
With earthen features that grow, change, and fall off more often than
other oreads, oread goblins track dirt wherever they go. Those with
crystalline features often make art from their shed crystals to give to
those most important to them.
Jaric halflings living in the Barrier Wall mountains of northern Garund
host a large oread population, with some groups that are entirely oread,
making the Jarics among the only groups with wholly oread communities
on Golarion. Oread Jaric halflings often have rocky fingertips or nails and
veins of metal on the tops of their feet.
Few oread humans look alike, with their bodies incorporating their
earthen features in extremely diverse ways.
OREAD HERITAGE (UNCOMMON)
An earth elemental ancestor has influenced your bloodline, and your features
highlight this elemental planar connection. You might have a crystalline
or metallic sheen to your skin or hair, rough and stony flesh, or glittering
gemstone eyes. You gain the oread trait, in addition to the traits from your
ancestry. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from oread feats and
feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

OREAD
Your earth elemental ancestor’s influence manifests in you as dust and dirt,
like the soil of a field or the hot desert sands. You gain the trained proficiency

OREAD
You have a connection to the muddier denizens of the Plane of Earth from its
border with the Plane of Water, and your elemental lineage manifests as clay
or mud, reflecting that bond. Your body’s mudlike quality makes it easy for you
to compress and squeeze yourself through smaller areas. You gain the trained

Your connection to the earth makes natural uneven surfaces less of a hindrance
for you. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble and uneven ground made
of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on
narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone and earth, you aren’t flat-footed,

Family Relations
Most oreads are descended from
shaitans, genies native to the Plane
of Earth, but other planar creatures,
especially other earth elementals,
can also have oread descendants. The
children of earth and mud mephits
are typically born smaller than their
mortal parent, with modest vestigial
wigs or nubs in their backs where
a mephit’s wings would have been.
When a crystal dragon bears oread
offspring, they almost always have
the gemsoul lineage in addition to
draconic features like wings or a
tail. Xorns are the least common
elemental ancestors for an oread,
as they seldom have relationships
with mortals.
Frequency once per day
You reinforce your shield with a rocky outgrowth of metal and stone. You Raise
your Shield. If you use the Shield Block reaction before your next turn, add your
character level to your shield’s Hardness when determining how much damage
is blocked.

When in danger, you can harden the stone in your skin into armor, much like a
shaitan. You can cast stoneskin on yourself only, 3 times per day as a 4th-level
arcane innate spell.

Sulis are geniekin who embody a mixture of elements, most commonly air, earth, fire, and
water. They are typically the descendants of jann, genies of all four elements that wander
the Material Plane instead of making a home on the Elemental Planes.
Suli
108
108
At birth, a suli resembles their mortal ancestry, not
manifesting their otherworldly heritage until adolescence,
when they awaken into their elemental power. Strong
in body and will, sulis are dynamic and ever-changing,
and most feel they embody either all the elements
together at once or the traits of different elements at
different times. Some see themselves as
having multiple aspects or faces to
their personalities—one for each
element—that they cycle through
over the course of days or weeks.

elements within you, believing you have sides that
befit each element.
• Work
to

understanding in the world around you.
• Be prone to bragging, both about your own
accomplishments and those of your family or allies.

• Rely on you for your elemental abilities and expertise.
• Think you must be descended from a janni, if they
recognize that you are a geniekin at all.
• Assume your position at the nexus of opposing
elements means you are a neutral diplomat.
PhYsical descriPtion
Of all geniekin, sulis most closely resemble their mortal
ancestries, and many could be easily mistaken for a
non-suli As children, they appear wholly mortal; a suli’s
otherworldly characteristics only begin to develop when
they awaken into their power in adulthood, which
some refer to as a second puberty. Most adult sulis
have eyes that glow with a supernatural light or shift
color depending on the element they are attuned to at
that moment. Adult sulis are also prone to asymmetry
or physical traits manifesting only on one side of their
bodies, such as developing heterochromia, beauty
marks, freckles on one side of the face but not the
other, or vitiligo on half of the body. Their skin often
takes on a metallic (especially bronzy) sheen after
their awakening, as well.
Most sulis choose utilitarian clothes, expressing
themselves through jewelry that highlights their
glowing eyes or metallic skin, or with tattoos that
symbolize their journey through life.
societY
Most sulis can conform to the societies they’re
born into. They tend to be highly social and gravitate
toward jobs or societal roles where they will be seen by or
interact with the public, whether working in restaurants
or performing on a stage. Sulis often prize fame and
recognition, wanting themselves or the people close to
them to be known and remembered, and many take up
artistic hobbies like songwriting, poetry, or painting to
memorialize people and places they hold dear.
Some suli-jann try to seek out their immortal
ancestors, but the nomadic jann rarely invite sulis to

PAGE 110
================================================================================

Suli Adventurers
Sulis often come from artisan,
bounty hunter, emissary, or nomad
backgrounds before becoming
adventurers. Sulis’ elemental
manifestations in adolescence cause
many of them to seek answers
about their heritage; these sulis
typically train as acolytes or scholars.
Classes that focus on creation or the
combination of elements, such as
alchemists and wizards, appeal to the
multi-elemental nature of many sulis,
while others pursue classes like bard
that combine martial and magical
disciplines. Suli monks often focus
their attention inward, harnessing the
elemental potential within themselves
and exploring their inherent
connection to the elements through
their martial art.
live among them. Instead, jann encourage sulis to enter mortal societies,
hopefully working to influence the Empire of Kelesh from the inside and end
the enslavement of genies. Many sulis become drawn into this conflict; some
do so to impress their immortal ancestors, but most simply abhor slavery.
alignMent and religion
Most sulis are intense but adaptable people, valuing inner strength and truth
over conformity or peace, often respecting others for living their personal
truths more than for sharing common values. Sulis usually have a neutral
component to their alignment; true neutral is the most common alignment
among them, with lawful neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral good, and neutral
evil suiting most other sulis.
Sulis are typically only religious if raised in a religious society, but those
that heavily invest in their faiths or become clerics tend to follow gods of
duality like Nethys and Gozreh, gods of creation and alchemy like Qi Zhong
and Brigh, or gods of travel like Desna and Alseta. Shelyn is also popular
among sulis who identify themselves with the process of artistic creation,
seeing themselves as a beautiful whole made of disparate parts.
sulis in the inner sea
The largest populations of sulis live on the continent of Casmaron, where
clans of suli-jann families live as nomads in the Windswept Wastes. Those
that leave the desert for Kelesh or Qadira often become agents of revolution
and change, fighting for freedom and the rights of genies and geniekin. Sulis
in the Thuvian city of Merab are valued for their connection to the four
elements of creation, and suli alchemists and elementalists are sought out
for their expertise and abilities. In Varisia, dualborn sulis are found among
the Shoanti quahs, typically those with connections to air.
Suli dwarves frequently collect gemstones representing the various
elementals in their heritage, and those who cast elemental magic use
these gems as a focus.
Dualborn suli elves with a connection
to fire and either air or water are born
among the Vourinoi in the Osirion desert’s
oases. Vourinoi sulis often have eyes or skin
that glow like flame, and bright blue or white hair.
Suli gnomes’ hair, skin, and eye color match with
far less regularity than typical gnomes
and feature more natural tones like the
blue green of the sea, the earthen brown
of soil, or the multifaceted red, orange, blue, and
white colors of fire.
Suli goblins revel in the freedom and chaos of
their unpredictable and many-faceted heritage. They
may have radically different senses of style from day
to day, corresponding with the element they feel most
connected to at that moment.
Many Othoban suli halflings emerged into the
modern age alongside New Thassilon with strange,
archaic features. These dualborn halflings’ ancestors
were often strongly associated with a particular
runelord and are usually born with a connection
to a combination of elements that best fits that
runelord’s area of magical focus.
Suli humans are most common among the
nations of the Golden Road. Signs of suli
heritage are less obvious among humans, as they
bear particularly subtle suli traits.

Suli Settlements
Like their jann ancestors, sulis tend
to wander or live nomadic lives more
often than settle down in a single city.
Golarion’s largest populations of jann
wander the Windswept Wastes of
Casmaron, and many families of suli-
jann can also be found there. In the
city-state of Merab in Thuvia,
sulis’ skill with mixing and
understanding elements is held in high
esteem by the local alchemists and
magicians, and some suli elementalists
move there, at least for a time.
suli heritage (uncoMMon)
You are descended from a janni or otherwise embody a dichotomy of opposing
elemental planar forces. You gain the suli trait, in addition to the traits from
your ancestry. You also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your
ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from suli feats and feats
from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
SULI ANCESTRY FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry

Choose two of the following elements: air, earth, fire, and water. Once made, this
choice can’t be changed. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to
all damaging effects with the traits of either of your chosen elements.
Special If you take the Elemental Assault or Elemental Bulwark ancestry feats,
you can use them only with your chosen elements. You can add your resistance from
this feat to the resistance you gain from Elemental Bulwark against effects with your
elements’ traits, for a total of 5 + half your level, or 10 + half your level with Improved
Elemental Bulwark. If you take the Tetraelemental Assault feat, you can choose each
of your two elements twice each, instead of choosing each of the four elements
once each.

you use Elemental Assault, instead of choosing a single element,
you can choose an element from the list when using the action,
and then choose a different element at the beginning of each
of your next 3 turns without spending an action; once you
have chosen an element, you can’t choose it again during this

Sylphs are an intense and lively people, flighty and tempestuous. These planar scions have
kinship to beings of elemental air such as djinn, invisible stalkers, and cloud dragons.
Sylph
112
112
Sylphs enjoying following their own tempos, shifting
between wild energy that draws all eyes to embodying
the spirit of unseen breezes that slip away without note.
They often build their identities around their perceived
personal connection to the element of air, relating
to a gentle breeze, a sudden flash of lightning, or an
uncontrollable storm.
Some sylphs are born with a connection to an
extremely focused aspect of elemental air, such as
smoke, storms, or toxic gas. While it does happen, a
child is rarely born with a lineage that differs from
their parents’, as geniekin typically pass these unusual
gifts on to their offspring. Lineages can manifest in
sylph children as a result of where they’re born, such
as when stormsoul sylphs are birthed in regions prone
to tornadoes or windstorms. A lineage can
also reflect a sylph’s elemental heritage
like in smokesoul sylphs, who
often descend from belkers.
Fumesoul sylphs, on the other
hand, are associated with
poisonous
and
otherwise
unbreathable gases.
You Might...
• Relate your identity with the
element of air and believe the wind
and storms represent core aspects
of your personality.
• Enjoy traveling and exploring high, secluded places
where you can observe the world beneath you.
• Take pride in your elemental lineage, especially
if you believe you are related to the gregarious
djinn viziers.
others ProbablY...
• Look to you as an authority on air magic or the
elemental Plane of Air.
• Believe you easily flow through all aspects of
society, while listening to those around you.
• Assume you must be airheaded or capricious,
prone to irresponsible behavior without regard
for consequence.
PhYsical descriPtion
Like all geniekin, sylphs are recognizable as members
of their ancestries with unique characteristics that
identify their planar heritage. Their skin and hair can
be any color of the sky, ranging from cloudy whites to
the twilight tones of dawn and dusk. Complex, swirling
marks dance across the skin of many sylphs, resembling
shifting summer clouds. Some have skin cool to the
touch, while others are surrounded by a constant static.
Their hair can move with a life of its own, and they’re
often accompanied by light breezes that follow them
everywhere they go.
Sylphs typically prefer clothing in light, airy fabrics
such as silk and linen, cut in loose and voluminous
styles that flow in the breeze. Many of them deliberately
wear chimes and jewels that jingle in the wind, though
more stealthy geniekin endeavor to keep everything
pinned down.
societY
Sylphs exist within the societies of other ancestries,
usually that of their mortal families, and it’s incredibly
common for them to have a sense of never quite
belonging. Most sylphs engage in a practice known as
“listening to the wind,” keeping their eyes and ears open
to all that happens, often making their companions
uncomfortable in the process. For sylphs, this habit
of vigilance and information-seeking helps them feel
connected to the world around them. A curious and
restless bunch, many sylphs seek out occupations and
lifestyles that allow them to travel and explore.
alignMent and religion
Most sylphs place little value on laws and tradition,
preferring to forge their own paths and go where

Sylph Adventurers
Sylphs who become adventurers
often have backgrounds as acrobats,
entertainers, nomads, and scouts.
Traveling beneath an open sky or
exploring the highest mountains is
irresistible, and this drive to always
reach for the sky drives many to pursue
a life of adventuring. Sylph champions
are most often liberators, and clerics
typically serve gods of air such as Hei
Feng or the elemental lords of air. Many
sylphs are sorcerers with draconic or
elemental bloodlines or wizards that
focus on elemental magic.
the wind blows, especially as many have a great love for subterfuge and
trickery, placing them at odds with nearly all laws and social norms.
Overall, they tend toward neutrality, pursuing the most expedient avenues
toward accomplishing their goals, regardless of legality.
Sylphs often find themselves drawn toward the mysteries of secretive
cults, worshipping outsider demigods like the elemental lords of air
Hshurha and Ranginori, or the empyreal lords of detectives and vigilance
Zohls or Tanagaar. Those who worship conventional deities tend to favor
gods of travel like Desna, gods of secrets such as Norgorber, or the obvious
gods of air, Gozreh and Hei Feng.
sYlPhs in the inner sea
Sylph populations are highest in areas with concentrations of elemental
energy and eternal or regular storms. Many sylphs are born in the deserts of
Osirion where windstorms called khamsins, believed to be caused by warring
elementals, bury entire cities. Sylph births are influenced among all ancestries
in Ustalav by the mistgales, in Katapesh by the great Trackless Storm, and in
northwestern Garund by the Eye of Abendego. Stormsoul sylphs are born
in Katapesh and Nex near the Lightning Stones, menhirs that range across
the southern reaches of the Barrier Wall. The stones are said to mark the site
of battles between air and earth elementals, and to this day, they still attract
elemental attention.
While sylph dwarves are uncommon, they’re less unusual than most
non-dwarves believe. They can be found among the Mbe’ke and
Taralu dwarves in the Mwangi Expanse and are regarded
in those cultures as blessings from cloud dragons; indeed,
many have cloud dragon ancestors. Smokesoul sylphs live
among the Pahmet dwarves of the Osirion Desert. Sylph
dwarves often grow wispy, insubstantial beards of cloud
or mist, or beards streaked with lightning and crackling
with static.
Culture and traditions blend particularly seamlessly for
sylph elves, allowing them to feel more
at home among other elves. Sylph elves
have even longer ears than their non-geniekin brethren and tend
to have eyes that glow with colors of the sky or flicker with the
power of the storm.
 Sylph gnomes are just as curious as other gnomes and
tend to have less trouble handling the Bleaching. Their
bright, sky-colored hair, eyes, and skin tones don’t
stand out quite as much among the outlandish
coloration of their gnome kindred, and they
might be mistaken for chameleon gnomes early in life before it
becomes clear that their colorations can’t shift.
Sylph goblins tend to leap from cliffs and other high
places to feel the winds as they fall. Those who survive
long enough earn deep respect from their fellow goblins
for their aerial powers.
The Chelaxian city of Corentyn, one of the largest
halfling settlements in the Inner Sea, also has the
highest concentration of sylph halflings. Typically
born in families of free halflings, these sylphs
often become involved with the city’s trade and
crime. Sylph halflings are especially quick and
nimble, with thin, wispy fingers and a light
layer of downy feathers on their cheeks, ears, and feet.
Sylph humans often have swirling air patterns on their skin
from birth, making them easy to identify early on. The largest

Sylph Settlements
Because sylphs are fond of travel,
there are few true sylph settlements
on Golarion. In the Shackles, many are
born near the Eye of Abendego, and
those Shackles sylphs are often drawn
to the chaotic mysteries of Ilizmagorti,
an enigmatic city run—and largely
obfuscated from outsiders—by the
Red Mantis. In the Terwa Uplands of
the western Mwangi Expanse, Mbe’ke
sylphs who pass through use their
people’s Sky Citadel as a temporary or
seasonal home.

These dynamic, fluid mortals trace their ancestry to creatures from the Plane of Water,
such as marids, water mephits, and brine dragons.
Undine
116
116
Undines often go through life in a series of shifting
phases, their interests waxing, waning, or sometimes
morphing altogether as old loves are discarded for
new interests. Structure provides a much-needed focus
to undines’ lives, and without strong goals or support
from those around them, undines can find themselves
stagnating in feelings of despondence. Most undines
feel they personify specific aspects of water, some seeing
themselves with the strength and power of the waves, the
speed and tenacity of a river current, or the
calm of a peaceful lake or pond. Others identify with all
these aspects and more, their demeanors shifting like the
tides from one situation to the next.
Undines born with a connection only to a specific
subtype of elemental water, such as ice, brine, or mist,
might have a specific undine lineage. These are typically
passed down from parent to child, as with other geniekin,
but on occasion, a child is born with a lineage never
seen in their family. Sometimes lineages are the result
of where an undine’s ancestors lived, such as rimesoul
undines being born in the cold northern countries or
at the tops of mountain peaks. At other times it can be
related to the undine’s elemental heritage, as is often
the case with brinesoul undines, who usually descend
from brine dragons. Mistsoul undines might have a
distant but powerful connection to elemental water,
or might even have a bit of elemental air mixed into
their ancestry.
You Might...
• Relate your identity to elemental water and believe
the streams and tides represent core aspects of your
personality.
• Be equally comfortable above the waves as you are
beneath them.
• Take great pride in your elemental lineage,
especially if you believe you are related to the
formidable marid shahzadas.
others ProbablY...
• Look to you as an authority on water magic or
the elemental planes.
• Think you can speak with aquatic creatures.
• Assume you are easily swayed by others, with few
real opinions of your own.
PhYsical descriPtion
With all the same diversity in height, body type, and
physical characteristics as any other member of their
ancestries, undine coloration runs a vast breadth of
variation. Most commonly, an undine’s skin and
hair mimic the colors of the lakes, seas, or
oceans near where they were born, ranging
from the palest of blues to sea greens and
navies. A rare few undines may even take
on the bioluminescence of deep-sea fish, the
bright colors of corals and anemones, or the
pale bone hues of seashells. More unusual
traits can include fin-like ears, thin layers of
shimmering fish scales covering their bodies,

Undine Adventurers
Undines often come from the animal
whisperer, artist, and sailor backgrounds
before becoming adventurers. The
artist background is especially common
among undines descended from marids,
and undines raised on the Plane of
Water in their parent’s courts often
develop their skills as bards. Undine
clerics usually serve water deities,
while most undine sorcerers possess the
elemental or genie bloodlines.
coral growths at their joints or temples, tails with caudal fins, and even
webbed hands and feet.
societY
Unlike other geniekin, undines create and congregate within their own
tightly knit communities near water or floating on top of it. Undine
neighborhoods that develop within larger cities, typically near the docks
or directly on the water, are informally known as flotillas. Because undines
deliberately create and seek out these communities, their children usually
have healthy childhoods focused on the values of fellowship and harmony.
This stands in contrast to many other planar scions, who all-too-often grow
up feeling like outsiders.
Undines typically gravitate toward occupations that allow them to live
and work near water, and many of them excel at fishing and sailing thanks
to their love and understanding of the sea.
alignMent and religion
Undines are flexible and community-minded, often valuing the overall
health of their communities above that of any one individual. Usually of
a neutral alignment, their moral concerns are often centered around their
societies rather than their actions.
Religion isn’t a major part of most undine’s lives, but they often have
strong spiritual connections to their supernatural ancestors or to water
itself. Some undines worship deities of water, such as Gozreh or Hei Feng,
while others might offer their prayers to Lysianassa, the lost elemental lord
of water.
undines in the inner sea
Undines can be born anywhere in the Inner Sea region, to anyone of any
ancestry or culture that chooses to have dealings with a genie or elemental
creature. Still, like all geniekin, their numbers are concentrated around
geographical anomalies like the eternal winter of Irrisen and the Eye of
Abendego, the never-ending hurricane in the Arcadian Ocean. Undines of
all ancestries are thus most numerous in the Shackles, the Sodden Lands,
and the Crown of the World. In the unending winter landscape of Irrisen,
nearly all are born as rimesoul undines.
The Taralu dwarves of the Mwangi Expanse build their homes in the
fog-shrouded jungle lowlands and sometimes give birth to mistsoul undines.
In Rahadoum, undines are born among the Vahrid surface dwarves native to
the marshlands of the Eternal Oasis, with sandy skin and blue or green hair
that flows like a gentle stream.
Rimesoul and mistsoul undine elves manifest most often among the
Ilverani people, better known as the snowcasters, at the Crown of the World.
Ilverani already have frost-white skin and hair, and this is also common for
the undines born among them.
Undine gnomes consider the land and the sea to be two different worlds
of possibility, doubling their potential for new experiences. Their bright hair
and eyes tend toward the blues and greens of the ocean.
Undines among Irrisen’s frost goblins rarely have the light blue fur of their
relatives, instead growing thin coats of frost or quill-like icicles on their skin.
Undines among other goblins occasionally have tiny suckers on their lower
body, reminiscent of those on grindylow tentacles.
Known to travel across the land like a flowing river, undine halflings tend
to make their homes in riverside communities. They often have patches of
fish scales across their bodies and hair in either a deep green or muddy color.
Undine humans reflect the biodiversity of the oceans, with watery or
aquatic features that differ greatly between each, though family lines tend
to share common traits.

live in Outsea, a semi-aquatic River
Kingdom with a powerful, primal
connection to elemental water. In Tian
Xia, the Wanshou state was struck
by a series of storms that flooded the
land; now, many of Wanshou’s children
are born as undines.

higher. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 persistent acid damage and is sickened
1 by the pain. On a critical failure, it instead takes 2d6 persistent acid damage
and is sickened 2.
MISTSOUL
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
UNDINE
You have a connection to vaporous forms of water, such as fog and mist. You gain
the Mist Blending reaction.
Mist Blending [reaction] (undine) Trigger A creature attempts a flat check to target
you because you’re concealed or hidden due to fog, haze, mist, or smoke;
Effect You shroud yourself in mist, making it harder for your foe to hit
you. If you’re concealed, the DC of the flat check increases from 5 to
7; if you’re hidden, it increases from 11 to 13.
RIMESOUL

UNDINE
The water inside you is cold and frozen, like sheets of ice and frigid glaciers. You gain
resistance to cold equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental
cold effects as if they were one step less severe (incredible cold becomes extreme,
extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
TIDE-HARDENED
FEAT 1
UNDINE
You’re at home in the unpredictable tides. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
saves against cold and water effects. If you roll a success on a save against a
cold or water effect, you get a critical success instead.

Family Relations
Most undines descend from marids—
the water genies native to the Plane
of Water—and the mortals they take
for lovers. These mercurial genies
usually show their favor to musicians,
dancers, and other artists, inviting
mortals of exceptional talents to live
with them. Other planar creatures
occasionally have undine progeny as
well. The children of water, ice, and
salt mephits are often born with small
statures, nub-like horns, hooked or
beak-like faces, or vestigial wings and
tails. Those related to brine dragons
are sometimes born with draconic
wings and tails and almost always
have the brinesoul lineage.
5TH LEVEL
FLUID CONTORTIONIST
FEAT 5
UNDINE
You can ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren’t tight
enough to force you to Squeeze. When you roll a critical failure on a check to Squeeze,
you get a failure instead, and when you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
STEAM SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
UNDINE
You transform your fire spells into steam, making them more effective underwater. If
your next action is to Cast a Spell with the fire trait, you can cast it underwater. When
you do so, it takes the form of scalding steam. Underwater creatures do not gain the
normal fire resistance for being underwater against this spell, but they don’t light things
on fire or cause persistent fire damage, nor do they add other effects that would apply
to fire but not steam (at the GM’s discretion).

Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants
them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether
they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers
of the societies around them.
Kitsune (Uncommon)
120
Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a
fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where
they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically
have what’s called a tailless form—a humanoid body
without any fox features that resembles a more common
ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural
areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.
Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live
among people of other ancestries, granting
them a degree of external insight into social
rules or dynamics that others process only
subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting
expectations as much as they do going along
with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories,
and wordplay, especially when the twist of
a riddle hinges on the listener’s assumptions,
reinforces their reputation as tricksters.
With dual forms and a connection to both
the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have
diverse concepts of self and identity. Some
even view their forms as separate individuals
altogether, using them to explore different
aspects of their personality.
If you want to play a character with
innate magical talents and countless hidden
facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye
and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.
You Might...
• Studiously observe the habits of those
around you, taking mental notes on how to
imitate them better.
• Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks,
or unnecessarily complex plots.
• Present a different, but authentic, side of
yourself in each new situation.
others ProbablY...
• Are taken in by your magnetic personality and
enigmatic nature.
• Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.
• Wonder what you aren’t telling them.
PhYsical descriPtion
Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and
short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes.
Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,

Traits

Kitsune
Low-light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it

concealed condition due to dim light.
Change Shape
As a kitsune, you gain the Change
Shape ability.
Change Shape [one-action] (concentrate, divine,
kitsune, polymorph, transmutation)
You transform into a specific alternate
form determined by your heritage.
If your heritage doesn’t list a form,
your alternate form is a tailless
form, which is a common Medium
humanoid ancestry prevalent where
you grew up (typically human). This
form is the same age and body type
as your true form and has roughly
analogous physical traits, such as
hair color. Using Change Shape
counts as creating a disguise for the
Impersonate use of Deception. You
lose any unarmed Strikes you gained
from a kitsune heritage or ancestry
feat in this form. You can remain in
your alternate form indefinitely, and
you can shift back to your true kitsune
form by using this action again.
tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as
they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.
societY
Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and
many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family.
Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities
that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective
that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that
someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong
interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.
When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal
repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it’s considered
a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune’s shapechanging nature,
kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to “break character,” shocking
the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.
alignMent and religion
Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual
natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly
toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but
even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.
The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture.
Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the
purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru
and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted
nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion,
respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess’s
true form to be that of a kitsune—hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.
naMes
While kitsune have some traditional names, they’re more likely to use names that
are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have
different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional
name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.
saMPle naMes
Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro
KITSUNE ON GOLARION
Kitsune originated in Tian Xia, though they’ve tagged along as other peoples
have moved across Golarion. As a result, they can now be found across the
globe. Kitsune tend to establish few ancestral enclaves, instead blending in with
the various national and ethnic groups in the lands where they reside.
angen
Angen is a kitsune settlement in the Inner Sea region, located in the Verduran
Forest of Taldor. Angen kitsune don’t represent an ethnicity of kitsune, but a
group of kitsune from many regions who have formed a collective society. Angen
kitsune are among those most invested in bridging communications between
kitsune and other peoples, as well as in forging a common kitsune identity out of
the traditions of all kitsune.
Where other kitsune often view their forms as different facets of themselves,
Angen kitsune tend to view their kitsune form as their true self. Angen kitsune
feel that showing their “true forms” to the people of the Inner Sea ensures
kitsune visibility and dispels the negative stereotypes of trickster kitsune. As
a cosmopolitan people, Angen kitsune are equally likely to have any heritage.
They tend to have a more fluid sense of what it means to be a kitsune and

Kitsune Adventurers
Kitsune who live among others
often have the charlatan, emissary,
entertainer, fortune teller, merchant,
noble, or nomad backgrounds. Those
kitsune who strike out alone favor the
acolyte, bandit, or hermit backgrounds.
Kitsune often excel as rogues,
investigators APG, and bards. Kitsune

those who forge a stronger connection

greater familiarity with living in a world of shapeshifters, often represented by
the Myriad Forms and Shapechanger’s Intuition ancestry feats.
hwaeko
Hwaeko kitsune live in scattered groups in and around the Chang Lio Jungle in
otherwise-peaceful Hwanggot. They tend to have lean builds, bristling dark fur,
and golden eyes. Long ago, Imperial Lung Wa drove these kitsune underground
and chased them to the edges of society. Many Hwaeko were forced to survive by
scavenging vegetables and less desirable cuts of meat like liver. This persecution
caused the majority of Hwaeko kitsune to develop an antagonistic and
misanthropic view of “civilization,” with many reluctant to reveal themselves as
kitsune at all. Some with fox forms eschew society altogether, living as foxes in
the wilds and coming into town only rarely—perhaps for a harvest festival, at the
new year, or as part of a “fox pilgrimage,” a practice where they test themselves
by living among non-kitsune as long as they can without detection.
Hwaeko kitsune often have the earthly wilds or dark fields kitsune heritage.
rengo
Every so often, when a caravan crossed the Crown of the World or a ship
sailed across the seas to Avistan, a kitsune numbered among the passengers.
Over time, these kitsune established a presence in distant Avistan. Though
Irrisen and Varisia have the highest kitsune concentration, some kitsune
live sprinkled throughout the large population centers of the
Inner Sea, such as Absalom.
Rengo kitsune tend toward dark brown or red fur. Practical
skills useful on the frontier are valued more than philosophic
meditation, leading Rengo kitsune to focus on trade skills such as farming
and artisanship. However, even in the Inner Sea region, kitsune retain a
connection to the unseen, incorporating local soothsaying traditions such
as harrow reading or tasseography into their customs.
Rengo kitsune often have the frozen wind kitsune heritage.
souko
While all kitsune, on some level, bridge the boundary between the material
world and the world of the spirits, Souko kitsune embody this role fully.
From their brightly painted settlement of Kihime in the Forest of Spirits,
Souko kitsune serve as couriers, diplomats, and translators between
distant kami, especially the ancient kami lords known as jinushigami,
who rarely move from the mountains and lakes they protect. Those
Souko kitsune who live outside of Kihime walk among the settlements
of northern Minkai and eastern Hongal, where they liaise with other
mortal peoples on behalf of the spirits. Their cultural emphasis on
ambassadorship means Souko kitsune tend to strongly separate their
internal and outwardly expressed feelings, modulating their expressions
based on the audience. Similarly, Souko kitsune tend to remain in tailless form
when among other ancestries out of a desire to present a more familiar face.
Many kitsune believe that Souko kitsune are closest to the Nine Bright
Grains—the originators of the kitsune people that legend states Daikitsu sent
to the Material Plane—and almost all are faithful Daikitsuns, incorporating
many of the Lady of Foxes’ rites into their everyday society. Souko kitsune’s
fur tends toward paler shades, with reddish streaks and patches that grow in
unnaturally symmetrical, runelike patterns.
Souko kitsune often have the celestial envoy or empty sky kitsune heritage.
KITSUNE HERITAGES
The form kitsune take varies between individuals, with tales stating that their
alternate form represents their connection to magical and spiritual influences.
Choose one of the following kitsune heritages at 1st level.

Fox Families
Due to their shifting nature, kitsune
often have mixed-ancestry family
units. The children of a kitsune and
a non-kitsune can inherit either of
their parent’s lineages, though many
assume that a human baby born to a
kitsune is simply a kitsune that has
yet to reveal their true form. This has
led to the widespread misconception
that all offspring of kitsune are
themselves kitsune.
celestial envoY kitsune
Whether due to Daikitsu’s grace or faithful forebears, you have a strong
connection to the divine, affording you certain protections. You gain the Invoke
Celestial Privilege reaction. Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid

Your spirit is open to the secrets of beyond, granting
you greater access to kitsune magic. You gain the Kitsune
Spell Familiarity ancestry feat. Your alternate form is a
common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you
grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.
Frozen wind kitsune
Your ancestors crossed the Crown of the World or resided on
snowy peaks. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level
(minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they
were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme,
extreme cold becomes severe, and so on). Your alternate form is a
common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up
(typically human), called a tailless form.
KITSUNE FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a kitsune,
you select from among the following ancestry feats. Additionally, when you
gain a level, you can grow one or more tails. Your maximum number of tails
is equal to the level of the highest-level spell you can cast from your spell

Kitsune Settlements
Though kitsune live all around the
world, two major kitsune settlements
exist on Golarion: Kihime in Tian Xia,
and Angen in the Inner Sea region.
Kihime, the central settlement for
Souko kitsune, is located in the Forest
of Spirits and consists of low, thatched
buildings in an intentionally ancient,
though effective, design. Rather than
torches, star orbs line the streets and
glow with soft foxfire to light the
darkness—legends state that these
star orbs can be unified to cloak
Kihime in illusions and abjurations in
times of peril. Angen, in the Verduran
Forest of Taldor, represents a more
modern and cosmopolitan kitsune
town, with buildings made in a variety
of styles. Angen customs emphasize
unity and collectivism, one of the best
known being the Foxes’ Wedding.
In this yearly festival, which occurs
spontaneously on the first autumn
day that rain falls from a blue sky, all
kitsune who became betrothed in the
last year are considered married. In
celebration, rainbows formed from
the mixed sunlight and raindrops
are enhanced by kitsune illusions,
becoming truly a sight to behold.
1ST LEVEL
FOXFIRE
FEAT 1
KITSUNE
A crack of your tail sparks wisps of blue energy. Choose either electricity or fire when
you gain this feat. You gain a foxfire ranged unarmed attack with a maximum range
of 20 feet. The attack deals 1d4 damage of the chosen type (no ability modifier is
added to the damage roll). Your foxfire attack is in the sling weapon group. Like other
unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with handwraps of mighty blows.
Special If you are a frozen wind kitsune, your foxfire deals cold damage instead
of electricity or fire.
KITSUNE LORE
FEAT 1
KITSUNE
You excel at navigating social situations and keeping secrets. You gain the trained

KITSUNE
Your magic has crystallized into a spherical stone. You gain a familiar, except it’s a
star orb: a Tiny stone of light Bulk. The familiar has no Speeds and must select
a Speed familiar ability before it can move, animating in a way appropriate

one. You can Change Shape to alter the details of your hybrid form without
fully changing into your true form or your alternate form. While in hybrid
form, your foxlike features make it obvious that you aren’t a normal humanoid.

Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the fey realm known
as the First World. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing
everything to do with magic.
Sprite (Rare)
126
When most people picture a fey, chances are they’re
thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in
the First World, where they are essentially immortal,
reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life
eventually comes to an end. Some even
meld together with others to form a more
substantial body or split apart
into multiple smaller fey.
However, sprites are incredibly
curious about all forms of
magic,
leading
a
significant
number to risk the mortal world
to explore the new possibilities
offered by the unusually static
nature of mortal
existence.
These
creatures
mix
in with other,
smaller groups of Material
Plane comrades, including
exiles from the First World,
those whose family swore pacts to
mortals, and even contemplative
individuals curious to enter the
mortal cycle of souls.
The first generation of Material
Plane sprites were content to
guard magical locations or objects,
learn music, and play pranks on the
unsuspecting. Panic struck when children
born in the mortal world didn’t form wings
upon adulthood—some sprites transitioning
to the mortal world likewise lost their
wings after a time. Believing this to be a
sign that the mortal world was too alien
for them to live there, many of the initial
sprite explorers returned to the safety of
the First World.
However, their wingless children
exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their
ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the
mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes,
but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As
they came close to reaching their full strength, many of
them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique,
and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen
before, a sign of their limitless potential.
If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and
curious, you should play a sprite.
You Might…
• Play good-natured pranks on those around you,
intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost
item, or even help find love.
• Become sidetracked by something new and
eye-catching before you have fully followed through
on your previous plan.
• Find something magical that’s so important to you,
you can’t help but protect it with every ounce of
your strength.
others ProbablY…
• Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and
perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your
actual abilities.
• Consider
you
the
prime
suspect
whenever
unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.
• Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your
flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained.
PhYsical DescriPtion
Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based
on their heritage. The Wingless—those with the potential
to become powerful heroes and villains, including
all PC sprites—slowly grow their wings over time as
their magical potential manifests, though some never
grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies
typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and
mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at
around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey
who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can
live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who
sense their time is coming to an end usually return to
the First World to be reborn and start their adventure
all over again.
societY
Sprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas
with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities
of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small
family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search
of excitement.
alignMents anD religion
Sprites run the gamut of alignments but are rarely lawful
or evil. They are far more likely to worship the Eldest—
the peculiar deities of the fey—than those of the mortal
world. They have a particular affinity for Shyka, the
many-formed Eldest of time, and the Lantern King, the

the most, and due to her iconic depiction as a butterfly-winged woman, some

SPRITES ON GOLARION
Unlike almost any other ancestry, sprites have distinctive heritages that
almost always correlate to their societies, and they don’t have any consistent
ethnicities beyond that. This oddity has led many scholars to classify the
various heritages of sprites as different creatures altogether, a fact that
endlessly amuses the fey, who don’t bother correcting such hilarious mistakes.
In truth, these fairies are capable of forming families and kin groups across
their various heritages, and the fact of reincarnation in the First World means
that they don’t see ancestry in quite the same way as mortal creatures. A
sprite’s parent might die and return as a young dryad, and there wouldn’t be
anything remotely unusual about that. So too do these tiny fey quickly accept
people of every sort who make a genuine effort to know them, even those
creatures that mortals tend to find dangerous or distasteful.
Sprites on Golarion who live among their own kind typically form villages
near exciting locations. That doesn’t mean other sorts of sprites are unwelcome
but is rather a reflection of the composition of the group that set off to form
the village in the first place. Those sprites of other heritages that come to visit
or reside in an area find themselves not only completely welcome by their kin
but often especially popular.
Draxies
With colorful scales and draconic features, draxies are mischievous dragon
sprites, rivaling pixies for the title of ultimate pranksters. The first draxies were
reincarnations of Elucredassa, the mightiest faerie dragon of known draxie
history, who returned as hundreds of individual draxies when she passed on.
Since then, draxies have become more populous and spread to all corners of the
First World, as well as areas of Golarion where dragons and fey are common,
such as the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Draxies have the same capricious
yet benevolent tendencies as their faerie dragon forebear, but they have one
exception to their flighty nature: they bond with their closest comrades for
life. Called the elucrea, this special bond can form with creatures a draxie is
particularly fond of from any ancestry—though typically only those who can
take a good joke. Fey folklore holds that the longing for the elucrea comes from
when draxies were first split from Elucredassa, as each longs to become part of
something bigger than themselves.
FireFlY sPrites
Those sprites that refer to themselves simply as sprites, sometimes called
“common” sprites or firefly sprites by scholars, are the most frequently
encountered fey in both the First World and on Golarion. These diminutive
explorers are more obsessed with magic than most, and they love studying ley
lines and magical locations. Their curiosity, wanderlust, and chaotic nature
balance their compulsive urge to protect that which they find most wonderful.

appoint itself guardian, they pursue this task with remarkable dedication.
It takes a tremendous magical mystery or discovery to shake a sprite’s vigil.
grigs
Grigs are artistic, musical, and passionate sprites with the hind body of a
cricket. They often use their legs as stringed instruments, fiddling along with
their songs in the same way most folk might clap their hands or snap their
fingers. Cunning and courageous, grigs are always ready to protect those they
love, and even strangers, from the forces of evil, but they tend to get themselves
into trouble by biting off more than they can chew. Thus, adventuring with
comrades suits a grig well, as friends can help them overcome otherwise
unbeatable odds. Grigs love to collect art objects of all kinds, particularly
those with bright colors and vibrant images, decorating their homes with
wondrous mementos of their journeys and adventures. Grigs usually make
their homes and villages in areas of incredible natural beauty, though they
are just as often out exploring and seeking new wonders away from home.
Melixies
While most sprites have insectile wings, melixies are closer to insects than
other sprites, sharing additional physical qualities—usually with bees, but
sometimes with butterflies, moths, ladybugs, or other beetles. Melixies have
an incredibly strong sweet tooth, guzzling honey, nectar, and sugar at every
opportunity. These tiny sugar collectors occasionally leave such delicacies
uneaten long enough to use them as ingredients to create some of the world’s
finest miniature desserts. When not indulging, they’re incredibly industrious,
both at innovative tasks other sprites enjoy, like inventing and building new
things, and at repetitive tasks most others find odious, such as cleaning.
Melixies enjoy dancing over all other leisure activities and are particularly
likely to learn a dancelike Sylvan sign language they call Melisylvan.
nYkteras
Nykteras, or bat sprites, are gentle and friendly sprites known for their
especially affectionate, sharing, and caring nature. Nyktera appearance varies
as much as the various species of bats. Some look like insectivorous microbats,
while others resemble larger, fruit-eating megabats
such as flying foxes. Even more may resemble
nectar-eating bats, and even blood-drinking
varieties. Nykteras live wherever bats are found,
and they tend to congregate near areas with bats
similar to their own appearance. Notably, a population
of white nykteras from Arcadia, who share features
with an Arcadian white bat species, has given birth to
the highest number of Wingless anywhere in Golarion.
This has lead some to speculate they’ve been blessed by the gods.
Nykteras have an incredible sense of hospitality and are willing to share
food with any in need; even a nyktera’s greatest enemy might be able to
find a reprieve from battle by invoking the bat sprite’s hospitality.
Pixies
Pixies are hyperactive and curious tricksters, never slowing down for a
moment and flitting from one topic or scheme to another. Pixies love
pranks, and they often compete with draxies over who make the better
pranksters. While they lack draxies’ patience to perfect a trap over the
long term, pixies are improvisational prank maestros. Pixie pranks
are typically intended to reveal an overlooked truth, whether by
bringing the prideful down to size or matchmaking two people
secretly in love with each other. Larger than any other type of sprite,
Wingless pixies can sometimes pass for halflings if they disguise their
Tiny PCs
PCs are typically Small or Medium size,
but most sprite PCs are Tiny instead!
Being Tiny comes with its own set of
rules about space and reach. Your Tiny
sprite can enter another creature’s
space, which is important because your
melee Strikes typically have no reach,
meaning you must enter their space to
attack them. Like other Tiny creatures,
you don’t automatically receive lesser
cover from being in a larger creature’s
space, but circumstances might allow
you to Take Cover. You can purchase
weapons, armor, and other items for
your size with the same statistics
as normal gear, except that melee
weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or
a reach 5 feet shorter than normal if
they have the reach trait). Remember to
adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk
limit for Tiny size (Core Rulebook 295).

PAGE 130
================================================================================

Riding PCs
As a Tiny creature, a sprite PC weighs
so little and takes up so little Bulk that
it doesn’t cause issues to hitch a ride
in a sack, shoulder, or other position
on another PC. However, the amount
of coordination required to ensure
you don’t get in each other’s way or
jostle each other into losing actions
makes this tactic unfavorable for most
fellow adventurers during combat. If
you’re riding along with another PC or
similar non-minion intelligent creature,
roll both your initiatives and use the
lower of the two results. You act in
either order on the same initiative
count. While traveling in this way,
you each gain two actions at the start
of your turn, instead of three, since
they spend one action keeping you
balanced on their back, and you spend
one action maintaining your grip.
pointed ears. Their closer size to other ancestries means they are somewhat
more likely to be taken seriously by mortals.
SPRITE HERITAGES
Sprite heritages have wide variations in appearance and are considered by
some mortal scholars to be different “creatures,” a taxonomy that sprites
find adorably naive. Choose one of the following sprite heritages at 1st level.
Draxie
You are kin to faerie dragons, tracing your heritage back to the death of the
mightiest faerie dragon in the First World. You gain touch telepathy, allowing
you to communicate silently and purely mentally with any creature you’re
touching, as long as you share a language.
grig
You have the hindquarters of a cricket and adore art and music. Your cricket
legs grant you a +2 circumstance bonus on Athletics checks to High Jump or
Long Jump, and you gain ghost sound as a primal innate cantrip.
luMinous sPrite
You glow with magical luminance. You naturally shed light as a torch; this light
has the evocation, light, and primal traits. You can extinguish, rekindle, or change
the color of this light using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
Melixie
You have the features of a bee, butterfly, or other insect that loves sweets. You
can ask questions of and receive answers from
arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs,
and similar invertebrate animals), as well as use
Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and Request
things of them. Most bees, butterflies, moths, and
beetles have an indifferent or friendly starting attitude
toward you and give you time to make your case, though
other arthropods react to you like any other adventurer.
nYktera
You have batlike features, an affinity for batkind, and hearing
that is second to none. As long as you can hear normally, you
can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in a 60-foot
cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30
feet with a Seek action.
Pixie
You are larger than other sprites. Instead of Tiny, your size is Small.
SPRITE ANCESTRY FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional

It has the scent ability, which counts against your limit for familiar and master
abilities as normal. Furthermore, it can never gain a familiar ability that grants it any
Speeds other than a land Speed. If you’re a pixie, you can’t ride a corgi due to your
Size, but you can take this feat to gain a corgi familiar.
EVANESCENT WINGS
FEAT 1
SPRITE
You’ve manifested wings that can flutter for brief spurts. You don’t need to spend any
additional actions to reach something in your space that a Medium creature could
reach. For instance, if you wanted to open a cookie jar located four feet off the ground,
you only need to spend a single Interact action to do so. When you use Evanescent
Wings to flutter to a higher place in your space, your action gains the move trait.
FEY CANTRIPS
FEAT 1
SPRITE
You’ve learned the cantrips sprites have used since time immemorial. You gain dancing
lights and ghost sound as primal innate cantrips. If you have the grig heritage, you also
gain detect magic, and if you have the draxie heritage, you gain prestidigitation.
SPEAK WITH BATS
FEAT 1
SPRITE
Prerequisites nyktera heritage
You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with bats.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression on
bats or Request something from bats.
SPRITE’S SPARK
FEAT 1
SPRITE
You can fling a portion of your magic at foes. You gain a ranged unarmed attack in
the sling weapon group with a maximum range of 20 feet that deals 1d4 damage. (No
ability modifier is added to the damage roll.) The damage type and name of the unarmed
attack depends on your heritage, described below; most sprite heritages not

Sprite Adventurers
While PCs sprites are marked from
adulthood as destined for great things,
their childhoods before that point vary
as widely as any other ancestry. That
said, the tendency of most sprites to
live either apart from civilization or in
small villages means they rarely have
backgrounds related to cities or large
organizations and more likely were
acrobats, animal whisperers, artists,
entertainers, gamblers, herbalists,
hermits, nomads, or scouts. Sprites
are most often bards, rogues, or
sorcerers, though sprite rangers and
druids do exist and tap into their love
of the natural world. Likewise, sprite
witches APG and wizards are even
more enthusiastic about learning the
secrets of magic, and sprite oracles APG
approach the contradictions of their
mystery from the experience of living
the contradictions between the fey and
mortal worlds.

While you are more susceptible to cold iron than most
of the Wingless, you also have an incredible resilience
and a deeper connection to the healing energies of
the First World. Increase your maximum Hit Points
by an amount equal to your level. If you rest for
10 minutes, brilliant light from the First World
seeps into your form from your wings (or the spot
where your wings would be), causing you to regain
a number of Hit Points equal to your level; this is
cumulative with any Hit Points you regain from Treat
Wounds. However, you gain weakness 5 to cold iron.
INVISIBLE TRICKSTER
FEAT 13
SPRITE
You have learned how to become invisible and
remain so. You can cast 4th-level invisibility as a
primal innate spell once per hour.
17TH LEVEL
HERO’S WINGS
FEAT 17
SPRITE
Prerequisites Energize Wings
You have begun the final steps to reaching your full
potential. Your wings are always in their majestic form
without you needing to use Energize Wings, granting
you a permanent fly Speed. Furthermore, sprites recognize
you as a powerful hero (or villain) by your unique wings and are appropriately
impressed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidation
checks against sprites and gain the benefits of the Glad-Hand skill feat against
other sprites, without taking a  –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check.
Sprites in Society
Sprites who mingle openly among
mortals find that mortal superstitions
about fey regularly color their
interactions with sprites, for both
good and ill. Mortals often believe half-
remembered tales, frequently about
a different sort of fey altogether;
most sprites find this hilarious and
play along. Mortals uninterested in
sprites’ pranks tend to view them as
nuisances and treat them accordingly.
Additionally, sprites’ small stature and
excitable natures sometimes cause
mortals to treat them like children.
Sprites vary in their reactions to this
sort of treatment from annoyance to
good humor, and sometimes even a
realization that they can get away
with more this way.

Known as itarii in their own language, strix are reclusive avian humanoids devoted to
their homelands and their tribes. They defend their precious communities with broad
wingspans and razor talons.
Strix (Rare)
132
Strix value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above
all else. Their dark, formidable wingspans and long
history of taking revenge for their fallen family members
have painted them as winged devils in the eyes of
neighboring human populations. In contradiction to
their misunderstood nature, strix boast a spiritual,
artistic, and compassionate culture that is rarely seen
outside of their roosts.
As strix populations begin to resurge and spread
beyond the mountainous region known as the Devil’s
Perch, their tribes now speckle the landscape of Cheliax
and surrounding nations. Soaring over mountains,
forests, and beaches, strix are always brought home by
the deep connections they share with their kinfolk.
If you want a character who is loyal yet enigmatic,
fierce yet artistic, and who yearns to soar above the
world, you should play a strix.
You Might...
• Dedicate and endear yourself to your family,
friends, or community.
• Harbor an inherited distrust of humans.
• Keep strangers at arm’s length and perhaps
exhibit naivete about the world beyond
your homeland.
others ProbablY...
• Appreciate your dedicated friendship, even if they
don’t grasp the cultural history behind it.
• Treat you on occasion like a carrier pigeon, asking
you to deliver letters or other similar favors.
• Find your appearance frightening due to complete
inexperience with strix.
PhYsical DescriPtion
Strix are avian-influenced humanoids with intimidating
talons and feathered wings sprouting from their backs.
With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than
most humans but are very light for their size. Strix
are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an
average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and
large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil,
but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix
lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their
head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their
gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually
taut with defined musculature—a result of the strength
necessary to flex their wings.

When Leaping horizontally, you

at least 10 feet first. In addition,
when you make a Long Jump, you
can jump a distance up to 10 feet
further than your Athletics check
result, though still with the normal
maximum of your Speed.
Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it
were bright light, so you ignore the
concealed condition due to dim light.
societY
Strix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories.
They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of
tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil’s Perch,
but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel
an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community
members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual
desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized
division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.
A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax has bred into
most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans—who they call kotaara. Strix
have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in
the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to
destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to
their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating.
alignMent anD religion
Due to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely
chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies.
Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as
the Korrsat Akra, or “The Scattered Nest,” to tell them of their origins and give
them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment
in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing.
Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of
religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved
community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech
the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect
their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent
two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes.
naMes
Strix names consist of sounds that are reminiscent of chirping, screeches,
or trilling by various birds, and their naming conventions are influenced
primarily by tradition and spirituality. Strix in small communities might
share a common syllable among all their names to express their unity. Due
to their deep affection for their family members, naming children after other
loved ones is very common, occasionally with an additional syllable or slight
change to the pronunciation.

STRIX OF THE INNER SEA
Strix aren’t native to the Inner Sea region. According to strix legend, they
became permanent residents after being deposited among the steep spires and
plunging valleys of Devil’s Perch from somewhere distant and unknown by a
catastrophic magical storm. Since their arrival at Devil’s Perch, a mountainous
area in the southwest region of Cheliax’s Menador Mountains, strix have
been in perpetual conflict with nearby human populations. Strix believe that
this ongoing slaughter of their precious kinfolk is a continuation of a curse
from the gods that banished them to Devil’s Perch. The strix of the Inner Sea
region have a dark relationship with their history, and mysteries lie obscured
somewhere among the vast skies between their current residence in Cheliax
and their distant relatives in Arcadia and beyond.
Physiologically very similar to humans, strix most notably differ in the
12-foot feathered wingspans spread from their back and curved talons in
the place of toes. Strix of the Inner Sea region universally grow white hair.

Their skin tones and plumage most often range from black to gray, while
some have brown to umber skin tones that complement the color of their
feathers. Large, pointed ears and sharp brows give them very angular, defined
features. Their eyes have no pupil and are fixed in their head, with
nictitating membranes that blink sideways.
Strix attire is simple. To allow flight, these avian relatives
must keep clothing light and minimal and their feet bare
to allow for adequate perching. Strix naturally shed their
feathers, and much of this material makes its way back
into their attire as ornaments; wearing the feathers of
loved ones is particularly popular. A tribe’s rokoa may
wear a full cloak or headdress of her community’s
feathers, and the downy fluff shed by strix’s young
provides valuable insulation for winter clothing.
At their core, most strix communities simply
wish to be left alone to seek prosperity peacefully.
Unfortunately, any acts of self-defense by
strix are seen as further justification for
violence by their enemies,  who are already
accustomed to treating strix as a scourge on
the mountains and forests. The concept of
vengeance is fluid but pervasive among strix
groups. Strix generally believe that a certain
amount of vengeance is just, but this conflicts
with their general understanding of the value
of life and kinship. Their itaraak champions,
warriors of vengeance sworn to defend their
people at all costs, protect their tribe fearlessly to
avoid bloodying the wings of more sensitive souls.
Rumors from fearmongering humans claim that
itaraak champions habitually slaughter a hundred
humans for every one of their kin that falls.
cheliaxian strix
Cheliax, location of the famous Devil’s Perch, is the primary
home of strix in the Inner Sea region. Its dry, arid mountains
and tall spires high above the plunging valleys create the
perfect craggy locale for strix to put significant barriers between
themselves and others. In addition to the mountains, the nearby
forests and coastal cliffs also provide an isolated refuge, as well as an
enjoyably short flight back to Ciricskree, a metropolis by strix standards that
counts over 500 residents.
MinDsPin strix
The Mindspin Mountains provide an ideal environment for strix settlements.
Giants and trolls—which typically make the mountains a staunch barrier
between Varisia and the Hold of Belkzen—tread the ground far below strix
homes. If anything, the formidable neighbors are a temperamental amenity
in that they deter humans from encroaching on strix territory. However,
the presence of fey and drakes that roam the skies has forced smaller tribes
into a tenuous alliance with these forces. Strix in the mountains and the
surrounding areas of Isger, Nirmathas, and Molthune sing stories of a tribe
that encountered Lamashtu’s divine herald in the Mindspin Mountains
and became enslaved by the goddess.

especially isolated from other strix kinfolk, leaving many young strix yearning
for larger communities. The nationwide unity of Nidal under Zon-Kuthon’s
faith speaks strongly to some strix who, isolated by meager numbers of their
own kind, have become convinced by the teachings of Zon-Kuthon’s faithful.
Moved by the willingness of the people of Nidal to accept them with a
simple change of faith, strix have begun to leave their distraught families for
Zon-Kuthon’s faith. These individuals believe that faith in Zon-Kuthon may
relieve them of the legendary curse that lingers over their people. The Umbral
Court utilizes these young converts as emissaries and spies.
ravounelian strix
Ravounel hosts the largest population of forest-dwelling strix in the Inner
Sea region. The Kitkasiticka tribe is unique not only for its locale but also for
being strongly involved and allied with the nearby city of Kintargo. Smaller
tribes in Ravounel cling to the country’s northern coast and frequently visit
Kitkasiticka. The forest tribe has begun to connect strix from the north shores
to the Ravounel side of the Menador Mountains.
STRIX HERITAGES
Strix fill a variety of roles in their tight communal groups and have adapted
to provide the most they can for themselves and their community. Choose

PreDator strix
You come from a line of strix with exceptionally broad wings and
lengthy talons. You gain a talon melee unarmed attack that deals
1d4 slashing damage. Your talon attack is in the brawling
group and has the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.
scavenger strix
Your ancestors originated from a land where food
was scarce and threats were many. You are trained in
Survival. You gain the Forager skill feat as a bonus feat.
Your thoroughness when gathering food provides you
a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to Subsist.
shoreline strix
You’re the descendant of strix who traveled to the
coasts. Your feathers are especially water-repellent
and sleekly angled for diving, allowing you to catch fish and other prey in
the shallows. You are trained in Athletics, and you gain the Underwater
Marauder skill feat as a bonus skill feat.
songbirD strix
You descend from a talented line of strix storytellers. From the highest
mountains and purest landscapes where your lungs fill with glorious clean
air, you trill, whistle, and croon sweet songs. While natural sounds make you
predisposed to sing, voices make you predisposed to mimicry. You receive
a +1 circumstance bonus on Deception checks to Impersonate a mimicked
voice, where the sound of the voice is the only factor; if you are a master in
Deception, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead. You also gain a +1
circumstance bonus on Performance checks to sing; if you are a master in
Performance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus instead.
Strix Settlements
Strix settlements, called roosts, are
lofty dwellings at the highest point
of the local landscape. Mountains
are a particular favorite, especially
if they provide tall spires that make
foot traffic impossible. Strix living
in forests build their communities
around the largest trees available, and
seaside dwellers prefer to nestle their
dwellings along perilous cliffs.
By far, the largest strix community
resides at Ciricskree, which translates
from the Strix language to “the
Shrieking Spire.” This tribe of over
500 individuals is the cultural
epicenter for the Devil’s Perch and
the entire Avistani strix population.
Additional settlements include the
Ikaraka in the Barrowood forest at
the base of the Menador Mountains,
and the small Blackcove tribe along
the shore, who have established a
tolerant trading relationship with a
nearby fishing village.

ANCESTRY FEATS
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry
feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a strix, you
select from among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
NESTLING FALL
FEAT 1
STRIX
You trust the strength of your wings and can spread them to glide safely to the
ground. As long as you can act, you take no damage from falling, no matter what
distance you fall.
STORY CROONER
FEAT 1
STRIX
You’re a talented story weaver and use your voice effectively. You are trained in
Performance. If you would automatically become trained in Performance, you instead
become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the Impressive Performance
skill feat and gain a +1 circumstance bonus when Performing for an audience of strix.
STRIX DEFENDER
FEAT 1
STRIX
Your ancestral feud with humans gives you experience dealing
with vicious foes, and your vengeance knows no bounds. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Intimidation, Perception,
and Survival checks against humans, as well as on damage
rolls against humans with weapons and unarmed attacks.
However, your hatred of humans is immediately obvious,
giving you a –2 circumstance penalty to Diplomacy checks
against them and usually starting their attitude one step
worse towards you.
STRIX LORE
FEAT 1
STRIX
You’re well connected to your tribe and perhaps even strix
communities beyond your own, where you’ve learned about
the land and techniques of graceful movement. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Nature. If you would
automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your
background or class, for example), you instead become trained
in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Strix Lore.
5TH LEVEL
FEATHERED CLOAK
FEAT 5
STRIX
To blend in with the grounded and wingless, you fold your wings just
so on your back, creating the illusion of a feathered cloak. You receive
a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate a version of
yourself who is not a strix.
Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person,
providing a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal an Object.
FLEDGLING FLIGHT [one-action]
FEAT 5
STRIX
Frequency once per round
You can fly through the air in short bursts at half your land Speed. If you don’t end
your movement on solid ground, you fall at the end of your turn.
Strix Storytelling
Strix utilize storytelling to convey
a verbal history of their people and
perform poetic tales that sound like
songs when sung in their native
tongue. Nestling strix grow up hearing
their histories sung to them as
lullabies and serenades of daily life.
Powerful moments are punctuated
with screeches, and mournful recounts
float in the air like soft cooing. One
common story tells of a vengeful strix
whose wings turned gloriously red,
but who hid his face with a mask,
ashamed of the actions that led to his
glory. Another crooned to nestlings
warns of a mysterious parasite that
hides in filthy feathers.

PAGE 138
================================================================================

STRIX VENGEANCE [reaction]
FEAT 5
EMOTION
MENTAL
STRIX
Frequency once per 10 minutes
Trigger You, or a strix ally you can see, are damaged by an enemy’s critical hit.
You dedicate yourself to destroying those who harm your kin. Until the end of your
next turn, you deal an additional +1d6 damage on Strikes against the triggering
enemy. The bonus increases to +2d6 if you use a striking weapon or unarmed attack
and +3d6 if you use a major striking weapon or unarmed attack.
THROWN VOICE
FEAT 5
STRIX
You’ve learned how to throw your voice through the winds, tricking others as to
your location. You can cast ventriloquism as a primal innate spell once per day. If
you’re a songbird strix, you can cast it twice per day instead.
9TH LEVEL
FEROCIOUS GUST [two-actions]
FEAT 9
AIR
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
STRIX
Frequency once per 10 minutes
With heavy wing beats, you whip up a furious gust and direct it at
your opponents. This air blast has the effects of gust of wind with
a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
JUVENILE FLIGHT [two-actions]
FEAT 9
STRIX
Frequency once per day
You unfold your wings for travel and can keep them unfolded for 10
minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed while your
wings are unfurled. If you have Fledgling Flight, you gain a +10-foot
status bonus to your fly Speed with Juvenile Flight. As normal, since
your fly Speed is derived from your land Speed, this status bonus isn’t
cumulative with a status bonus to your land Speed, if you have one.
ROKOAN ARTS
 FEAT 9
STRIX
Ancestral spirits have begun to bond themselves to you, granting you
powers characteristic of a rokoa. You can cast speak with animals and status
as primal innate spells once per day each.
WING STEP [one-action]
FEAT 9
STRIX
With a sharp flap of your wings, you stay light on your feet as you move. You
Step twice.
13TH LEVEL
ANCESTOR’S TRANSFORMATION
FEAT 13
STRIX
You can commune with ancestor spirits to assume the form of an enormous
primeval strix. You can cast 5th-level aerial form as a primal innate spell once per
day, but you take the form of a primeval strix, using the statistics for a bird form.
FULLY FLIGHTED
FEAT 13
STRIX
Prerequisites Juvenile Flight
You gain the effects of Juvenile Flight at all times, rather than just once per day for
10 minutes. This includes the status bonus to your Speed if you have Fledgling Flight.
Rokoas
Strix tribes are led by a spiritual, social,
and military leader called a rokoa.
Rokoas are elder female leaders who
consult a council of other warriors and
spiritualists to make decisions for the
entirety of the community. Young female
strix are selected early as potential
successors to the tribe’s current rokoa.
Often the rokoa herself
chooses her favorite
protégé to pass along her
storytelling recitations,
battle stratagems, and
spiritual understanding.

Ancestral Gear

Ancestries around the world develop unique
equipment
to
accommodate
their
own specific physiologies, lifestyles,
and needs. The following section
features weapons and magical runes
representing a small fraction of
the accomplishments made by the
peoples of Golarion.
ANCESTRAL WEAPONS
The following are a sampling of weapons
that many ancestries use to complement their
cultures’ unique fighting styles.
WeaPon DescriPtions
Each of the weapons listed in Tables 1–1 and 1–2 are
detailed below. Gripplis and conrasus appear in Pathfinder
Lost Omens Mwangi Expanse.
Adze: A common cutting
tool, an adze resembles an
axe—but the cutting edge is
horizontal, rather than vertical.
The adze’s shape makes it
popular among wood workers,
and grippli builders often use them to
construct their treetop homes. The tool
also serves as an effective weapon, due in
part to the immense strength required to
swing it.
Buugeng: A blade of conrasu design,
a buugeng has a unique, curved shape
that allows it to rotate smoothly in the
hand of a trained warrior. This spinning motion makes
it easier to attack multiple foes at once with the weapon.
Fangwire: This kobold wire is thin and hard to see,
making it perfect for an ambush. The wielder wraps the
wire around a vulnerable spot,
such as the neck, and twists
it to inflict potentially fatal
lacerations. The name derives
from the use of a similar wire
in traps, or slow fangs, with
the word “slow” removed, as
a fangwire gets quick results.
Hand Adze: This is a smaller
version of an adze, useful for more
delicate woodworking or projects
in cramped spaces. Gripplis use the
hand adze for crafting and as
close quarters weapons.
Rungu: This specialized club
is designed for throwing and is
useful for both combat and hunting.
Though gripplis didn’t create the rungu originally, many
grippli communities have adopted it as the weapon of
choice for hunting creatures that hide high in treetops.
Taw Launcher: Designed by conrasu warriors, this
complex device resembles a crossbow and fires small
wooden bullets known as taws. A system of blades
within the launcher can rapidly reshape a taw as it’s
loaded, allowing the launcher to fire taws of
different shapes, such as fléchettes.
Thunder Sling: Tengu use these
specialized slings to fire darts further
and with greater force than when
thrown by hand, which is particularly
effective when attacking from great
heights. A thunder sling uses darts as
ammunition. It can also hurl blowgun
darts as ammunition but deals 1d4
piercing damage instead of 1d6 when used this way.
Tricky Pick: This ingenious kobold pick conceals
several hidden traps, which the wielder can activate
to trick and befuddle foes with a variety of damaging
blades and bludgeoning surfaces.
Whip Claw: The whip claw is a long tether
affixed to clawlike daggers, allowing the
wielder to fling and retract them with
deadly precision. Catfolk developed
this weapon to provide extended
reach when hunting dangerous
animals and wield them with
unmatched expertise.
Wish
Blade:
Specialized
grooves lined with unique,
alchemically treated metals
capable of retaining energy
score the length of this sword. The first wish blades
originated from genie smiths, and the knowledge of these
weapons has been passed on to generations of geniekin,
earning them the name wish blades.
Wish Knife: Much like a wish blade, the length of
this knife is scored with intricate grooves capable of
retaining energy. Wish knives are lighter than their
counterparts, making them the weapon of choice
for agile combatants.
WeaPon traits
The weapons in this section
include the following new traits.
Conrasu: Conrasus craft and
use these weapons.
Geniekin: Geniekin craft and
use these weapons.
Grippli: Gripplis craft and use
these weapons.
Buugeng
Thunder Sling
Whip Claw

PAGE 140
================================================================================

139
Hampering: A weapon with the hampering trait
is designed to be shaken, cast outward, or whipped
about to control space on
the battlefield. You can use
an Interact action to thrash the
weapon in a square within the weapon’s
reach. That square becomes difficult terrain
until you attack with the weapon, move, or
would otherwise stop intentionally thrashing it.
Kobold: Kobolds craft and use these weapons.
Modular: The weapon has multiple configurations
that you can switch between using an Interact action.
Typically, switching between the configurations of a
modular weapon allows it to deal different types of
damage (listed in the trait, such as “modular B, P, or
S”), though it’s possible for a modular weapon’s
description to list more complicated configurations.
Resonant: This weapon can channel energy
damage. You gain the Conduct Energy free action
while wielding a resonant weapon.
CONDUCT ENERGY [free-action]
ENERGY
Requirements Your last action or spell this turn had the acid,
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic trait.
You channel energy into your weapon. The weapon deals 1
additional damage per weapon damage die until the start of
your next turn. This damage type matches the trait of the
triggering action or spell. If your triggering action or spell had
multiple eligible traits, you select one of those traits.
ANCESTRAL RUNES
The following runes are popular among some of the
ancestries found in the Inner Sea region. Soaring armor
is common among flying ancestries like sprites, strix,
and tengu.
CONDUCTING
RUNE 7
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Price 300 gp
Usage etched onto a weapon
A conducting weapon can channel energy through
it. The weapon gains the resonant weapon
trait, except that when you Conduct Energy,
the weapon deals an additional 1d8
damage of the selected type instead of 1
additional damage per die; if the weapon
already had the resonant weapon trait, it
deals 1d8 damage plus 1 damage per die
instead. On a critical hit, the weapon
deals 1d8 persistent damage of the
same type.
SOARING
RUNE 14
ABJURATION
MAGICAL
Price 3,750 gp
Usage etched onto armor
A set of soaring armor helps you fly faster and protects you
and nearby allies from falling. While wearing soaring armor,
you gain a +10-foot item bonus to your fly Speed, if you have
one. As normal, if your fly Speed is based on your land Speed
and you already have an item bonus to your land Speed, these
bonuses aren’t cumulative.
Activate [reaction] command; Trigger You or a creature within
60 feet of you is falling; Effect You cast feather fall on the
triggering creature.
