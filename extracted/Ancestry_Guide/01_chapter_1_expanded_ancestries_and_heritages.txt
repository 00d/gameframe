EXPANDED ANCESTRIES
AND HERITAGES
This section offers expanded options for ancestries and
versatile heritages introduced in the Pathfinder Advanced
Player’s Guide and Pathfinder Lost Omens Character
Guide. The core rules for these ancestries are provided in
those books, with the new material here expanding and
enhancing the breadth and depth of options available
for characters taking these ancestries and heritages. This
chapter covers the following ancestries and heritages.
AAsimAr (Uncomon HeritAge)
Aasimars result from celestial influence, but only rarely
are they literally descended from celestials, more often
coming from special blessings or the residual energies
in holy places. This book presents new lineages for
aasimars descended from various types of celestials. For
information on playing an aasimar, see pages 34–36 of
the Advanced Player’s Guide.
AzArketi (Uncomon Ancestry)
Often known as “gillmen” or “Low Azlanti,” azarketis
are the descendants of the Azlanti Empire. They survived
Earthfall by being mutated by their foes, the alghollthus,
to become an aquatic people tied forever to seas and
waterways—but their history draws them back to the land.
This book presents new azarketi options, exploring their
magical connection to water. For information on playing
an azarketi, see the “Azarketi Ancestry Web Supplement”
on paizo.com or Absalom, City of Lost Omens.
cAtfolk (Uncomon Ancestry)
Native to the nation of Murraseth in southern Garund,
catfolk are feline humanoids who believe they were
created to hunt down threats to Golarion as a whole.
This book presents new options to double down on
catfolk’s agility and luck. For information on playing a
catfolk, see pages 8–11 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
cHAngeling (Uncomon HeritAge)
The offspring of wicked hags, changelings are often left
in the cradles of their mortal parent’s people and raised
without understanding what makes them different. They
often feel disconnected from their communities early in
life, the subtle call of their hag mother coaxing them to
abandon those they love. This book presents new lineages
for changelings descended from different kinds of hags.
For information on playing a changeling, see pages 30–31
of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
DHAmpir (Uncomon HeritAge)
Dhampirs are mortals descended from a living and a
vampiric parent. Marked forever by their hungers, some
may learn to draw strength from the blood of others,
while others drink subtler substances, such as pain. This
book presents new lineages for dhampirs descended from
different kinds of vampires. For information on playing a
dhampir, see pages 32–33 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
DUskwAlker (Uncomon HeritAge)
Reincarnated souls, duskwalkers gained leave to have
one more chance at life. All duskwalkers have strong
connections to their previous identities, but each must
decide for themselves whether to learn more about their
past or forge a new path. This book contains options for
duskwalkers based on how their previous life ended. For
information on playing a duskwalker, see pages 37–38 of
the Advanced Player’s Guide.
Hobgoblin (Uncomon Ancestry)
Many hobgoblins have been drawn toward the nation
of Oprak, which seeks to forge pacts and earn respect
through methods other than war and conquest. While
clearly related to their goblin cousins, hobgoblins are less
frenetic and more careful planners. This book contains
options for hobgoblins to assist their fellow warriors or
to tap into the legendary Cantorian Spring—the source
of the hobgoblin ancestry—to gain healing effects. For
information on playing a hobgoblin, see pages 48–51 of
the Character Guide.
kobolD (Uncomon Ancestry)
These expert trap makers often live in secluded places that
most other ancestries eschew. Kobolds operate in a world
of larger, stronger creatures who often dismiss them—
until these cunning survivors reveal what they can unleash
on their foes. This book contains options for kobolds to
improve their use of traps and kobold weapons, and even
to grow draconic wings. For information on playing a
kobold, see pages 12–15 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
The Pathfinder Core Rulebook introduces six ancestries that are particularly common within the Inner Sea region, but
these represent only a small fraction of Golarion’s diverse peoples. With a history that stretches tens of thousands of
years across endlessly shifting nations and even to other worlds and planes of existence, the Lost Omens setting has a
vast, varied, and colorful selection of ancestries and heritages a player can choose when building a character. From those
who must shoulder the expectations of being infused with supernatural essences, to peoples who have been embraced
as champions of good, to outcasts who have experienced lifelong intolerance and suspicion, to members of vast empires
long hidden in the mists of time or the depths of the ocean, there’s a perfect ancestry for every character concept!

lesHy (Uncomon Ancestry)
Leshys are immortal spirits temporarily given mortal
forms in bodies made of plants and fungi. Created by
powerful primal rituals, leshys come into the world fully
formed and self-sufficient, independent of any settlement
or even the ritualist that gave them form. This book
contains numerous new heritages to represent various
types of leshy. For information on playing a leshy, see
pages 52–55 of the Character Guide.
lizArDfolk (Uncomon Ancestry)
The powerful reptilian lizardfolk call themselves iruxi
and have a history that stretches back thousands of
years. Patient and confident, lizardfolk explorers travel
from their ancient nations to explore the world of
younger ancestries and kingdoms. This book contains
options for lizardfolk to gain insights from astrology
or power from the bones of their ancestors. For
information on playing a lizardfolk, see pages 56–59 of
the Character Guide.
orc (Uncomon Ancestry)
Orcs were driven from their homelands by the dwarven
Quest for Sky and thrust into a foreign world where they
had to carve a place for themselves. A troubled history
of warfare and grudges has left most orcs at odds with
other surface ancestries. This book contains options
for orcs to gain power from special painted warmasks.
For information on playing an orc, see pages 16–19 of
the Advanced Player’s Guide.
rAtfolk (Uncomon Ancestry)
Small rodentlike humanoids, ratfolk are clever, adaptive,
and communalist. Known amongst themselves as ysoki,
ratfolk are natural explorers, travelers, and, most of
all, merchants. This book contains options for ratfolk
to squish, sneak, roll, and otherwise move about. For
information on playing a ratfolk, see pages 20–23 of the
Advanced Player’s Guide.
tengU (Uncomon Ancestry)
The beaked and feathered tengu originate from Tian Xia.
Nearly always in the minority, tengu have learned to use
their knack for languages and blades to find space for
themselves. This book contains options for tengu to store
magic in specially made fans. For information on playing
a tengu, see pages 24–27 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.
tiefling (Uncomon HeritAge)
Tieflings are planar scions born with a fiendish stain
in their blood. Though tieflings are not inherently evil,
they are often mistrusted and many do find that fiendish
powers and associated temptations come easily. This
book presents new lineages for tieflings descended from
various types of fiends. For information on playing a
tiefling, see pages 39–41 of the Advanced Player’s Guide.

Exemplars of poise, grace, and magnificence, aasimars are beloved throughout
the Inner Sea and beyond. These mortal beings are shaped by incredible
celestial power and are often greeted as omens of good fortune for the
communities they’re born into. As adults, many aasimars gravitate towards
noble and heroic principles, often finding success as renowned artists, devout
clergy, and resplendent heroes. A celestial tether holds an aasimar’s soul close,
gently pulling them towards celestial ideals. Aasimars feel subtle urges to root
out evil, aid the downtrodden, and amend society’s broken promises. This
pull is not a guarantee for a life of good, however, and many aasimars crack
under the pressure put upon them. These aasimars might prefer to escape the
expectations of their lives and choose to live in solitude. In other cases, an
aasimar might turn to a life of evil, either as a backlash for failing to live up to
these societal pressures or as a rejection of their own celestial nature.
Physically, an aasimar’s appearance greatly resembles others of their
ancestry, though their celestial influence can visibly manifest in nearly
imperceptible to substantial cosmetic differences. Common manifestations
include pearlescent teeth, golden hair, lyrical voices, floral scents, and shining
features. More radical manifestations can include additional eyes, bodies
covered in soft down feathers, a voice that sounds akin to several people
speaking in unison, or heads with more than a single face. These differences
are far less common and, for some, unnerving; many would consider these
aasimars monstrous if not for their natural aura of holiness.
AASIMARS OF THE INNER SEA
Aasimars possess a natural radiance—the legacy left by their celestial
origins—that suffuses the world around them. These supernatural qualities
push people to perceive aasimars as not just more beautiful than the average
person, but also smarter, funnier, stronger, and more naturally gifted. The
degree of truth to these perceptions varies, but that doesn’t stop most from
transfixing on aasimars’ inherent magnificence, as they captivate those
around them whether they intend to or not. Though many aasimars are
conventionally beautiful, even aasimars with strange and unusual
features are perceived as wondrous to behold, regardless of any
bizarre celestial manifestations.
Many aasimar lineages are attributed to liaisons
between marvelous celestials and heroic or
virtuous mortals, but rarely do such trysts
result in an aasimar child. Aasimar births
may arise from any celestial influence.
A childless couple praying for an
heir, a conjurer frequenting in celestial dealings, or a champion wielding a
holy sword—the celestial spark is entirely unknowable. Producing aasimar
offspring is never guaranteed, and even an aasimar’s own children are unlikely
to inherit their parent’s celestial birthright.
The results of a dwarf inheriting the celestial legacy are magnificent to
behold. Aasimar dwarves’ skin might shine like polished metal, and their
immaculately groomed beards might weave impossible patterns. Even as
children, they might speak with the wisdom of a thousand lifetimes. Aasimar
dwarves tend to be serious-minded, and many choose to abstain from alcohol
and frivolous pursuits unless it benefits the greater community. Dwarves
believe that Torag himself forges each aasimar dwarf, imbuing them with his
zeal. Lawbringers are the most common aasimars among dwarves, and their
desire for order aligns well with regimented dwarven culture.
Aasimar

PAGE 10
================================================================================

Aasimar elves represent the height of artistry, possessing impossible grace
and poise. Azatas and elves have a long history of intermingling, and their
musetouched offspring are universally celebrated. Their hair gently moves to
its own breeze and their skin appears painted on, with visible brushstrokes
covering their bodies.
Due to their First World origins, aasimar gnomes are a rare
sight. They often have small, feathered vestigial wings, or bright,
wildly colored hair and eyes that actively sparkle at a glance.
Their halos shine brightest when they laugh, and their speaking
voices are accompanied by harps, flutes, and horns. Poetry
pours effortlessly from their lips, all their words carrying
seamless rhythm and cadence.
Many are surprised to discover that there are
aasimar goblins, whose existence proves that
goblins are worth the notice of the beautiful and
powerful celestials. The celestial inheritance mixing
with goblin physiology often results in extreme physical
expressions. They may have eyes on the roofs of their mouths,
their songs may sound like they are sung by a chorus of angels, or
they may appear to be eternally shrouded in heatless flames.
Celestials hold halflings in special regard. While some ancestries
must be shepherded, halflings are more likely to value music, food,
and community. Idyllkin aasimars appear often among halfling
communities, as agathions resonate with halflings’ contentedness.
An aasimar halfling may smell like a different dessert depending on
their mood, be covered in thick lamb’s wool, or grow long rabbit
ears as an expression of their celestial heritage.
Humans have a long history of beseeching celestials in times of
need. In Thuvia, angelic peris work alongside human champions
to quell demonic div insurrections. In Mendev, angels spent
lifetimes battling alongside mortals against demonic hordes. In
Tianjing, outside the Inner Sea, a host of quartered celestials
changed the fabric of a nation after defending it from vile
qlippoth forces. Humans are captivated by aasimars, as they
serve as a reminder that good will always triumph over evil.
AASIMAR FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to aasimars.
1ST LEVEL
EMBERKIN
FEAT 1
AASIMAR
LINEAGE
A peri’s roaring spirit burns in your soul. Peris engage in constant struggle to
right the wrongs of their fallen forebears, and that struggle has been passed

perception is unaffected by non-magical flames, fog and smoke.
IDYLLKIN
FEAT 1
AASIMAR
LINEAGE
Your wild, unique features betray your agathion birthright. Serene celestials
from the plane of Nirvana, agathions seek the peaceful path, ensuring a
better world for all to coexist. Your halcyon demeanor leads you to search
for peaceful resolution to conflict. You gain the trained proficiency rank in
Nature. If you would automatically become trained in Nature (from your
background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of
your choice. You know the Sylvan language and gain the Natural Medicine skill feat.
Aasimar Adventurers
Aasimars are often revered from
birth, and communities often ensure
that these blessed children are given
every advantage to pursue their divine
destiny. Pampered aasimars may
have the artist, emissary, entertainer,
or noble background. Aasimars
pursuing virtuous ends may have the
acolyte, detective, or field medic
backgrounds. Aasimars often
devote themselves to faith,
becoming champions or clerics.
Artistic aasimars excel as bards.

Your peri lineage has opened your mind to fire’s raw, purging essence. You can
spend 1 minute in focused preparation, then enter a fire your size or larger to
instantly teleport to any fire that is your size or larger up to 5 miles away. You
take no damage from entering or exiting fires when using this ability. Once

Your inherent glory radiates into the world with all
the divine power of the celestial planes for 1 minute.
Any creature that can see you while you Radiate Glory
must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC
or spell DC, whichever is higher. The creature then becomes
temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success You are concealed to the creature for 1 round by the shining light, but
can’t use this concealment to Hide, as normal for when your location is obvious.
Failure As success, except you are concealed to the creature while your glory
radiates.
Critical Failure You are hidden to the creature while your glory radiates, lost
amid the radiant corona of your presence. Your general position is still
obvious, so you can’t use this to Sneak.
Divine Pressure
Societies expect great destinies from
aasimars, and the pull of their celestial
tether guides them towards noble
pursuits. Most aasimars embrace
these impulses, looking to prove
themselves by answering the call. But
this intense pressure from their peers
and the celestials above may cause
an aasimar to shirk their birthright
and flee their homes, overwhelmed.
There are also aasimars who resist the
celestial call entirely, acting as a force
for evil to spite their heritage.

Azarketi
12
The proud and secretive azarketis descend from the Azlanti survivors of Earthfall.
Physically mutated by their greatest enemies, alghollthus, to survive underwater,
azarketis unknowingly traded annihilation for centuries of enslavement. Though
they’ve escaped subjugation, azarketis are tied to the ocean but drawn to the
shore, torn between two worlds in a way they can’t wholly reconcile.
AZARKETIS OF THE INNER SEA
Azarketi territory spreads across the globe, but most live in the Arcadian
Ocean, Inner Sea, and the ruins of Azlant. These ambitious survivors refuse to
embrace complacency and tend toward logic and adaptability. Wary of being
enslaved or manipulated by their neighbors, they value freedom and privacy.
AlvADnA
Adapted to survive in the dark, crushing ocean depths, Alvadna azarketis live in
deep sea trenches, where their large, sedentary communities protect them and
enable their reclusive tendencies. They subsist primarily on gelatinous lifeforms,
such as sea cucumbers, jellyfish, and xenophyophores but also consume eels,
fish, and starfish. As they adapted to their home depths, Alvadnas developed
semi-translucent skin and overly large eyes. They bind marine snow into thin
sheets to craft spartan clothes and fishing nets, which they illuminate with
bioluminescent bulbs. These azarketis also frequent underwater volcanoes,
using their control over water to shape molten lava into tools and weapons.
Alvadnas typically have the ancient scale, benthic, or murkeyed
azarketi heritage.
erAvAr
Confined to much smaller waterways than other azarketis, Eravars live in
rivers, swamps, lakes, and other inland bodies of water. Brown-skinned and
sedentary, Eravars build their homes at the bases of waterfalls or in caverns
behind them, along the banks of fertile riverbeds or half-submerged in
warm marshes and swamps. They grow crops and rear livestock for
food. Eravar azarketis have a fondness for pets, raising birds, fish,
and aquatic mammals along with other domesticated animals. Social
and gregarious, Eravars happily trade tales and goods with outsiders.
Eravars most often have the river, inured, or mistbreath azarketi heritage.
inzenti
The most commonly found azarketis, Inzentis live in temperate waters
throughout the Arcadian Ocean and Inner Sea. Inzentis’ skin tones range
from human hues to shades of pearlescent white, blue, green, pink, or yellow.
They have expressive brow ridges and vibrant purple eyes, and they favor
elaborate circlets, anklets, and wristbands crafted from gold, coral, and pearl.
Their cities of coral and seaweed sprawl across the ocean floor, surrounded by
farms of crustaceans, fish, and oysters. Inzentis hold great reverence for their
Azlanti origins and avidly study their ancestors’ culture and history, making
regular pilgrimages to Azlanti ruins, sunken shipwrecks, and coastal museums
and universities.
Inzentis most often have the benthic, spined, or thalassic azarketi heritage.
ozAlon
Large decorative fins crest the heads of Ozalon azarketis, who appear as
bold and beautiful as coral. They inhabit the warm waters of the Fever Sea
and southern Arcadian Ocean. Ozalons live in reefs and seaweed forests but

PAGE 14
================================================================================

13
regularly stroll onto sandy beaches to sunbathe and supplement their seafood
diet with tropical fruits. They typically wear little beyond simple skirts of
seaweed and have a preference for bracelets made of coral and shells. Ozalon
azarketis possess extensive knowledge of the toxins harvestable from sea
creatures; many can also read the weather and use this aptitude to avoid or
prepare for hurricanes and ocean storms.
Ozalons often have the spined, tactile, or thalassic azarketi heritage.
UsenA
Short and broad with mottled blue, brown, or gray skin, Usena azarketis live in
the frigid waters of the Steaming Sea. A thin layer of blubber lays beneath their
tough, rubbery flesh, and a dense crop of short hair grows atop their heads in
place of fins. Usenas wear waterproof, formfitting suits crafted from seal pelts
or sharkskin and typically live in small, submerged homes carved from ice.
During winter, they reside under the sea ice and hunt bears, fish, seals, sea birds,
and walruses. In spring, they work with other families to hunt schools of fish,
sharks, and whales at sea. Each night, Usenas surface to stargaze while sharing
stories and songs. They often worship Desna or the empyreal lords Pulura and
the Black Butterfly.
Usenas typically have the benthic, murkeyed, or tactile azarketi heritage.
AZARKETI HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to azarketis.
inUreD AzArketi
Your ancestors had to survive in polluted water that made every breath
noxious. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).
Furthermore, you can survive outside of water for 72 hours before you
begin to suffocate.
mUrkeyeD AzArketi
You live in murky waters and have grown accustomed to life in a
low-visibility environment. You need only a successful DC 3 flat
check when targeting a concealed creature and a successful DC 9
flat check when targeting a hidden creature.
spineD AzArketi
Your fins conceal launchable toxic spines. You have a spine
ranged unarmed attack with the unarmed trait that
deals 1d4 poison damage, has a range
increment of 10 feet, and is in the dart
weapon group.
tActile AzArketi
Your skin can detect the slightest changes in ocean currents. You gain
imprecise wavesense (Bestiary 344) with a range of 30 feet, allowing you
to sense motion in the water around you. You also gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to Survival checks to Sense Direction in aquatic environments.
ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to azarketis.

trained proficiency rank in Alghollthu Lore and Azlanti Lore. If you roll a critical
Legacy of Azlant
Directly descended from the people of
Azlant, azarketis have preserved their
ancestors’ culture through art, oral
traditions, songs, and stories. Azarketi
scholars study the history of Azlant and
Earthfall, elders recite tales of Azlanti
legends, and musicians sing songs to
long-lost gods. Most azarketis know the
location of the nearest Azlanti ruin, and
many possess a piece of Azlanti jewelry.

You can cast this spell once every 10 minutes. You can also use your innate

blood, giving that creature a +2 status bonus for 1 minute on their ongoing
saves against poisons already present in their body when you cast the spell.
WATER DANCER

AZARKETI
You glide through the water with graceful ease. When in an aquatic or swamp
environment, you ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. In addition,
swimming up or down isn’t difficult terrain for you.
Other Sea Creatures
Azarketis are one of many ancestries to
live beneath the water’s surface. They
have the most contact with locathahs,
humanoid fish-folk with an easygoing,
friendly demeanor. Azarketis find
merfolk territorial neighbors, though
their shared private tendencies lead
to mostly amicable relations. Together
they combat their shared enemies, the
monstrous but intelligent sahuagins.

TRANSMUTATION
WATER
Frequency once per day
If you and up to four other creatures are in contact with a body of water
deep enough for you to fully submerge, you can spend 10 minutes
adapting the creatures to that specific body of water. This allows them
to breathe normally while within that body of water and protects
them from deep ocean pressure. These effects last until the
creatures are no longer in contact with that body of water or until
you use this ability again, whichever comes first for each creature.
AQUATIC CAMOUFLAGE
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
You blend into the waves. While fully submerged in water, as long
as an observer is at least 20 feet away from you, you don’t need
cover from that observer to Hide or Sneak.
HYDRAULIC MANEUVERS [one-action]

PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your
surroundings. If the next action you take is an Athletics check to Disarm,
Shove, or Trip, that action has a range of 15 feet. You don’t receive any item
bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body,
but if you roll a critical failure on that Athletics check, you get a failure instead.
MIST STRIDER
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
Prerequisites Water Strider
You condense the moisture in the air, solidifying it so it can hold your weight.
When you use Water Strider, you can walk on air. You can ascend and descend at
a maximum of a 45-degree angle. You still fall at the end of your movement if you
don’t end on a surface that can support you, as normal for Water Strider.
REHYDRATION
FEAT 13
AZARKETI
PRIMAL
TRANSMUTATION
WATER
Frequency once per day
You surround your body with a thin layer of water drawn from the moisture in the
air. You can spend one hour resting to rehydrate your gills and skin, which counts
as submerging your body in water. At the GM’s discretion, incredibly dry areas, such
as deserts, might not have enough moisture in the air for your Rehydration to work.
17TH LEVEL
UNDERWATER VOLCANO
 FEAT 17
AZARKETI
You can cast volcanic eruption as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day, except
that you can only evoke the volcano on the floor of a body of water, and the effects
that normally happen to flying creatures happen to swimming creatures instead.
Alghollthus
Azarketis have a complex relationship
with alghollthus, who saved but then
enslaved their people. Alvadnas have the
greatest chance of meeting an alghollthu
face to face. Azarketi sentiments toward
these creatures vary: some fight fiercely
against their ancient enemies; others
bargain for power or safety, or even
serve through compulsion.

Catfolk
16
Believed to originate somewhere in central or southern Garund, catfolk—
known amongst themselves as amurruns—live everywhere around the Inner
Sea. Catfolk legends claim that when Golarion was first created, the gods made
catfolk to be guardians tasked with hunting threats to the young world. They
consider their nation of Murraseth in southern Garund their hereditary home,
though the allure of travel appeals to many catfolk. Propelled by their culture
of discovery and bursts of restless energy, they’ve spread across the world since
ancient times, pursuing their love of company and their ancient sense of duty.
CATFOLK OF THE INNER SEA
The ancient catfolk diaspora has established distinct cultures and ethnicities
around the world, though many of them live among other humanoids so
consistently that they rarely form separate settlements.
AskeDHAki
Askedhakis are diaspora catfolk commonly found in Vudra, Jalmeray,
and Nex. They tend to have striped hair or fur and wear light clothing
suitable for travel in oppressive heat and humidity. Most eke out their
living as nomadic traders, but their warriors traditionally hunt
tigers, rakshasas, and other creatures that prey on humanoids. As
a mark of prestige and culture, Askedhakis usually wear the most
expensive jewelry they can afford in a variety of styles. They view
long fangs as an attractive sign of strength, and their artists and artisans
have developed various techniques for enhancing one’s fangs with metal.
Askedhakis typically have the clawed or flexible catfolk heritage and
often take the Saber Teeth ancestry feat.
mitzenki
Mitzenkis are indigenous to the Crown of the World and nearby arctic
regions, such as Iobaria and northern Arcadia. They often appear taller
and brawnier than most other catfolk, and they have either striped or
spotted fur that ranges from white to lightly colored. Their home
conditions mean these catfolk rarely encourage leaving their communities
or traveling abroad, so they like to know everything about their community
and neighbors. Mitzenki armor, weapons, and clothing traditionally feature
leather and prominent bones.
Mitzenkis overwhelmingly have the winter catfolk heritage.

PAGE 18
================================================================================

17
QittAj
The diasporic Qittaj catfolk are most common in Kelesh, including some parts
of eastern Qadira. They tend to have yellow or green eyes and striped bronze
or yellow fur. They frequent the busy, sunny marketplaces of Katheer and other
major cities as well as journey through major travel hubs and oases across the
empire. Qittaj catfolk also use surnames, an unusual practice among their kind,
generally taking on an ancestor’s title as the clan surname. They’re also some of
the most religious catfolk, often worshipping Sarenrae.
Qittaj catfolk typically have the nine lives or sharp-eared catfolk heritage.
setHUrril
Sethurrils are the most populous catfolk ethnicity in Garund and Avistan.
Their ancestral home of Murraseth has stood as a rich and influential cultural
touchstone since the Age of Darkness, leading many amurruns to equate
catfolk culture with Sethurril culture. Sethurril fashion favors eye-catching,
multicolor garments with puffy sleeves or flowing cloaks. They’re especially
likely to worship Desna, whom they depict as a kindred catfolk explorer and
hunter of the monsters lurking at the world’s edges.
Sethurrils most often have the jungle or
hunting catfolk heritage.
sHemtej
Many believe Shemtej catfolk to
be the favored children of Bastet
and wardens of dangerous spirits
bound in the remote deserts of Osirion,
Thuvia, and Rahadoum. Male shemtej catfolk
are known for growing full, leonine manes. Their
culture prioritizes free love, and Shemtejes largely
disavow formalized marriage in favor of more fluid
relationship structures. Nomadic family groups known
as trains constantly change membership. Lovers come
and go, children grow up and seek their own paths, and
elders leave to pursue their personal goals.
Shemtejes often have the nine lives or liminal catfolk heritage.
CATFOLK HERITAGES
As a catfolk, you can select your heritage from among the following.
flexible cAtfolk
You’ve inherited flexibility beyond that of most humanoids. You
don’t treat tight spaces that don’t require you to Squeeze as difficult
terrain. In addition, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to checks when
you attempt to Escape.
liminAl cAtfolk
You’ve inherited a closeness to the far corners of the world, where the
boundaries between dimensions grow thin. You can cast detect magic as
an occult innate cantrip heightened to half your level, rounded up. You
also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Recall Knowledge
about creatures that originated outside of the Material Plane.
sHArp-eAreD cAtfolk
You were born with big, expressive ears that move with your moods and
perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate
undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.
As long as you’re aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your
ears can help you Point Out the creature to all allies as a free action.
Other Catfolk
Numerous catfolk ethnicities exist
beyond the Inner Sea. The black-spotted
Guarrxil of southern Arcadia are
renowned for their principled mercenary
companies and heroic rangers. The
mysterious Caimurru of the western
Arcadian coast trade more with First
World caravans than with other mortals.
The Lyashtaki catfolk of the Valashmai
Jungle sometimes make treks far from
the jungle via coast-hopping boats.

perceive. Others experience it as a
reflexive awareness of danger beyond
their normal senses. More spiritual
catfolk try to tune into the warnings
from the spirits of fortune through an
art known as serendipity reading.

you (typically dying 3). This doesn’t change the result for any other creature affected.
Murraseth
Murraseth is the largest of several
remote catfolk-majority city-states in
central Garund. Even distant catfolk
take pride in its guilds and its Houses
of Names—labyrinthine, live-in galleries
for artists and performers who retell
catfolk discoveries and tales. Many
catfolk consider visiting a House of
Names an important life milestone.
Guilds dominate Murraseth. Perhaps
the most distinctive of these groups is
the Circle of Lifeshapers, comprised of
polymorph specialists and healers.

Changelings are the children of the monstrous crones known as hags; they
received their name from their hag mothers’ habit of stealing babies and
leaving changelings behind in the empty cradles. While some changelings are
left as foundlings or even given as gifts to hopeful couples, the changeling tale
of abduction permeates Golarion’s cultures for all-too-real reasons. Raised
by parents possibly unaware of their nature, a young changeling often grows
up in uncertainty and isolation. Some changelings might be shunned for their
eccentricities, and many push others away for not understanding their feelings
and desires. However, those who manage to get close to a changeling will find
an intensely dedicated friend.
Changelings choose their paths in life as anybody might, but regardless of
ancestry, the most common influence among changelings is ostracism.
Even changelings who receive unconditional love and acceptance
usually experience subconscious feelings of unbelonging. Rare is the
changeling who feels entirely at home among their community and
peers; many leave their homes when the opportunity for travel or
adventure comes, searching for somewhere they can fit in on their
own terms. Perhaps for related reasons, changelings that work
to reject their mothers’ influence often prove the most accepting
of others and forgiving to a fault; combined with a desperate
desire for emotional intimacy, this accommodating nature has
led more than one changeling to be taken advantage of by a “friend”
they can’t seem to stop forgiving. Many other changelings, whether
by their nature or from being betrayed one too many times, have
the opposite mentality and hold grudges to the bitter end.
Changelings can go through a life-defining experience
known as the Call. When changelings reach a certain age,
unless their hag mother was slain or has abandoned them
entirely, they feel a psychic pull as their mother tempts
them into becoming a hag. While changelings can resist
the Call, its gnawing presence causes many to suffer
long-term mental strain and emotional instability.
As a result, however, changelings who avoid the Call
frequently develop fierce willpower.
The Call can start as early as childhood, but for
most changelings, it comes at the cusp of adulthood. Callow
mays receive it through the whisper of leaves, brine mays hear it in the
splash of surf, and moon mays feel it in the shimmer of moonlight.
The experience blends wanderlust with a desperate desire to find new
horizons and unravel the world’s mysteries, and it sharpens the longing
for community and understanding that most changelings experienced
throughout their youth. While the Call comes occasionally as an imperative,
hags are cunning enough to know that a changeling brought forcibly to heel
likely won’t submit to the covenant ritual. As a result, the Call tempts more
than it commands, feeling like a far-off wonder awaiting discovery.
The grand temptation, as folklore has labeled it, lies at the far end of
the Call, when the changeling finally comes face-to-face with their mother.
The hag often prepares for this moment by adopting a harmless facade,
presenting herself as a kindly, old woman eager to meet her lost child.
Through conversation or prior divinations, the hag intuits the changeling’s
emotional vulnerabilities, using manipulation and deception to persuade
them to submit to their inner spite and hatred. When the changeling is
ready, the hag brings them to her coven.
Changeling

PAGE 22
================================================================================

CHANGELINGS OF THE INNER SEA
While changelings largely resemble other members of their father’s ancestry,
a few common tells still distinguish them. Their eyes are the best-known trait;
nearly every changeling inherits a single eye’s color from their mother, a trait
referred to by superstition as the covenant sign. Tales claim that this eye serves
as the link that facilitates the Call and that putting it out will save the child,
but numerous one-eyed changelings—and, for that matter, one-eyed hags—can
testify to the belief’s falsehood.
In addition to the covenant sign, most changelings grow long, flowing hair
that requires frequent trimming. They often appear especially striking for their
ancestry, and many have a certain potent mystique. Changelings commonly
dress to accentuate physical appeal even if they don’t wish to use their
appearance to their advantage, as some inherited instinct causes them to find
intense emotional comfort in an alluring personal aesthetic.
Old tales describe changelings as exclusively women, but changelings of
other genders are simply less common. Some might never learn of their nature
as changelings since the Call disproportionately targets women. Nonetheless,
changelings of any gender can undergo the covenant ritual and become
hags. Perhaps because of this malleability, it’s somewhat more common for
changelings to feel drawn to a gender expression other than that which they
were assigned.
Changelings appear among almost all ancestries. Changeling dwarves,
most common in Cheliax and Varisia, often have soft skin that never calluses,
especially on their hands, which frequently causes them discomfort during hard
labor. Changeling dwarves raised among their ancestral cultures are usually
watched closely by the community for signs of their unnatural heritage, which
drives many to settle elsewhere or become adventurers.
Changeling elves, most common in Kyonin and among the Ilverani,
notably have strong and luxuriant hair, which can grow several
feet annually to easily reach ankle-length or longer. While elf
communities accept and even celebrate changeling elves, the
common understanding that a changeling has replaced another baby
leaves a bittersweet edge to their reaction, which many changelings
mistake for secret hatred or mockery. Changeling elves often receive
specialized training to resist the Call, and upon finding a changeling child,
some communities immediately set rangers on the wicked mother’s trail.
Unlike changelings of other ancestries, changeling gnomes rarely receive
different treatment from their people, for better or worse. Most common in
Absalom, Andoran, and throughout the Saga Lands, changeling gnomes are
marked by unusually large eyes—even for gnomes—which other ancestries
often find unsettling.
Goblins openly celebrate changelings of their ancestry, often calling
them stormcrows or stormcrones (regardless of gender). Most common in
Varisia, Isger, and the Shackles, changeling goblins typically appear taller
and ganglier than other goblins, though their tendency to develop hunched
backs more than offsets their height.
Found mostly in Andoran, Cheliax, and Iobaria, changeling halflings
attract a mix of intense suspicion and superstitious respect, and they’re
often assumed to have magic powers. Some communities pester their
changelings for help with numerous problems, from warts to bad crops,
driving them away in search of peace rather than excitement.
Changeling humans look especially slender and tall with long hair and
limbs. They’re most commonly viewed with suspicion, ostracized
for their differences, and simultaneously resented for their
advantages. The exception is in Irrisen, where changelings gain
a measure of respect. While likely found anywhere, changeling
humans drastically appear more frequently in Ustalav, Irrisen,
and Brevoy.
Changeling Adventurers
Depending on their mother’s choice of
cradle, a changeling might grow up a
farmhand or noble. Reclusive changelings
might be artists, herbalists, tinkers, or
hermits, while some find companionship
as animal whisperers. More outgoing
changelings might become charlatans
or fortune-tellers or use their allure as
merchants and entertainers.
Changelings carry the potential for
occult sorcery via their hag blood;
the bard’s path offers similar magic.
Many changelings who find beauty
in nature become druids or rangers,
while changeling rogues make master
manipulators with lethal claws.
Changelings might become paladins or
redeemers to protect what they love.

ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to changelings.
1ST LEVEL
MAIDEN’S MENDING [reaction]
FEAT 1
CHANGELING
Frequency once per minute
Trigger You cast a non-cantrip occult spell or an innate spell from a changeling
ancestry feat.
You can tap into some of the magic that flows through your blood to give you new
life. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1)
that last until the end of your next turn.
MOON MAY
FEAT 1
CHANGELING
LINEAGE
Your mother was a moon hag, a handmaiden of Groetus, and you have a single
scarlet eye and a sliver of her supernal foresight. You can cast guidance as an
occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level
rounded up.
SNOW MAY
FEAT 1
CHANGELING
LINEAGE
You’re the child of a winter hag, with one blue-white eye and an affinity for rime
and snow. When moving over ice or snow in arctic terrain, you always gain the
benefits of the Cover Tracks action without needing to use the activity or having
to move half your Speed. You don’t treat icy terrain as uneven ground (though it’s
still difficult terrain for you), and you ignore difficult terrain caused by snow. Cold
precipitation and environmental cold effects don’t alter the time it takes for you
to become fatigued.
VEIL MAY
FEAT 1
CHANGELING
LINEAGE
Born of a blood hag, a fiery blood drinker hidden behind a false
skin, you have one blood-red eye and the ability to slough off your
appearance in an instant. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat, and you can
shed a disguise quickly by peeling off the outer layer of your skin. Changing
from a disguise used to Impersonate back to your true appearance is a 3-action
activity for you; if you’re an expert in Deception, it’s a 2-action activity, and if
you’re legendary in Deception, it takes only a single action. This doesn’t allow
you to don or remove armor or other equipment any faster, but your physical
appearance otherwise returns to its normal state.
VIRGA MAY
FEAT 1
CHANGELING
LINEAGE
Born of a storm hag, you have one crystal-blue or rain-gray eye. You share your
mother’s power over wind and storm. You can cast electric arc as an occult innate
cantrip. As normal, a cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level
rounded up.
5TH LEVEL
CUNNING HAIR
FEAT 5
CHANGELING
Your hair moves under your control. You can perform simple Interact actions with
your hair, such as opening an unlocked door. Your hair can’t perform actions that
require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would
require a check to accomplish, and you can’t use it to hold items.
Changeling Relationships
Given their desire for emotional
intimacy, romance and love are often
major aspects of changelings’ lives.
Some flit from one tryst to another,
while others find dedicated lovers
and cling to them tightly—sometimes
enough to drive them away. While
some changelings use their mystique
to manipulate others, such attempts
all too often end with the changeling
actually falling in love, only to
become heartbroken when their lover
discovers their earlier duplicity.
Changelings rarely feel comfortable
with a single partner despite their
desire for commitment. The most
comfortable relationship structure
for many changelings involves the
changeling and two or more people,
each in a relationship with all other
members. However, these changelings
are acutely aware that their hag blood
is the likely source of this desire.

FAVORABLE WINDS [one-action]
FEAT 5
AIR
CHANGELING
CONCENTRATE
OCCULT
Prerequisites Virga May
You wrap a shell of favorable wind around a weapon you wield. On your next Strike
with a ranged weapon before the start of your next turn, you don’t take circumstance
penalties on the attack roll due to wind. In addition, if that weapon has a range
increment of 10 feet or less, increase its range increment by 10 feet for that Strike.
9TH LEVEL
INVOKE THE ELEMENTS [two-actions]
FEAT 9
CHANGELING
EVOCATION
PRIMAL
Prerequisites Brine May APG, Snow May, Veil May, or Virga May
Frequency once per day
You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow,
crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning. For
1 minute, you gain concealment against creatures
more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its
turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 damage (basic
Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever
is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases
by 1d12. A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow
may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling
deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the water
trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.
MOTHER’S MINDFULNESS [reaction]
FEAT 9
CHANGELING
Frequency once per minute
Trigger An adjacent ally is hit by an attack.
You have the protective instinct your own mother lacks and will gladly suffer in
another’s place. You interpose yourself in the attack’s path. You become the target of
the triggering attack and are automatically hit by the attack (or critically hit if the
ally was critically hit), suffering the full effects in your ally’s place.
13TH LEVEL
SPITEFUL RAKE [two-actions]
FEAT 13
CHANGELING
Prerequisites claw unarmed attack
Requirements You have both hands free.
Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you’ve learned a devastating trick:
go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is
dazzled for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead blinded for 1 round and
dazzled until restored to maximum hit points.
17TH LEVEL
CRONE’S CRUELTY
FEAT 17
CHANGELING
Filled with rancor and hate, you rend the minds of those who displease you. You can
cast warp mind once per day as an occult innate spell.
STORMY HEART
FEAT 17
CHANGELING
Prerequisites Invoke the Elements
The elemental power in your blood is a raging storm. You can Invoke the Elements
with a frequency of once per 10 minutes, rather than once per day.
Changeling Origins
Changelings’ rarity typically prevents
them from gathering in numbers.
While changelings can be found
anywhere hags lurk, they’re most
common by far in Ustalav, Irrisen, and
neighboring regions. The daughters
of night hags and moon hags can
arise far from any known hag activity
thanks to their mothers’ extraplanar
origins, as can the spontaneously
arising sorrow may.

Dhampir
24
Mortal, yet descended from immortals; living, but irrevocably shaped by
undeath: dhampirs exist in a liminal space between two opposing forces. Many
superstitious folk would say these half-dead, vampire-descended creatures
shouldn’t exist at all—but exist they do, despite their often-violent origins,
carving out lives for themselves among all ancestries and across all cultures.
In most ways, dhampirs resemble their mortal parents. They retain their
ancestry’s size, general shape and build, and distinguishing features such as
pointed ears, pronounced jawlines, thick facial hair, and the like. They hail
from all ethnicities and all parts of the world, but a dhampir’s skin and hair
are always an ashen, bloodless reflection of their mortal parent’s, lacking
the warm tones that indicate life and vitality. Born with a hunger distinct
from most mortal appetites, dhampirs trend toward slighter builds than
their mortal counterparts. Their eyes are often colorless, with only pinpoint
pupils, though some instead have gray, silver, or red eyes. Despite these
eerie characteristics, most dhampirs embody an entrancing combination
of physical grace and subtle charm.
Given their unusual origins, it’s no surprise that dhampir societies are
all but unheard of. Complex families occasionally form when a single vampire
gives rise to several dhampir siblings, but most dhampirs exist in isolation. In
the best of cases, a dhampir is raised as part of their mortal parent’s society
and faces all the prejudice that community bears toward a half-living child.
Those born to strife and violence are often orphaned, abandoned, or cast out.
Their eerie mannerisms and long lifespans only exacerbate the difficulties
they face when integrating into a community, causing most dhampirs to
keep their distance and remain detached from those around them.
Dhampirs are outsiders in most cultures, and many find kinship
among other people of mixed ancestry: half-elves and half-orcs, tieflings,
changelings, and similar types. Rarely, small communities of dhampirs
form in the shadows of particularly large cities or in wild hinterlands far
from settled regions.
To some extent, a dhampir’s existence is predicated upon death and
bloodshed; even in the best of circumstances, their vampire parent’s very
nature compels them to feed upon the living, and many dhampirs have more
sinister origins. This reality leaves dhampirs prone to feelings of guilt and
indebtedness, which almost always have some sort of influence on their
outlook, but otherwise a dhampir isn’t beholden to their vampiric parent’s
wicked nature.
Dhampirs left to fend for themselves among a hostile populace often care
little for questions of morality; these individuals have learned, out of necessity,
to look out only for their own interests, and if their powers over others allow
them to better survive, they might as well put them to use. Some strive to prove
themselves to be more than the curse of their undead lineage, even going so far
as to hunt down vampires and other undead. Others enthusiastically embrace
the dark side of their origin and live a life of evil. Those who uphold a faith
often patronize the deities worshipped by their mortal parents, though evil
dhampirs often find inspiration in Urgathoa, whispered to have been not
only the first undead but in fact the first vampire.
DHAMPIRS OF THE INNER SEA
On Golarion, dhampirs occur most often in those lands where
vampires are most common: shadowy Nidal, the undead land of Geb,
and the legendary gothic haunts of Ustalav. These regions are home to the
svetocher children of moroi vampires; the offspring of nosferatu vampires

known as stravezeck; and the rare cel rau, descended from ancient strigoi
vampires. In Tian Xia’s Dragon Empires, dhampirs are most often ru-shi,
descended from the breath-stealing jiang-shi vampires more common to that
land. Adhyabhau dhampirs, creations of the rare vetalaranas—also called
psychic vampires—are hardly found outside the Impossible Kingdoms of
Vudra or, occasionally, Jalmeray.
Traditional dwarf culture maintains powerful safeguards against undead,
including a long history of tomb guardianship that makes vampires relatively
uncommon among most dwarf societies. Thus, dhampir dwarves are few and
far between, typically emerging in areas where dwarves have lost control
of their ancestral lands. Dhampir dwarves in traditional communities must
find a way to prove themselves—often by becoming hunters of undead
themselves—lest they be cast out from their homes.
Few elves would readily admit the extent to which their kind mingles with
the undead masters of the night, but similarly, few elves would admit that
they are just as easy prey to a vampire’s charms and enchantments as any
other. Elves make remarkably suitable companions for immortals, given their
long lifespans, so it’s no surprise that more dhampirs are born among elves
than nearly any other ancestry besides humans. Dhampir elves find the pace
of elf culture a suitable match for their own prolonged lifespans—though
these communities are rarely welcoming to their half-dead kin.
Of all the ancestries dhampirs are born into, goblins are perhaps the most
accepting of their half-living kin—largely because goblins vary so much that
the physical features of a dhampir goblin are largely
unremarkable. They are admittedly less common than
dhampirs of most other ancestries, and their longevity
is often balanced by the fact that dhampir goblins are no less
reckless or ebullient than any other goblin.
As creatures suffused with vibrant life force, gnomes rarely
deal with the undead, and so dhampir gnomes are remarkably
rare. The infusion of undeath into such an exuberant ancestry mutes
a dhampir gnome’s color and vivacity, giving them an appearance and
demeanor surprisingly similar to those few gnomes who have survived
the Bleaching.
 Halflings have long lived alongside humans, whether recognized or
not. Since vampires lurk most frequently among human cultures, their
influence extends out among halflings as well, leading to a population
of dhampir halflings that would surprise most. The close-knit nature
of many halfling communities means that dhampir halflings are less
ostracized and face less discrimination than dhampirs of other ancestries,
and the optimism of halfling culture encourages dhampir halflings toward a
friendlier, more open disposition than most.
As vampires primarily exist among and draw from human cultures, dhampir
humans are the most common of their kind, and they vary as much as human
cultures do. Given this disparity, perhaps the only thing dhampir humans
have in common is the distrust they face among most human communities,
likely due to the fact that humans are a vampire’s most common prey.
ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to dhampirs.
1ST LEVEL
ADHYABHAU
 FEAT 1
DHAMPIR
LINEAGE
You descend from the rare psychic vampires known as vetalaranas. Your forebear
gained sustenance from the mental and emotional energy of living creatures, which
manifests in you as powerful resistance to such effects. You gain a +1 circumstance
Dhampir Adventurers
Outsider status combined with
supernatural abilities make dhampirs
natural adventurers. The criminal,
hermit, nomad, and street urchin
backgrounds are common among
dhampirs, while those with better
fortune might have the acolyte,
noble, or scholar backgrounds.
Dhampirs who practice magic are
often undead-bloodline sorcerers,
wizards of the necromancy school, or
occasionally oracles APG or witches APG.
Those who have learned to fend
for themselves might be rogues or
swashbucklers APG, and those who
seek to slay undead might choose
champion or ranger.

bonus to Will saves against effects with the emotion trait, and when you roll a
success on a saving throw against such an effect, you get a critical success instead.
CEL RAU
FEAT 1
DHAMPIR
LINEAGE
You are a cel rau, child of a strigoi, one of the first vampires to walk Golarion. Your
heritage ties you to the Shadow Plane and grants you strange resilience to light and
darkness alike. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects
with the darkness, light, or shadow traits, and whenever you become dazzled or
blinded for at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.
NOCTURNAL CHARM
FEAT 1
DHAMPIR
The supernatural charm of your vampiric progenitor hangs about you, and you’ve
learned to use it on mortals. Against humanoids (or other creatures of your type, if
you’re not a humanoid), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to
Lie, and to Diplomacy checks to Gather Information and Make an Impression.
OLD SOUL
FEAT 1
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites at least 100 years old
Your immortal lineage has granted you a lifespan much longer than most mortals, and
you’ve learned a lot along the way. You become trained in two skills of your choice.
RU-SHI
FEAT 1
DHAMPIR
LINEAGE
You were born to a jiang-shi, one of the so-called hopping vampires found
most often in Tian-Xia. Your parent had a supernatural obsession with
counting small objects, which manifests in you as a preternatural gift
for linguistics and mathematics. You are trained in Society and gain the
Eye for Numbers skill feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 206). If you would
automatically become trained in Society (from your background or
class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
5TH LEVEL
FEED ON PAIN [reaction]
FEAT 5
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites Adhyabhau
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You deal mental damage.
The psychic feedback of another creature’s pain fills you with false life. You
gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the mental damage you dealt from
the triggering effect. If the triggering action dealt mental damage to multiple
creatures, calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took
the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
HOPPING STRIDE [one-action]
FEAT 5
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites Ru-Shi
You’ve internalized the hopping gait of your vampiric forebear. Stride up
to a distance equal to your Speed – 10 feet. During this Stride, instead
of moving through each space normally, you hop over every
other square between your starting space and your ending
space. These hops aren’t high enough to jump over a creature
or other significant obstacle in your way, but they avoid
difficult terrain, hazardous terrain, pressure plates, or hazards on
the ground or up to a foot above it in the spaces you hopped over.
Dhampir Settlements
The Darklands city of Nemret Noktoria
is home to a small, isolated enclave of
dhampirs born to the city’s vampire
ambassadors. A similar dhampir
community in the city of Kaer Maga
welcomes kin from across the Inner Sea
region. In Ustalav and the far reaches of
Vudra, a few dhampir villages exist—but
as the personal projects of vampires,
these hamlets become horrors at night.

PAGE 28
================================================================================

27
TASTE BLOOD [one-action]
FEAT 5
DHAMPIR
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Prerequisites Cel Rau, Straveika, Svetocher, or another lineage from a vampire with
the Drink Blood ability
You retain not only your vampiric parent’s taste for blood but their ability to gain
vitality from it. You drink fresh blood from a living humanoid creature, gaining
temporary Hit Points equal to the target’s level that last for 10 minutes. The target
must succeed at a Fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or
become drained 1. Regardless of the outcome of this save, the target is temporarily
immune to your Taste Blood for 1 day; further uses of this ability against the target
don’t increase the drained condition or grant you more temporary Hit Points.
To drink a creature’s blood, either your last action must have been a fangs Strike
that damaged the target, or the target must be restrained or unconscious and your
last action must have been a Strike that dealt piercing or slashing damage to them.
If the target is willing, they don’t need to be restrained or unconscious for the latter.
Draining the life force from an unwilling humanoid creature is a greater violation
than just drinking their blood. Taste Blood has the evil trait unless the target is
willing or is an active foe in combat.
UNDEAD COMPANION
FEAT 5
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites an animal companion or a familiar
Your companion is also touched by undeath, a mix of a traditional companion and
a skeleton, zombie, or stranger form of unlife. Your companion gains the undead
trait instead of the animal trait and gains negative healing. It otherwise uses the
normal rules for an animal companion or familiar; that means it can still be
affected by many conditions or effects to which most undead are immune.
9TH LEVEL
SLIP INTO SHADOW
FEAT 9
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites ability to cast at least one spell with the darkness trait
Your shadow magic bleeds into the space around you. Whenever you cast a
spell with the darkness trait, a lingering aura of shadows reduces bright light
within a 5-foot emanation around you to dim light until the end of your turn.
Like in natural dim light, you can use these shadows to Hide, but the aura still
makes your overall position obvious, so you can’t become undetected through
the use of these shadows alone.
13TH LEVEL
DAYWALKER
FEAT 13
DHAMPIR
Whether through painstaking exposure, devoted prayer, or simple luck, you’ve
found a greater affinity for life through the sun’s light. When in an area of direct
natural sunlight, your negative healing is suppressed, meaning you are healed by
positive healing effects and harmed by negative energy.
17TH LEVEL
TWIST HEALING
FEAT 17
DHAMPIR
Prerequisites ability to cast heal and harm
Your connection to both life and undeath lets you twist the healing
power of magic items to suit your own needs and aims. Whenever
you Activate an Item to cast a heal spell, you can invert its energy to
produce the effects of an equivalent harm spell instead.
Strigoi
The first vampires arrived on Golarion
from the Shadow Plane, but most have
died out, gone into hiding, returned
to the Shadow Plane, or evolved into
modern vampires. Those ancient few
who retain their original form are
called strigoi. These vampires aren’t
destroyed when exposed to sunlight—
instead, they enter a dormant state
from which they rise again at nightfall.

Duskwalker
28
Once, having been convinced by a powerful olethros advocate, a yamaraj
psychopomp judge decreed that, after death, certain souls could reincarnate
and walk Golarion once more. The children of this ancient pact became
known as duskwalkers. In their previous incarnation, every duskwalker
somehow served the cycle of life and death—but their time was cut short
until the machinery of psychopomp bureaucracy gave them another life. Born
anew, each duskwalker appears near the site of their past existence, a strange
child with an old soul and an
uncertain destiny.
DUSKWALKERS
OF THE INNER
SEA
Even by the generous standards in the
Inner Sea region, duskwalkers have odd
upbringings. They come into existence with
some measure of their past incarnation’s
memories, but they have roughly the
faculties and form of an 8-year-old child.
Each duskwalker once had a specific
destiny—but these destinies have failed in the
Age of Lost Omens, and duskwalkers are under
no obligation to follow them. In fact, only a few
duskwalkers ever receive any sort of guidance from
psychopomps or the Boneyard during their lives.
Duskwalkers are perhaps the rarest planar scions, with many going their
entire lives without meeting others of their kind. As a result of their unique
reincarnation, however, duskwalkers who do meet feel a strong sense of shared
identity. Duskwalkers tend to be hesitant to discuss their origins—not out of
shame or fear, but simply because the truth often makes people uncomfortable.
Many claim unusual but ultimately mundane origins, explaining away their
appearance with reference to fictional parents from far-off lands. Duskwalkers
are also prone to a degree of asceticism. Gratuitous hedonism or conspicuous
consumption feel somehow small in the face of death’s reality, a waste of time and
energy that could be better spent in other ways. They’re usually companionable,
understanding, and accepting of others. While incapable of having children and
generally uninterested in carnal pleasures, many duskwalkers seek to build a
family, often adopting children others would overlook.
Nearly every duskwalker develops strong feelings about their previous
incarnation, devoting great effort to learning about their former life. How a
duskwalker reacts to that knowledge varies—some idolize their past lives and
seek to complete their predecessor’s unfinished destiny, while others try to undo
and overturn every act out of philosophical opposition. Rare, however, is the
duskwalker who has only mild interest in their past self.
Physically, duskwalkers tend toward the monochromatic, as their skin, hair,
and eyes trend towards white, gray, black, or desaturated blue shades. Some
duskwalkers have more unusual features, such as patches of scales or feathers,
based on the their previous incarnation’s nature and actions. Their tendency
towards asceticism means that most duskwalkers dress in whatever garb is
common in their lands, though the occasional stylish soul dons robes of pure
white or black or takes on symbols of death.
Duskwalker dwarves tend to have black eyes, sometimes called mirror eyes
for the way they reflect light like those of a cat. In the Sky-Citadel of Kraggodan,

PAGE 30
================================================================================

29
just inside the borders of Nirmathas, lorekeepers keep meticulous records of
known duskwalkers and consider each discovery an important omen.
Duskwalker elves are often difficult to distinguish from mundane elves,
although silver-gray hair is common. Some duskwalker elves are born with
a faint spiderweb pattern on their skin, and spiders are unduly fond of them.
Duskwalker gnomes seem rarer even than those of other ancestries, although
the handful that exist are often mistaken for bleachlings due to their muted
color palette and restrained manner. This often makes them either particularly
popular or unpopular among their brethren, much like bleachlings, though
they are welcomed on the Isle of Irrere, near the Linnorm Kingdoms.
Duskwalkers of goblin ancestry are particularly rare, as fewer goblins have yet
performed actions in service to the cycle of life and death. Duskwalker asceticism
often causes mundane goblins to consider duskwalker goblins as “ungobliny.”
In the reclaimed lands of the Sarkoris Scar, they are nevertheless seen as lucky,
attracting death to themselves (variously defined but often personified as undead
with big teeth) and thus diverting it away from other goblins.
Duskwalker halflings are usually thinner than other halflings, even skeletal, and
frequently have delicate features with pronounced cheekbones. The occasional
duskwalker halfling to manifest in Cheliax is usually captured as a runaway and
disappeared before they can be adopted or find a way to survive on their own.
Duskwalker humans have the classic monochromatic palette of their kind.
A few among them, especially those manifesting in Tian Xia, possess curling
ram horns. Duskwalker humans appear more frequently in Ustalav, though the
paranoia of that land means that many have a hard time finding homes. Such
duskwalkers often live as outcast orphans in graveyards, which paradoxically
makes their communities safer from the undead.
Young duskwalkers are often prone to wanderlust
and a desire to prove their significance; surely, if they’ve
been given a second chance at existence, they should
make the most of it. Many seek out chances to fight
undead or aid psychopomps in their work, or simply
to do great deeds that might justify their reincarnation.
ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to duskwalkers.
1ST LEVEL
CHANCE DEATH [reaction]
FEAT 1
DUSKWALKER
FORTUNE
Frequency once per day
Trigger You would die as a result of a failed saving throw or recovery check.
Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck by lightning or choking on
a fish bone. You can reroll the triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you
must use the new result, even if it’s worse than the first roll.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out
of this feat.
DELIBERATE DEATH [reaction]
FEAT 1
DUSKWALKER
Frequency once per day
Trigger You are about to gain the dying condition as a result of another creature’s
attack or ability, and that creature is within your melee reach.
Once, you died because someone—murderer or monster, soldier or executioner—
chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness, make a melee Strike
against the triggering creature.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or
out of this feat.
Taking Tea with Death
Psychopomps can recognize a
duskwalker on sight, and most types
of psychopomp are much more
likely to start up a conversation
with a duskwalker they encounter
during their appointed tasks than
any other mortal. Nosois might trade
shiny objects or sweets for tidbits of
knowledge, morrignas might give a
warning of a nearby undead threat,
and so on. Rarely, a psychopomp
might take a shine to a duskwalker
and visit from time to time—though
given the way psychopomps measure
time, these gaps could be months,
years, or even decades.

NOSOI’S MASK
FEAT 1
DUSKWALKER
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
Many psychopomps wear masks when dealing with the living, and many cultures
believe that seeing an unmasked psychopomp’s face invites death. You are trained
in Intimidation and gain the Intimidating Glare skill feat. If you were already trained
in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice. You also know how to make masks like those worn
by psychopomps, a process that takes 1 hour and 1 sp of appropriate material. If you
instead pay 50 gp for a splendid psychopomp mask, the mask grants you a +1 item
bonus to Intimidation while you are wearing it. Its usage is worn (mask).
VANTH’S WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
DUSKWALKER
You seek to emulate vanth reapers’ fighting styles. You are trained with bo staves,
longbows, composite longbows, scythes, and staves.
WILLING DEATH [reaction]
FEAT 1
DUSKWALKER
Frequency once per day
Trigger An ally within 30 feet takes damage that would otherwise reduce them to 0
Hit Points and give them the dying condition.
Once, you died because you valued someone else’s life above your own; just as then,
you protect an ally by suffering in their stead. Reduce the damage the triggering
ally would take by 1 + your level. You redirect this damage to yourself, but your
immunities, weaknesses, resistances, and so on don’t apply. You aren’t subject to
any conditions or other effects from whatever damaged your ally (such as poison
from a venomous bite)—your ally is still subject to those effects even if you redirect
all of the triggering damage to yourself. If the redirected damage prevents the
ally from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, they remain conscious and don’t gain the
dying condition.
Special You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t retrain into or out
of this feat.
5TH LEVEL
SHOKI’S ARGUMENT
FEAT 5
DUSKWALKER
You feel a connection to shokis, the rambling collectors of wayward souls, and
might have found old texts written by one. You are trained in Diplomacy. If
you were already trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can
also cast disrupt undead as a divine innate cantrip at will. A cantrip is
heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
VANTH’S WEAPON EXECUTION
FEAT 5
DUSKWALKER
Prerequisites Vanth’s Weapon Familiarity
You’ve trained in the finer points of dealing death. Whenever
you critically hit using a bo staff, longbow, composite longbow, scythe, or
staff, you apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
9TH LEVEL
CATRINA’S PRESENCE
FEAT 9
DUSKWALKER
You’ve adopted the calming presence of catrinas, the festive dead; you
might have even danced with a catrina yourself! So long as you are visibly
Duskwalker Adventurers
Duskwalkers become adventurers most
often out of some sense of misplaced
destiny. While duskwalkers have free
will, they also feel the pressure to
make good use of their reincarnation.
Many duskwalkers choose to study the
otherworldly arts and become wizards
or bards. Duskwalkers are also more
concerned than most with matters of
the soul, commonly becoming clerics,
champions, and monks. Duskwalkers
most often come from the acolyte,
fortune teller, hermit, martial disciple,
and scholar backgrounds.

carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast
calm emotions twice per day as a 2nd-level divine innate spell.
MORRIGNA’S SPIDER AFFINITY
FEAT 9
DUSKWALKER
Much like morrignas, you feel an affinity for spiders. You can cast animal messenger
(spiders only), speak with animals (spiders only), and spider climb each once per day
as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
13TH LEVEL
CALACA’S SHOWSTOPPER [two-actions]
FEAT 13
AUDITORY
DIVINE
DUSKWALKER
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
Prerequisites expert in Performance
Frequency once per day
You’ve spent many an evening learning songs and tales
featuring calacas, death’s wandering minstrels. You
dramatically unleash a stunning blast of sound by
smashing an instrument you hold or belting out a
discordant note. This has the effects of synaptic pulse, but
the effect is auditory rather than mental. The DC is either
your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
VANTH’S WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
DUSKWALKER
Prerequisites Vanth’s Weapon Familiarity
Vanths themselves recognize you as an honorary reaper.
Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert
or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you
also gain that proficiency in bo staves, longbows, composite
longbows, scythes, and staves.
17TH LEVEL
OLETHROS’S DECREE [one-action]
FEAT 17
DEATH
DIVINE
DUSKWALKER
NECROMANCY
Frequency once per day
You have a connection to olethroses, the enigmatic psychopomps
who successfully swayed the yamaraj to permit the creation of the
first duskwalkers. You place a finger on fate’s scales by wrapping
silk around your bow. The first time this turn that you hit a creature
with a Strike using a weapon in the bow group you’ve modified in this
way, that creature takes an additional 60 damage (basic Fortitude save
using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher) as the arrow works
to cut short their very destiny. This additional damage is of the same
type as the initial attack dealt. If you hit more than one creature at
the same time, choose one to suffer the effect of your decree.
YAMARAJ’S GRANDEUR [two-actions]
FEAT 17
DUSKWALKER
Frequency once per day
You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the
magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist
at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This
is a 30-foot cone that deals 14d6 slashing damage and 4d6
persistent slashing damage (basic Reflex save using your class
DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also
become sickened 2.
Duskwalker Origins
Duskwalkers’ past lives were often
adventurers, but other origins might
include a doctor who fought an undead
plague or a gravedigger who encouraged
a healthy attitude towards death.

Hobgoblin
32
Hobgoblins are a tough, efficient, and disciplined people. These tall, muscular
humanoids resemble goblins who have been stretched to the height of a human.
Most live in regimented social structures, usually modeled after military
hierarchies. Their commitment to order and generally harsh, unsentimental
outlook on life often make it difficult for hobgoblins to earn allies outside of
their own kind.
HOBGOBLINS OF GOLARION
Hobgoblins live throughout the Inner Sea region, usually in insular, ordered
settlements. A large population of hobgoblins reside in the Avistani nation
of Isger and among the forests of the Eye of Dread and Shining Kingdoms,
though even these groups tend to live in small settlements or mercenary bands
thanks to a decline in hobgoblin population since the Goblinblood Wars. Some
of the largest, most notable hobgoblin settlements and organizations found
throughout Golarion are detailed below.
Bandu Fleet
The Vidrian Revolution, an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow
colonialist rule in the former state of Sargava, provided an opportunity for
the hobgoblins of the Bandu Hills in the central Mwangi Expanse. War had
ignited the nation, and the hobgoblins were eager to participate, allying with
several Free Captains and joining the pirates’ ranks in an attempt to quell the
revolution. As the tides of war turned against the Sargavan elite and the Free
Captains, the Bandu hobgoblins recognized two truths: they were on the losing
side, and any attempt to return home would surely end in their death. Seizing
opportunity amidst the chaos, they stole a fleet of Free Captain ships and set
out to start a new life at sea. The Bandu hobgoblins, now sailing under the
flag and moniker of the Bandu Fleet, have come to enjoy traveling the waves,
applying their militaristic tenets to the nautical lifestyle.
Members of the Bandu Fleet act as mercenaries, selling their services to anyone
willing to provide the supplies and funds needed to keep their crews fed and
ships repaired. Maintaining sizable crews can be difficult, so the Bandu Fleet also
takes on a smattering of sailors from other ancestries. Forced to accept whatever
sailors and jobs they could find, Bandu hobgoblins have become rather affable
(at least by hobgoblin standards), earning them a surprisingly positive reputation
among the ports of the Shackles. They’re seen as particularly efficient, capable
sailors, especially compared to some of the pirates of the region.
Bandu hobgoblins tend to have the runtboss, steelskin, or warmarch heritage.
Kaoling
Life among the hobgoblins of Kaoling—a hobgoblin nation in central Tian
Xia—is especially regimented. Kaoling’s rise to prominence was built on a brutal
commitment to structure and discipline that secured the nation’s place among
the Dragon Empires and instilled a deep sense of order among its populace.
More than the members of other hobgoblin communities, citizens of Kaoling
are used to living as part of a rigid hierarchy; even civilians in Kaoling hold
a specific rank and status within society. Any efforts to rise above one’s rank
outside the approved or official methods are met with swift, harsh punishment.
The Kaoling way of life often produces hobgoblins who are particularly cold
and distant, even by hobgoblin standards. Many expect treachery from their
compatriots as a matter of course, making it difficult for them to trust anyone
but those allies they gain during times of tribulation.
Kaoling hobgoblins tend to have the elfbane or warmarch heritage.

PAGE 34
================================================================================

33
opraK
Hobgoblins’ regimented lifestyle has found new applications in Oprak,
the hobgoblin nation founded by General Azaersi, nestled in the Mindspin
Mountains. To solidify themselves as an independent nation, the hobgoblins
of Oprak have shifted their focus from warfare to economics; entire squads
of hobgoblins now dedicate themselves to specific trades such as alchemy,
farming, mining, or smithing. Their military training colors these pursuits—
expert crafters in Oprak drive their apprentices with the same brutality that
lieutenants use with their soldiers. An intense dedication to commerce and the
creation of magical roads through the Plane of Earth have enabled Oprak to
become an economic powerhouse in just a few years. In addition to trade,
General Azaersi has pushed for a strong focus on diplomatic skills among
her highest-ranking officers. These officers drill tirelessly on their manners,
knowledge of local customs, and overall charm, receiving severe discipline
when they offend without permission or give in to an urge for retribution.
Oprak hobgoblins tend to have the elfbane, runtboss, smokeworker, or
warmarch hobgoblin heritage.
raKh lo
Deep beneath the surface of Golarion lie the Darklands, a vast network of
caverns and tunnels that sprawls beneath multiple continents. Hundreds of
settlements dot the seemingly endless span of the Darklands, and among them,
below the continent of Tian Xia, is the fabled hobgoblin city of Rakh Lo. It
was long considered no more than a legend to hobgoblins on the surface
until Oprakan delvers, while using the power of the Onyx Key to travel to
Kaoling, accidentally discovered this vast city built into the stone.
The hobgoblins of Rakh Lo have a flourishing civilization, thanks in
no small part to the rigidity of their lifestyle. This structure assigns each
hobgoblin a role in support of the city. Some hobgoblins act as food gatherers,
some use their skills to mine for valuable resources, and others use their
combat skills to defend the city. Hobgoblins in Rakh Lo have adapted to
the harsher nature of the Darklands, riding massive bats and centipedes,
using unique alchemical concoctions to sustain their crops, and relying
heavily on each other for support. They have learned to share what
knowledge and resources they have with others to improve everyone’s
chance at survival in the merciless Darklands. These hobgoblins are eager
to learn what they can from others but are also willing to commit brutal acts
to defend themselves or those they trust.
Rakh Lo hobgoblins tend to have the shortshanks, steelskin, or
warrenbred hobgoblin heritage.
HOBGOBLIN HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to hobgoblins.
ShortShanKS hoBgoBlin
You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins,
making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong,
muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist
you in riding and climbing—and you’ve trained at riding in a saddle
from an extremely early age. You gain the Ride feat. Additionally, you
are not flat-footed while you Climb.
SteelSKin hoBgoBlin
When you are cut or burned, your body responds by forming tough
but flexible callouses over the site of the injury. Over time, this makes
the most vulnerable sections of your body harder and more resistant to
damage. Many steelskin hobgoblins intentionally use blades and flame
to scar themselves in intricate patterns, though this isn’t universal. Your flat
Cantorian Spring
In days long past, Cantorys, goddess
of life, transformations, and forests,
created a staff called the Cantorian
Spring and placed it on Golarion for
fledgling mortals to find. A powerful
devil named Canzoriant learned of the
staff and slew Cantorys, claiming it for
himself. Using the Cantorian Spring’s
power, Canzoriant transformed early
goblins into the more powerful and
calculating hobgoblins, instilling in
them a deep hatred for elves. After a
failed attempt by elves to claim the
staff, the Cantorian Spring disappeared
and hasn’t been seen since.

Looming Concerns
To many, the specter of Oprak looms
large over the Eye of Dread region.
While the Whispering Tyrant is a more
fearsome figure, nearby nations worry
that once he is defeated, Oprak will
be the next monstrous powerhouse
on their doorstep. Some nations, like
Druma, realize the potential of Oprak as
an economic ally. Others, like Molthune
and Nirmathas, still feel the sting of the
Ironfang Invasion and hold unchecked
grudges. Nidal has reached out to
extend their non-aggression agreement,
and Nirmathas appears grudgingly
set to follow suit. Molthune remains
undecided, or at least unspoken about
its leanings, though rumors suggest
that hostility between Oprak and
Molthune is rising behind the scenes.

International Relations
Oprak holds a powerful magical tool
that has contributed to its economic
boom: the Onyx Key. Through this
powerful artifact, the nation creates
planar tunnels that facilitate easy,
seamless travel across Golarion. Using
the artifact, General Azaersi contacted
her fellow hobgoblin nations of Kaoling
and, later, Rakh Lo, establishing
trade agreements between the three
powers. These pacts have faced
their share of difficulties, however.
Oprak and Rakh Lo quickly grew
into close allies, but Kaoling’s harsh
traditionalism, even among hobgoblins,
has complicated diplomatic progress.

Kobold
36
Kobolds live throughout Golarion, with hundreds—if not thousands—of tribes
located in the upper Darklands and some secluded, often difficult-to-traverse
surface locales. Smaller tribes often manage to find a niche so minor that no
others bother to contest them for it, while larger tribes forge alliances with
powerful patrons, usually dragons, that they serve in return for protection.
KOBOLDS OF THE INNER SEA
While kobolds can often pose a nuisance to members of other ancestries, they
rarely gather in huge numbers and aren’t known for forming massive armies
to siege cities or attack nations. When they present a greater threat, it’s often
in conjunction with some other creature or group, such as a patron dragon or
group of larger allies. These allies are usually credited with being the “true”
threat, so small kobold groups have gained a modest level of acceptance among
settlements that are otherwise unkind to outsiders. A band of 20 to 30 kobolds
might be seen as a raiding party, and an assembly of hundreds would certainly
be received as an army, but a single kobold, or group of four to six, is generally
seen as an annoyance at worst, and more often a curiosity. After all, how much
damage could just a few kobolds do?
Rather than take offense at this attitude, kobolds see it as a sign of other
ancestries’ foolishness. Immensely practical, kobolds happily take advantage of
their reputation as cowards and weaklings. Many kobolds are perfectly happy to
cringe and grovel to survive, never feeling any shame for doing so. This is due in
large part to kobolds’ self-confidence. They’re told from hatching of their kinship
to dragons, and that nothing others say or do can in any way reduce this glory.
The following are some of the best-known tribes of the Inner Sea region.
danKBlade Crew oF the ShaCKleS
The black-scaled Dankblade Tribe tunneled their way up from the
Darklands into a sea cave on the Shackles’ Raptor Island. They soon
discovered that the nearby pirate battles and dangerous nautical hazards
frequently caused useful goods to float ashore. The tribe delightedly
accepted these seaborne tributes, took to dressing in any nautical garb
they found, and renamed themselves the Dankblade Crew. They sell whatever
they scavenge, and passing ships have learned it is easier to treat with the
Dankblades than fight them. Prime bits of salvage are offered up to the brine
dragon Machazmroh, who flies by from time to time. There’s no formal alliance
between the Dankblades and the dragon—but the Dankblades see no reason to
tell anyone else that.
Dankblades often have the dragonscaled or tunnelflood kobold heritage.
emBermaw triBe
In the Cinderlands, beneath the Mindspin Mountains in Varisia, the Embermaw
Tribe continues to expand its kingdom beneath the feet of unsuspecting
surface-dwellers. Allies of the red dragon Tsazgatherax, Embermaws are
red-scaled, broad-shouldered, and uniquely muscular. They mine
the Cinderlands, forge fine tools and weapons, protect their
patron’s eggs, and fend off fire giants, azers, and salamanders.
Embermaws often have the cavern or caveclimber
kobold heritage.
glaSSClaw oF KatapeSh
The Glassclaw are an old tribe that operate near, and sometimes
within, the city of Katapesh. Unlike many larger kobold tribes, they

PAGE 38
================================================================================

37
have no patron, but they do have friendly relations with at least one sphinx,
for whom they run errands. Small even for kobolds, with yellowish scales
and subdued features, the Glassclaws work to ensure that no one ever breaks
Katapesh’s famous Glass Pyramids. They claim they were given this task by
a celestial entity 100 generations ago and dismiss any claim that the Glass
Pyramids aren’t that old.
Glassclaws typically have the spellscale or strongjaw kobold heritage.
iCerenderS
The Icerenders inhabit hundreds of tunnel warrens within the Tusk Mountains
in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Their white scales and icy blue eyes
serve as excellent camouflage, which they use to set ambushes on passing
caravans. They choose a new pass every few years, clearing it of ice and snow
to make it inviting to travelers. Their lord, the dragon Lydek the White, attacks
caravans that try to pass to the south, encouraging the use of the Icerenders’
passes. Icerenders only set upon caravans that won’t be missed or that have
truly valuable loot—though some of the tribe have begun to wonder what
opportunities might lie at either end of these caravan’s journeys.
Icerenders usually have the dragonscaled or spellscale kobold heritage.
Sewer dragonS oF aBSalom
The tribe that became the Sewer Dragons first tunneled into Absalom’s
subterranean drainage system in 4696 ar. The kobolds quickly found that their
aptitude for navigating tight spaces, mapping complex subterranean tunnels,
and making new passageways posed a highly sought-after skillset beneath the
City at the Center of the World. The Sewer Dragons have a much broader range
of coloration than many kobold tribes, in part because they happily accept any
kobold willing to work. The tribe continues to grow its reach and political
influence in Absalom, almost becoming its own guild within the city.
Sewer Dragons often have the caveclimber or venomtail kobold heritage.
KOBOLD HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to kobolds.
CaveClimBer KoBold
You live in a vertically-oriented home, and you’re
a consummate climber. You gain the Combat
Climber skill feat, even if you don’t meet the
prerequisites. You can use your clawed feet
and tail to Climb, leaving your hands
free. Additionally, if you succeed
at an Athletics check to Climb,
you critically succeed instead.
tunnelFlood KoBold
You grew up in a warren crisscrossed by underwater
passages, whether natural or excavated. You gain a swim Speed of
15 feet.
ANCESTRY FEATS
Kobolds can select from the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
DRACONIC SYCOPHANT
FEAT 1
KOBOLD
You have an affect that dragonkind find unusually pleasing—and when
that fails, you know when to duck. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception
Kobold Origins
Kobolds in the Inner Sea region have
numerous origin stories, many tied
to the conflict between the dragon
gods Dahak and Apsu. Kobolds who
live in caves near the surface often
believe they predate true dragons, as
Dahak scooped up their ancestors and
transformed them into dragons. The
further a kobold settlement is from a
cave system, the less these tales link
kobolds directly to dragons. Kobolds
in swamps generally tell of their birth
from blood that Dahak shed in battle,
while those who dwell in trees and
mountains often believe they were
born of Dahak’s tears.

checks and saving throws against dragons. In addition, whenever you meet a
creature with the dragon trait in a social situation, you can attempt a Diplomacy
check to Make an Impression on that creature immediately, rather than after
conversing for 1 minute; you take a –5 penalty to this check. If you fail, you can
choose to engage in 1 minute of conversation and then attempt a new check rather
than accept the failure or critical failure result.
Special If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don’t take the penalty to your
immediate Diplomacy check if the target has the dragon trait.

KOBOLD
You’re among the few kobolds who grow a set of draconic wings
later in life. The wings are initially small and weak; while not
enough for full flight, a strong flap allows you to jump further.
When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet (this
additional distance isn’t cumulative with the increased Leap
distance from the Powerful Leap feat). You don’t automatically fail
your checks to High Jump or Long Jump if you don’t Stride at least 10 feet first.

Other Kobolds
Kobolds most commonly share
the coloration and some physical
resemblance to chromatic and metallic
dragons, but others closely match
different sets of true dragons—notably
esoteric, imperial, planar, and primal
dragons. In Tian Xia, kobolds with an
imperial dragon appearance are nearly
as common as those with chromatic
and metallic features, and often take
roles as advisors and spellcasters.
Planar and primal kobolds sometimes
hatch when a settlement is in great
danger or exposed to planar energies,
and are often considered to be destined
for greatness. Esoteric kobolds are
rare anywhere, though they appear
more regularly in places with strange
energies (such as the Impossible
Lands), and are often feared and
mistrusted by their clutchmates.

Prerequisites Hatchling Flight

Traps!
Kobolds are renowned trap-makers
and take great pride in their ability to
design, develop, and construct cunning
and complex varieties of these hidden
defensive mechanisms, which they
call “slow fangs.” They often test new
trap concepts far from their homes,
using them to hunt or harass disliked
neighbors. This allows kobolds to
iterate on designs, sometimes mixing
traps to see if they’re more effective
in tandem rather than alone. Only
once a trap idea has proven effective
is it considered worthy to defend a
kobold settlement.
Trap-makers are treated by most
kobold settlements as intellectual
elites, and are often given the kind of
deference other cultures reserve for
priests and war heroes. A kobold tribe
lacking a trap-maker is likely to send
an emissary to find one and implore
them to come teach their craft.

Leshy
40
Leshys are immortal spirits of nature called into physical bodies through
primal rituals. While early leshys originated as guardians of natural habitats
who rarely strayed far from their birth places, a few went on perilous journeys
to attack threats at their source. These wandering spirits became easier to
draw into future creation rituals. With each passing generation, leshys with a
penchant for adventure have become increasingly common.
Leshy bodies can be made of numerous possible building blocks—like
petals, leaves, bark, and mushrooms. The ritual to create leshys can include
almost any plant or fungus, though most are primarily built from a single
species, which gives individuals their most distinctive features. Leshy scholars
group these characteristics into broad categories based upon their abilities.
Most common are leaf leshys. They can arise from any leafy plant but most
often form from trees or shrubs. These graceful leshys tend to be boastful,
enjoying mock combats and other dramatic performances. Gourd leshys have
hollow spaces within their heads, which they use to store their most valuable
possessions; this secure and private space makes them more likely to hold
cherished keepsakes. While fungus leshys can be quite sociable with other
ancestries, they tend toward introversion, needing quiet time spent in dark
and cozy caverns to recover after loud events. Vine leshys, by contrast, rarely
enjoy being alone. Much as vines scale trees and climb cliffs to reach for
sunlight, many vine leshys thrive in the presence of friends,
and they don’t shy away from asking for help when they
need it. Fruit leshys are similarly gregarious and tend to
be nurturing and generous toward their companions—
sometimes too much for their own good. True to their spiny
exteriors, cactus leshys are known for being abrasive, sarcastic,
and slow to trust. However, those with the patience to earn a
cactus leshy’s friendship find themselves with an unswervingly loyal and
unflinchingly honest ally. Similarly, root leshys are hard to win over, not
because of their personalities, but because they tend to live at a slower pace,
taking longer to warm up to others and make important decisions. Seaweed
and lotus leshys often have the most patience among leshys. Carefree and
playful, many seaweed leshys happily ride along with the ebb and flow of
the tides. Meanwhile, lotus leshys are thoughtful and fond of dispensing
wisdom in the form of cryptic advice.
A newly created leshy is at once both young and ancient. They view
the world with a childlike wonder and curiosity, relishing the chance to
experience the world with fresh eyes once again. Though their spirits may
be ancient beyond the reckoning of most ancestries, leshys consciously
recall little of previous lifetimes. Leshys typically find the significance most
ancestries attach to numerical age a curiosity—they understand that many
creatures have childhoods during which they gradually mature and gain vital
knowledge of themselves and the world around them, but they also struggle
to comprehend what makes an elderly noblewoman who has lived a life
of luxury and indulgence much different from her grandchildren. Still,
the past has a powerful impact on a leshy’s spirit, shaping their
personality, interests, and priorities.
As spirits who can experience many lifetimes
and forms, leshy ethnicities aren’t determined
by their physical bodies, origins, or familial
bonds, but by their spirit’s affinity for
particular cultural traits. Guardians
of the Green take their traditional

PAGE 42
================================================================================

41
role as protectors to heart and are the most likely to worship green men.
Reflective leshys value honesty and clear-eyed introspection; they’re
particularly sensitive to changes around and within them, such as the cycle
of seasons and the ways they grow from their experiences, though they often
embrace these changes and revel in their beauty, content to spend hours in
meditation. Ritualist leshys are collectors. In addition to gathering objects
significant to their current lives, they also proclaim the hidden power in other
objects. Sometimes dismissed as mere superstition, these pronouncements
are typically rooted either in their innate sense of other nature spirits or
in faint memories of their past lives. Sunbeam leshys value diplomacy and
alliance-building. Best known for their cheerful dispositions, sunbeams aren’t
without guile. Many willingly use trickery or manipulation to avoid conflicts
or to secure advantages. Hot-headed and quick-thinking thornspark leshys
are the first to spring into action against anyone who would dare to threaten
their allies or wards. Wandersoul leshys constantly seek out new experiences,
often spending their lives as travelers, explorers, and storytellers.
Leshy bodies don’t age and are theoretically immortal. With such long
lifespans, even the most daring leshys find value in periods of patient reflection.
They typically remain the guardian of a single location for many years. Most
leshys eventually lose their bodies to violence or mishap, exploding in a
verdant burst that nourishes the life around them. Leshys value their lives,
but they don’t hold the same fear of death that plagues other ancestries; they
know that once their bodies fall, their spirits will return to the natural world.
Indeed, leshys rarely wish to live forever in the same form. As the centuries
pass, a leshy who has lived a rich life full of new experiences and insights
gradually spends more time in reflection and meditation. At the culmination
of these reflections, their spirit flies back to rejoin other spirits of nature,
ready to absorb all that it has learned and begin the cycle anew.
Leshy spirits can be transformed by the strong influence of other planes of
existence or sources of energy. For example, a leshy spirit continually exposed
to an artifact from Heaven might take on characteristics based on Heaven’s
lush gardens in its next body, gaining the aasimar versatile heritage (page 8).
Similarly, a spirit given form in an area corrupted by negative energy might
become a dhampir (page 24).
Leshy kinship groups are based on mutual bonds of loyalty and trust
rather than biological relationships. When leshys gather with others of their
kind, they band together in nomadic groups or long-term villages near areas
of primal significance. Such groups often include a druid with knowledge
of the rituals that create leshys, allowing their group to grow or even
call back their lost members into new bodies. When governing
themselves, leshys usually defer to expertise and wisdom rather
than arbitrary classifications like wealth or social status.
Leshy settlements flourish in all manner of natural locations,
from forest treetops and prosperous fields to deep caverns,
desert oases, and even kelp forests surrounding flourishing
coral reefs. Leshys don’t limit themselves to only the most
pristine natural locations—they can be found in nearly any
corner of Golarion that supports plant life. Most leshys live
among other ancestries as well as in druidic circles, frontier
settlements, or even cities surrounded by lush farmlands.
LESHY HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to leshys.
CaCtuS leShy
Spines cover your body. You gain a spine unarmed attack that
deals 1d6 piercing damage. Your spines are in the brawling group
and have the finesse and unarmed traits.
Green Men
The first beings to create leshys were
green men, sometimes referred to as
leshy kings. These legendary guardians
emerge when countless spirits of
nature merge and rise to divinity.
Many green men discovered how to
draw upon the connection they held
with other spirits of nature, coaxing
them into physical forms. These early
leshys worked alongside green men to
defend their verdant homes. Though
modern leshys have far more varied
motivations, many still respect and
revere the gods that first gave them a
chance at mortal life.
While green men were indifferent to
most non-plant creatures, they didn’t
scorn the assistance of druids. In time,
some green men taught trusted allies a
version of the ritual to create leshys.

of still water and other non-damaging liquids, moving at half your normal
Speed. You can attempt to walk along the surface of flowing water as well,
still moving at half Speed, but doing so requires a successful Acrobatics
check to Balance using the DC of a Swim check to move through the
water; on a failure, you fall into the water. This Acrobatics check doesn’t
use an action.
root leShy
Your body is made from hardy roots that attach you firmly to the
ground. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8. You can
go without sunlight for 2 weeks before you begin to starve. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to
Shove or Trip you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells
or effects that attempt to move you or knock you prone.
Seaweed leShy
Your body is made from woven seaweed, and you’re just as
comfortable underwater as on land. You gain a swim Speed of 20
feet, and you can always breathe underwater. However, your land Speed is
reduced by 5 feet (to 20 feet for most seaweed leshys).
LESHY ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to leshys.
1ST LEVEL
AGELESS SPIRIT
FEAT 1
LESHY
You remember more about your previous incarnations than
most leshys. During your daily preparations, you can meditate
upon fragmentary memories of your past lives to gain the trained
proficiency rank in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts
until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t use
it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like
a feat.
5TH LEVEL
ANCHORING ROOTS
FEAT 5
LESHY
Small roots sprout from your feet, steadying you as you move. You gain the
Steady Balance skill feat, even if you aren’t trained in Acrobatics, and you can
use the Anchor action.
Anchor [one-action] Effect You send your roots deeper into the ground, making it harder
for you to stumble. Until you move, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to Shove or Trip you (or a +4
circumstance bonus if you’re a root leshy). This bonus also applies to saving
throws against spells or effects that attempt to move you or knock you prone.
Leshy Resurrection
Leshys who lose their physical
form incorporate the changes they
experienced in life into their spirit.
Even though a leshy’s spirit isn’t the
same as the soul of many ancestries,
resurrection magic can still restore it
to their most recent body. Should the
ritual fail, it’s usually because a leshy
has shed too many of their memories
and attachments, rather than due to
Pharasma’s judgment.

PAGE 44
================================================================================

43
If an effect forces you to move, you move only half the normal distance, as
some of the effort goes to tearing out the roots. At the GM’s discretion, this
ability might not work on ground that’s more resilient than stone, such as
metal flooring or magically-reinforced masonry.
9TH LEVEL
SPORE CLOUD [two-actions]
FEAT 9
LESHY
Frequency once per hour
You unleash a cloud of pollen or similar spores. All creatures in a 10-foot
emanation around you must attempt a Fortitude save using your class DC or
spell DC (whichever is higher) with the following results. Plants and fungi are
immune to this effect.
Critical Success No effect.
Success The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
Failure The creature is dazzled and can see only 10 feet away for
1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 round.
THORNED SEEDPOD
FEAT 9
LESHY
Prerequisites Seedpod (Character Guide 54)
When your seedpods strike a felling blow, they burst into viciously thorny
vines. When you critically succeed at a seedpod Strike, vines twist
and stab your foe, dealing 1d4 persistent piercing damage.
13TH LEVEL
CALL OF THE GREEN MAN
FEAT 13
LESHY
You can call forth nearby nature spirits to augment your body. Once
per day, you can cast plant form as a 5th-level primal innate spell. When
you reach 17th level, this spell can be heightened to 6th level.
CLOAK OF POISON [two-actions]
FEAT 13
LESHY
POISON
Frequency once per day
You secrete a cloak of concentrated poison that harms any who
dare attack you. For 1 minute, any creature that touches you or
damages you with an unarmed attack or melee weapon without
the reach trait takes 3d6 poison damage.
17TH LEVEL
FLOURISH AND RUIN
FEAT 17
LESHY
You can call upon the vital essence of your spirit to restore life to
your allies and call forth vines to ensnare and bludgeon your foes.
You can cast field of life and tangling creepers as 6th-level
primal innate spells once per day each. You become an
expert in primal spell attack rolls and primal spell DCs.
REGROWTH
FEAT 17
LESHY
Your command over your vital essence allows you or
an ally to recover from grievous wounds. You can cast
regenerate as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day.
Life without Form
Leshy spirits are beings of pure vital
essence without any of the otherworldly
quintessence known as spiritual
essence. Existing without physical
form allows them closer contact with
memories from their distant past, but
this broader perspective gradually
erodes memories of their experiences in
their most recent body.

Lizardfolk
44
Lizardfolk—also known as iruxi—are one of Golarion’s most storied ancestries,
thanks in part to their perpetual ability to adjust to new environments. Along
with this adaptability, their skill as astronomers and survivalists and their
oral traditions dating back millennia have kept lizardfolk relevant throughout
Golarion’s history on a global scale.
LIZARDFOLK OF GOLARION
Outsiders often don’t perceive the finer subtleties of iruxi culture. Many humans
have trouble even telling individuals apart, relying on only obvious details like
scale color and fin size. In truth, iruxi civilization is rich and varied with dozens
of ethnicities across Golarion—including several in the Inner Sea region.
eSSari
When most Avistani think of lizardfolk, they picture Essaris. Immediately
identifiable by the dorsal fins that start atop their heads, Essaris tend to
have scales of mottled dark green or blue that pale with age. Primarily
swamp-dwellers, Essaris eschew unnecessary clothing, opting for simple
tabards, loincloths, arm wraps, and cloaks. They live across Avistan, especially in
the west, though they’ve lost much of their historic territory to other ancestries.
Family trees are vital to Essari culture. Every Essari can recite their clan lineage,
and the bones of their precursors likely fortified the walls of their childhood
home. Even the most nontraditional Essari has a spiritual connection to their
ancestors that their closest companions might never suspect—until it saves
their lives. Most Essaris harbor suspicions of those from New Thassilon, as the
runelords and their giant servitors are dread figures in Essari lore.
Essaris typically take the frilled or wetlander lizardfolk heritage.
iKeleK
At first glance, Ikelek iruxi resemble their Essari neighbors. Instead of a
fin, Ikeleks typically have dorsal spines or no adornment at all, and their
duller, pebbled scales tend toward browns and grays amid olive greens.
Their reach across Golarion isn’t as broad, mainly concentrated among
the waterways and forests of the Broken Lands and Shining Kingdoms.
Ikelek architecture and crafts favor using glass, made from colored sand
acquired in trade with their desert kin to the east, over bone. They’re
superlative javelin throwers, and some take up archery.
Battling the pollutants and monsters that wash down from the
Eye of Dread has made Ikeleks revere the druidic arts and nature
deities like Gozreh. However, isolated settlements sometimes fall
under the sway of other forces, with some in the wilds of the River
Kingdoms worshipping demons or crueler patrons.
Ikeleks often take the cloudleaper or woodstalker
lizardfolk heritage.
Sand Brethren
The deserts of northern Garund and western
Casmaron house lizardfolk clans such as
the armor-scaled Hazairs, blood-spewing
Shaikims, dune-surfing Barrukas, and
camouflaged Nazegs—united by their
love of the hot sands, independence,
and privacy. Many have adopted the
heat-resistant cloaks and head wraps of

PAGE 46
================================================================================

45
their human neighbors, which also serve them when they want to roam Kelesh’s
city streets without comment.
While Sand Brethren iruxi vary wildly in physiognomy, they share traditions
of hospitality, desert flower cultivation, and scimitar sword dances that involve
nicking the tips of their rivals’ tails. The slender Zephyr Kin, nocturnal traders,
share news and tall tales from Rahadoum to Taldor and into Casmaron,
reinforcing the shared culture of the otherwise disparate desert iruxi.
Sand Brethren mostly take the cliffscale or sandstrider lizardfolk heritage.
terwazaSh
Outside of Droon, western Garund is the center of iruxi culture—and Terwazash
iruxi certainly hold themselves as paragons of their ancestry. Terwazashes are
brightly colored, usually with green scales and paler underbellies, though historical
association with dragons and lunar nagas means that entirely white, black, and
emerald individuals also appear. Terwazashes also tend to have expressive fin and
neck frills, and have strong artistic traditions focused on jewelry. The clothing
they wear is made of waterproof material such as woven reeds.
Terwazashes most often take the frilled or unseen lizardfolk heritage.
other ethniCitieS
Lizardfolk inhabit areas throughout Garund, from the red-scaled, cliff-dwelling
Karrakis to the secretive Mist Dragons who move through rain forest treetops
without ever touching the ground. Lizardfolk are most prevalent in southern
Garund, particularly in the iruxi nation of Droon, but are also numerous in
Vudra, where they mingle (and sometimes compete) with the area’s other
reptilian peoples, including vishkanya. Most Vudrani iruxi have scales that blend
in well with their jungle and mountain homes, though some appear glossy black
with brilliantly colored mouths that warn of venomous bites.
LIZARDFOLK HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to lizardfolk.
Cloudleaper lizardFolK
Your body is light with flaps of skin along your limbs that catch the air
that passes beneath you. As long as you can act and have enough room,
you can open the flaps to slow any fall just enough to avoid taking damage
(whether you have the room to do so depends on the GM’s discretion).
woodStalKer lizardFolK
You move easily through thick forest and jungle, using every branch
or bush. You can always use the Take Cover action when in forest or
jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you’re not next to an obstacle you
would normally be able to Take Cover behind. You gain the Terrain
Stalker feat, even if you’re not trained in Stealth, and you must
choose underbrush as your chosen terrain.
LIZARDFOLK FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to
lizardfolk.
1ST LEVEL
BONE MAGIC
FEAT 1
LIZARDFOLK
Your connection to your iruxi ancestors manifests as a simple primal
spell that you cast using a fragment of an ancestor’s bones. Choose one
cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a primal innate
spell at will, and it’s heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
Droon
Long before the birth of Azlant, iruxi
realms girdled Golarion. Today, only
one nation recalls the splendor of that
bygone era: Droon, a vast empire on
the coast of southern Garund. Here,
lizardfolk rule astride dinosaurs. Iruxi
nobles settle feuds via ceratosaur
duels. Sauropod caravan trains haul
goods across seemingly impossible
distances. Wizards breed spell-laced
rhamphorhynchus familiars, and no
thief worth their salt pulls a job without
a whistling velociraptor lookout.

10 minutes to draw upon your readings of a recent night’s sky to gain the trained
proficiency rank in one skill of your choice; the chosen skill’s key attribute must
be Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. This proficiency lasts until your next daily
preparation. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for

FEAT 1
LIZARDFOLK
Your tongue darts out faster than the eye can see to retrieve loose objects. You

Iruxi
While most lizardfolk permit humans

moniker, they call themselves iruxi.
This ancient word arose from the
Draconic tongue, though its exact
etymology is unclear. In Droon, iruxi
astronomers point to the jagged
constellation of the Maw and the
starry figure who stands against it.
Today, while this constellation is called
the Lone Mother and features in fables
about environmental conservation, she
once had another name in dragon lore:
Erux, meaning “defiance.”

gear to the appropriate size for your new body (though powerful items like artifacts
or items strongly tied to their original size may not transform, at the GM’s discretion).
Iruxi Ancestors
Ancestor worship is central to
iruxi spiritual life. Lizardfolk keep
their elders’ physical remains
close, incorporating them into the
architecture of their settlements.
The bones of deceased iruxi shore up
protective walls and fill great vaulting
ossuaries. Preserved and suffused
with ritual veneration, these bones
become magical reservoirs of power.
It’s rumored that in times of great need,
iruxi ancestors will reanimate their
bones and fight for their descendants.

Orc
48
Driven to Golarion’s surface by the dwarves’ exodus, orcs have a history shaped
by conflict. In Avistan, orc civilization is largely confined to the Hold of Belkzen,
a scraggy, mountainous badland and the last echo of their once-mighty empire.
United for the first time in generations, Avistani orcs are now poised to
make allies instead of enemies—assuming they can survive the wrath of
the mighty lich Tar-Baphon.
For many orcs, life is a tumultuous affair, where victory and survival—
and achieving them honestly—mean everything. Most orcs despise lies and
deception, seeing them as cowardice; this is especially true for diplomacy’s
crucial, if petty, half-truths and omissions. However, this view often causes
others to dismiss orcs as uncooperative and short-sighted.
Orcs value immediacy greatly, as they know much of life’s uncertainty and
brevity. They regularly fight to resolve conflicts, but so long as a combatant
demonstrates strength, even defeat can win respect. These displays of violence
have deep cultural roots, and just as orcs have pride in the scars they earn,
they don’t see their raging contests as brutal, the way outsiders do. To express
themselves, orcs often favor beautiful tattoos and intricate scarring that both
decorate the body and demonstrate their ability to endure pain.
Surface orcs are naturally nocturnal, holding many cultural activities and
ceremonies at night, as their eyes are better suited to the dark. This can
lead to further misunderstandings between orcs and other humanoids,
as orcs encountered during the daytime have likely been forced to
modify their sleeping pattern for the comfort of others, leaving
them short on sleep and, potentially, more easily aggravated.
Enshrak
Enshrak orcs returned to their homeland after being driven
skyward. They feel a deep connection to their people’s past and
search the Darklands for relics left by ancient orcs. They practice
traditional rituals and cultivate Darklands root vegetables (rather
than the surface’s sun-poisoned produce). Enshraks believe
orcs were never meant to leave the Darklands and hold fierce
superstitions concerning the blinding sun and their surface kin.
Enshraks maintain their hatred of dwarves, seeing the Quest for
Sky as a genocide. Many holds dig deep into the Darklands, trying
to reclaim their ancestral home, and some even seek to eventually
free Rovagug, in a movement known as the Quest for the Cage.
Enshraks usually have the battle-ready or deep orc heritage.
kharmaja
Living among Golarion’s lofty peaks has instilled a reckless
bravado in the orcs who call them home. Kharmaja orcs learn to
jump and climb before they can walk. Great honor is thrust upon
mountain orcs capable of death-defying leaps over deadly chasms—tales
of these deeds are sung across Kharmaja holds for generations in their
expansive oral tradition. Most Kharmajas live among the Kodar and
Mindspin Mountains, though some have expanded as far south as the
Menador Mountains.
Wrangling a drake into servitude is one of the greatest feats of bravery
recognized by the mountain holds. Kharmaja children memorize the
names of their favorite drake riders and their fearsome mounts.
Kharmajas usually have the battle-ready or hold-scarred orc
heritage.

PAGE 50
================================================================================

49
khuldar
Even sun-baked deserts contain hidden orc holds. Entirely nocturnal, Khuldar
orcs disguise their collapsible wooden homes under mounds of sand to escape the
harsh light of day. Young Khuldars prove themselves by standing watch during
the day while the remainder of the hold sleeps. Many reside in Belkzen’s Dirt
Sea, a massive expanse of fine silt. They create large, innovative barges pulled by
beasts or giants to traverse the sunken terrain.
Khuldars most often have the badlands or grave orc heritage.
matanji
The jungle holds no secrets for rain orcs. Matanjis defend their territory from the
demons of the Mwangi Expanse, their ancestral enemies. They carve protective
runes in trees to mark their territories; more extreme holds display macabre
trophies from defeated fiends. Other Mwangi residents greatly respect Matanjis
for their fiend-hunting prowess, and Mualijae elves often ally with
them against fiendish cults and other nefarious forces.
Matanjis often cover their bodies with intricate warding
tattoos. They show off their strength in intense martial dances
performed by small groups. Completing a dance with passion
and precision gains respect for the entire group.
Matanjis mostly have the hold-scarred or rainfall
orc heritage.
namathkar
Solitary orcs are highly rare, especially on the plains. Utterly
communal, the Namathkar orcs of the Hold of Belkzen and
the plains beyond are most comfortable when surrounded by
those they trust. Their skin tones range from dazzling greens to
earthy browns, and they dress in simple clothing that doesn’t hinder them
in combat, leaving them ready to fight at a moment’s notice.
Namathkars are the most populous orc ethnicity in Avistan. As scions of
the orc armies that clashed most with neighboring nations, they have fraught
relationships and reputations. However, they’ve proven most likely to
peaceably interact with other cultures, and the transformation of the orc
city of Urgir into a trading hub has facilitated this cooperation.
Namathkars often have the badlands or hold-scarred orc heritage.
nanut
The biting cold of Golarion’s frozen corners shapes the lives of Nanuts,
also known as arctic orcs. Most reside in the Land of the Linnorm
Kings, but they find homes in all arctic realms. Their skin tones range
from cold greens and frosty blues to dark purples, and they dress in
dyed animal furs. Nanut orcs hibernate during the times of year when
the sun never sets; when it finally does, they return to activity.
Living in large, nonmonogamous family units, Nanuts teach
their children to hunt communally. They’re less likely to resort
to interpersonal violence than other orcs, believing their energy too
precious to waste. Nanut orcs instead prove their dominance through
hunting—orcs who brave the cold and best the creatures of the arctic to
provide for their kin prove both their strength and value to their people.
Nanuts largely have the battle-ready or winter orc heritage.
ORC HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to orcs.
BattlE-rEady Orc
You descend from a line of terrifying battlefield commanders. You become
trained in Intimidation, and you gain the Intimidating Glare skill feat.
Orc Settlements
Orc settlements rapidly rise and fall,
but a few have stood the test of time.
Garaguum: In the Darklands, orcs
inhabit a ruin built by their ancestors:
the final battleground of their people’s
last stand against the dwarf invaders.
Scarwall: When the curse lifted from
this haunted castle within the Hold of
Belkzen, the local orc holds rushed to
make their claim. The castle’s lingering
magic warped the minds and bodies of
the orcs, who now call themselves the
Spirit Skull Hold.

Orc History
Originating deep underground, orcs were
driven upward when the dwarves began
their Quest for Sky. Endless dwarf forces
advanced from below, crossing into orc
territory and inciting a war that lasted
for countless orc lifetimes, with each
new generation losing more ground.
When finally driven to the surface,
orcs discovered a world shrouded by
ash. The nearby human civilizations
were unprepared for their anger and
desperation as they battled their way to
empire with dauntless ferocity.

Ratfolk
52
Known as ratfolk in many places across Golarion, ysoki have survived thanks to
their cunning, adaptability, and focus on community and cooperation. Ysoki have
large families with dozens of members, often including non-ysoki. Many ysoki
are avid travelers, moving throughout the world as merchants and adventurers—
lifestyles complemented by their ability to spot a wide variety of threats, from
environmental dangers to other creatures who wish to do them harm. Due to
their cautious and wandering nature, ysoki usually stay wary of strangers but can
quickly develop strong bonds with those they trust.
RATFOLK OF GOLARION
Where there’s trade, there are ysoki. As adaptable as humans, ysoki have carved
out warrens and caravan routes across nearly every continent on Golarion.
BElkzEn crEEpEr
Outsiders often dismiss Belkzen Creepers as uncivilized and monstrous due to the
animal skull masks they wear to inspire fear in their orc neighbors. In truth, these
canny survivors simply value seclusion as much as community. Isolated from
most other ratfolk, Belkzen Creepers often dwell in large burrows beneath the
rocky islands poking out of the Hold of Belkzen’s Dirt Sea. They typically have
tawny fur and limbs well-muscled from poling their sled-skiffs over quicksand.
Belkzen Creepers tend to be devout, and their clerics skillfully drive away the
region’s unusual undead. The central figure in their mythology is the Hollow Rat,
a hairless chthonic rodent who carves tunnel mazes to keep Rovagug contained—
or hasten his escape, depending on the tale-teller. They also venerate Lor Shan (a
local aspect of Lao Shu Po), Gozreh, and the orc fertility goddess Dretha.
Belkzen Creepers usually have the deep rat or longsnout rat heritage.
diGuO-dashun undErminEr
Populating the Darklands under central Tian Xia,
Diguo-Dashun Underminers are the most numerous
ratfolk on the continent. They generally have black or gray
fur with long whiskers and red eyes that help them navigate
underground. Those with enough wealth use gold, jewelry, and
elegantly wrapped tail ribbons to flaunt their social status.
Life in these ysoki’s resource-scarce caverns has taught them
the value of alliances, and they display fierce loyalty to their
militaristic clans and antipathy to any rivals (of which there
are inevitably many). Most Diguo-Dashun Underminers
dislike surface dwellers and resent the ease of their lives—
but bond strongly with those they come to trust.
Underminers usually view religion as transactional, worshipping
more out of hope for divine boons than reverence. However, they’re
strongly influenced by Lao Shu Po, the Grandmother Rat who stole
divinity for herself. Like her, Diguo-Dashun Underminers go
after what they want, sneaking around, tunneling
under, or barreling through whatever stands
in their way.
These ratfolk often have the shadow rat
or tunnel rat (page 54) heritage.
drumish dashEr
When most Inner Sea natives think of ratfolk, they picture a Drumish
Dasher. Affable, inventive, and quick-witted, Drumish Dashers have

PAGE 54
================================================================================

53
spread from Katapesh and Druma to markets, caravansaries, and dungeons across
the Inner Sea. Most sport brown fur ranging from beige to sienna and chestnut to
taupe. Though not ostentatious, instead preferring to keep their wealth hidden,
Drumish Dashers nearly always wear at least one jewel or bauble meant to dazzle
the eye (and occasionally, to flash secret messages to coconspirators). They value
intellectual pursuits, and many train as alchemists, wizards, clerics, or bards.
Drumish Dashers usually have the desert rat or tunnel rat (page 54) heritage.
GOkan hOppEr
Gokan Hoppers dwell throughout western Tian Xia. Born to bound across
desert sands and the Wall of Heaven’s mountain trails, they hop just as much as
they walk, springing like kangaroos on large feet. Desert Hoppers have sandy
coats, while those from the highland caverns have striking white and black
patches. Most wear Gokan-style robes or quilted coats, but others don the
tatterdemalion rags of the Darklands’ caligni.
With twitching whiskers and hands that rub together in excitement, a Gokan
Hopper will readily make you a bet, a deal, or a friend for life—it’s a small
wonder that so many dwell in the Deepmarket below Goka, a cosmopolitan
city where gambling is practically a way of life. Gokan Hoppers chase novelty
whenever possible, believing that fortune smiles on those who search for it.
Gokan Hoppers usually have the desert rat or longsnout rat heritage.
numErian tinkErErs
Bright-eyed and inquisitive, Numerian Tinkerers always look for new
opportunities to occupy themselves: a new project
to dabble with, a discarded object to claim as their
own, or a fresh escape route in case it all goes
bang. They resemble other Avistani ratfolk,
but with patchy, mottled fur, especially at the
head and shoulders. Numerian Tinkerers ardently
scrounge for alien artifacts while also exploring the
fields of alchemy, technology, and surgery. Exposure
to the region’s otherworldly influences has gifted many
with sorcery, too.
Surrounded by slavers, barbarians, nanite clouds,
and malfunctioning robots, Numerian Tinkerers
don’t allow outsiders to approach their warrens
or even their nominal capital, Chitterhome. Instead,
they bring their scavenged finds and expertly restored
artifacts to market in nearby human cities, deflecting
questions about their settlements with a joke and a wink.
Numerian Tinkerers typically have the longsnout rat or
sewer rat heritage.
ulfEn lEapEr
The north’s tough winters have tempered the ysoki who live
there. Big and broad, Ulfen Leapers are larger than other ratfolk,
with brown, gray, or snow-white fur. Named for their deftness at
traversing craggy cliff sides and ship riggings alike, they’re commonly
found along the western coast of Avistan, especially in Kalsgard and
Riddleport. Thanks to their hardiness and love of the sea, they travel
as far east as the Worldwound and as far south as the Shackles.
Ulfen Leapers hold paradoxical reputations, viewed either as brash,
pint-sized brawlers eager to outshine folks twice their size or as shifty
sneaks who vanish like footprints in a blizzard. In either case, it’s best
to look upwards, as these ysoki treat rooftops and ratlines like private
highways and often attack from above.
Ulfen Leapers often have the longsnout rat or snow rat (page 54) heritage.
Ratfolk Settlements
Ysoki congregate at trading cities and
crossroads of all kinds. In Avistan,
ratfolk are somewhat more prevalent
in Druma, the Five Kings Mountains,
and Taldor, as well as port cities like
Absalom and Riddleport. Others
carve out warrens far from human
settlements, such as Numeria’s
Chitterhome. Garundi ysoki congregate
in Katapesh and the Mana Wastes
(where they’re in demand as alchemists
and tinkerers), though many sail as far
as Thuvia, the Shackles, and Vidrian.
Ysoki dwell throughout Casmaron.
They are respected in Kelesh and
well established in the caravan city
of Ular Kel. Diguo-Dashu, the famous
“Empire of Rats,” sprawls below central
Tian Xia; however, ysoki also appear
throughout that continent’s Darklands,
especially in the recently reestablished
Second Ticker (page 54) and the
Deepmarket below Goka.

OthEr EthnicitiEs
Ratfolk have spread across the Grass Sea of Casmaron, particularly in Ular
Kel, where Sarki Tunnelers have established a large presence in (and under) the
districts devoted to trade, learning, and monstrous residents. Vudra has at least
three distinct ysoki lines—one of which, the Vradji Gnashers, produces some of
the best acrobats in the world. In southern Tian Xia, Minatan Skimmers spend so
long afloat their barge cities that many have never set a paw on dry land.
RATFOLK HERITAGES
Ratfolk prosper in nearly any Golarion environment—and even on other worlds.
The following heritages are available to ratfolk.
snOW rat
You have a thicker coat and bulkier frame to defend against the cold, granting
you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental
cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme,
extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
tunnEl rat
Your incredibly small bones allow you to easily compress your body and squeeze
through gaps. You gain the Quick Squeeze feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren’t
trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the Squeeze action
aren’t difficult terrain for you.
RATFOLK ANCESTRY
FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to ratfolk.
1ST LEVEL
SKULL CREEPER
FEAT 1
RATFOLK
You wear skulls to demoralize foes. You become trained in Intimidation and
gain the Intimidating Glare skill feat. If you’re already trained in Intimidation, you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you pay 50 gp for a splendid skull
mask, the mask grants you a +1 item bonus to Intimidation; its usage is worn (mask).
WARREN FRIEND
FEAT 1
DOWNTIME
RATFOLK
You’re adept at making contact with other ysoki. When you arrive at a new settlement,
you automatically find the nearest ratfolk enclave by spending 1 day of downtime
searching, provided one exists and its members aren’t actively hiding from you. Once
you’ve made contact, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
Gather Information and Earn Income in the settlement.
5TH LEVEL
CORNERED FURY
FEAT 5
RATFOLK
When physically outmatched, you fight with
unexpected ferocity. If a foe of a larger
size than you critically hits and
damages you, that foe is flat-footed
to you for 1 round.
GNAW [three-actions]

RATFOLK
Prerequisites Vicious Incisors (Advanced Player’s Guide 22)
Second Ticker
Five centuries ago, the sorceress Hao
Jin (Lost Omens Legends 46) thwarted a
ratfolk surface invasion by transporting
the ratfolk’s Darklands province to
her private demiplane. The demiplane
recently collapsed, returning the
sphere (now called Round Mountain)
to its former site—thankfully just after
Pathfinder agents had evacuated the
area (then known as Broken Ticker).
At first, the ysoki’s delight at their
reunification smoothed over the
upheaval caused by Round Mountain’s
return. However, the event diverted
nearby rivers and trade routes and
caused many Broken Ticker ratfolk to
lose their homes; the Round Mountain
ysoki must now readjust to a world
that forgot them; and Hao Jin is
reluctant to arbitrate. The united realm
of Second Ticker has thus become a
powder keg, with only the threat of
a nearby army of clockwork soldiers
keeping it from exploding.

With enough time and determination, you can chew through nearly anything. You deal
double your jaws damage to an unattended, inanimate object.
PLAGUE SNIFFER
FEAT 5
RATFOLK
Prerequisites longsnout rat heritage (Advanced Player’s Guide 21)
You can sniff out the pungent tang of disease. When you detect a creature by scent, you
can also detect if that creature is suffering from a disease at a non-carrier state. If the
disease is particularly subtle, you might need to attempt a Perception check against the
disease’s DC (subject to the GM’s discretion).
RATFOLK ROLL [two-actions]
FEAT 5
MOVE
RATFOLK
Your ability to curl up into a tight ball comes in handy. You roll up into a ball and move
up to four times your Speed in a straight line down an incline. If you reach the bottom of
the incline or hit an obstacle during this first turn of movement, you stop rolling safely.
Otherwise, you automatically keep rolling at this Speed during subsequent turns until
you hit the bottom of the incline or an obstacle ends this movement (which can happen
in the middle of your turn). You’re slowed 2 each turn after the first that you keep rolling,
and if you hit an obstacle on a turn after the first, you and the obstacle both take 4d6
bludgeoning damage and you stop rolling.
9TH LEVEL
UNCANNY CHEEKS
FEAT 9
RATFOLK
You squirrel away useful objects and seem
to retrieve them at just the right time.
You gain the Prescient Consumable
and Prescient Planner feats (Advanced
Player’s Guide 208), except that you
always withdraw the objects from your
cheek pouches. This means the object
you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk
unless you also have the Cheek Pouches feat (Advanced Player’s Guide 22).
13TH LEVEL
SHINSTABBER
FEAT 13
RATFOLK
Prerequisites Overcrowd (Advanced Player’s Guide 23)
You can dart around and between your larger allies’ legs without tripping them
up. As long as you’re Small or smaller, you can end your movement in the same
square as a Medium or larger ally. Only two creatures total can share the same
space when using this ability or a similar one.
SKITTERING SNEAK
FEAT 13
RATFOLK
You squish, slink, and skitter from cover to cover with great speed and
stealth. You can move up to your full Speed when you Sneak.
17TH LEVEL
RATFOLK GROWTH
FEAT 17
RATFOLK
You call upon the familial bonds you share with other ysoki to defend them in
battle. You can cast enlarge as a 6th-level primal innate spell once per day. You
can target only yourself and other ratfolk with this spell.
Ysoki of the Red Planet
To Golarion natives, Akiton appears
as a pink star winking in the evening
sky. The handful of explorers who’ve
gone there and returned tell of a
desert planet peopled by red-skinned
humanoids, four-armed giants, and—
most surprisingly of all—ysoki almost
identical to Golarion’s ratfolk, even
down to a shared common language.
These ysoki are expert traders as well
as superlative gadgeteers; while they
invent little themselves, they can
repair or reverse-engineer nearly any
sort of widget.

Tengu
56
Perhaps in reflection of their patron—the storm god Hei Feng—trouble and
turmoil has filled the recent history of the tengu people. The tengu spent
more than 400 years as a persecuted underclass of the empire of Lung Wa.
Many tengu fled from their ancestral homelands during this time, taking
boats to Arcadia or risking the deadly journey across the Crown of the
World in search of a better life. Even now, with Lung Wa 100 years gone
and the tengu homeland of Kwanlai regained, the tengu diaspora remains.
TENGU OF GOLARION
Established tengu enclaves tend to have long and storied histories behind
them, with proud legends, traditions, and social roles passed down from
generation to generation.
jinxfEathEr tEnGu
The most common tengu found in the Inner Sea region, jinxfeather
tengu eke out their living along the coast of Garund, often in fishing villages
around the Shackles. They descended from migrants who traveled from Tian
Xia for easily available work as sailors, dockworkers, and fishers. Garund
proved the most attractive for many tengu due to a curious superstition among
the sailors of the Shackles—that tengu eat and negate bad luck, making their
presence valuable on sailing ships. Many tengu found the role of “jinx eater”
on a sailing crew to be a relatively privileged position. Today, jinxfeather
tengu often play up this legend to increase their perceived worth, though this
practice has also led to tengu youths being kidnapped and press-ganged.
Jinxfeather tengu often have the jinxed or stormtossed tengu heritage.
kaWatEnGu
One of the rarest ethnicities of tengu, kawatengu focus much of their communal
efforts on isolationism. These river-dwelling people largely keep their presence
a secret from others; if not for their regular harassment of fishers and
traders in Lung Wa successor states, their existence might have remained
completely hidden. While generally misanthropic towards others,
kawatengu have been rumored to accept rare jobs as smugglers,
saboteurs, and assassins. Kawatengu are the most likely tengu to have
unusual feather colors or patterns, and many possess brown feathers or
white striped patterns throughout their black plumage.
Kawatengu often have the dogtooth tengu or wavediver tengu heritages
(page 57). They also commonly take the Mariner’s Fire ancestry feat.
kOnOha tEnGu
Konoha tengu reside in the Forest of Spirits in Tian
Xia. With smaller frames compared to most tengu,
they often tend towards simple clothing or none
at all. They commonly inhabit trees near water,
playfully snatching fish out of rivers, and their
kilns and forges provide the only trappings of
advanced technology. They express curiosity
and friendliness for those that simply wish
to pass through their homeland, but rapidly turn cold toward any who
seem interested in settling permanently or otherwise troubling the Forest
of Spirits. Konoha tengu are known to swarm and rip apart any oni who
trespass from Chu Ye, a habit that some scholars believe won tengu their
occasional resistance to curses.

PAGE 58
================================================================================

57
Konoha tengu often have the skyborn or taloned tengu heritage.
kWanlai tEnGu
The single largest concentration of tengu on Golarion resides in the nation
of Kwanlai, part of the ancestral homelands of the tengu people. Though
the citizens of Kwanlai take pride in their country and heritage, they’re
a people of strong passions and strong contradictions—some revere
beautiful shrines crammed in the forgotten back-alleys of ill-planned
slums, while others boast of beloved family heirlooms before gambling
them away in low-class dice halls. Few peoples can claim a stronger sense
of solidarity than the tengu of Kwanlai, however, who still cherish the
strength of community that helped them survive more than 400 years with
an uncertain future.
Kwanlai tengu have no strong inclinations toward any specific heritage.
takatEnGu
Residing among the tall mountain peaks of Minkai, takatengu
notably appear much taller and broader in stature than other
tengu. They highly value asceticism, martial prowess, and discipline.
These tengu typically prefer simple clothing in muted colors, often
matching the style of other Minkai ascetic groups. Takatengu tend to
focus on the elements of a simple life, centering their days around
farming, crafting, and training for combat. All tengu are responsible
for providing for the community; beyond that obligation, they can
focus on whatever art, craft, or combat style catches their fancy—so
long as they excel at it. Takatengu have a reputation for being some of
the finest warriors and swordsmiths on Golarion and take great pride
in this prestige, meaning tengu who can’t live up to these expectations
likely won’t thrive.
Takatengu often have the mountainkeeper or skyborn
tengu heritage. They also commonly take the Long-Nosed
FormAPG ancestry feat.
TENGU HERITAGES
The following heritages are available to tengu.
dOGtOOth tEnGu
In addition to a beak, your mouth also features a number of vicious, pointed
teeth. Some legends claim your powerful jaws can even bite through steel.
While you aren’t that strong yet, your fangs can still leave terrible wounds.
Your beak unarmed attack gains the deadly d8 trait.
WavEdivEr tEnGu
You’re one of the rare tengu who can cut through water like a bird through
air, and you often lurk in rivers or oceans where few expect you. You gain
a swim Speed of 15 feet.
ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to tengu.
1ST LEVEL
MARINER’S FIRE
FEAT 1
TENGU
You conjure uncanny orbs of spiritual flame that float above or below the
water’s surface. You can cast the produce flame cantrip as a primal innate
spell at will, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded
up. You can cast this cantrip underwater.
Tengu Settlements
The majority of tengu enclaves are
found either in the Tian Xia nation
of Kwanlai or on the continent
of Garund; Kwanlai is part of the
ancestral tengu homelands, while
tengu communities on the Garund
coast resulted from a troubling
combination of lucrative job
opportunities and kidnapping. Tengu
also have a sizable presence in the
nation of Minkai and the Forest of
Spirits, and scattered communities
dot much of northeast Tian Xia.

cast tengu magic. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a
replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous
fan falls apart into mundane feathers. Further feats might grant you
additional activations of your tengu feather fan, but you can never have
more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have.
The DC for spells you cast with your tengu feather fan is your class DC or
spell DC, whichever is higher.
You can cast the 1st-level gust of wind spell by activating your tengu
feather fan.
Activate Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect You cast one

Tengu Bottles
Tengu tend to have a healthy respect
for gods that rule over storms and
air—or at least, a healthy fear. One
ancestral custom that has caught on
among other sailors is the tengu bottle:
a decorated gourd or other container
filled with an offering for the gods,
kept on ships and thrown overboard
in the event of dire weather. Tengu
bottles most often contain fine alcohol
to appease the fury of Hei Feng or
Besmara; crew puncture the bottles to
release these offerings before throwing
them into the waters.

The Storm God’s People
While Hei Feng’s tempestuous
blessings mean that some tengu prefer
to pay the god lip service rather than

the Duke of Thunder’s love of loud
and colorful celebrations—holidays
dedicated to Hei Feng are nearly
universal, in even the most far-flung
communities. Likewise, many tengu
enclaves put little faith in the stability

Tiefling
60
When a trace of fiendish corruption worms its way into an unborn child, the
babe is born a tiefling, bearing certain uncanny traits. In popular imagination,
and often in actuality, this manifestation stems from some past liaison between
one of the child’s ancestors and some manner of fiend. For example, many
pitborn claim, accurately or not, to have a succubus in their family tree. Casting
fiendish magic, worshipping the lords of below, or signing a diabolic pact all
have the possibility of thus afflicting one’s descendants—though even less
common tiefling origins are also possible. Many beastbrood tieflings result
from a failed or partial rakshasa reincarnation, while the riftmarked simply
have the misfortune of being born too near a qlippoth runestone.
TIEFLINGS OF THE INNER SEA
Tieflings rarely have happy childhoods, as few places in Golarion welcome
the fiend-blooded. The luckiest tieflings possess easy-to-hide fiendish traits and
unusually understanding parents, yet they often still learn the importance of
constant secrecy and deceit. Less fortunate tieflings grow up as outcasts or get
shunned by their fearful families, left to live as street children and beggars.
Some tieflings never get a chance to grow up at all.
Tieflings tend to develop a wide range of coping strategies; most have a
strong cautious streak. Even the ones that grow up in loving families and
open-minded communities usually know that these are far from universal traits,
and so they tend to be prickly, suspicious, and slow to trust. Many tieflings
develop tricks to ward off hostility and suspicion from outsiders—they might
grow adept at hiding their nature, cultivate a repertoire of jokes and stories to
defuse situations, or simply develop psychological armor a foot thick.
On the other hand, those that do earn a tiefling’s loyalty find it nearly
unshakable. Tieflings know they can’t afford to waste precious relationships
in an oft-unfriendly world, and so cherish their friends and loved ones. A loyal
tiefling will cross deserts, scale mountains, and risk dragons for a friend. This
devotion isn’t always a good thing, though, as sometimes those inclined to
offer tieflings a warm smile and helping hand have cruel intentions or, unlike
most tieflings, have been outcast for very good and sensible reasons (such as
practicing demonology).
No matter their lineage, tieflings also tend to have more developed
philosophical viewpoints than most people. To a tiefling, good and evil aren’t
distant abstractions, but questions of immediate import. Can a demon’s child
truly be good? What does it mean to accept your devilish blood? Tieflings have
as much free will as any other person in Golarion, but they don’t always realize
it, and more than one tiefling has embraced or raged against their heritage out
of some sense of ironbound destiny.
Tieflings are among the most physically mutable of planar scions. Fiends
come in endlessly diverse shapes and forms, so when filtered through the quirks
of mortal blood, the results never cease to surprise. Certain traits appear more
commonly than others—a slim majority of tieflings have some combination of
horns, fangs, cloven hooves, tails, and oddly-colored (typically crimson) skin.
Each of these traits varies: a tiefling might have small forehead horns, great
curling ram horns, or wicked antlers like a mule deer. Their skin could have
blue lapis coloration or zebra-like stripes or serpentine scales. They might have
teeth like a wolf or a shark or a viper. Less common lineages have their
own markers. Riftmarked often bear strange birthmarks shaped
like script, while many beastbrood tieflings have inverted hands.
Ultimately though, no two tieflings ever quite have the same
physical quirks, not even siblings.

None of Golarion’s ancestries can claim complete freedom from fiendish
influence. Tiefling humans are perhaps the most prevalent and the most likely
to show the classic markers of horn, hoof, and tail. Tieflings are particularly
common in devil-worshipping Cheliax, where they’re still outcasts, but for
a different reason—rather than a forbidden evil, they’re viewed as symbols
of weakness in interactions with devils. To Chelaxians, a tiefling signals that
someone couldn’t control their diabolic powers or resist the machinations of a
devil, and often are thus pitied or held in contempt.
Tiefling goblins are also quite common, a consequence of the ancestry’s
frequent worship of Lamashtu. Tieflings in such communities often receive
great respect as symbols of divine favor and for their unusually sharp and
vicious teeth—sometimes multiple rows of them.
Other societies treat tieflings less kindly. Tiefling dwarves, usually notable for
their glowing eyes of crimson flame, are rarely appreciated by their kin.  For
example, the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion hide, smuggle away, and occasionally
even kill such tieflings at birth, believing that a tiefling symbolizes some great
crime or dereliction of duty on the part of the family as a whole.
Tiefling elves frequently have exceptionally long, delicate-looking horns, and
occasionally more than one set. They also possess vestigial wings more often
than other tieflings, though even among elves, winged tieflings remain quite
rare. The Mualijae elves of Garund are no more fond of tieflings than anyone
else, but they tend to take a more utilitarian approach to them; their society
encourages tieflings to become warriors and demon hunters, reasoning that
they couldn’t possibly become more corrupted than they already are.
Tieflings of halfling ancestry are most often found in Cheliax as well, but
where tiefling humans are pitied, tiefling halflings are considered threats to
the ruling class and often killed by the Church of Asmodeus. Other halfling
slaves have decidedly mixed feelings about their fiend-blooded kin, expressing
sympathy for their plight touched with horror for what they represent. Tiefling
halflings frequently have hooves and forked or unusually long tongues.
Tiefling gnomes aren’t particularly common since their ties to the First World
often serve as a sort of inoculation against fiendish corruption. When they do
appear, they’re frequently mistaken for fell gnomes, with whom they get along
quite well. Tiefling gnomes often have peculiarly elongated fingers, sometimes
with extra joints and claw-like nails—such tieflings have an iron grip, despite
the seeming fragility of their hands.
Many tieflings live transient lives, traveling in search of work and acceptance,
however temporary. Few people will go out of their way to harass a grown
tiefling, particularly one that has fangs or claws or worse, but smart tieflings
know that it’s only a matter of time before something gets blamed on the local
fiend-blood. Tieflings often gravitate to major cities as a result, seeking anonymity
in urban life, or else choose the wilderness over civilization altogether. Those
rare tieflings who actually find a community that wholeheartedly accepts them
defend their new homes with zealous ferocity.
ANCESTRY FEATS
The following ancestry feats are available to tieflings.
1ST LEVEL
BEASTBROOD
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
One of your ancestors was a rakshasa, the corrupt and aristocratic reincarnated
souls that call Golarion home. You have some dim echo of your ancestor’s memories—
enough to play the role of noble as needed, no matter your origins. You’re trained
in Society. If you’re already trained in Society (from your background or class, for
example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the
Courtly Graces skill feat.
Tiefling Adventurers
For many tieflings, becoming an
adventurer is a natural progression.
The typical tiefling already relies on
no one but themself or a few chosen
comrades, lives a semi-nomadic
existence to avoid trouble, and tends
to have very developed opinions on
good and evil and the necessity of
intervening on one side or the other.
Tieflings often grow up as outcasts,
and the charlatan, criminal, hermit,
nomad, and street urchin backgrounds
might fit, with unluckier tieflings
coming from the prisoner background.
Many tieflings become rogues or
bards as a means of survival, while
others access the powers of their
blood to become sorcerers. Some
become wizards, monks, or clerics in
an effort to gain mastery over their
fiendish corruption.

RIFTMARKED
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
Long ago, qlippoth marked someone in your lineage, most likely through their ancient
runestones that dot Golarion’s surface. Yours is an old lineage, primordial and twisted,
and you have a sense for similarly twisted things. You’re trained in Occultism. If you’re
already trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead
become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.
SHACKLEBORN
FEAT 1
LINEAGE
TIEFLING
Your lineage shows the signs of velstrac tampering, including some curious quirk
bequeathed by those shadowy surgeons of flesh and souls. Your flesh heals cleanly
and quickly—all the better for you to serve as a subject for their ghastly art. You gain
the Fast Recovery feat, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites.
5TH LEVEL
DEVIL IN PLAIN SIGHT [two-actions]
FEAT 5
CONCENTRATE
DIVINE
POLYMORPH
TIEFLING
TRANSMUTATION
You’ve learned to draw your fiendish nature into a small ball of corruption and hide it in
your soul. Your obviously fiendish traits disappear, including
any tails, horns, and cloven hooves, though hints remain
(claws turn into jagged nails or eyes retain an odd hue,
for instance). You’re still recognizably yourself, but now
appear as a typical, non-tiefling member of your base
ancestry. Using Devil in Plain Sight counts as creating
a disguise when using Deception to Impersonate, and
your transformation automatically defeats Perception
DCs to determine if you’re a normal member of your base ancestry; only creatures
actively rolling Perception to examine you might notice the disguise. While
in your shapeshifted form, you can’t use unarmed attacks, innate spells,
or other abilities that require physical features you receive from a
tiefling ancestry feat—for instance, you can’t use the Skillful TailAPG
feat. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and can shift
back to your tiefling form by using this action again.
DEVILISH WILES
FEAT 5
TIEFLING
Traditionally, fiends are exceptionally good at persuading people to do
things, even when their targets know it’s a bad idea. You’re also rather good
at it, compelling the weak and weak-willed to your bidding. You can cast
charm once per day as a 1st-level divine innate spell.
9TH LEVEL
QLIPPOTH MAGIC
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Riftmarked
You’ve deeply studied the secrets of your blood and can force reality to act against
its own wishes. You can cast blur and silence once per day each as 2nd-level
divine innate spells.
RAKSHASA MAGIC
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Beastbrood
You remember the secrets of your rakshasa forebears and know how to apply
those memories to get results. You can cast humanoid form and illusory
creature once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
Tiefling Settlements
Given the nature of fiends, tieflings
are among the most common of
planar scions, especially in areas
where demonic or diabolic corruption
is most powerful, such as in the
lands of the Sarkoris Scar or under
the rule of the Thrice-Damned House
of Thrune in Cheliax. In such places,
it’s not unheard of for a few dozen
tieflings to form their own small
community. These places tend to be
paranoid and precarious, sometimes
worryingly vulnerable to the cults of
dread gods or unholy fiends.

PAGE 64
================================================================================

63
VELSTRAC MAGIC
FEAT 9
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Shackleborn
You know there’s so much more to sensation than whips and chains—but whips
and chains also have their place. You can cast telekinetic maneuver and web once
per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells; in both cases, the spells manifest
shadowy chains rather than their usual visual signifiers.
13TH LEVEL
FINEST TRICK
FEAT 13
TIEFLING
Prerequisites Devil in Plain Sight
Many fiends—rakshasa rajas and demonic succubi most famously—can take on
the forms of others. With practice, you can do the same. When you use Devil in
Plain Sight, you can alter your appearance to match a generic member of your base
ancestry, rather than one that’s obviously you without your tieflings features. In
addition, you can imitate a specific person’s appearance (of any ancestry of the
same size and kind as your base
ancestry, typically a humanoid
for most ancestries) if you
consume a bit of their blood, a
lock of their hair, or appropriate
equivalents as part of the action.
You still must know what the creature
looks like, and you must be aware that the
consumed portion comes from their body.
17TH LEVEL
FINAL FORM [three-actions]
FEAT 17
CONCENTRATE
DIVINE
EVOCATION
MORPH
TIEFLING
TRANSMUTATION
Frequency once per day
You embrace your monstrous blood and make it your own,
screaming out to the heavens and hells alike in rage, pain,
and defiance. Reality buckles and twists under your sudden
power—each tiefling has a unique transformation, but it might
include sulfurous flames, choruses of shrieks, or twisting,
serpentine lightning. Every creature within 10 feet of
you is deafened and dazzled for 1 round unless they
succeed at a Fortitude save using your class DC or
spell DC, whichever is higher. Your final form has
the effects of divine vessel for a deity that shares
an alignment with your fiendish lineage. Your
final form resembles a creature from your
fiendish lineage, and you remain in that form
for 1 minute. While in your final form, you can
cast chilling darkness, fireball, and lightning bolt
as 6th-level divine innate spells, once each per use
of this feat.
When you emerge from your final form, you become
drained 3. In addition, if you have this feat, you gain weakness 10
to good even when not in your final form, and you take good damage even if
you aren’t evil.
Special At the GM’s discretion, the specific elements of this feat can be
adjusted to better fit the tiefling’s lineage—for example, a GM might decide
that a particular beastbrood tiefling could cast a 6th-level phantasmal
killer instead of fireball.
Abandoned by Faith
Few tieflings have positive relationships
with the faiths of good-aligned deities.
Sometimes this friction stems from
ignorance; experienced priests might
know to differentiate a tiefling from
a demon, but a random lay follower
might not. Sometimes it’s just a clash of
perspectives—tieflings are more likely
to have seen the kind of darkness that
makes holy idealism look laughable.
Other reasons stem not from divine
limitations but earthly ones, such as
overstretched churches failing tieflings
in need due to a lack of resources.
