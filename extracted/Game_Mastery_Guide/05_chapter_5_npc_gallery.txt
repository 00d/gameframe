CHAPTER 5: NPC GALLERY
Monsters and PCs aren’t the only inhabitants of your world. Though they might not be
heroes, NPCs can play various roles in your game, such as calling PCs to adventure, serving
as obstacles in social encounters, or opposing PCs in battle. This chapter presents almost a
hundred NPCs for your game, plus rules to modify them to fit any particular niche.

NPC ANCESTRY ADJUSTMENTS
To use one of the NPCs in this section to represent an NPC of a different ancestry, apply
the adjustments below for the desired ancestry. These provide the basic features from
that ancestry, like darkvision, altered Speed, and unique abilities like a halfling’s keen
eyes. For other ancestries, you can create similar templates following the same format.
In addition to these base changes, you can add the effects of a specific heritage: you
might apply the snow goblin heritage if your NPC is a Frostfur goblin and you want
them to have cold resistance. You can also give them an ancestry feat, or even adjust
their ability scores and skills to reflect the new ancestry’s strengths and weaknesses.
For a half-elf, half-orc, or any other heritage essential to the character, you
should always apply the heritage effect.
Dwarf
 • Change the human trait to dwarf.
 • Add Dwarven to the NPC’s languages.
 • Add darkvision.
 • Decrease the NPC’s Speed by 5 feet. If the NPC already has a reduced Speed due
to their armor, consider applying the Unburdened Iron ancestry feat.
Elf
 • Change the human trait to elf.
 • Add Elven to the NPC’s languages.
 • Add low-light vision.
 • Increase the NPC’s Speed by 5 feet.
GnomE
 • Change the human trait to gnome.
 • Add Gnomish and Sylvan to the NPC’s languages.
 • Add low-light vision.
Goblin
 • Change the human trait to goblin.
 • Add Goblin to the NPC’s languages.
 • Add darkvision.
HalflinG
 • Change the human trait to halfling.
 • Add Halfling to the NPC’s languages.
 • Add the keen eyes ability below.
KEEN EYES
Your eyes are sharp, allowing you to make out small details about concealed or even
invisible creatures that others might miss. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using
the Seek action to find hidden or undetected creatures within 30 feet of you. When you
target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the
flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.
MAKING A SPECIALIST
These NPCs contain several specialists, such as barristers and navigators, who are a
higher-level challenge at their specialty than in combat, and often have a special ability
related to it. To make your own specialists, you can easily switch out skills, but you
might want to use the following special abilities to make those NPCs more evocative!
Butter Up (emotion, mental) When someone eats a dish or treat made by this NPC, the NPC
can attempt a Baking Lore, Cooking Lore, or similar check against that creature’s Will DC,
with the same results as the Make an Impression action of Diplomacy. If more than one
creature partakes, the NPC uses the same check result against each creature’s Will DC.
ORGANIZATION AND
DEITY TEMPLATES
In addition to the templates in this
book, the Pathfinder Lost Omens
Character Guide presents theme
templates to quickly and easily make
these NPCs members of various
organizations (see Theme Templates
on page 116). If you’re looking
for adherents of a specific deity,
Pathfinder Lost Omens Gods & Magic
offers a theme template (see Theme
Templates on page 9) that allows you
to customize an NPC to fit any deity,
or a deity of your own creation!

COURTIERS
Though adventurers travel through perilous dungeons and across treacherous
wilderness, sometimes the most dangerous place they can end up is in a noble court.
NOBLE
Envied by many and detested by still others, nobles exude confidence and
gentility. Gossip and gambling are often nobles’ favorite pastimes. Day-to-day
life for a noble is often a mixture of business and leisure, and to an onlooker,
such a lifestyle can appear to be nothing more than a string of meals, parties,
and game halls. However, despite what some might believe, life as a noble is
often quite dangerous and requires far more intellect than it
would appear—along with a healthy dose of suspicion.

noble Strikes the target.
Sneak Attack The noble deals an extra 1d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures.
PALACE GUARD
Every palace has its gatekeepers. Often the younger offspring of minor nobility or
those from long lines of trusted staff, the palace guards are in charge of defending
the royal family and their inner stronghold. Their days consist of guarding
doorways, escorting nobles to various locations, and keeping those in their
charge as safe as possible. The statistics below are for the lowest rank-and-file
member of a small nation’s palace guards; they also work well for elite guards of
a lesser noble.

ADVISOR
Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance in the ears of
those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their counsel that they make few
decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events.
Advisors are often master manipulators, and their guidance can shape a barony or even
a kingdom—for good or ill.

SPY
No empire would be complete without its spies. The spy is a master of infiltrating
the court and blending in: they might be one of a number of nobles, a beloved
confidante of the queen, or even the court jester. Spies use their skills to subtly
manipulate courtiers, turn enemies against one another, and collect valuable
information either for blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder.

CRIMINALS
Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to
survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld
guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
GRAVE ROBBER
Many cultures have a tradition of burying their dead with a selection of the deceased’s
most precious possessions, and some include gifts that are thought to provide a boon
in the afterlife. Such valuables can be easy pickings for those with no respect for—or
fear of—the dead.

BANDIT
By setting ambushes and traps in concealing countryside, such as
forests and mountains, bandits waylay travelers and plunder their
valuables before disappearing back to their wilderness hideouts.
Many bandits seek only to steal and release their victims alive,
though a few prefer to leave no witnesses.

include sending fake collectors
for nonexistent charities to seek
donations for the diseased and
downtrodden; rigged games of
chance at local fairs offering
worthless prizes, and flashy
sideshows concealing the work of
pickpockets in the audience; and
plants who offer to help travelers
find accommodations but lead them
to inns with exorbitant prices.

creatures.
CHARLATAN
Charlatans use pretense and misdirection to swindle money and other valuables
from the credulous and confused. Selling snake oil (literally or figuratively),

They gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Underworld Lore checks when doing
so, and to Underworld Lore checks to determine whether an item was stolen,
whether a stolen item would be too recognizable to easily move, and who would be
interested in purchasing such an item.
FANTASY CRIMES
While many crimes in Pathfinder
are similar to crimes in the real
world, certain crimes are possible
only in a world of magic. These
include using magic to win a wager,
malicious uses of curses, violating
autonomy with enchantment
magic, falsifying divinations,
violating privacy with divinations,
or trespassing via teleportation.

PROTECTION MONEY
Criminal organizations often find it
easier to demand protection money
from locals than go to the trouble
of stealing it. “Protection” includes
an implicit assumption that those
who pay up are safe from those
criminals, and some also promise
retribution against other criminals.

Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church’s

Iomedae, Norgorber, Pharasma, Sarenrae, or Zon-Kuthon. They often ride a war horse
(Bestiary 209) wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.
SWAPPING DEITIES
Customize an acolyte or priest by
matching their deity’s alignment
and favored weapon, adding the
deity’s divine skill at +14 (or +7), and
swapping spells. An example appears
on the facing page. (An acolyte gains
only the 1st-level spells, domain spell,
and cantrips, and has two 1st-level
heal spells instead of three 3rd-level
heal spells.) If you swap harm spells
for heal, replace Healing Hands with
the Selective Energy cleric feat.

DOWNTRODDEN
Unfortunately, every society has people living on its fringes. While good communities
work to grant aid and respite to their downtrodden, sometimes—due to economic
downturn, famine, or war—the ranks of the less fortunate exceed the community’s
capacity to support them. In heartless neutral and evil societies, poverty is seen as
an inevitability that can never be truly eradicated, or even worse, as a tool to be
manipulated for political gain.
BEGGAR
Wherever there is poverty, there are beggars. Beggars are truly the downtrodden of
society—folks who have been cast out into the streets due to a variety of setbacks
or the weight of circumstance. Some beggars work for underworld organizations
as lookouts, spies, or even hired muscle on the cheap—sometimes by choice, but
often not.

COMMONER
Though not every commoner is downtrodden, many live hard lives of toil as
they work to keep their families fed and housed in
relative comfort. While many commoners are just
simple folks who keep to themselves, sometimes
commoners rebel, either rising up to face their
oppressors or persuaded or even duped into
joining nefarious plans and criminal conspiracies.
Commoners benefit from power in numbers, and a
crowd of commoners can accomplish a great deal more than their rulers
often expect.

each commoner gets a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletic checks to Shove,
attack rolls, and damage rolls.
BRAVING THE MOB
A mob is a violent crowd
(Core Rulebook 514) that works
as greater difficult terrain and
hazardous terrain, dealing 1d4
damage for each square entered. A
creature can spend a single action to
attempt a DC 16 Intimidation check,
clearing the mob from all squares
adjacent to them on a success
(or all squares within 10 feet on
a critical success). This action
has the concentrate, emotion,

Although their escapades might be notorious, few urchins are thrill-seekers. For some
urchins, when begging alone is not enough to fill their bellies, theft becomes a viable

while training them to become future pickpockets, burglars, and foot soldiers.

Pickpocket The urchin can Steal or Palm an Object that’s closely guarded without taking
the usual –5 penalty. They can Steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or
time-consuming to remove (like worn shoes, armor, or actively wielded objects).
PRISONER
Most who end up in a jail, dungeon, or prison are just biding their time until their
imprisonment ends, trying to find ways to make it through interminable days of
boredom and deprivation. Some, however, may use their time on the inside to
strengthen their criminal connections. Using force and intimidation to gain status
among other prisoners, they create makeshift weapons to take down their enemies
and give them an edge if escape becomes possible. Even for prisoners who don’t
become involved in the world of prison politics, learning to stand up for themselves
and projecting an air of toughness can become essential for survival in a place
where people have little left to lose.

can see and that can see them.
WORD ON THE STREET
Privy to all sorts of conversations
from passersby, the downtrodden
can provide eyes and ears on
the street. Finding a reliable
contact can give a character a
circumstance bonus to checks to
Gather Information if they return to
that source. This bonus is usually
+1, but could be +2 or +3 if the
contact lingers in a market where
influential politicians shop, sweeps
a noble estate, or the like.
Befriending NPCs in advance
can also help the heroes in action
scenes. A friendly urchin might
show a character a shortcut to
catch an escaping enemy, a crowd
of fans who frequent a bard’s
performances might throw rocks to
distract someone trying to fight the
bard, and so on.

FORESTERS
From the managed and cultivated forests that support villages to the tree-covered
crown lands where only nobles and their servants are permitted to hunt, forests
provide. To communities, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and raw materials,
while royally protected forests provide food for the nobles’ table and a source of
entertainment in the form of organized hunts. Even the ancient woods untouched
by mortal hand or blade provide bards with settings where legends happened and
could happen again. Many find the forest depths unsettling, but others live their
lives among the trees and alongside the creatures that make their homes there.
POACHER
Some forests are protected by kings, others only by wild things. Laws against
hunting may protect the private reserves of nobles or guard the viability of animal
populations of shared forests during specific seasons. Poachers violate those laws—
sometimes out of greed, sometimes out of desperation, and sometimes for sport.
Although penalties against poaching often include public shaming (see Penalties for
Poaching), in lean times a successful poacher is a local hero.

or a critical failure, they get a success instead. If the hunter rolls
a success, they can provide food for 4 additional creatures that
eat about as much as a human, or 8 creatures on a critical
success.
Snare Crafting The poacher can use the Crafting skill to create
the following snares: alarm snare, hampering snare, marking
snare, and signaling snare. The poacher can create four snares
each day without paying for the materials, using 3 Interact
actions to set up each snare.

Hunt Prey  (concentrate) The poacher designates a single
creature they can see and hear, or one they’re Tracking, as their
prey. The poacher gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception
checks to Seek the prey and to Survival checks to Track the prey.
The first time the poacher hits the designated prey in a round, they deal an
additional 1d8 precision damage. The poacher also ignores the penalty for making
ranged attacks within their second range increment. These effects last until the
poacher uses Hunt Prey again.
TRACKER
The forest offers dangerous creatures—whether they walk on four legs or two—a
place to hide. Dim light, low brush, and fallen leaves conspire to hide their
trails. Given these poor conditions, an unskilled eye might spot a sign or two
of a creature’s passing, but only a skilled tracker can identify several such
signs and discern their relationship to each other, connecting one to the next
PENALTIES FOR POACHING
Punishment for poaching on noble
land can be vicious. Maiming
poachers by removing fingers
is a common practice. Crueler
punishments include snaring
poachers in their own traps and
leaving them helpless, or binding
them in the bloody skins of their
catch and setting dogs to chase them
through the woods.

As is reflected in the many depictions of an elk-headed Erastil,
god of the hunt, the hunter is very much a creature of the forest,
known by the forest and familiar with every aspect of it. After all,

depends on who is able to make an ally of the terrain.

FAMED FORESTS
The Verduran Forest is the largest
woodland on the continent of
Avistan; the druids and rangers of
the Wildwood Lodge earned the
forest great autonomy through
a thousand-year treaty. The
Forest of Spirits stretches over
a thousand miles of Tian Xia and
is the primeval birthplace of the
nature spirits known as kami.
The Fangwood in Nirmathas
and the Gravelands is home to a
secret village of druids, named
Crystalhurst, and to one of the
most powerful green dragons in
the world. The terrible Darkblight
devastated the 7,000-year-old
fey court that once guarded the

healers know the science of anatomy and physiology better than the surgeon.
While their expertise is of grave importance in the medical world, the downside
is that when one is in need of their talents, it is likely the complaint is serious. In

Medical Malpractice  The surgeon attempts a Medicine check against the
Fortitude DC of one living creature they can see within 60 feet. On a
success, the surgeon’s melee Strikes deal an extra 1d6 precision damage
against that creature (2d6 on a critical success) until 1 minute passes or
the surgeon critically hits that creature, whichever comes first. Using
this action again designates a new target and ends the effect for any
previous target. A surgeon can target an individual creature no more
than once per day with this ability.
PLAGUE DOCTOR
These healers, often seen wearing distinctive masks and burning powders to
defend against airborne plagues, are as much feared as they are respected. To see
a plague doctor signals that disease has infested the land—and that it might have
already taken hold. Despite their devoted work in curing the untouchable, they are
sometimes treated with suspicion, as if they are somehow the cause of the plague.

MAGISTRATES
Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the
machine along under the inertia of the status quo.
JUDGE
These magistrates have the final say on the intent and spirit of the law. Properly
exercised, the duty of a judge is the strict adherence to the law regardless of station,
with minimal sentimentality toward rationalization and justification of why the
law was broken. Yet expectations and practice are not always the same thing. For
every unbiased justice, there is one who is zealously confident in their own agenda.
In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge.

TAX COLLECTOR
Ledgers and marks, positive and negative flows, and levies and
allotments are a tax collector’s daily bread. Where coin is gained, from
whom it is collected, and to whom is it disbursed are their main concerns;
the collector is unconcerned with whether the taxed can afford it or take a
loan to make up for any shortfall. However, tax collectors aren’t immune to
corruption: arrangements can be made, deals discussed, documents altered,
or coin misappropriated. When dealing with matters of taxes and finance,
the tax collector is a 3rd-level challenge.

There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows,

WARDEN
Wardens are the chief guardians of borders and frontiers. Whether they stand watch
over a single village or an entire region, wardens keep a vigilant eye out for outside
threats to their charges. Wardens are stalwart folk, often called to duty by Erastil to
protect those around them. Be it times of war or upon the frontier, wardens are often
the balanced edge of a blade between a community and the wilds at its fringes.

MERCENARIES
A broad category that includes those wielding arms, spells, or even guile and
cunning, mercenaries hire themselves and their expertise to those with the gold
to pay for it.
BODYGUARD
Hired to protect someone famous or powerful, bodyguards use intimidation,
quick wits, and martial skill to keep their charges safe. Such mercenaries might
be auxiliaries to a noble’s own guards, but with special directives to safeguard
their patrons.

and hear within 30 feet. That creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
as long as the bodyguard is adjacent to the chosen creature and can act; this
bonus lasts until the start of the bodyguard’s next turn.
MAGE FOR HIRE
Not all mercenaries sell brawn and intimidating glares. Some sell their
magical talents to earn a living. While there are many types of mages for
hire, some of the sneakiest are specialized in divination, using their skills
for infiltration and sabotage.

BOUNTY HUNTER
Bounty hunters are constantly on the move, whether within city walls or
the wilderness, trailing their fugitive quarries for capture… or disposal. Often
relying on stealth or deception as much as martial skill, bounty hunters employ
a vast array of talents to accomplish their goals, not to mention to collect
the hefty payout that follows.
BRIBING MERCENARIES
Unless a mercenary prides themself
on their name or reputation, the
PCs might be able to bribe them to
switch sides, or at least stand aside.
You can estimate a bribe by taking
roughly 5% of the Party Currency
value from the row corresponding

A harrow deck is a set of 54 cards with symbolic illustrations that serves as a
sacred divining tool. Feared by the superstitious and avoided by those who know
better than to tempt fate, harrow readers live and work in traveling communities,
often moving from town to town as opportunities arise. For encounters involving
social interaction, the harrow reader is a 3rd-level challenge.

After their frenzy, the cultist is fatigued.
FALSE PRIEST
Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to
great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against
someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest. Combining their gifts
of deception, a silver tongue, and an impeccable sense of timing, the false
priest can gain influence among the powerful, entice a mark to dispose of
all their possessions, and make a believer out of a cynic.

occurs first.

creatures. This increases to 2d6 against creatures flat-footed due to the
false priest’s Feint or deceiver’s surprise.

attempts a single Deception check against the highest Perception DC among the targets.
Critical Success The targets believe the lie and act as directed for 1 minute. Additionally,
one bystander remains by the cult leader’s side, influenced enough to join their sect.

Abyssal Temptation (divine, enchantment, mental) Demonic study has garnered
the attention of at least one demon that is actively trying to possess the
demonologist. When the demonologist publicly espouses the benefits of demonic
power (whether they believe it a good thing or not), they gain a +1 status bonus to
skill checks, AC, and saves for 1 day. These bonuses don’t apply against demons.
At the end of the day, the demonologist must attempt a DC 20 Will save,
becoming possessed for 1 day on a failure (permanently on a critical failure).

Breach the Abyss  Requirements The demonologist’s last action
was to cast a non-cantrip spell; Effect The demonologist siphons
energy drawn from the Abyss into their weapon. Until the end of the turn,
the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage. Roll 1d20 to determine the type:
1–7 acid, 8–9 cold, 10–11 electricity, 12–18 fire, 19–20 negative.
Demon Summoning The demonologist can cast a 5th-level summon fiend
arcane spell to summon a demon. To do so, they must sacrifice two
4th-level prepared spells and voluntarily take 4d12 mental damage that
can’t be reduced or prevented. If the demonologist is unable to Sustain the Spell,
including if they’re knocked out or killed, the spell continues, but the GM rolls
a DC 10 flat check each round, ending the spell on a failure.
DARK RITUALS
Most rituals have a simple gp cost
and skills. But what if a desperate
NPC is willing to offer something
darker, such as lives, souls, or
worse? Such a nefarious ritual uses
a normal ritual as a baseline,
but the DCs and proficiency
requirements might be
reduced or waived entirely, as
might any gp cost.

OFFICERS
Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce
laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral
and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect
this), imposing severe punishments on those who can’t pay for mercy.
BARRISTER
Barristers may serve as criminal prosecutors or as legal advocates, defending the rights

precedents is being argued.
GUARD
Guards are rank-and-file members of a town watch or city guard, trained to look
for trouble, take down criminals, and follow orders. They are a match for only the
most fledgling of adventurers and criminals, but, given time, the settlement can usually

leading a small team of lower-ranking guards, they patrol those areas to maintain
order and enforce laws. Watch officers get the job done, though their methods

INNKEEPER
The sight of an inn is a welcome one to any weary traveler. Innkeepers can often

SCHOLARS
True power comes from knowledge: the power to shape the growth of kingdoms
by mere whispers, staying three steps ahead of adversaries, or even knowing which
flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
LIBRARIAN
Keepers of knowledge, librarians document discoveries, events, and laws. The
best librarians record events twice; once for public record, and again to record
how events truly unfolded. A librarian typically knows four to six additional
languages, often including Elven and Draconic. A librarian is a 3rd-level challenge
for encounters involving research.

TEACHER
The passing of knowledge and traditions from generation to generation is a
time-honored occupation. Teachers exist to strengthen their populations with
literacy, history, and advanced sciences, but most of all with inspiration. Most
teachers provide general knowledge so their students are well rounded, but
some are experts or even masters of a single discipline. A teacher typically
knows three languages in addition to Common. For academic encounters, a
teacher is a 4th-level challenge.

Every settlement needs tradespeople to create new products, facilitate commerce,
and keep the infrastructure from crumbling. Larger cities often have entire guilds
dedicated to the creation of specific goods, managing worker conditions, and
working with local governments.
APPRENTICE
Ambitious apprentices can be found in all cities. These individuals are generally

Small settlements can typically support one or two generalist merchants,
and larger cities house multiple specialists—experts in one type of product.
Merchants can be found anywhere: vendors hustling in the public square,
shopkeepers running small storefronts, traveling salespeople in carriages or
caravans, or wealthy tycoons running entire organizations devoted to commerce.
For encounters involving negotiation or mercantile skill, a merchant is a 4th-

In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form
guilds to set standards of quality, establish common
prices, engage in collective bargaining with business
owners, and lobby local governments for favorable
laws. The guildmaster—often a master artisan in
their own right—also acts as an administrator and
politician, advocating for artisans in their trade. The

ANTIPALADIN
There is perhaps nothing more anathematic to peace than an antipaladin.
Dedicated holy warriors to the darkest and foulest of deities, antipaladins
work to fulfill the vile wishes of their evil masters. The zeal with which they
implement the plans of dark gods makes them truly fearsome foes for
anyone allied with the forces of good.

a willing undead creature, the target regains 18 Hit Points, and if it is one
of the antipaladin’s allies, it also gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls

SERVANTS OF DESTRUCTION
Antipaladins are the polar opposite
of paladins: chaotic evil warriors
devoted to destruction. Much like
champions of good, they must follow
a code. Their code exhorts evil and
prohibits selfless acts. Antipaladins
usually serve Lamashtu, Rovagug, or
demon lords. Many antipaladins used
to be champions of good and seek to
destroy their former faiths.

members. A gang of significant size
typically has a pyramid structure
so that only a few members report
directly to the boss and it’s harder
to link crimes directly to those in
charge if someone gets arrested.
