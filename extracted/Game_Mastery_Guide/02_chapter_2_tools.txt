CHAPTER 2: TOOLS
While the Core Rulebook provides all the tools you need to be a Game Master, you may
want resources to create original game content, whether it be new items, unique creatures,
or a sprawling new world for adventurers to explore.
This chapter provides a variety of tools to help you quickly and easily build
your own elements for your game, as well as some special types of rules you can
incorporate in your game, such as more hazards and strange magic items. This
chapter is organized into the following sections.
• Building Creatures (page 56) demonstrates a top-down approach for
quickly and easily constructing the creatures and NPCs you want or need
for any possible situation in your game.
• Building Hazards (page 74) gives rules and advice for creating your own
brand-new hazards.
• Building Items (page 82) teaches you how to create new pieces of treasure
to delight your PCs.
• Item Quirks (page 86) introduces simple but memorable quirks that you
can use to quickly personalize an item and make its nature seem just as
unique and exciting as its special abilities.
• Intelligent Items (page 88) includes rules for creating items with a mind of
their own that are characters in their own right, as well as several examples
to get you started.
• Cursed Items (page 90) examines items that have a nasty drawback or
might be altogether unpleasant. The section includes specific cursed items
and a list of curses you can add to an existing item, akin to a rune.
• Relics (page 94) are special magic items that increase in power along with
the PCs, and that you and your players work together to build and enhance.
• Artifacts (page 106) are the most powerful and story-rich magic items in
the game, and can only be destroyed in a specific way.
• Gems and Art Objects (page 114) expands the diversity of monetary awards
given to PCs and includes 100 sample art objects.
• Afflictions (page 116) provides a plethora of curses, diseases, and drugs for
use in your games, as well as drug and addiction rules useful in creating
your own afflictions.
• Building Worlds (page 122) explains how to go about building your own
entire world or setting from scratch. This section leads into the next three,
which provide tools to help you flesh out the finer details of specific parts
of your game world.
• Nations (page 130) includes a system to quickly encapsulate a nation in a
stat block that contains all the information you need.
• Settlements (page 132) covers everything from tiny villages to incredible
metropolises. The section explains the settlement’s role in a game and
provides a system to describe a settlement in a stat block with all the
important information.
• Planes (page 136) includes the various planar traits you can use to build
your own planes, and explores all the planes of reality in the Age of Lost
Omens setting as well.
It’s up to you to determine how much of your game you want to customize.
Many GMs use the default rules and creatures, and set their adventures on
Golarion or another published game world. Other GMs devise and incorporate
all-new creatures and places with strange themes that don’t fit in the standard
Pathfinder game or world. Unless you’re building your entire game world from
scratch, you can usually wait to implement any new rules creation until you
think you’ll need it for your next session.
BUILDING VERSUS MODIFYING
Many times, a small adjustment
to an existing creature, item,
adventure, or other part of the
game can serve you just as well
as building something brand new.
Before you delve into creating your
own new content, ask yourself
a few questions. First, does
something similar already exist?
When answering this question,
look beyond the surface level.
Maybe you want a 5th-level clawed
centipede creature that can make
Attacks of Opportunity and that
regenerates unless hit by acid or
fire damage. It might not look very
much like a troll on the surface, but
the statistics for a troll are going to
get you most or all the way there.
Ask yourself what you’ll need to
change between your idea and the
existing material. This will help you
decide between using the original
rule with minimal modification,
using the original with adjustments,
starting with the original as a
framework to build your own, or
just starting from scratch. Finally,
ask yourself how much time you
have to prepare the content, what
overall impact you expect it to
have in your campaign, and how
important any discrepancies from
existing material are to the core
concept. The less important an
element is to your game, or the less
time you’ll be using it at the table,
the more likely you should modify
something that already exists.

BUILDING CREATURES
Making your own creatures fleshes out your game world and lets you introduce concepts not yet
available in published products like the Bestiary volumes. These guidelines help you customize
creatures to your specifications and explore your imagination. From strange beasts to canny
political rivals, you have the power to design creatures that fit the narrative needs of your story.
Creatures aren’t built the same way PCs are. The rules for
building them are more flexible, and their statistics are
based on benchmark final numbers rather than combining
each individual modifier together. This is called top-down
design, in which you consider the design process as a
whole and select the details that reflect your intended
result, rather than building statistics from the bottom up
and hoping the finished creature matches your vision.
This guide provides a step-by-step process to build
creatures, but as you get more comfortable with creature
creation, you may prefer to use different methods. You
could start with one ability you think is cool, or you might
look to create a spellcaster of a certain type. There’s no
wrong starting place or wrong way to compile and present
your creation; some GMs prefer to generate a stat block
that is as similar to an official Bestiary entry as possible,
while others prefer to compile just a brief set of notes.
DEVELOP THE CONCEPT
To begin making a creature, you should first come up
with its concept. You likely already have the basic idea. As
you add details to the general idea, taking notes can help
keep your creature on track. Consider the parts of your
creature you find most compelling and that you want
to emphasize when the creature hits the table. For
example, in the Bestiary, demons are creatures of
sin, and are designed to have weaknesses against
specific virtues that oppose them. Harpies
enchant creatures by singing, represented by their
centerpiece ability, Captivating Song. Note your
creature’s core aspects, and if you feel uncertain
later, you can look back and ask yourself, “Does
this emphasize a core aspect or not?”
Next, look at the creature’s role in your game.
Is it meant to be a combatant? A social creature?
A trusted ally? Figuring this out will help you
determine whether to give it strong combat abilities
or to focus on skills, spells, and special abilities. Think about
how the creature might behave if it’s in a fight, if someone
tries to talk to it, or if it’s in a social situation. Does it work
better alone or with allies? What sort of character should be
best at facing it or be particularly weak against it?
Consider also the complexity of the creature. This
matters most when you plan to use a large number of
creatures of that type. If you’ll use five at the same time,
you’ll want their turns to move swiftly and avoid complex
special actions. A creature likely to face a group of PCs alone
can have more abilities, and it might need a more versatile
Gamemastery Guide

================================================================================

set of defenses against PC tactics. Cut complexity as much
as you can while retaining your desired theme.
Now, how do you want an encounter with this creature
to feel? Should it be scary? Mobile? Confusing? A mystical
duel or a knock-down, drag-out fight? What can you give
your creature to convey those characteristics? Note that
much of this feel will come from your choice of the creature’s
special abilities or spells, rather than its raw numbers.
With all this in mind, think about the specific abilities
your creature should have. Take a few notes now, and get
to the details later. You can use abilities from the Bestiary
or feats in the Core Rulebook, adjusting as needed, to save
yourself time. It helps to think of a creature that’s similar to
yours and see what makes it tick—and what you can steal
from it. Maybe you can just reskin that creature (page 58),
instead of making a new one from scratch.
Now that you understand your creature’s concept, it’s
time to get to the statistics. Remember that you can always
change your concept later on. Your creation might evolve
and transform as you go, so be open to change and revisions.
UNDERSTANDING AND
CHOOSING STATISTICS
Most of the statistics in this section use a scale of extreme,
high, moderate, and low—some use terrible values as well.
Extreme: The creature is world class in this statistic
and can challenge almost any character. Most creatures
have no extreme statistics or only one extreme statistic,
although some creatures might have additional extreme
statistics and weaker related statistics elsewhere (a
common example being a creature trading accuracy for
extreme damage). Examples from the Bestiary include the
succubus’s Diplomacy and the lich’s spell DC.
High: Extremely capable but not world class, the
creature presents a challenge for most characters. Just
about all creatures have at least one high value. Most
combat-focused creatures have high AC and either a high
attack bonus and high damage, or a merely moderate
attack bonus but extreme damage. An ogre warrior’s
attack bonus and a kobold scout’s Stealth are high values.
Moderate: A middle-of-the road statistic can cover
anything unremarkable about the creature. Use this
one often.
Low: The creature is actively bad at this. Choose these
intentionally to represent the creature’s weak points.
Most creatures should have at least one low statistic; an
example is the goblin pyro’s Will save.
Terrible: Some statistics can dip even lower than low,
to terrible. This indicates a truly awful statistic that
still isn’t game-breakingly bad. A spider’s Intelligence is
terrible, as is a dero stalker’s Will save.
PUSH AND PULL
When it comes to statistics, a creature should be balanced
overall. That means if you’re giving a creature an extreme
statistic, it should have some low or terrible statistics to
compensate. For example, if you were making a creature
extremely hard to hit by giving it an extreme AC, you’d
likely give it lower saving throws or low HP. If a creature
is great at spellcasting, it might need several low statistics
to be a balanced challenge. There’s no perfect system for
making these decisions. If you’ve made a creature that has
four high stats and nothing low, or vice-versa, take another
look. A creature’s strengths and weaknesses change the
PCs’ strategies for dealing with it, and that’s what makes
playing the game fun!
This section details the creature-building process using the
following steps.
1. Develop the Concept (page 56) Think about your creature,
and make notes you can use in future steps.
2. Build the Stat Block Pick all the statistics for the creatures,
going through the list below.
Level (page 58)
Alignment, Size, and Traits (page 58)
Ability Modifiers (page 59)
Perception and Senses (page 60)
Languages (page 60)

AC (page 61)
Saving Throws (page 62)
Hit Points (page 62)
Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances (page 63)
Speed (page 64)
Strikes, including their damage (page 64)
Spells, if necessary (page 65)
3. Design Abilities (page 67) Create the special abilities your
creature can use.
4. Review Holistically (page 69) Step back, take stock of
your creature as a whole, and tweak as needed.
TRAIT ABILITIES (PAGE 70)
This section provides the abilities conveyed by certain traits,
such as demon, dragon, and undead. You’ll also find abilities
typical of creatures with those traits to help guide you as
you plan your creatures.
DESIGNING NPCS (PAGE 72)
Sometimes you’ll design a creature that’s meant to have
abilities or characteristics similar to those of a PC. Maybe
you need a bold champion, a sly rogue master criminal, or
a wizened druid elder for your game. You also might need
a common baker, who has little combat ability but great
skill with dough and an oven. This section provides ways
you might modify aspects of the creature-building process
to fit those needs.

================================================================================

EXTREME INCREASES
At the higher levels of the game, PCs have more tools at
their disposal, so the creatures they face need to hit back
harder! At higher levels, give each creature more extreme
statistics. Having one extreme statistic becomes typical
around 11th level. A creature of 15th level or higher
typically has two extreme statistics, and one of 20th level
or higher should have three or four. Keep in mind that these
should be relevant to the encounters you expect them to
have—extreme social skills aren’t much use to a combat-
focused creature. Be careful about giving multiple extreme
statistics that are closely linked: a creature with extreme
damage and Fortitude saves is one thing, but having an
extreme attack bonus and extreme damage allows the
creature to apply both extreme statistics to each attack.
LEVEL
For most creatures you build, their level depends on the level
of the party who will encounter it. Look at other creatures
you think are similar in power to yours to determine its
level. Note that level represents a creature’s combat ability,
so a creature that’s more social might have, for example,
3rd-level combat statistics and 6th-level skills but remain
a 3rd-level creature. Most such creatures are NPCs; for
more information on this distinction and how to use it, see
Non-Combat Level on page 72.
Some abilities are hard for PCs to deal with at low
levels. For instance, creatures that can fly and have ranged
attacks should typically appear around 7th level, when
PCs gain access to flight. Natural invisibility or at-will
invisibility as an innate spell should come at around 6th
level, when PCs are more likely to prepare see invisibility
in lower-level spell slots, or 8th level, when some PCs get
the Blind-Fight feat.
The tables in this chapter go up to 24th level—the
highest-level extreme encounter a party might face.
ALIGNMENT, SIZE, AND
TRAITS
Fill out the trait line of your creature’s stat block. The
alignment can be whatever suits your story, though some
types of creatures must be or tend to be certain alignments.
Creatures can be whatever size you need them to be,
though you seldom find Large creatures below 1st level,
Huge creatures below 5th level, or Gargantuan creatures
below 10th level. Generally, you don’t automatically
adjust statistics for size, except for an exception to
Strength modifiers for Large and bigger creatures, which
you’ll find in Ability Modifiers on the next page.
Your creature will almost certainly have one of the
following traits to define its type: aberration, animal, astral,
beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, ethereal, fey,
fiend, fungus, giant, humanoid, monitor, ooze, plant, or
undead. If you’re making a creature from an existing
category of a type, such as demon, it also has
that category as a trait. Creatures with a close
RESKINNING A CREATURE
Sometimes you need a creature with abilities that are almost
exactly the same as those of a published creature. In that case,
it can be more efficient to simply “reskin” the old creature
rather than design a new one—that is, to change the description
but keep the abilities mostly the same. Occasionally reskinning
requires small mechanical adjustments. For instance, a fire cat
that has immunity to fire, an aura that deals fire damage, and
the ability to light people on fire with its jaws to deal persistent
fire damage could be reskinned as a caustic animate tree that
has immunity to acid, an aura that deals acid damage, and
branch attacks that smear acidic sap on a creature’s body
when they hit, dealing persistent acid damage.
Gamemastery Guide

================================================================================

affinity to elements—air, earth, fire, and water—or types of
energy—like acid, cold, and electricity—have those traits.
Some abilities typical of creatures with the traits listed
above can be found in Trait Abilities on page 70. As with
the other steps, looking at similar creatures will give you
an idea of what traits to use.
Add any traits that have detailed rules attached to
them, like amphibious, aquatic, incorporeal, mindless, and
swarm. You can add traits related to the creature category,
such as dinosaur or werecreature, but most of these traits
are pretty self-evident in play. If at any point you realize
during play that you didn’t add a trait the creature really
should have, you can usually apply it retroactively.
ABILITY MODIFIERS
Next, figure out your creature’s ability modifiers, since
these will suggest what their other statistics should be.
You don’t have to determine the exact numbers, but it’s
good to avoid creating creatures whose ability modifiers
are at odds with their abilities, like creatures with a terrible
Wisdom modifier and very high Perception. Most of the
time, you’ll just be using ability modifiers for untrained
skills, so they’re useful as a guide but not crucial.
Table 2–1 shows some benchmarks for your creatures.
Use high for the creature’s best ability modifiers,
moderate for ones they’re okay at, and low for the rest.
If a creature has a truly bad ability, you can go as low
as –5. That’s the terrible range for ability modifiers, and
doesn’t really change by level. This is most common with
animals, which have an Intelligence modifier of –4 (for
dogs, dolphins, and such) or –5 (for more instinctual
animals like spiders), and for mindless creatures, which
have a –5 Intelligence modifier.
Few creatures use the extreme column. A powerful,
dedicated spellcaster might use an extreme spellcasting
statistic, or a preternaturally charming creature like a
succubus or nymph might have an extreme Charisma
modifier. However, the most common way extreme
numbers are used is for really big, really strong creatures.
This happens with only Large or larger creatures from
1st to 5th level, only Huge or larger creatures from 6th
to 9th level, and only Gargantuan creatures from 10th to
15th level. Beyond that level, a creature doesn’t gain an
extreme Strength modifier from size alone.

BASE ROAD MAPS
You can use the following suggestions to set the baseline when
creating your road map. For example, use brute for a big, tough
creature like an ogre, and skirmisher for a darting enemy. Each
entry is a starting point you can customize as you see fit. Any
core statistic that isn’t listed should typically use moderate
numbers. You can set ability modifiers and add additional
abilities as needed. To make a creature that resembles a
character of a certain class, see Class Road maps on page 73.
Brute low Perception; high or extreme Str modifier, high
to moderate Con modifier, low or lower Dex and mental
modifiers; moderate or low AC; high Fortitude, low Reflex or
Will or both; high HP; high attack bonus and high damage
or moderate attack bonus and extreme damage
Magical Striker high attack and high damage; moderate
to high spell DCs; either a scattering of innate spells or
prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature’s
level (rounded up) minus 1
Skill Paragon high or extreme ability modifier matching
its best skills; typically high Reflex or Will and low
Fortitude; many skills at moderate or high and potentially
one or two extreme skills; at least one special ability to use
the creature’s skills in combat
Skirmisher high Dex modifier; low Fortitude, high Reflex;
higher Speed than typical
Sniper high Perception; high Dex modifier; low Fortitude,
high Reflex; moderate to low HP; ranged Strikes have high
attack bonus and damage or moderate attack bonus and
extreme damage (melee Strikes are weaker)
Soldier high Str modifier; high to extreme AC; high
Fortitude; high attack bonus and high damage; Attack of
Opportunity or other tactical abilities
Spellcaster high or extreme modifier for the corresponding
mental ability; low Fortitude, high Will; low HP; low attack
bonus and moderate or low damage; high or extreme spell
DCs; prepared or spontaneous spells up to half the creature’s
level (rounded up)

================================================================================

PERCEPTION
Perception is a fairly straightforward statistic. Use Wisdom
as a guide for setting it, and adjust to the high side if your
creature has acute senses or extra training. If your creature
has low Wisdom, for example, it would probably have a
low Perception modifier, or moderate if it’s supposed to
be a great hunter. Don’t make your creature’s Perception
higher just because it’s often used for initiative; creatures
with poor Perception could use a skill check for initiative
instead, such as Stealth.
SENSES
Choose or design any special senses for your creature, such
as low-light vision, darkvision, or scent. If you’re making
a sense from scratch, simply decide what it senses, whether
it has a range limit, and whether it’s precise or imprecise.
For example, a sinspawn (Bestiary 297) has “sin scent
(imprecise) 30 feet.” This means it can smell creatures
bearing its associated sin if they’re within 30 feet, and the
sense is imprecise—about as acute as human hearing.

LANGUAGES
Think about what languages the creature would need
to communicate with other creatures in its home. For
instance, many intelligent undead speak Necril, and many
creatures from the Darklands speak Undercommon. If you
want your creature to be able to speak to the PCs, be sure
it has Common; for a creature with no reason to speak the
common tongue of your setting (such as most extraplanar
creatures in a typical campaign), be sure it doesn’t. Some
creatures can understand language but can’t vocalize; in this
case, you can state that they can’t speak any language. For
creatures that need to be able to infiltrate and communicate
wherever they go, you might give them tongues or a similar
ability as a constant innate spell.
SKILLS
You have lots of flexibility in setting your creature’s skills.
Pick some skills you think are appropriate, and consider
how good the creature is at them. High skills are roughly
on par with a specialized PC of the creature’s level, though
they could be a little lower or higher. Most creatures have
at least one high skill, but no more than three. The best
skills should go with the best ability modifiers, and you
might even want to estimate the creature’s proficiency rank
for these skills. Some skills can get a high bonus for free to
fit the creature’s theme, particularly Lore skills.
CONVERTING FIRST EDITION CREATURES
If you’re converting creatures from First Edition, you won’t
find a direct numerical conversion. Instead, use the original
statistics to create your road map, giving a better AC to a
creature that had a good AC in First Edition, and so on.
Here are the main areas of difference that you’ll want to
keep in mind for your conversion.
• Ability modifiers scale differently, so don’t copy them over
exactly. The highest modifiers tend not to get as high in
Second Edition. You’ll rarely see a +10 Strength modifier,
for example. Creatures also tend to get better low
statistics at higher levels than they used to, particularly
for Dexterity and Wisdom. This is most evident in
high-level First Edition creatures with awful Dexterity.
• Low-Intelligence creatures, particularly animals, tend to
have more special actions than they would have in First
Edition. This is to make encounters with them more
dynamic and distinct. Compare dinosaurs between the
editions for good examples.
• When converting spell-like abilities to innate spells, you
might need to make some substitutions. Some spells will
appear as heightened versions of spells (such as greater
dispel magic now being heightened dispel magic), but
others will require you to find something different. Also,
don’t feel like you need to keep every spell; focus on the
most thematic and potent ones. The Spells section on
page 65 has more advice on this subject.
• Damage reduction has been replaced with two options:
resistance to all damage (possibly with exceptions), or
more HP and a weakness. Immunities, Weaknesses, and
Resistances on page 63 describes the distinction.
• If you want to convert spell resistance, you can give the
creature a +1 status bonus to all saves against magic, or
+2 if it had abnormally high spell resistance for its level.

================================================================================

Most creatures don’t have an extreme skill unless
they are world class for their level, like a succubus’s
Diplomacy. Having an extreme skill is less impactful than
an extreme AC or attack bonus, but still might warrant a
sacrifice elsewhere, especially if the creature also has more
high skills than usual. There’s no need for terrible skill
modifiers, since an untrained skill usually represents that.

SPECIAL MODIFIERS
You can also add special, thematic modifiers for certain
skill uses. For instance, you might give a creature that
secretes adhesive “Athletics +7 (+9 to Climb or Grab).”
This special bonus should still remain at or below the
extreme number, especially if it has a combat purpose like
the Grab bonus above.
ITEMS
If you gave a creature gear equivalent to a PC, your PCs
would gain a huge amount of treasure by defeating a
large group of them. Using Table 2–4: Safe Items can help
you avoid that. A creature can have a single permanent
item of the listed level without issue. For example, if
a 6th-level creature has a +1 weapon, that item’s not
worth so much that the PCs would be massively rich if
they encountered many creatures of that type and sold
everything they found. You can give a creature several
lower-level items too. Just pay attention to your overall
treasure as measured against the guidelines on pages
508–510 of the Core Rulebook. At the lowest levels, a
creature can certainly have multiple level 0 items, even
though normally a creature should have only one item of
the level listed in the Safe Item Level column.
Specific creatures or NPCs have more leeway to break
these guidelines because you can plan the rest of your
adventure’s loot around them. Also, giving a boss villain
a powerful magic item makes the fight and its aftermath
more interesting.

ARMOR CLASS
Because AC is one of the most important combat stats,
you need to be more careful with setting this number
for any creature you expect will end up in a fight. Low
AC typically fits spellcasters, who compensate with their
IMPROVISING A CREATURE
As you get more experienced, you might find that you don’t
need to build some creatures in advance. In many cases,
especially for simple creatures, you can just select values from
the relevant tables on the fly and track its HP. When you do,
track which value you used as it came up. For instance, let’s
say you’re improvising a 2nd-level kobold soldier. When it’s
time for initiative, you decide it has moderate Perception and
jot down “Per +8.” Your group’s fighter beats it at initiative and
attacks. You decide the soldier has high AC—looking at Table
2–5, you see that’s 18—and add this information to your note.
The fighter’s Strike hits, and you select the low end of high HP:
36. Well, now it’s 25. Your note says “Per +8, AC 18, HP 25.” If
it gets to take a turn, you can give it a Strike then.

selection of powerful spells. Most creatures use high or
moderate AC—high is comparable to what a PC fighter
would have. Reserve extreme AC for a creature that is even
better defended; these values are for creatures that have
defenses similar in power to those of a champion or monk.

COMPENSATING WITH HP AND SAVES
You might adjust your creature’s HP, AC, and saves in
tandem. Almost no creature has great defenses in all areas,
as such creatures often result in frustrating fights. A creature
with higher AC might have fewer HP and weaker saves,
and one that’s easy to hit could have more HP and a strong
Fortitude to compensate. This depends on the theme of the
creature. An extreme AC might mean reducing the creature’s
HP to the next lowest category, or reducing its HP by a
smaller amount and making another reduction elsewhere.
SAVING THROWS
You can often set saves quickly by assigning one high, one
moderate, and one low modifier. Some creatures might vary
from this, either because they have poor AC but better saves
or because they should thematically have multiple good
saves and compensate elsewhere. You have more flexibility
with saves, and having one save off the listed number by 1
is rarely a big deal. Pay attention to the creature’s Con, Dex,
and Wis modifiers—these don’t have to correspond to the
creature’s saves exactly, but should inform your choices.
Extreme saves often pair with extreme or high ability
modifiers. Almost no creature should have more than one
extreme save, even at high levels. Assign terrible saves to
creatures that have a clear weak point—for example, a
nearly immobile creature would have a terrible Reflex save.

HIT POINTS
Give a creature HP in the moderate range unless its theme
strongly suggests it should use another range. Spellcasters,
for example, often have low HP. Brutish creatures usually
have high HP, compensating with lower AC, weaker saves,
few tactical options, or other limitations. As mentioned in
the Armor Class section above, you don’t want a creature
with extreme AC to have high HP too.
Hit Points are closely tied in with immunities,
weaknesses, and resistances, so if your creature has any of
those, look at that section before finalizing HP (page 63).
REGENERATION AND HEALING ABILITIES
Your creature might have regeneration, fast healing, or
some other ability to heal itself. These healing abilities
can greatly affect the flow of a fight. Regeneration or fast
healing heals some number of hits each round—usually
one to one and a half hits. To determine the number of Hit
Points it should restore, look at the high damage value on
Table 2–10: Strike Damage (page 65) and multiply that
value by the number of hits healed. For instance, if the
Gamemastery Guide
62
62

PAGE 64
================================================================================

high damage is 20, regeneration between 20 to 30 makes
sense. The value should be higher if the regeneration is easy
to overcome—and remember that most regeneration gets
easier to overcome at higher levels. Also, you might want to
decrease the creature’s total HP by double its regeneration
value. Fast healing follows the same rules, but because it
can’t prevent a creature’s death and there isn’t always have
a way to deactivate it, you might want to give the creature
more HP instead of fast healing to keep things simple.
If a creature can use an ability that heals it, that ability
typically restores more HP since it costs actions. An at-will
healing ability should be based on a heal spell 2 levels
lower than the highest-level spell a creature of that level
could ordinarily cast (for example, an 11th-level creature
can typically cast up to 6th-level spells, so you would base
its healing ability on a 4th-level heal spell). If the ability
both deals damage and heals, use that same baseline scale
from above but with vampiric touch instead of heal.

IMMUNITIES,
WEAKNESSES, AND
RESISTANCES
If it’s highly thematic for a creature to have an immunity,
weakness, or resistance, consider adding it. Table 2–8 lists
the ranges for weaknesses and resistances by level.
Immunities are generally reserved for creatures made
of an unusual substance (like a fire elemental being
immune to fire). You can also give an immunity if a
creature’s biology or construction would logically cause
it to be unaffected (like a mindless creature’s immunity
to mental effects).
If the creature should be hard to affect with something
but the conditions above aren’t true, give it a resistance
instead. For instance, a giant octopus isn’t actually made
of cold water, so it wouldn’t be immune to cold, but its
life in the ocean depths make it resistant to cold. You’ll
typically use the lower end of the value on Table 2–8 for
a broad resistance that applies to a wide range of effects,
like “physical 5 (except silver)” and the higher end for
something narrower, like a single damage type. A creature
with a resistance, especially a broad resistance or a physical
resistance, usually has fewer HP.
Giving your creature a weakness adds flavor to it and
greatly rewards effective player tactics once your players
identify the weakness. The weakness should apply to one
damage type or phenomenon and use the high end of the
scale. Creatures typically have at most one weakness. If a
creature has a weakness, especially to something common,
give it additional HP. The amount of additional HP might
depend on how tough the creature should feel if the PCs
don’t exploit its weakness; a tough creature might have
additional HP equal to quadruple the weakness value.
A creature with a hard-to-exploit weakness might have
additional HP equal to the weakness value or less.

PAGE 65
================================================================================

The combination of more HP and a weakness has a
different feel from standard HP with resistances. If the
creature being an impervious tank really fits its theme, use
a resistance with an exception, such as “physical 5 (except
silver).” If, however, it makes more sense for normal hits
to get through and the creature to simply have great
staying power, use more HP and a weakness. Skeletons
and zombies are a good example of the difference between
these styles. Skeletons have resistances because they’re
bony and hard to hurt. Zombies, on the other hand, have
more HP and a weakness to slashing damage—they’re
tougher, but their bodies aren’t built to deflect weapon
attacks, and slashing attacks can rip them up quickly.
SPEED
Your creature’s Speed should be 25 feet if it moves like a
human. Beyond that, you can set the Speed to whatever
makes sense. Remember that the creature can move up to
triple this number if it spends its whole turn moving, so
if you want the PCs to be able to chase the creature, its
Speed can be only so high. Creatures at higher levels need
ways to deal with flying PCs, speedy PCs, and PCs with
more efficient actions that let them engage and retreat
more easily. This might mean adding a fly Speed, giving
the creature ranged attacks, and so forth.
Creatures can have climb and swim Speeds even at
low levels. While you can give your creature a fly Speed
at those low levels, it’s better to wait until around 7th
level (when PCs gain access to fly) to give your creature a
fly Speed if it also has ranged attacks or another way to
harry the PCs from a distance indefinitely.
STRIKES
When building your creature’s selection of Strikes, use
the following sections to set the Strike’s attack bonus
and damage. Give the attack all the normal traits if it’s a
weapon; for unarmed attacks or weapons you invent, give
whatever traits you feel are appropriate. Note that these
traits might influence the damage you give the Strike.
You might want to make sure a creature has an unarmed
attack if you think it’s likely to get disarmed. At 7th level
and higher, PCs might have the ability to fly, which makes
it more important for creatures to have decent ranged
Strikes to make sure they aren’t totally hopeless against
flying PCs (though they could instead have fast fly Speeds
or something similar).
STRIKE ATTACK BONUS
Use a high attack bonus for combat creatures—fighter
types—that also usually have high damage. A creature
could have a higher attack bonus and lower damage, or
vice versa (for instance, a moderate attack bonus and
extreme damage might fit a creature that’s more like a
barbarian), instead of having a poor statistic in another
category. Spellcasters typically have poor attack bonuses,
potentially in exchange for extreme spell DCs.

STRIKE DAMAGE
Table 2–10 on the next page gives the damage a creature
should deal with a single Strike. You might use a lower
category if the creature has better accuracy, or a higher
category if its accuracy is lower.
A creature that’s meant to be primarily a combat threat
uses high damage for its melee Strikes, or moderate for
melee Strikes that have the agile trait. Ranged attacks
more typically use the moderate value, or even low. A
creature that’s meant to be highly damaging uses the
extreme damage values, but might then have a moderate
attack bonus. As with most statistics, extreme damage is
more likely at higher levels. You can also use the extreme
value for special attacks that the creature can use only
a limited number of times or under circumstances that
aren’t likely to happen every round.
More versatile creatures, such as ones that can cast
some spells and aren’t meant to primarily get their damage
through Strikes, go one category lower: moderate for
their main melee Strikes, low for agile and ranged Strikes.
Spellcasters and other creatures that aren’t meant to be
competent in a direct fight might use the low damage value,
or even less if they completely don’t care about their Strikes.
On Table 2–10, you’ll find a damage expression (a die
roll or rolls plus a flat modifier) you can use as is, or you
can take the damage in parentheses and build your own
damage expression to hit that number. If you do the latter,
Gamemastery Guide
64
64

PAGE 66
================================================================================

remember that a d4 counts as 2.5 damage, a d6 as 3.5, a
d8 as 4.5, a d10 as 5.5, and a d12 as 6.5. Usually a damage
expression works best when roughly half the damage is
from dice and half is from the flat modifier. If your creature
deals special damage, like 1d6 fire from flaming attacks,
that counts toward its total damage per Strike. Keep in
mind that a creature using a weapon should have a damage
value that feels right for that weapon. Extreme damage
works well for two-handed weapons that uses d10s or d12s
for damage. On the other hand, a dagger uses only d4s, so
a dagger wielder would need something like sneak attack
to deal extreme damage, or you might compensate for the
dagger’s lower damage per Strike by giving the creature the
ability to attack more efficiently or use other tricks.

SPELLS
Your creature might have magical abilities that are
best represented by spells. If you’re making a highly
spellcasting-themed creature, give it prepared or
spontaneous spells. For a creature that has spells due
to its magical nature, especially if that magic isn’t its
core focus, consider giving it some innate spells instead.
How many spells you should give a creature depends on
how you expect it to spend its actions in combat. If it’s
primarily going to be making Strikes, it might not have
any spells, or it might just have a few to help it move
around better or protect against certain types of magic.
When choosing spells, lean hard into the creature’s
theme. While many PCs choose spells to cover a wide
variety of situations, creatures are more evocative the more
focused they are. Consider selecting about three-quarters
of the spells based on relevance to the theme and the
remainder for other things. However, make sure the spells
aren’t one note—selecting fireball for most of a creature’s
spell slots doesn’t make for a compelling fire creature in the
way a diverse selection of fire spells would.
When choosing spells, some spells won’t be very
useful if cast at an extremely low level compared to the
creature’s levels. Most notably, damaging spells drop off
in usefulness for a creature that’s expected to last only a
single fight. A damaging spell 2 levels below the highest
level a creature of that level can cast is still potentially
useful, but beyond that, don’t bother. Spells that have the
incapacitation trait should be in the highest level slot if
you want the creature to potentially get their full effect
against PCs.
SPELL DC AND SPELL ATTACK ROLL
Set the creature’s spell DC and spell attack roll using
Table 2–11 on page 66. Most creatures use the same DC
for all their spells, even if they have multiple types, such
as a creature with both prepared spells and innate spells.
Use the high numbers for primary casters, and
the moderate numbers for creatures that have some
supplemental spells but are focused more on combat.
At 15th level and higher, the extreme numbers become
standard for spellcasters. A few creatures might use the
extreme numbers at lower levels, but they tend to be
highly specialized, with very weak defenses and Strikes.
Secondary spellcasters can go up to high numbers if
they’re above 15th level and have offensive spells. There
is no low value—the creature shouldn’t have any spells
in the first place if it would be that bad at using them!
MANUFACTURED WEAPONS
As noted in Items on page 61, most creatures have less treasure
than PCs, so those that rely on manufactured weapons are
significantly weaker if you don’t adjust the weapons’ damage
to compensate. The method for determining Strike damage on
page 64 abstracts over the sources of damage so you don’t have
to worry about adjusting the weapon’s damage. If you do decide
to calculate the weapon’s damage, give your creature weapon
specialization or greater weapon specialization much earlier
than a PC would get it. You might also need to add sneak attack
or similar abilities to make the creature deal more damage.
On the flip side, you might want to use a one-off creature as
a source of a particularly high-level piece of treasure, such as
a magic weapon. In these cases, you might want to make the
attack bonus higher for the potency rune or the damage higher
for a potent striking rune so the PCs feel the weapon’s effect
before they obtain it. This will make the treasure feel more
powerful, since they’ve already been on the receiving end.

================================================================================

PREPARED AND SPONTANEOUS SPELLS
Spell slots work best for creatures that are meant to play
like PC spellcasters. Choose the magical tradition best
suited to the creature. You aren’t strictly limited to that
tradition’s spell list, though sticking close to it will make
your creature’s connection to that tradition more clear. The
decision to use prepared or spontaneous spellcasting should
align with the creature’s theme: a spontaneous spellcaster
fits well as a one-off creature, since spontaneous spellcasting
grants greater flexibility in the middle of battle, while a
prepared spellcaster makes for a great recurring character
who can change their spells between appearances.
For a creature that can cast as many spells as a PC
spellcaster, the highest spell level the creature can cast is half
its level rounded up. It gets five cantrips. If the creature’s
level is odd, it gets two spell slots of the highest spell level
(plus three spell slots of each lower level), or three spell slots
of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level). If its
level is even, it gets three spell slots of the highest spell level
(plus three spell slots of each lower level), or four spell slots
of that level (plus four spell slots of each lower level).
Because creatures tend to be “on stage” for only a short
time, you usually don’t need to fill every spell slot. You can
often fill just the top three levels of spells, pick cantrips, and
slot in a few thematic backup spells in the fourth level down.
For a recurring foe, you might give it a full complement.
INNATE SPELLS
Unlike prepared and spontaneous spells, innate spells can
be of higher level than half the creature’s level rounded
up, and you can choose how often they’re used—they
can even be used at will or be constant effects. The most
notable innate spells tend to be top-level ones that make
a big impact but can be used only once, at-will spells
that strongly reinforce the creature’s theme, and constant
spells that give it an ongoing benefit. A spell that’s usable
a limited number of times and falls at a lower level than
the top tier is typically less likely to come up in combat;
however, that’s a great spot for utility and recovery spells,
such as dispel magic or restoration.
Sometimes a strongly thematic innate spell is of a higher
level than the creature would normally be able to cast, but
it’s so fitting that it belongs there. Be careful when doing
this, as PCs might not have access to the appropriate
countermeasures for the spell. This option works best for
support, action denial, or battlefield control spells that
change the odds of a fight without outright killing anyone,
such as the succubus’s dominate spell. These should make
the fight more interesting, not end it. Keep the number of
such spells very low, typically just one.
Though you can achieve all sorts of things with innate
spells, always start with the theme and an idea of how
you want the creature spending its actions. And though

================================================================================

you could give the creature a tool to counter every kind of
PC attack or trick, remember that the players chose those
options to enjoy using them, rather than to be constantly
foiled by an effectively invincible creature.
RITUALS
Since rituals happen during downtime, giving them to
a creature is usually a purely thematic choice. You can
skip even looking at rituals in most cases. If you decide a
creature needs to have a ritual for your story, add in the
ritual whenever you need it.
DESIGN ABILITIES
In this step, you’ll take the ideas for abilities you noted when
you developed your concept and design these abilities for
your creature. You can look at existing creature abilities
from the Bestiary and feats from the Core Rulebook and
use them as is or modify them to fit your needs.
When choosing abilities, think about both the number
of abilities and the diversity of abilities. Having a large
number of similar abilities can make the creature tougher to
run, and it probably can’t use them all anyway. Diversity of
abilities gives the creature different ways to act in different
situations, and helps guide you as the GM. For instance, a
combat creature might have one ability it uses to get into
position, another to use when it wants to focus damage on
a single enemy, and a third that’s more defensive.
BASICS OF ABILITY DESIGN
There are a few principles of ability construction that you’ll
want to keep in mind. Some guidance for specific types of
abilities will come later, but these apply to everything.
• Respect the action economy.
• Make sure abilities are level appropriate.
• Avoid “invisible” abilities.
Action Economy
Understanding a creature’s action economy is
key for making it work in play. Remember how
short the lifespan of a typical combat creature
is. Including a bunch of combat abilities might
mean you spend time building actions the
creature will never have time to use. Narrow
your selections down to the smallest and most
compelling set that makes sense. Also keep in
mind that special actions will compete for time
with any combat spells you gave the creature.
Reactions can help, giving the creature a way to act
when it’s not its turn. See Reactive Abilities on page 69 for
advice on designing these tricky abilities.
Because of PC capabilities at higher levels, creatures
at those levels should get more abilities that improve
their action economy. For instance, creatures that grapple
should have Improved Grab instead of Grab, Speeds
should be higher, and many abilities that would have cost
an action at a lower level should be free actions.
FOCUS SPELLS
Some creatures have focus spells, especially when those focus
spells clearly fit a creature’s theme. Simply give the creature the
focus spells you like and between 1 and 3 Focus Points (you
can also allow your creature to cast focus spells using spell
slots). Use the same DC and spell attack roll as any other spell.
A creature that has just 1 Focus Point is likely to cast a focus
spell only once, unless it’s a recurring enemy. If the creature has
plenty of spells already, you might want to skip focus spells
altogether, as they aren’t as strong as top-level spell slots.
LEvEL AppropriAtEnEss
The effects of an ability should be appropriate to the
creature’s level. For damaging abilities, that means they
follow the damage guidelines on page 68. For others, take a
look at spells and feats with a similar effect to see if they’re
level appropriate. For instance, say you’re considering
giving a 6th-level creature the ability to teleport a short
distance. Dimension door is comparable—that’s a 4th-level
spell, normally cast by a 7th-level or higher creature. That
means 6th level probably isn’t too low, but the creature
shouldn’t be able to use the ability more than once. You
can also compare your creature to those in a Bestiary
volume to see if the special abilities seem similar in power
to those of other creatures of the same level.

================================================================================

invisibLE AbiLitiEs
Avoid abilities that do nothing but change the creature’s
math, also known as “invisible abilities.” These alter a
creature’s statistics in a way that’s invisible to the players,
which makes the creature less engaging because the players
don’t see it using its abilities in a tangible or evocative
way. For example, an ability that allows a creature to use
an action to increase its accuracy for the round with no
outward sign (or worse, just grants a passive bonus to its
accuracy) isn’t that compelling, whereas one that increases
its damage by lighting its arrows on fire is noticeable.
These both work toward the same goal—dealing more
damage this round—but one is far more memorable.
ACTIVE ABILITIES
Abilities a creature uses on its turn have the most flexibility
and scope. You can use Table 2–11 to determine active
ability DCs as well as spell DCs. You can have an ability use
1 to 3 actions as needed (or be a free action in rare cases) and
use just about any type of tactic. Feats, spells, and existing
creature abilities provide a wide variety of examples, so look
for something similar to your idea to use as a basis.
Consider how you want your creature to spend its turns.
Two-action activities pretty much define the creature’s turn,
and single actions work best for supplemental benefits
or normal Strikes. And as you build out your idea of a
creature’s turn, don’t forget about movement! A creature
often needs to spend actions getting into position, especially
early in a fight. This is especially challenging with melee-
only creatures. You can give such creatures abilities similar
to Sudden Charge or the deadly mantis’s Leaping Grab.
Use 3-action abilities sparingly, as a creature can’t use
them if it is slowed or stunned—making a creature’s coolest
or most defining ability use up 3 actions might mean
the creature never gets to use it. These activities should
be reserved for abilities that include some movement
(like Trample) or that the creature is likely to use before
engaging in combat. Don’t make an ability use 3 actions as
a way to balance it—saying “This can be more powerful
than other abilities because it is less likely to work,” is a
recipe for frustration if you’ve made a cool ability that’s
too hard or even impossible for the creature to use.
Be especially careful with activities when designing
boss creatures. They’re likely to get targeted with the PCs’
most powerful detrimental effects, get grabbed, become
slowed, or otherwise have their actions restricted. Bosses
need to have solid options they can use with 1 or 2 actions.
This lets them use their remaining actions to get away, use
a simple ability, or otherwise keep the fight dynamic.
FrEE Actions
Use free actions that don’t have triggers sparingly, and
when you do, they should almost always be used for
support or utility actions, not Strikes or movement. If you
come up with a free action, consider whether it should
be its own action or part of a combo, such as drawing a
weapon and attacking. In cases like the latter, you might be
better off making a single action that allows the creature to
draw a weapon and then Strike.
DAmAgE-DEALing AbiLitiEs
If a special action is a single action with only one target,
you can often set damage using Table 2–10: Strike Damage
on page 65. If it uses more than 1 action or requires setup
in some way, it might deal higher damage than is typical;
often, you can just use the extreme column in these cases.
For abilities that deal damage in an area, use Table 2–12
below. These numbers are based on a 2-action activity
(e.g., most damaging spells). Single actions should deal
much less damage. An ability that has another significant
effect, like applying a condition, should deal less damage;
for this, look at the damage for 2 or more levels lower,
and judge which value would best match based on the
severity of the additional effect. These abilities typically
allow a basic saving throw. The table includes values for
unlimited-use abilities (ones that can be used at-will) and
limited-use ones (which can be used once or, like a Breath
Weapon, once or twice but not on consecutive turns).
You can use the dice given or generate your own
expression based on the damage in parentheses, as detailed
in the Strike Damage section on page 64. If a high-level
effect has a small area compared to similar abilities, you
have it deal more damage.

================================================================================

DEFENSIVE ABILITIES
Active offensive abilities usually fit creatures better than
defensive abilities do. Save defense increases for creatures
that are strongly defense-themed. For martial creatures,
something as simple as a shield and Shield Block is usually
plenty. Defensive abilities often run the risk of being
invisible abilities. For examples of good defensive abilities,
look at spells like sanctuary for ideas, or other spells that
create interesting protective effects instead of just granting
a bonus. If you do want to make a creature defensive, pick
one defensive ability rather than several, since stacking up
multiple defenses can make for a frustrating fight. One solid
style of defensive ability is a mode switch, which causes the
creature to get stronger defenses, but limits its attacks, spells,
or other offensive options.
REACTIVE ABILITIES
Reactions and free actions with triggers can give a creature
an impact outside its turn. This can make the fight more
interesting, but may also be risky. It’s tempting to give every
creature a reaction, but that’s not necessarily a good idea.
To decide whether your creature should have a reaction,
first consider if the creature has the reflexes or insight to
react well in the first place—for instance, an ogre doesn’t
have Attack of Opportunity because it’s a big oaf. Oozes,
constructs, and unintelligent creatures are less likely to have
reactions than others for this reason.
Second, look at the complexity of the encounter your
creature is likely to appear in. If you’ll have a large number
of creatures, skipping reactions can make the fight flow
faster. A creature that’s more likely to fight solo, on the other
hand, might have a reaction to give it a way to continue to
be dangerous amid an onslaught of attacks by the party.
When creating reactions, be careful with “gotcha”
abilities—ones that punish players for making perfectly
reasonable choices, for rolling poorly, and so on. If you
include abilities like this, they need to reinforce the
creature’s core theme and the play style you want it to use
in combat. For example, a creature that Strikes as a reaction
when someone fails an attack roll will encourage PCs to use
their actions on other tactics, rather than attacking multiple
times each turn. Is that what you want? Is this dynamic
essential for making the creature feel like it’s supposed to?
This isn’t the type of ability you’d give to any old creature—
only an incredible duelist or something similar.
Reactions should require something out of the ordinary
to happen, or should be relatively weak if triggered by
something ordinary. A reaction that triggers anytime
someone tries to Strike a creature is likely to be perceived
by the players as uninteresting because it’s so predictable.
The best reactions should be telegraphed so when they
happen, it makes sense to the players. Think of one of the
core reactions of the game: Shield Block. The creature raises
its shield—an obvious action the PCs can see—so when it
blocks damage from an attack, that makes perfect sense.
Similarly, if you made a crystalline creature, you might
have it build up sonic energy in a low thrum, so when it
uses a reaction to release a burst of sonic energy when hit,
the players can say, “Oh, I should have seen that coming.”
rEAction DAmAgE
Reactions should use lower damage, usually that of a
moderate Strike. A reaction that deals area damage might
deal low damage, though use such reactions with caution.
CONSTANT AND AUTOMATIC ABILITIES
Certain abilities shouldn’t use any actions. Auras are a
common constant ability, with frightful presence, an adult
red dragon’s dragon heat, and a xulgath’s stench as notable
examples. An aura needs a range, and if it needs a DC,
you’ll usually set it to the moderate spell DC unless the aura
is one of the creature’s defining concepts. For example, the
xulgath’s stench DC is significantly higher because the aura
is such an iconic part of the creature.
Abilities the creature has no control over should be
automatic. For example, the living wildfire fire elemental
explodes into flame when it dies. It has no option not to,
so this wouldn’t make sense as a reaction or free action.
Conversely, the Ferocity ability is a reaction because it
requires the creature to give itself a last push to stay at 1 HP.
constAnt AnD AutomAtic DAmAgE
Much like for reactions, damage for a constant ability
should be pretty low. Usually this value is just below low
Strike damage. Automatic abilities like the living wildfire’s
explosion ability tend to deal moderate Strike damage or
unlimited-use area damage, and can deal even more if they
happen only after the creature is dead or otherwise no
longer presents a threat.
SKILL ABILITIES
A skilled creature might have abilities related to its skills.
The skill feats in the Core Rulebook make for a good
baseline. Avoid giving your creature skill abilities that
won’t matter in its interactions with PCs.
REVIEW HOLISTICALLY
Now it’s time to look over your completed creature as a
whole and make sure it’s living up to your concept. Can
it do everything you wanted? Does it fit its intended role?
Is there anything you could add or anything superfluous
you could cut to get the creature where it needs to be?
If this creature is built for combat, run through a few
turns in your head. Does it still work decently if it gets
slowed? Can it move into combat against the PCs effectively
given their mobility options compared to its own? Does it
have any abilities it’ll never use given its other actions?
When you’re satisfied with your creation, it’s ready to
hit the table. But that’s not necessarily the end! If you
notice issues during the game, you can fix them on the
spot. It’s your game, and you can freely change what you
wrote if you think differently later on.

Traits Many constructs lack minds and have the mindless trait.
Immunities bleed, death effects, diseased, doomed, drained,
fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed,
poison, sickened, unconscious; if mindless, add mental
DAEMON
Traits NE, fiend

DESIGNING NPCS
Creatures that are meant to cleave closely to character
classes or intended to represent people rather than
monsters are NPCs. They might face more scrutiny
around their mechanics than creatures, because a player
can more directly compare their rogue to an NPC who
acts like a rogue. That doesn’t mean you have to build
an NPC exactly like a PC, though.
You can build NPCs just like you would any other
creatures. If an NPC should work like they have a class,
use the class features and feats of a suitable class to pick
abilities, and look at both the class’s proficiencies and
ability modifiers to determine how strong the NPC’s
statistics should be. Class Road Maps on page 73 has
prebuilt road maps for the Core Rulebook classes to get
you started.
If the NPC isn’t meant to work like they have a class
(a baker, for example), instead look at the NPC Gallery
on pages 202–249. Compare your NPC to the existing
ones to determine the NPC’s level, and look for abilities
that are similar to what yours should have. You can
also create new abilities as needed to get the NPC’s
interactions with the PCs to express their theme and
role in the story. These NPCs can be level –1 or level
0. Their capabilities are below those of PCs, and they
should typically not use any class features or feats from
PC classes. Creatures of these levels tend to be extremely
simple, and usually you can just take one from the NPC
Gallery and reskin it.
It’s highly recommended that you select NPC skills
using proficiency ranks as you would a PC, though
you don’t need to be precise about the number of skill
increases you give the NPC. You can give them earlier
access to expert, master, or legendary proficiency if
they’re a skill-based NPC, and better proficiency in
narrow areas of expertise, like Engineering Lore for a
tinker NPC.
NON-COMBAT LEVEL
An NPC’s level should represent their combat prowess.
A common person might not be a combat threat, even if
they’re important or highly skilled, and they consequently
have a low level. However, that doesn’t mean they can’t
present a challenge in other types of encounters. This is
represented by a non-combat level, and tends to be specific
to their area of expertise. For example, the barrister on
page 232 of the NPC Gallery is a 4th-level creature in an
encounter related to legal matters.
This can go the other way as well, such as with a
powerful combat creature that’s not suited to social
settings. This is usually the case with creatures untrained
in mental skills. You can improvise this as you run the
game, or you can plan ahead if you have something
particular in mind.
Building an NPC’s non-combat level is pretty simple.
Choose the level you want the NPC to be for the type of
challenge you have in mind, and use the skill numbers
for that level—typically high or even extreme. Some
challenges, such as social challenges, require the creature
to have a high Perception and Will DC, so in those cases,
you should increase those values as well. These should
be set at the moderate or high values for the non-combat
level, usually, depending on how adept you want the NPC
to be.
The Experience Points gained for besting an NPC
depend on how the party overcame them, because XP
comes from overcoming a specific challenge. If the
PCs defeat the NPC in a non-combat setting of the
NPC’s specialty, the party gets XP based on the NPC’s
non-combat level. If they just beat the NPC up, the XP
would be based on the NPC’s creature level. Quite often,
that means 0 XP and failure at the PCs’ objective; for
instance, during a baking contest, if the PCs murder the
other baker, not only would they be disqualified, but they
would likely be apprehended for their crime.
PC-STYLE BUILD
If you do choose to build an NPC fully using the PC
rules, your NPC should generally end up being an
appropriate challenge as a creature of their level. They
will likely have lower statistics in some areas than if
you had built them using the creature rules, but more
options due to their full complement of feats and class
features. This is best saved for important, recurring
NPCs, especially if they’re meant to engage in social or
exploration endeavors rather than just battles.
There are still some considerations and shortcuts that
can expedite the process while ensuring the NPC works
as you intend.
• The creature’s treasure should follow the Treasure
for New Characters rules on page 510 of the Core
Rulebook. You’ll need to account for this in your
campaign’s overall treasure. You might even want
to give the NPC a higher-level item appropriate as a
treasure allotment for the level.
• You can expedite ability score generation by
making the starting ability modifiers add up to
+9, with no more than one modifier at +4 (and
typically no more than one negative modifier). You
can skip adding a background if you do this, but
you might want to give the creature two skills,
which includes one Lore skill, to represent the skills
granted by a background.
• It’s not necessary to assign every skill feat, particularly
for a higher-level NPC. You can just pick the most
emblematic ones and gloss over the rest.
• For
general
feats,
Incredible
Initiative
and
Toughness make good choices.
• Most of the guidelines about choosing spells still
apply, though you might want a few more utility
spells that deal with non-combat challenges,
particularly in low-level slots.

CLASS ROAD MAPS
You can use these suggestions when creating your road map to
emulate a PC class, customizing as you see fit. You’ll still need to

Alchemist low Perception; high Crafting; high Int, moderate or
better Dex or Str; low to moderate HP; moderate attack with bombs;

BUILDING HAZARDS
Building hazards designed for your game allows you to customize them to match your
story, location, and needs, as well as to surprise the other players at every turn. There’s no
wrong way to create a hazard, but this guide presents the information in the order you
might see it in a hazard stat block.
CONCEPT
The first thing you’ll need is a concept for your hazard.
What level is your hazard? Will it be simple or complex? Is
it a trap, a haunt, an environmental hazard, or something
else? If it’s a trap, is it mechanical, magical, or both? This is a
good time to brainstorm the hazard’s name and description,
as this will help you decide how the hazard can be disabled.
The following information builds on concepts from
Building Creatures, which starts on page 56.
HAZARD TYPES
The three main types of hazards are traps, environmental
hazards, and haunts.
Traps are usually built or placed, though they can also
form accidentally, such as if a magic
portal, through millennia of disuse,
malfunctions as its magic warps. Mechanical traps always
have some physical component, whereas purely magical traps
typically don’t. Magical traps can usually be counteracted
by dispel magic, and those without a listed proficiency rank
for Stealth can be found using detect magic. Thievery is the
most common skill used to disable traps.
Environmental hazards are either living things, like
dangerous spores and molds, or simply features of the
terrain or environment, like avalanches or rockslides. While
they are always physical, some environmental hazards can’t
reasonably be attacked or damaged, such as a cloud of
poisonous gas or a patch of quicksand. Survival is the most
common skill used to disable environmental hazards.
Haunts are spiritual hazards, usually formed when the
spiritual essence of a location is imprinted with the instincts
and emotions from a living being’s demise. Because haunts
lack matter, they rarely involve a physical component, and
when they do, that component is generally incorporeal or
might even be damaged only by positive energy. The skills
and options used to disable haunts vary, though using
Religion for an exorcism is common. However, even with
a successful check to disable a haunt, it can reoccur until
its unfinished business is resolved. Typically, successfully
disabling or enduring a haunt provides clues to determine
what it would take to lay it to rest permanently.
UNDERSTANDING AND
CHOOSING STATISTICS
Much like for creatures, hazard statistics can be extreme,
high, or low (hazards don’t need as much granularity, so
they usually don’t have moderate or terrible values for their
statistics). While they are defined in creature creation, when
building a hazard, you’ll use the values slightly differently.
Extreme: While extreme values remain
world-class statistics that are extremely difficult
to meet or exceed, unlike with monsters, almost
all hazards have one extreme statistic because
hazards normally activate only if they have
gone unnoticed or if someone critically
failed to disable them. Does it
have an extreme Stealth DC that
makes it incredibly hard to find,
an extreme Disable DC that makes
it perilous to disable, or an extreme
save DC that makes it deadly in
the event it triggers? These are the most
common choices, as each affects a different
phase of encountering the hazard.
Gamemastery Guide

PAGE 76
================================================================================

High: This is a capable level, and can generally serve as a
baseline value; this value for hazards covers what would be
the high and moderate ranges for creatures.
Low: If a hazard has a weakness, like a poor Reflex save
for a bulky mechanical trap or an easy DC to disable for
a hard-to-find trap, it usually has a low value. If you need
something even lower, use a terrible value from Building
Creatures (pages 56–73), or just an incredibly low value
like the Armageddon orb’s Stealth (Core Rulebook 526).
STEALTH AND DISABLE
When determining a hazard’s combat statistics, first decide
how the hazard can be located and how hard it is to disable.
A hazard where the main challenge is how difficult it is to
find, like the Core Rulebook’s hidden pit, might have a very
different effect for its level than a hazard out in plain sight,
daring a PC to try to disable it, like the Armageddon orb.

When deciding how your hazard is disabled, come
up with a narrative description of how it would happen,
which will inform which methods and skills disable the
hazard. You’ll need to decide the proficiency rank necessary
to find the hazard as well as disable it with each method.
Remember, a hazard without a listed rank next to its Stealth
DC is obvious enough that creatures can find it without
Searching, and magical hazards without a listed rank are not
normally protected against detect magic. Most hazards built
by intelligent creatures are concealed have at least a trained
rank. Table 2–14 indicates the high and moderate proficiency
requirements by level; you can use lower proficiency ranks
than the ones listed, and if you use the high rank, consider
a secondary, perhaps less-efficient method to disable the
hazard using a lower rank. For instance, the bloodthirsty
urge haunt in the Core Rulebook can be disabled with
master Religion, or by a higher DC with expert Diplomacy.
If you need a Stealth modifier for a complex hazard,
just subtract 10 from the listed DC.

DEFENSES
If there’s a physical component that a character could break,
you’ll need to determine the hazard’s AC, Fortitude save,
and Reflex save, using the extreme, high, and low values
(preceded by E, H, or L on the table) as well as its Hardness,
HP, and Broken Threshold (BT). When building a purely
magical or formless hazard, you can skip this section.

Some hazards, even high-level ones, don’t make sense
with a high Hardness value. In those cases, you can skip the
Hardness and use the HP values from table 2–7: Hit Points
on page 63. Especially for complex hazards, you might
want to divide the durability over multiple sections, located
in different positions, to encourage teamwork and mobility.
OFFENSE
Almost all hazards need an attack bonus or a save DC,
and hazards that deal damage need to list a damage
value. Simple hazards deal about twice as much damage
as complex hazards and have an attack bonus even higher
than the extreme attack bonus for a creature (abbreviated
as S. Atk in Table 2–16: Offense). Complex hazards
usually have attack bonuses akin to a high attack bonus
for a creature (abbreviated as C. Atk in Table 2–16). You
can adjust them further using Table 2–9: Attack Bonus
on page 64 if your hazard needs it. Simple hazard DCs
aren’t as high for their level as their attack bonuses are,
since effects with DCs usually have some effect even on a
successful saving throw; use the EDC and HDC columns
for extreme and hard DCs on Table 2–16: Offense below.
The damage columns on the table give a damage
expression you can use, followed by the average damage
in parentheses. If you want to make your own damage
expression, remember that average damage is 2.5 for a d4,
3.5 for a d6, 4.5 for a d8, 5.5 for a d10, and 6.5 for a d12.

DESIGNING SIMPLE HAZARDS
When designing a simple hazard, make sure to select an
appropriate trigger and effect. Often, a simple hazard that
merely damages its target is little more than a speed bump
that slows down the game without much added value, so
think about the purpose of your hazard carefully, both
in the story and in the game world, especially when it’s
a hazard that a creature intentionally built or placed
in that location. A great simple hazard does something
interesting, has a longer-lasting consequence, or integrates
with the nearby inhabitants or even the encounters in
some way (you can find more information on integrating
hazards with encounters in Dynamic Encounters on
page 48).
DESIGNING COMPLEX HAZARDS
Unlike a simple hazard, a complex hazard can play the
part of a creature in a battle, or can be an encounter all
its own. Many of the concerns with damaging effects when
designing a simple hazard don’t apply when designing a
complex hazard. A complex hazard can apply its damage
over and over again, eventually killing its hapless victim,
and isn’t intended to be a quick-to-overcome obstacle.
Complex hazards have a lot more in common with
creatures than simple hazards do, and you’ll see that a
complex hazard’s statistics are similar to those of a creature.
A good complex hazard often requires disabling multiple
components or otherwise interacting with the encounter
in some way. For instance, while the Core Rulebook’s
poisoned dart gallery requires only one Thievery check to
disable, the control panel is on the far end of the gallery, so
a PC would need to make their way across first.
Building Routines
A complex hazard has a routine each round, whether it
stems from preprogrammed instructions built into a trap,
instincts and residual emotions swirling around a complex
haunt, or a force of nature like sinking in quicksand. Make
sure to build a routine that makes sense for the hazard; an
environmental lava chute that ejects lava into the area each
round shouldn’t be able to seek out and precisely target
only the PCs, but it might spatter random areas within
range or everything within range, depending on how you
describe the hazard. However, a complex haunt might be
able to recognize life force and target living creatures.
If you create a hazard that can’t consistently attack the
PCs (like the Core Rulebook’s blade pillar, which moves
in a random direction), you can make it deadlier than
normal in other ways.
The hazard should have as many actions as you feel
it needs to perform its routine. If you split the routine
out into several actions, you can also remove some of
the hazard’s actions once partial progress is made in
disabling or destroying it; this can give the PCs a feeling
of progress, and it can encourage them to handle the
hazard if it appears in a encounter alongside creatures.

SIMPLE HAZARDS
A simple hazard uses its reaction when triggered.
SHRIEKER
HAZARD –1
ENVIRONMENTAL
FUNGUS
Stealth DC 12
Description This human-sized purple mushroom emits a
piercing shriek when disturbed.
Disable DC 18 Survival to carefully approach and cut the
mushroom’s air sac without triggering the shrieker
AC 12; Fort +8, Ref +2
HP 9; Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Shriek [reaction] Trigger A creature or light source approaches within
10 feet of the shrieker or the shrieker takes damage; Effect
The shrieker emits a deafening screech that deals 1d6 sonic
damage to creatures within 30 feet (DC 16 basic Fortitude
save; creatures that critically fail this saving throw are
deafened for 1 minute).
Reset 1 minute
SNOWFALL
HAZARD 0
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth DC 16 (trained)
Description Loose snow and ice have built up on a high surface,
such as a tree branch or a rooftop. Its grip on the surface is
tenuous, and it is likely to fall if the surface moves.
Disable DC 19 Survival (trained) to safely dislodge the snow,
or deal any amount of fire damage to destroy the hazard
without triggering it
AC 16; Fort +10, Ref +8
HP 8; Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Snowdrop [reaction] Trigger A creature moves beneath where the
snowfall is resting; Effect Ice and snow fall on the triggering
creature, dealing 2d6+3 bludgeoning damage (DC 18 basic
Reflex save) and soaking their clothing. Until they change
into fresh clothing or spend at least an hour in an area of
normal or higher temperature, they treat cold environments
as one step colder (for example, mild cold as severe cold).
HAMPERING WEB
HAZARD 1
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth DC 18 (expert)
Description Semitransparent sheets of
webbing span the entryway, ready to
capture small insects or hamper larger
creatures that pass through.
Disable DC 17 Survival (trained) to dislodge it
AC 19; Fort +10, Ref +11
HP 26 (BT 13); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Ensnare [reaction] Trigger A creature that isn’t a
spider walks into the web; Effect The web
wraps around the triggering creature’s body,
clinging to their limbs. The triggering creature
must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to all their Speeds until they Escape
the web (DC 20). On a critical failure, the webbing also clings
to the creature’s face, making them sickened 1, and they can’t
attempt to reduce this condition until they Escape the web.
BROWN MOLD
HAZARD 2
ENVIRONMENTAL
FUNGUS
Stealth DC 21 (trained)
Description This unassuming fungus leeches heat out of the air.
Disable DC 18 Survival (trained) to safely remove the mold
Emit Cold (aura, cold); 5 feet. Brown mold deals 2d6 cold
damage to nearby creatures.
AC 18; Fort +11 Ref +5
HP 30 (BT 15); Immunities critical hits, fire, object immunities,
precision damage; Weaknesses cold 10
Leech Warmth [reaction] Trigger Fire comes within 5 feet of the brown
mold; Effect The brown mold expands into every square
adjacent to its space. As it grows, it pulls more heat from
its surroundings, dealing 2d6+6 cold damage (DC 18 basic
Fortitude save) to creatures within 10 feet after it expands.
Reset After expanding, the brown mold can’t grow again for 1 day.
TREACHEROUS SCREE
HAZARD 3
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth DC 23 (trained)
Description The footing on this sloped ground appears to be
stable at first glance, but the tiny rocks that cover it are
loosely packed and prone to slipping.
Disable DC 20 Survival (trained) to navigate a safe path
Rockslide [reaction] Trigger A creature steps on the
unstable ground; Effect Rocks tumble and slip
beneath its feet. The triggering creature
must attempt a DC 21 Reflex save as
they tumble against the rocks, which
deal 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage.

Critical Failure As failure, but double damage.
TITANIC FLYTRAP
HAZARD 4
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth DC 25 (trained)
Description On the surface, a titanic flytrap appears to be
a patch of the more common flytrap plant, but beneath
murky waters it hides a far larger set of jaws, reaching 10
feet across and reinforced with woody branches and lined
with paralytic hairs.
Disable DC 22 Survival (trained) to mislead the flytrap’s sense
of weight and pressure
AC 21; Fort +15, Ref +8
HP 56 (BT 28); Immunities mental; Resistances acid 20, fire 10
Snap Shut [reaction] Trigger A Small or Medium creature moves into
a square that is within reach of the flytrap’s hidden jaws;
Effect The flytrap’s jaws snap shut, making a jaws Strike
against the triggering creature.
Melee [one-action] jaws +17, Effect devour
Devour The target is trapped by the flytrap’s jaws, gaining the
grabbed condition until it Escapes (DC 21). Additionally, it
is exposed to the titanic flytrap toxin from the hundreds of
tiny hairs that line the inside of its leaves. If the flytrap’s
jaws Strike was a critical success, the target takes a –2
circumstance penalty to its saving throws against this
poison. At the end of each of target’s turns that it remains
grabbed, the target takes 3d6 acid damage.
Titanic Flytrap Toxin (contact, poison) Saving Throw DC 21
Fortitude; Maximum Duration 4 rounds; Stage 1 2d6 poison
damage and stunned 1 (1 round); Stage 2 3d6 poison damage
and stunned 2 (1 round); Stage 3 4d6 poison damage and
paralyzed (1 round)
Reset 1 hour (or longer, after a large meal)
SPECTRAL REFLECTION
HAZARD 5
HAUNT
Stealth DC 26 (expert)
Description The reflection in the mirror subtly twists and distorts,
its expression taking on an unnerving sneer of malice.
Disable DC 23 Religion (trained) to exorcise the spirit, or DC 23
Thievery (trained) to quickly cover the mirror
AC 19; Fort +15, Ref +10
Hardness 13, HP 50 (BT 25); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Spectral Impale [reaction] Trigger A living creature approaches
within 15 feet of the mirror, and the mirror is lit with dim
or brighter light; Effect Shadowy barbs impale the body
of the reflected creature as the haunt makes a shadow
barbs Strike.
Melee [one-action] shadow barbs +19, Damage 4d8+9 negative plus
sap vitality
Sap Vitality A creature hit by the reflection’s shadow barbs
must attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save as the haunt tries
to draw a portion of its vital essence into the mirror. The
target is drained 1 on a failed saving throw, or drained 2 on
a critical failure.
Reset The haunt re-forms after 1 minute, manifesting in any
mirror within its infused area (see Special below).
Special Spectral reflections often infuse entire buildings,
manifesting in any sufficiently large mirror. The example
Hit Points and Hardness given represent a typical mirror
reinforced by the haunt; at your discretion, the haunt might
appear in reflective surfaces that are harder to destroy.
Defeating a manifestation through damage destroys the
surface, preventing the haunt from using it again. If this
haunt appears in an area with many mirrors, consider giving
PCs double or even triple the XP for a typical simple hazard.
GHOSTLY CHOIR
HAZARD 6
HAUNT
Stealth DC 20 (expert)
Description A choir of lost souls rises out of the floor, singing
an eerie chant that terrifies its listeners and buffets their
bodies with walls of sound.
Disable DC 28 Performance (trained) to disrupt the song’s
resonance with another tune or DC 28 Religion (trained) to
ritually silence the spirits
Profane Chant [reaction] (auditory, emotion, enchantment, fear,
mental, occult) Trigger A creature moves within 10 feet of
the section of floor from which the choir can arise; Effect
The choir rises, and its song deals 4d8+18 mental damage to
non-evil creatures within 30 feet of the souls’ spectral forms.
Affected creatures must each attempt a DC 24 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and becomes
frightened 1.
Failure The creature takes full damage and becomes
frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage. It also
becomes frightened 3 and fleeing for 1 round.
GREEN SLIME
HAZARD 9
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth DC 30 (expert)
Description A caustic green film clings to the ceiling above,
watching for prey to pass beneath it.
Disable DC 33 Survival (expert) to carefully peel the slime off
the ceiling without touching it
AC 20; Fort +25 Ref +15
HP 200 (BT 100); Immunities critical hits, object immunities,
precision damage; Weaknesses cold 20, fire 20
Dissolving Ambush [reaction] Trigger A creature walks beneath the
slime; Effect The green slime drops on top of the creature,
attempting to dissolve it into a nutritious slurry. The target
must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save.
Critical Success The target leaps out of the way, and it
is unaffected.
Gamemastery Guide

PAGE 80
================================================================================

Success A small amount of the slime splashes onto the
target. The target is drained 1.
Failure The slime lands on its target. The target is drained 1,
and this condition value increases by 1 at the end of its
turn each round until the slime is removed. If the target
reaches drained 4, the next time its drained value would
increase, it dies and collapses into a slurry of nutrients.
A slime covering a target can no longer be removed
through Survival checks, and damage dealt to the slime is
also dealt to the target (applying the target’s immunities,
weaknesses, and resistances rather than those of the
green slime).
Critical Failure The slime completely coats its target. This
has the same effect as a failure, except the target is
immediately drained 2, becomes drained 4 after 1 round,
and dies after 2 rounds.
Reset 1 hour, as the slime feasts and then slowly creeps back
up to the ceiling
JEALOUS ABJURER
HAZARD 11
HAUNT
Stealth DC 33 (master)
Description A robe-clad spirit rises out of the floor, pointing an
accusing finger.
Disable DC 36 Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion (master)
to convince the spirit that the target’s magical knowledge is
too great to be trifled with
Rend Magic [reaction] (abjuration, arcane) Trigger A creature that
is currently affected by a beneficial spell approaches
within 30 feet of the abjurer; Effect Envying the fame and
magical prowess of others, the jealous abjurer attempts
to engineer a catastrophic failure in the highest-level
beneficial spell currently affecting its target. It
attempts a counteract check with a +26 modifier.
If the counteract check succeeds, the spell is
dispelled, and the creature it had been affecting
takes 4d12+30 force damage as the spell violently
implodes (DC 32 basic Reflex save).
Reset 1 hour
PLUMMETING DOOM
HAZARD 15
HAUNT
Stealth DC 40 (master) to hear the echoes of a
faraway object crashing into the ground
Description Four vengeful spirits grab interlopers
and toss them off the edge of a nearby
120-foot-tall cliff.
Disable DC 40 Athletics (trained) to push back
so forcefully that the spirits fear being thrown
off the cliff, or DC 40 Religion (expert) to
temporarily seal the spirits away
Call of the Ground [reaction] (divine, abjuration) Trigger
A creature approaches within 15 feet of the edge
of the cliff; Effect Each spirit attempts to throw a
creature within 60 feet of the cliff’s edge off the cliff
by attempting a check with a +26 modifier against the
target’s Fortitude DC. If the haunt succeeds, the target is
thrown over the edge of the cliff, where it then falls 120
feet to the ground.
Until the haunt is defeated, each creature within 60 feet
of the cliff’s edge must attempt a DC 40 Will save each time
they would spend an action or reaction to Arrest a Fall, Fly,
Grab an Edge, or otherwise avoid falling; if they fail the save,
the action is disrupted. The haunt automatically attempts
to counteract spells that would slow a fall or mitigate the
effects of falling, such as feather fall, with a counteract
modifier of +32.
Reset 1 hour
GRASP OF THE DAMNED
HAZARD 17
HAUNT
Stealth DC 43 (master)
Description These desperate spirits are the echoes of people
who committed great atrocities in the name of an evil god.
Now, they are left with only the knowledge that their souls
have been damned, and the unwavering belief that they can
better their fate by providing powerful sacrifices for their
fiendish masters.
Disable DC 46 Religion (master) to inspire a deity to intervene
and counteract the ritual
Mark for Damnation [reaction] (death, divine, necromancy) Trigger
Three or more sentient living creatures of 13th level or higher
enter the haunt’s area; Effect The haunt deals 6d12+35
negative damage to each creature in the haunt’s area, and
each creature must attempt a DC 40 Will save.

ETERNAL FLAME
HAZARD 7
COMPLEX HAUNT
Stealth +18 (expert)
Description A raging spectral inferno arises out of thin air,
strengthening all undead creatures within its area. This
haunt most often arises from the charred remains of a
group of three people who burned to death, whether in
a terrible accident or a deliberate execution, and their
unavenged souls burn with rage.
Disable DC 27 Diplomacy (expert) to temporarily calm the rage
of one of the three spirits, or DC 30 Religion (trained) to
exorcise one of the spirits; three total successes are required
to disable the haunt
Searing Agony [reaction] (divination, mental) Trigger A living creature
approaches within 10 feet of the remains of a victim of the
original fire; Effect Memories of the pain suffered by the
fire’s past victims assault the triggering creature’s mind. The
creature must attempt a DC 25 Will save, and the haunt
then rolls initiative.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is sickened 1.
Failure The creature is sickened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 3, and it is
flat-footed for as long as it remains within the haunt’s
area and for 3 rounds thereafter.
Routine (1 action) Phantom flames rage across the haunted
area, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each living creature
within the area (DC 23 basic Will save). Undead creatures
in the area are infused with flames for the following round.
They gain the fire trait and immunity to fire, and all their
attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. Objects in the
area are unaffected.
Reset The flames cease 1 minute after all living creatures leave
the area, but after 1 hour, the anger and pain simmer up and
the haunt is ready to trigger again.
CONFOUNDING BETRAYAL
HAZARD 8
COMPLEX HAUNT
Stealth +21 (expert)
Description Allies appear to shed their disguises and reveal
themselves to be malevolent monsters.
Disable DC 28 Deception (expert) twice to confound the haunt
with your own deceptions, or DC 28 Occultism (trained)
twice to create a ward against the haunt’s mental influence
Unmask [reaction] (illusion, occult) Trigger Two or more creatures
enter the haunt’s area; Effect Each creature sees the forms
of nearby creatures shift and change, appearing to transform
into fiendish or aberrant beings with a thirst for blood. Each
creature in the area must attempt a DC 30 Will save.
Critical Success The creature sees through the illusions
entirely and is temporarily immune to the haunt’s routine
for 1 minute.
Success The creature is unaffected by the strange images.
Failure The creature believes the illusions to be true; if
they become confused by the haunt’s routine, they can’t
attempt flat checks to end the confused condition when
they take damage.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is left with a
lingering suspicion of others and can’t benefit from Aid
reactions for 24 hours.
Routine (1 action; illusion, incapacitation, occult) The haunt
continues to confound victims’ senses and inspire them to
commit violence against each other. Each creature in the
haunt’s area must attempt a DC 26 Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected and temporarily
immune for 1 minute.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is confused for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is confused for 1 minute.
Reset The haunt deactivates 1 minute after all creatures leave
the area but resets immediately thereafter.
PERILOUS FLASH FLOOD
HAZARD 10
COMPLEX
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth +22 (expert)
Description Whether made up of water rushing through the
streets that sweeps up dangerous debris along the way or
a less natural substance bursting free of its container, this
relentless flood batters everything in its path.
Disable three DC 35 Athletics, Crafting, or Survival checks
to move or construct barricades strong enough to create
a shelter from the flood. While this creates a safe place to
stand, creatures outside of the barricaded area may still be in
danger depending on the nature and the source of the flood.
Burst Free [reaction] Trigger A creature or effect breaks the flood’s
containment; Effect The hazard rolls initiative as the flood
surges forth.
Routine (1 action) The flood advances forward 60 feet, crashing
into all creatures within its area. Each creature must attempt
a DC 30 Fortitude save as the floodwaters pummel them and
pull them downstream. The amount and type of damage dealt
are based on the nature of the flood, and certain types of
Gamemastery Guide

================================================================================

floods impose additional effects. The turbulent waters mean
creatures within the area of the flood must attempt a DC 20
Athletics check to Swim in order to move, and those who do
not succeed at a check to Swim each round may drown.
Critical Success The creature takes no damage.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is moved 10 feet
along with the water.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is
moved 20 feet along with the water.
• Acidic Runoff This caustic flood dissolves flesh as it
moves, dealing 1d12 bludgeoning damage and 1d12+8 acid
damage. Additionally, it deals 2d6 persistent acid damage to
creatures who critically fail their Fortitude saves.
• Battering Waves This flood of rushing water deals 2d12+10
bludgeoning damage.
• Repulsive Refuse This flood has picked up tainted or
disease-ridden objects like sewer runoff or rotting food.
It deals 2d12+8 bludgeoning damage. Each creature
exposed to the flood must attempt a DC 29 Fortitude
save, becoming sickened 1 on a failure or sickened 2 on
a critical failure. Additionally, creatures who come into
contact with the flood waters are exposed to filth fever
(DC 20 Fortitude, Bestiary 258).
• Sharp Debris The waters have picked up various objects,
some of which are particularly sharp. The flood deals 1d12
bludgeoning damage and 1d12+12 piercing damage.
• Sticky Goo The substance is particularly sticky. It deals
2d12+6 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, each creature
in the flood must attempt a DC 29 Reflex save at the
beginning of their turn each round. On a failed saving
throw, they take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all
their Speeds for 1 round. On a critical failure, they are
instead immobilized for 1 round.

Description A whirling tornado of spectrally propelled glass and
steel slices whatever it touches to ribbons.
Disable DC 35 Thievery (master) to precisely adjust the blades
so that they destroy each other, or DC 38 Religion (expert) to
weaken the haunt; four successes are required to disable it
AC 33; Fort +27, Ref +25, Will +22
Hardness 20; HP 100 (BT 50); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage; Weaknesses positive 15
Whirling Blades [reaction] Trigger Three or more creatures enter
the area of the haunt; Effect sharp fragments lift up from
the ground and begin to spin in rapid circles taking up one
5-foot square. The haunt rolls initiative.
Routine (3 actions) The tornado of blades uses 3 actions to
move, traveling up to 30 feet with each action and dealing
2d10+10 slashing damage. Each creature in its path must
attempt a DC 33 Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage plus 1d10 persistent
bleed damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and 1d10
persistent bleed damage. It also becomes wounded 1 (or
increases its wounded value by 1, if it is already wounded).
Each successful check to disable this hazard reduces the
haunt’s movement by 30 feet, and the fourth success
disables it completely.
Reset The haunt draws jagged shards back into its area over the
course of an hour, after which it can trigger again.
DANCE OF DEATH
HAZARD 16
COMPLEX HAUNT
Stealth +32 (master)
Description An eerie orchestra compels all who hear it to dance
until they collapse from exhaustion.
Disable DC 42 Intimidation (expert) three times to frighten
dancers and spectral musicians alike away from participating
in the deadly performance, DC 40 Performance (master)
twice to produce a tune discordant enough to disrupt the
compulsion, or DC 42 Religion (master) three times to
banish the spirits with prayers
Prelude [reaction] (auditory, enchantment, incapacitation, occult)
Trigger A creature approaches within 30 feet of the
orchestra; Effect The orchestra compels all creatures that
can hear it to begin dancing. Each creature must attempt a
DC 41 Will save, with the following effects.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is flat-footed and cannot use
reactions. Additionally, it must spend 1 of its actions each
round dancing. Dancing is a move action that allows the
creature to Stride up to half its Speed.
Failure As success, except the creature must spend 2 of its
actions each round dancing.
Critical Failure As failure, except the creature must spend 3
of its actions each round dancing.
Routine (1 action; auditory, enchantment, incapacitation,
occult) The orchestra performs a raucous tune, compelling
all creatures that can hear it to spend actions dancing.
Each round, creature must attempt a DC 37 Will save; the
results of this save modify the number of actions that the
creature must spend dancing each round. If this would
cause the creature to spend more actions dancing than it
can use on its turn, the creature takes 10d6 damage (or
double that on a critical failure) from moving faster than
its body can manage.
Critical Success The creature decreases the number of
actions it must spend dancing by 1.
Success No effect.
Failure The creature increases the actions it must spend
dancing by 1.
Critical Failure The creature increases the actions it must
spend dancing by 2.
Reset The eerie orchestra spends an hour retuning its
phantasmal instruments, after which it is ready to begin its
routine again.

================================================================================

New items make great mementos of previous adventures
and tend to be one of the easiest elements for a character to
begin using mid-campaign after receiving them as a reward.
This section explains the philosophy and numbers behind
creating items so you can design your own in no time!
CONCEPT AND ROLE
First, come up with a concept for the item based on the role
the item serves in your game and in the game’s world. You
might include a new item in an ancient ruin to hint at the its
history and the people who used to live there. For instance, a
Thassilonian ruin might have an item based on rune magic,
while a Jistkan ruin might have an item related to golems.
A new magic item might be important later in the story,
or its role might be as simple as a fun wolf-themed item for
the monk that uses Wolf Stance. Keep your concept in mind
to guide you through the rest of the process. Start thinking
about what kind of magic item it will be. Each item type has
its own niche, and some are less likely to be as useful to the
PCs. For instance, new weapons and armor require the PC
to give up the weapon or armor they already have, which
might make them more reluctant to use the new items unless
they’re noticeably better, while consumable items don’t have
as big an impact on the story as permanent items.
ITEM LEVEL
A new item is typically going to be within a few levels of
the PCs. If it’s too low, it might not be interesting, and if it’s
too high, it might be too powerful or too lucrative to sell.
COMPARISON
First, take a look at similar items. For example, if you want
a permanent item that lets someone fly, look at the broom of
flying, which moves of its own volition to a location and thus
can’t be used to gain a huge advantage during combat, and
winged boots, which can. This will give you an idea of the
right level range and the different specifics and limitations of
existing items. You might even be able to just adjust one of
those a bit to get what you want with minimal work.
ITEM EFFECTS
Next, use the item’s concept and role to decide its effects.
This is where your creativity will bring the item to life. Make
sure to have it do something exciting and roleplay-inspiring.
A magic item that does nothing more than deliver a bonus is
far less interesting, even if the item does have a load-bearing
item bonus, like a magic weapon. To determine the item’s
power, take into account the special abilities you give the
item as well as the item bonus (if any) that it grants.
BUILDING ITEMS
Creating your own magic and alchemical items is an amazing way to customize the
adventure and gameplay for your group and add unique elements without requiring quite
the same mechanical depth as a whole new class, archetype, or ancestry.
For specific advice for the type of magic item you are
creating, check out Designing by Type on page 83.
SPECIAL ABILITIES
When deciding what special abilities are appropriate for
what level, it’s best to look for similar spells to gauge the
effect. For most consumables, the effect should be less
powerful than the highest level spell a spellcaster of the
item’s level could cast. Scrolls are about the most efficient
you can get—they’re the same level the spellcaster would
be—but they require a spellcaster that has the spell on their
list, and take the same actions as casting the spell normally.
The most straightforward choice is a once-per-day ability.
For this, the item’s level should be at least 2 levels higher
than the minimum level a spellcaster could first cast that
spell. For example, if your ability is about as powerful as
a 3rd-level spell cast once per day (perhaps haste), then it
should be at least a 7th-level item. A basic wand is a good
example. However, a wand is flexible and can contain the
most effective possible choice for its spell level (such as
long-lasting spells where once a day is effectively permanent),
so a specific item that doesn’t grant such a spell could have
additional powers or bonuses at the same price as a wand.
If the item can be activated multiple times per day, it
should be at least 4 levels higher instead—9th level in our
example. Frequency could range from twice per day to
once per hour and anything in between. Choose whatever
makes sense to allow the characters to use the item more
frequently without being effectively constant or unlimited.
The appropriate frequency, or whether it’s ever okay to
have unlimited activations, varies wildly based on the spell.
Unlimited castings of a cantrip is fine, but an effect akin to
a non-cantrip spell is rarely a good idea. Only attempt to
build such an item when you’re certain of the consequences.
Items that can be activated less often than once per day
don’t appear too often, and they usually fit best with abilities
that make sense outside of encounters. It’s still best to stick
to the guidelines for once-per-day abilities, but these items
tend to have more properties—and often strange ones.
Constant aBilities
If you want an effect to be constant, set the level and Price
accordingly. For instance, let’s say your group is 16th level
and you want to give them an item themed around flying.
A 7th-level fly spell lasts an hour already, so one casting
covers a significant portion of the adventuring day. To keep
it simpler, you decide to create a 16th-level cloak that lets
the wearer constantly fly. Remember, some effects were
never meant to be constant and could warp your game.

PAGE 84
================================================================================

aCtivation aCtions
Watch out when picking the number of actions an
activation takes! A 1-action activation that casts a spell
with a 2-action casting time is drastically more powerful in
an encounter than an item with a 2-action activation would
be. An item like that is typically much higher level, and it
works best with “helper” spells or ones with limited utility
rather than offensive spells. The safest bet is to use the same
number of actions the spell normally takes to cast.
sCaling out of usefulness
Some spells aren’t appealing if their level is too low. For
instance, an item that casts 1st-level burning hands three
times per day might be 5th or 6th level. The problem is that
spell scaling has the biggest impact at low levels, so the spell
isn’t effective compared to other actions a character could
take. Err on the side of fewer, more impressive activations.
BONUSES
If your item includes item bonuses, check the table below for
the minimum item levels the game’s math expects permanent
bonuses to be applied to. A lower-level item might give such
a bonus temporarily, but keep track to make sure the item
isn’t effectively permanent. If a character typically picks
three or fewer locks a day, there’s no difference between a
+2 item bonus to pick all locks and an activation that gives
a +2 item bonus to Pick a Lock three times per day.
For attack bonuses, AC, and saves, the minimums match
magic weapons and magic armor. You can have other items
with these bonuses (like handwraps of mighty blows), but
keep in mind they compete with fundamental runes.
Skill bonuses come on a wider range of items. Some are
more broadly useful, so an Athletics item might be more
expensive than an equivalent Society item. Gaining a bonus
to Perception is especially valuable compared to gaining a
bonus to a skill. Just because an item is the minimum level
for its bonus doesn’t mean the bonus should be the item’s
only power. The item can and should have an additional
interesting power beyond the bonus. Likewise, an item can
come at a higher level than the minimum, but if it’s much
higher, its abilities start to compete with the next bonus.

DESIGNING BY TYPE
The following guidance applies to items of various types.
ALCHEMICAL ITEMS
Alchemical items are consumables. Because alchemists can
make a large number for free, alchemical items tend to be
on the weaker end for their level, with lower Prices. Avoid
alchemical effects that feel too much like magic. Alchemy is
capable of fantastical things, but should have its own distinct
feel; where you draw the line depends on your game.
Alchemical bombs are like weapons for alchemists and
should usually primarily deal damage, with small extra
effects. Existing bombs are great models. Elixirs are varied;
make sure not to duplicate potions, especially highly magical
ones. Be careful with mutagen drawbacks; it’s easy to make
one that doesn’t affect certain characters. Look at the serene
mutagen. If its drawback didn’t affect spells, Wisdom-based
casters who didn’t use weapons would have no drawback.
Poisons are one of the trickier alchemical items to make,
and it’s usually best to just tweak one found in the Core
Rulebook to avoid making something that’s overpowered;
compare to poisons of the same type that have similar onset
and stage duration, as longer onset and duration poisons
tend to deal drastically more damage. Alchemical tools are
best used for adding a little weirdness. They can be especially
creative and interesting, but tend not to be powerful.
AMMUNITION
Magic ammunition is consumable; launching it destroys
it. Pay attention to whether you give the ammunition an
activation: any big flashy effect for its level should almost
always have one, since otherwise the effect is essentially a
free action on top of a Strike. This is particularly important
for extremely low-level ammunition, since a high-level
character could use that ammunition for every Strike
without noticing the gold cost. If the ammunition doesn’t
deal normal Strike damage on a hit, remember to say that!
Dealing damage is the default.
ARMOR AND WEAPONS
Specific armor and weapons replace the opportunity to add
property runes, so you have a lot of space to design. Choose
abilities that feel attached to the fact that they are weapons
or armor; for instance, a fiery sword that you point at an
enemy to shoot fire bolts is more on theme than a fiery
sword that casts wall of fire in an unconnected way.
The specific item should cost more than the base armor
or weapon would with just the fundamental runes,
but you can often discount the cost of the additional
components significantly as part of the specific item’s
special niche. Be careful about specific armor or weapons
that include property runes in addition to unique specific
abilities. If you discount the item, you might end up
with an item significantly superior to one built using the
normal property runes system. That’s not always bad,
since it’s still giving up customization for power, and this
can be appropriate if the item has an important place in
your story. Just make sure the difference isn’t too drastic.
If you just want to create armor or a weapon with runes
and no extra special abilities, you can do so. The Price
of such an item is the sum of all the runes’ Prices, and its
level is that of the highest-level rune on the item.

================================================================================

When picking abilities, you can also consider taking from
the relic gifts found on pages 96–105. Even if your game
doesn’t use relics, that section has plenty of choices sorted
by theme. If you do, keep in mind that relic abilities are
typically more powerful than usual for their level and that
those abilities wouldn’t scale on a normal magic item.
HELD ITEMS
Usually, held items should require manipulation to use, with
Interact activations. They are most often tools, implements,
items that can be thrown, and the like. Imagine a PC
physically using the item and what that looks like.
Remember that held items are more challenging for
martial characters to use, compared to spellcasters or
hands-free characters, like monks. A barbarian might have
to give up a two-handed weapon to use a held item, and so is
less likely to use one. This means you might want to design
held items specifically for non-martial characters, or have
them be items a martial character uses outside of combat.
OILS
Oils are consumables you slather onto items or, rarely,
creatures. They provide an interesting opportunity to apply
effects to other items. Just remember not to accidentally
make something that should be applied topically into
a potion; for instance, a petrified character can’t drink
an anti-petrifying potion! The actions an oil takes to use
depend on how thoroughly it needs to be applied. For one
used outside of combat, it could take a minute or more.
POTIONS
Potions are consumables in the truest sense; you literally
consume them. Since the action of drinking isn’t easy to
split up, they take only a single action to activate. This
advantage makes potions that replicate spell effects
incredibly powerful, and it’s the reason potions are nearly
always higher level than scrolls with similar effects.
RUNES
Property runes are a fun and versatile way to customize
weapons and armor without throwing away the previous
items. Each should be fairly simple, especially at lower levels,
because combining runes can make things overcomplicated.
Compare to other properties to determine the right level.
SCROLLS
You’ll never need to design a new scroll, but use them as
a comparison when designing other types of consumables.
If you’re designing a consumable that seems like it’s much
better than a scroll of its level—or faster to activate—you
should probably raise the item’s level or adjust the effect.
SHIELDS
Use the sturdy shields as benchmarks for the best possible
shield Hardness, HP, and BT for a shield of that level. Your
new shield should have less than those benchmarks since it
also does something else, and you can use the magnitude of
the reduction to build room for creative defensive abilities.
STAVES
You’ll need to come up with a theme and curate a list of
spells that stay close to that theme, typically one to three
per spell level, all on one spell list. A staff is always at least
3 levels higher than the minimum level for a spellcaster to
cast the highest-level spell it contains, so a staff with up to
4th-level spells would be at least a 10th-level item.
STRUCTURES
Structures are evocative and make great tertiary items,
quirky but not part of a combat build. This allows you to
price them affordably, but make sure there isn’t some hidden
abuse where the structure drastically alters encounters. The
structure trait is intended to help as a starting point.
TALISMANS
Because talismans are affixed ahead of time but don’t take
an action to retrieve, they reward forethought and planning.
Those that can be activated as a free action also have the
best action efficiency of any consumable. In the same way
scrolls reward specific spellcasters, talisman requirements
reward particular types of characters. Talismans might
grant a single use of a feat, with an additional effect if
the character already has that feat. Think of talismans
as martial characters’ answer to scrolls to expand on the
options of the non-spellcasters at your table.
WANDS
You won’t need to design basic magic wands, but you
might want a special wand. When designing a new special
wand, your wand’s level will usually be 1 to 2 levels higher
than the basic wand, depending on the magnitude of the
special effect. Remember that if you make the wand 2
levels higher, it’s now competing with wands of a spell a
whole level higher, so the special effect should be worth
that cost!
WORN ITEMS
Worn items vary wildly in their effects, but they all take up
one of a character’s 10 invested items. Remember to include
the item’s worn entry, if applicable (or — if you could
imagine someone wearing 10 or more with no difficulty).
POTIONS VS. ELIXIRS
Alchemical items and magic items follow a similar price
economy based on their level, but the effects of potions
can be a bit broader and more directly magical. Alchemists
can also make extremely large numbers of elixirs at an
item level equal to their alchemist level, so if a 17th level
elixir was competing with a 9th level spell for power, an
alchemist would be packing the equivalent of over 40 9th
level spells, and potentially quickened spells thanks to the
single action activation.

================================================================================

Where the item is worn should usually match its effects or
bonuses: shoes help you move, eyepieces affect your vision,
and so on. As with held items, imagine a character wearing
the item to picture how they use its magic.
Apex items are always at least level 17 and should have
unique abilities on top of their bonus, just like other items.
FILL IN THE NUMBERS
You’re almost done! The final step is to fill in the numbers.
DCS
Choose any DCs for the item’s abilities. You can’t go wrong
with the typical DCs in Table 2–18. However, an item with
a narrow function might have a DC up to 2 higher, and one
that forces a save (such as with an aura) is typically 2 lower.
The lower the DC, the quicker the item becomes obsolete.

ITEM PRICES
Use the following guidelines for pricing items.
PeRmanent items
Each item level has a price range. Based on the item’s role
and abilities, decide where in that range to place it. There’s
plenty of variation, and you primarily need to worry about
Price only if you expect the PCs will be able to sell it.
Primary items cost near the highest value for their level.
They have a big impact on combat or player ability. This
includes weapons, armor, and Perception items. The highest
price is for items like magic weapons, magic armor, and
apex items. So a +1 striking weapon is 100 gp at 4th level.
Secondary items, with middle values, give significant
secondary benefits or enhance highly consequential
noncombat or support skills like Medicine or Crafting.
Tertiary items, with low value, are weird or very
specific items, ones not usually core to a character’s build.
Especially strange ones might fall into the gap between
two levels.

the high end.

that a PC creates. Rather than rolling, you can instead
choose one yourself or invent a new quirk. Item quirks

effects should never grant more than a +1 item bonus or

applies to should be narrow. For a quirk that grants an
item the ability to speak, you choose the language based
on the history of the item, or your best guess of what that
history might be. It’s typically a language spoken by the
item’s creator.

INTELLIGENT ITEMS
Magic items with a mind of their own have been a hallmark of myth and fantasy for
millennia. When integrated into a campaign, they can become memorable characters in
their own right.
Intelligent items are a special kind of magic item that
straddles the line between treasure and NPC. An
intelligent item might be another type of item as well: it
could be an artifact (like Serithtial on page 112), a cursed
item (page 90), or even a relic (page 94) that grows with
its wielder.
Introducing an intelligent item is an effective
way to subtly alter the party dynamic. An
intelligent item works well when its personality
makes it a natural complement or foil for its
partner: the PC investing, holding, or otherwise
interacting with the item. An intelligent item
that can communicate only with that particular PC is
also a great way to engage players who are a bit quieter,
or those slower to speak in a scene where all the PCs can
talk to a particular NPC. Due to their inherently limited
agency, intelligent items are at less of a risk for stealing
the spotlight than other NPCs who travel along with
the party.
INTELLIGENT ITEM
RULES
Every intelligent item has the intelligent trait. Intelligent
items can’t be crafted by normal means—typically an
accident, a divine act, or a major sacrifice on the part
of the creator is required to grant the item the mental
essence it needs for sentience, and in some rare cases
the spiritual essence it needs to have a soul of its own.
Because of this, intelligent items are always rare or
unique. The normal statistics and rules for wearing
or using an item of its type still apply to an intelligent
item. In addition, intelligent items have a few statistics
other items lack.
ALIGNMENT
An intelligent item always has an alignment trait, just
like any other creature, even if it isn’t fully sapient. Few
intelligent items are capable of growing and changing
their alignment and fundamental nature; most are fixed
at the time of their creation.
PERCEPTION AND SENSES
An intelligent item that has any sense of the world
around them has a Perception modifier. Intelligent items
have only the senses listed within their entry, rather than
the assumed assortment of senses that most creatures
have. If an intelligent item notices something its partner
doesn’t, it might be able to communicate with its partner
and let them know.
COMMUNICATION AND LANGUAGES
Intelligent items almost always have some means of
communication—an easy way to demonstrate an item’s
intelligence! The most common ways are via empathy,
speech, and telepathy. Speech and telepathy function
as they do for any creature, while an empathic
connection allows the item to share only
emotions. Empathic and telepathic connections
are often limited either to the item’s partner or
to a certain distance.
If an intelligent item understands or speaks
any languages, they are listed in parentheses in
its Communication entry. If the item doesn’t have speech
listed, it can only understand the listed languages, not
speak them.
SKILLS
Intelligent items might have skill modifiers for
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skills that fit
their nature.
ABILITY SCORES
Intelligent items have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores, though as inanimate objects, they don’t have
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution entries.
WILL SAVE
Since they have their own minds, intelligent items might
be subject to mental effects that require a Will save.
ITEM AGENCY
As a default, intelligent items have control over all their
own magic, meaning an intelligent magic weapon could
deny the effects of its fundamental and property runes
if it so chose, and intelligent items perform their own
activations when they wish. Intelligent items can typically
use 3 actions per turn, acting on their partner’s turn. These
actions don’t count toward their partner’s 3 actions. They
have a reaction if any of their activations requires one.
Beyond denying magic effects and communicating
their displeasure, intelligent items can usually influence or
hinder their partners only in subtle ways. If the item is a
weapon or tool necessary for an action (like thieves’ tools),
it can at least be disruptive enough to make its partner take
a –2 circumstance penalty to associated checks, much as if
the partner were using an improvised weapon or tool. If
an intelligent item can have a greater effect, such as seizing
control of its partner’s body for a time, the intelligent
item’s entry includes those abilities.

================================================================================

DESIGNING INTELLIGENT
ITEMS
When you first set out to create an intelligent item, ask
yourself what role you expect the item will play in your
game. Unlike any other item, the intelligent item is a
character of its own and adds to the group dynamic,
usually in ways similar to a minor NPC who follows the
party throughout the adventure. That means it’s important
to have a clear role in mind. Is the item an ally in the PCs’
dangerous quest? A kindred spirit and confidante? A foil
for the PC? A morally ambiguous ally worth handling for
its great power? Or perhaps a bit of comic relief? Once
you know what you want in the item, you can develop
its personality and abilities in parallel, coming up with
thematic links between them.
When choosing values for the intelligent item’s
statistics, you’ll often want to use values suitable for a
creature of its level. You could use much lower values
if you want to give it a weakness, but keep in mind that
a low Will modifier might make it particularly easy to
control, which could be a problem if it can make life
miserable for its partner. Because the item can usually
activate its abilities on its own, the intelligent item is
essentially adding a limited additional character to the
PCs’ team, so consider its effect on the encounters the
PCs face. For example, a high-level normal item that
lets a PC cast a 3rd-level fireball every round might be
reasonable given that it counts toward the PC’s available
actions, but an intelligent item is adding that fireball on
top of everything else the PCs can do.
SPECIFIC INTELLIGENT
ITEMS
The following, as well as the intelligent artifact Serithtial
on page 112, are a few example intelligent items to get
you started.
GENIUS DIADEM
ITEM 18
RARE
N
APEX
ARCANE
DIVINATION
INTELLIGENT
Usage worn circlet; Bulk L
Perception +22; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30
feet, constant detect magic
Communication speech (Common, Draconic, and eight other
common languages)
Skills Arcana +34, seven Lore skills +28, Occultism +28,
Society +28
Int +8, Wis +0, Cha +4
Will +24
The genius diadem is a diadem of intellect that typically acts
like an arrogant professor or mentor, often boasting that it
is a certified greater intellect and far superior to your own
intelligence, even after the benefits the diadem grants you. The
genius diadem encourages you to learn things for yourself
rather than actually attempting to Recall Knowledge for
you, though you or your allies might be able to play on its
arrogance using Deception to trick it into doing so. In addition
to allowing you to activate it, the diadem can use the diadem
of intellect’s hypercognition activation with its own actions,
though if it does so, the diadem gains the benefits instead of
you. Only the diadem can use the following activation.
Activate [two-actions] (command, Interact) Frequency once per hour;
Effect The genius diadem casts 7th-level feeblemind.
MARTYR’S SHIELD
ITEM 7
RARE
LG
ABJURATION
DIVINE
INTELLIGENT
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Perception +12; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet
Communication speech (Common and Celestial)
Skills Diplomacy +15, Religion +13
Int +0, Wis +2, Cha +4
Will +15
A martyr’s shield is a lesser sturdy shield imbued with the
compassion of a devout champion of a righteous deity, like
Iomedae or Vildeis, who sacrificed themself to save an ally. In
addition to good-naturedly attempting to convert you to its
religion, the martyr’s shield can use 1 reaction each round that,
when raised, it uses to Shield Block to protect an ally adjacent to
you, with the effects of the Shield Warden feat (Core Rulebook
112). The martyr’s shield uses this reaction whether you would
prefer it did so or not. The martyr’s shield can be upgraded to a
stronger form of sturdy shield by paying the difference in cost
between its current type of sturdy shield and the new type.
SINGING SWORD
ITEM 5
RARE
CG
ENCHANTMENT INTELLIGENT
OCCULT
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Perception +11; precise vision 30 feet, imprecise hearing 30 feet
Communication speech (Common and four other common
languages)
Skills Performance +15
Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4
Will +13 (+17 against attempts to quiet its singing)
A singing sword is a +1 striking longsword imbued with the
consciousness of a boisterous bard, and therefore constantly
sings at all times. A singing sword can’t stop singing and
in fact communicates in no way other than by singing. A
successful Diplomacy or Intimidation check against its Will
DC can convince it to quiet its singing to a whisper for 10
minutes, or 20 minutes on a critical success, though it quickly
grows displeased at anyone who attempts this repeatedly.
The singing sword can spend its actions to attack on its own,
with the effects of a dancing weapon’s activation, except
that its attack modifier is +12. Additionally, it can perform
the following activations; each casts a composition spell and
follows all the usual rules for compositions.
Activate [one-action] (command) Frequency once per minute; Effect The
singing sword casts inspire courage.
Activate [one-action] (command) Frequency once per minute; Effect The
singing sword casts inspire defense.
Activate [reaction] (command) Frequency once per hour; Trigger You or
an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory
effect; Effect The singing sword casts counter performance.

================================================================================

Cursed items are almost never made intentionally; even
those who set out to curse an item find the task incredibly
difficult or even impossible. These items are the results
of magical mishaps, shoddy crafting, or sinister forces
interfering with the creation. Many specify how
their curses work, but curses are fickle, and you
as the GM determine how curses play out in
your game. Due to these factors, an item with
the cursed trait is always rare.
Identifying Cursed Items: Cursed
items often appear to be ordinary
magical items, as the magic that
warps their function also disguises
their curses from detection. Unless
you roll a critical success when
Identifying a cursed item, it simply
appears as something helpful or
benign. A critical success reveals
both the presence of the curse and the
exact nature of the curse.
Removing Cursed Items: Many cursed
items can’t be discarded. Some use magic to
fuse to the wielder, making it impossible to remove the
item, while others attune to their owner and return even
if discarded. (This section uses the term “fuse” to describe
either situation.) In many cases, this feature reveals itself
only after the cursed item has been triggered for the first
time or after investing the item for the first time, allowing
the user to develop a false sense of security. Fused cursed
items can be removed by targeting the item’s owner
with a remove curse spell or similar magic. If the spell
is successful, the item can be discarded, but nothing
prevents the item from cursing the same creature again
if the conditions are met, so it’s best to dispose of the
item quickly. Invested cursed items that can’t be removed
continue to count against a character’s invested items,
even without reinvesting them each day.
SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS
The following are a few examples of cursed items.
BAG OF DEVOURING
ITEM 7+
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This item appears to be and functions as a bag of holding,
but is actually a feeding orifice of a bizarre extradimensional
creature. Any animal or vegetable matter put in the bag has a
chance of triggering the bag’s interest. Whenever you reach
into the bag to retrieve an item or place an animal or plant

While magical items can be potent weapons in any adventurer’s arsenal, magic can be
unpredictable and is not always benign. Cursed items are unusual magical creations that
have a malicious effect on the unwary and can force its wielders into difficult choices.
(or animal or plant product) within the bag, roll a DC 9 flat
check. On a success, the bag ignores the intrusion. On a failure,
the bag devours the triggering material, removing it from this
realm of existence; the bag can’t eat artifacts or other similarly
hard-to-destroy items. If the triggering material is
not entirely inside of the bag, such as when someone
reaches a hand inside, the bag of devouring attempts
to pull it completely inside the bag using a Grapple
action, with an Athletics bonus determined
by the type of bag. On a success, it devours
the victim or object entirely.
Type I; Level 7; Athletics Bonus +15; acts as
a type II bag of holding
Type II; Level 11; Athletics Bonus +21; acts
as a type III bag of holding
Type III; Level 13; Athletics Bonus +24;
acts as a type IV bag of holding
BAG OF WEASELS
ITEM 4
RARE CONJURATION CURSED
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
This item appears to be and functions as a type I
bag of holding, until you try to retrieve an item from the bag.
Whenever you retrieve an item from the bag of weasels, roll
a DC 11 flat check. On a success, you retrieve the item as
normal. On a failure, the item you retrieve is transformed into
a weasel; this doesn’t affect artifacts, cursed items, or other
hard-to-destroy items.
This weasel has the statistics of a giant rat (Pathfinder
Bestiary 276), except that it is Tiny and exudes an aura of
transmutation magic. The weasel has no loyalty to you and
typically attempts to escape as quickly as possible. If the
weasel is targeted with a remove curse spell or a similar
magical effect, it transforms back into the original item that
was taken from the bag of weasels. If it dies or is slain, the
weasel disappears and the item is permanently destroyed.
Because the weasel is a transformed item, you don’t gain any
benefit you would receive from attacking a creature, defeating
one, damaging one, or the like, but you do gain any benefit
you would gain from destroying an item.
BOOTS OF DANCING
ITEM 11
RARE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn shoes; Bulk L
These boots act as greater boots of elvenkind, but they react
wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots,
the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check
or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter.
The boots cast an 8th-level uncontrollable dance spell on you,
BAG OF DEVOURING

================================================================================

and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse
has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
CLOAK OF IMMOLATION
ITEM 7
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
Appearing as a magic cloak such as a cloak of
elvenkind, this garment is made of highly volatile
fabric. While wearing it, if you take fire damage,
you also take 1d10 persistent fire damage. Taking
fire damage while the persistent fire damage is in
effect has no additional effect. You can extinguish
the persistent fire damage as normal.
Any creature that hits you with a melee unarmed
attack while you are taking this persistent fire damage
takes fire damage equal to the persistent fire damage you
took on your previous turn. Once the curse has activated for
the first time, the boots fuse to you.
GLOVES OF CARELESSNESS
ITEM 7
RARE
ABJURATION
CURSED
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn gloves; Bulk L
These gloves appear and function as gloves of storing but
repel any item not stored in the gloves. When wearing them,
whenever you Interact to draw or pick up an item, roll a DC
11 flat check. On a success, you do so as normal. On a failure,
you instead fling the item 15 feet in a random direction. You
can use a reaction to attempt a DC 23 Reflex save, causing the
item to land at your feet instead if you succeed. Removing the
stored item from the gloves does not trigger the item’s curse.
The first time the curse activates, the gloves fuse to you.
MEDUSA ARMOR
ITEM 14
RARE
CURSED
INVESTED
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn armor; Bulk 3
This +2 adamantine scale mail appears to have a fortification
rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically
hit, after taking damage, you become petrified for 1 round.
Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses
to you.
MONKEY’S PAW
ITEM 20
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
MISFORTUNE
 NECROMANCY
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This dried, gnarled hand is clenched in a fist, waiting for
a creature to pick it up. When you pick up the monkey’s
paw, the hand opens, revealing three withered fingers. The
monkey’s paw grants you three wishes, curling one finger
after every one. Once you pick up the monkey’s paw, you
cannot discard the hand until it returns to a clenched fist
by casting its three wishes. Any attempts to discard the
hand, even with the effects of a miracle or wish spell, are
unsuccessful as the monkey’s paw reappears among your
possessions within 1d4 hours; it doesn’t work for any
other creature in the intervening time. The hand returns
even if another creature steals it from you. Once you make
all three wishes, the monkey’s paw uses
plane shift to travel to a random point in
the multiverse.
Whenever the monkey’s paw hears you utter a
statement that sounds like a wish, even if you don’t
use the words “I wish,” it activates and grants a twisted,
horrifying version of your wish, producing any effect within
the possibility of alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, or
wish, and potentially a greater effect at the GM’s discretion.
NECKLACE OF STRANGULATION
ITEM 15
RARE
CURSED
INVESTED
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn necklace; Bulk L
This beautiful necklace appears to be a magical item such
as a necklace of fireballs or a pendant of the occult. When
invested, it magically locks in place, suspiciously tightly, and
fuses to you. When you enter a situation of extreme stress
(as determined by the GM), the necklace tightens around your
neck, suffocating you (Core Rulebook 478) and dealing 30
bludgeoning damage to you at the end of each of your turns.
Once per round, you can spend a single action to attempt a
DC 34 Athletics check or Fortitude save; success means you
don’t take the damage on your current turn, but you continue
suffocating. The necklace loosens after you’ve been dead for
a month.
POISONOUS CLOAK
ITEM 13+
RARE
CURSED
INVESTED
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn cloak; Bulk L
This innocuous-looking cloak is associated with a type of
poison, set at the cloak’s creation. It often appears as a
clandestine cloak or a cloak of the bat to the unaware. When
you invest this cloak, you lose any resistance to poison
damage, and anytime you take piercing or slashing damage in
combat, you are exposed to the type of poison associated with
the poisonous cloak with no onset, even if it’s not an injury
poison. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the
cloak fuses to you.
Type I; Level 6; Poison giant scorpion venom
Type II; Level 10; Poison wolfsbane
Type III; Level 13; Poison purple worm venom
Type IV; Level 17; Poison hemlock
RING OF TRUTH
ITEM 10
RARE
CURSED
 ENCHANTMENT
INVESTED
MAGICAL
Usage worn; Bulk —
This ring appears to be a ring of lies, but when invested, close
investigation reveals angelic wings and divine creatures
hidden on the face of the ring. When you invest the ring, you
are rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech
or writing. If you attempt to omit the truth or phrase things
truthfully but deceptively, roll a DC 11 flat check; on a failure,
the ring itself blurts out the entire truth (as you believe it) as
an answer. Keeping silent does not activate the ring’s curse.
Once the curse has activated for the first time, the ring fuses
to you.

STONE OF WEIGHT
ITEM 2
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Also known as a loadstone, this small stone appears non-
magical and has a lovely sheen, giving the impression that
it could be a valuable or a notable item or a magic stone of
some kind. When you’ve carried the stone on your person for
1 minute, its curse activates: the stone’s size does not change,
but it suddenly increases in weight to 5 Bulk. This additional
weight does not cause the stone to deal more damage if
thrown or used as a weapon. It reappears in your possessions
within 1 minute if you discard it, and can’t be destroyed or
thrown away permanently, or even placed in a container that
would reduce or negate its Bulk (like a bag of holding), until
it is subject to a remove curse spell or similar magic effect.
Once the curse has activated for the first time,
the stone fuses to you.
ITEM CURSES
Most curses alter a base item. Item curses alter their base
item, much like a property rune, though they can’t be
detected or identified unless a creature critically succeeds
at a check to Identify the Item. A curse can be applied to
the specific types of magic items listed in its Usage entry.
Curses typically can’t be removed or transferred from the
item, though at your discretion, either might be possible
after the curse is broken. If the PCs manage to break the
curse, the newly uncursed item could be quite valuable.
ARROW ATTRACTING
CURSE 8
RARE
ABJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage curses armor or shield
An item affected by an arrow attracting curse protects you
normally, but it draws ranged attacks like a magnet. Whenever
a creature within 120 feet misses with a ranged attack, it
must immediately reroll the attack against your AC, affecting
you depending on the result of the new attack roll. The arrow
attraction curse activates only if you could have been a
legitimate target. Creatures that intentionally attempt to miss
a ranged attack do not activate an arrow attraction curse. Once
the curse has activated for the first time, the item fuses to you.
ARSONOUS
CURSE 7
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
FIRE
MAGICAL
Usage curses a ring, staff, or wand
An arsonous curse creates flaws in the mystic pathways
that channel magic through an item, allowing excess
power to escape as sparks. Whenever you activate
the magic item, a random ally within 30 feet
takes 1d10 persistent fire damage. If no ally
is in range, you take the damage instead. At
the GM’s discretion, this curse might ignite an unattended
object or the surrounding environment instead.
BACKBITING
CURSE 4
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
A weapon with the backbiting curse warps space
in response to catastrophic mishaps. Whenever
you critically fail at a Strike with this weapon,
the weapon curls around (or its projectile
swerves through the air) to strike you in the back
as though you hit yourself, automatically dealing
maximum damage to you.
BLOODBITER
CURSE 6
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
 NECROMANCY
Usage curses a piercing or slashing weapon
A bloodbiter weapon is awakened by
violence and fueled by blood. When you make
a successful attack with the weapon, it inflicts a
wound that deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage (in
addition to its normal damage), but it also deals 1d6
persistent bleed damage to you. The curse remains
POISONOUS CLOAK
Gamemastery Guide
92

PAGE 94
================================================================================

dormant until the weapon hits a creature, at which point black
thorns protrude from the weapon and dig into your body; the
weapon fuses to you and you can’t use the hand that holds
the weapon for any other purpose. If the weapon is
two-handed, it attaches itself to only a single hand
(GM’s choice).
DEGENERATING
CURSE 5
RARE
ACID
CURSED
 NECROMANCY
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
Failure makes the weapon crumble. Whenever you
critically fail an attack roll with the weapon, the
degenerating curse deals 1d10 acid damage to the
weapon, ignoring its Hardness and resistances.
DEPENDENT
CURSE 9
RARE
CURSED
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage curses gear used for skills or a weapon
The dependent curse makes an item function properly only under
certain circumstances. Whenever you use the item to perform a
skill check or use the weapon in combat, your degree of success
is one worse than the result you rolled unless those specific
conditions are met. The most common types of dependent
curses are nocturnal or diurnal—functioning normally only
at night or only during the day, respectively—but more
restrictive curses do exist, such as a curse that restricts
the item’s use to underground or a curse that allows the
item to function effectively only during autumn.
DREARY
CURSE 3
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage curses armor
When you invest this armor, a personal-sized cloud appears
over your head and begins to rain on you, and the armor
fuses to you. This extinguishes uncovered flames and
soaks other objects you are carrying or holding, potentially
ruining them. Cold conditions are one step worse
under the cloud, and at the GM’s discretion it
might cause other problems, such as interfering
with sleep.
ERRATIC TRANSPOSING
CURSE 11
RARE
CONJURATION
CURSED
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
This curse bursts with uncontrolled teleportation magic
when activated, unreliably transporting creatures across
the battlefield. On a critical hit with the affected weapon,
you and an ally within 60 feet (chosen randomly) teleport
to switch places with one another. If either of the affected
creatures is unable to entirely fit within its new space, the
creature is placed in the nearest available squares instead.
GRANDSTANDING
CURSE 11
RARE
CURSED
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
Weapons with the grandstanding curse inspire overconfidence
in their wielders, demanding style over pragmatism. Whenever
you reduce a foe to 0 Hit Points, you lose all remaining actions
on your turn, as you are compelled to flourish, gloat, pose, or
otherwise waste your time in response.
OVERDRAMATIC
CURSE 5
RARE
CURSED
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage curses a weapon
The weapon flashes excessive light with each attack.

================================================================================

RELICS
Some extraordinary magic items grow in power along with a character, gaining abilities
that add to an adventurer’s legend. These are called relics, and owning one can define a
character more than any other magic item could.
Relics begin as a simple item, called a relic seed, which is
little more than a functional item with a minor magical
effect associated with it. As the owner of the relic grows
in power, so does the relic. It develops gifts, which are
new magical abilities and activations. These abilities
might be themed to the relic, the character, or the nature
of the campaign. If a relic is passed to another character,
this process begins anew, sometimes granting the same
abilities again over time, but possibly unlocking entirely
new powers. If someone else takes the relic from its
owner, it usually works for a while, though it might lose
its power incrementally over time if not returned to its
owner. How the relic changes in such a circumstance is
up to you, and should fit the story.
The decision to add relics to the game is entirely up to
you as the GM. If you decide to add them, you’ll need to
adjust treasure somewhat. It’s also wise to consider how
many players you expect to end up with relics. Will they
each get one? Or will there be just one or two tied to the
theme of the campaign?
DISCOVERING A RELIC
Some relics might begin as ordinary items with a rich
history. They might be part of a character’s starting gear,
only to have their true powers uncovered later during play.
Other relics can be acquired during play as part of the
ongoing story. Regardless of their origin, these powerful
items might not appear to be much at first, but they contain
the potential to become something truly great.
For example, an old, tarnished amulet found around
the neck of a buried king might turn out to be an item of
deep historical significance that awakens to great power.
The seemingly ordinary family sword, passed down to
each new generation, might unlock hidden potential
through the deeds of its owner.
The PCs might immediately recognize a relic for its
ability, or they might carry it for a time before its true
nature becomes apparent. The story of a relic should be a
tale of discovery. At first, a relic’s wielder likely does not
fully understand the item’s power, or might be unable to
use it, learning of its abilities only after a momentous event
or fortuitous breakthrough. Ultimately, relics are powerful
tools in service of the story, working as a valuable tie to
the narrative, but their growth and development are in your
hands. Because of the place relics hold in the story, they
aren’t available for purchase, nor can they be crafted.
Pay attention to the characters’ backstories for potential
relics, and look for spots in your narrative that might be
suitable for campaign relics. If you’re planning to use
relics in your game, let the players know in advance,
since their ideas and plans can guide you and
give them greater investment in the relics.
BACKGROUND RELICS
A background relic is tied to the history of a character,
and its form and abilities should draw inspiration from
the story of their character’s life or the past of the item.
The relic could be a gift from a friend or mentor, an
heirloom from the character’s family, a found object
from their upbringing, or even the first item they ever
crafted. The player should select the form of the relic
(a battered longsword, a copper ring, or a threadbare
red cloak, for example).
CAMPAIGN RELICS
A campaign relic is drawn from the ongoing story of the
campaign. You decide the entirety of the item, from its
Gamemastery Guide
94
94

PAGE 96
================================================================================

form to its aspects (described below) as part of the story
of the campaign. Use campaign relics to reinforce and
foreshadow the themes of your game. Relics come to those
who need them to do great deeds, after all, so finding a
relic with the perfect aspects for your future challenges is
entirely likely. Unlike background relics, campaign relics
typically have magical abilities when first found.
RELIC ASPECTS
Each relic is associated with aspects—typically two—that
speak to its overall concept and purpose. The individual
gifts each have an associated aspect. You should almost
always select gifts that have an aspect matching one of
those found on the relic. For example, a brass dagger
recovered from the City of Brass might have the fire and
mind aspects, which means that it could have the flare bolt
gift (which has the fire aspect), but not the rolling geode
gift (which has the earth aspect).
Usually you can determine at least one aspect of a relic
easily by looking at the history of the item or personality
of the character. For example, if a player decides that their
background relic is a rusty mace wielded by the character’s
great grandmother in battle against rising undead hordes,
the mace might have the life aspect, as it was used to slay
countless undead creatures. There’s no harm in letting the
player choose an aspect for a background relic; through
play, the item will reveal another aspect associated with
it. In the previous example, the mace might reveal itself
to have powers against demons as well, in which case its
aspects might be celestial and life.
ADVANCING A RELIC
As a relic’s bearer performs mighty deeds and advances their
story, the relic gets stronger. The most basic advancement
for a relic is its level, which always matches that of its
owner. Weapons and armor can gain fundamental runes
normally. You decide what, if any, property runes can be
added to a given relic; by default, they can’t have property
runes, like any other specific item.
The more complex advancement comes from gifts.
Table 2–22: Relic Gifts shows the typical number of gifts
a relic should have at a given level, but relics don’t follow
this strictly. Rather, gifts arise according to the pace of
the story, the needs of the campaign, and the relationship
between the character and the relic. Generally speaking,
this results in a relic gaining one gift for every 4 levels
its bearer has, but this might fluctuate as the campaign
progresses. For example, a relic might gain its first gift at
4th level after the bearer defeats a powerful foe. It might
then gain its second at 7th, after they perform a special
ritual. That same relic might not gain another gift until
13th level and then again at 16th as the player reaches
other major milestones.
The gift types—minor, major, and grand—indicate
their general power level. Again, the table indicates what’s
generally appropriate at certain levels, but you can alter them
as you see fit. You should usually avoid giving a minor gift at
10th level or higher, because it just won’t be that impressive,
though some of them scale well enough to be interesting at
higher levels. The Gold Piece Equivalent entry for each gift
helps you determine how much you should reduce treasure
when using relics (see Adjusting Treasure below).
TABLE 2–22: RELIC GIFTS

9th
Major
700 gp

4

Major

5

Grand

You decide what gifts a relic gains, generally by either
selecting a single gift or offering two paths for the relic to
grow and allowing the player to choose, but this should
be informed by the story and the nature of the character
bearing the relic. A relic should complement the bearer,
bolstering the bearer’s strengths and helping to overcome
their weaknesses. Within that framework, you should try to
maintain a cohesive theme for the relic.
ADJUSTING TREASURE
When you incorporate relics into your game, you can
adjust the treasure gained by the party down to account
for the relics increasing in power. Essentially, some of
the treasure from Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level
on page 509 of the Core Rulebook should be replaced
with relic seeds and gifts instead. You can use the relic’s
minimum level, replacing a permanent item of that level,
or you can use the gp equivalent. Keep in mind that relic
gifts are often a little more powerful than other items
with the same Price even when they start out, and they
often scale without any additional costs, so PCs with
relics will usually be a bit more powerful.
If you prefer, you can grant relics in addition to other
rewards. This means PCs will be much more powerful,
but you’re rewarding their investment in the story.
MAKING RELIC SEEDS
A relic seed can be quite simple: imagine a standard
item with two aspects and an appearance that matches
the theme. You can also use an existing magic item for
a campaign relic; pick two aspects for it, and tweak its
appearance or characteristics to make it clearly different
from other items of its type. You can choose a tradition
for the seed and apply that trait to the seed and all the
gifts of the seed. This tradition might be derived from
the background of the item, or it might appear or change
through story moments involving the relic.
If you want a relic to have an additional special benefit,
you can design it to grant a bonus to a skill, typically a +1
item bonus for a 3rd-level relic.

================================================================================

RELIC GIFTS
Gifts are divided up into three tiers. Minor gifts grant useful,
often scaling abilities and are available early in a character’s
career. Major gifts define a relic, determining its true purpose
and granting powerful abilities. Grand gifts are the pinnacle
of power, and most relics never have more than one.
The more gifts there are of one aspect, the more the
relic reflects that aspect, and the more influence the aspect
has on the character who wields it. An item with multiple
shadow gifts might begin to lose its color. With four or
five, the character that wields it might take on an ashen
tone and the relic might become entirely made of shadow.
GIFT SAVES AND SPELL ATTACK ROLLS
Many gifts allow for a saving throw or have other abilities
that change as the relic goes up in level. The DC for any
saving throw called for by a gift is its owner’s class DC or
spell DC. The spell attack modifier of a gift is 10 lower than
that DC. A relic’s counteract modifier is equal to its owner’s
counteract modifier.
AIR GIFTS
DEADLY SPARK
MINOR GIFT
AIR
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
Aspect air
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect A spark flashes out
from the relic toward a creature within 20 feet. This spark

every 4 levels thereafter.
FEATHER STEPS
MINOR GIFT
AIR
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect air; Prerequisites The relic is a worn item.
While wearing the relic, you do not trigger traps that use weight
or pressure plates as a trigger. Also, whenever you fall, you
reduce the falling damage by the level of the relic. If this would
reduce the falling damage to 0, you land on your feet and are
not prone. The relic grants a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks
made to Jump, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level.
WIND BARRIER
MINOR GIFT
ABJURATION
AIR
Aspect air

turn. At 13th level, this increases to a +3 circumstance
bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
LIGHTNING STORM
MAJOR GIFT
AIR
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
Aspect air
Activate [two-actions] command; Effect The relic surrounds you with a
storm of wind, rain, and lightning in a 30-foot emanation.
This storm is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
Any creature other than you that enters or starts its turn
in the storm takes 1d12 electricity damage, with a basic
Reflex save (2d12 damage at 15th level). You can Sustain
this Activation up to 1 minute.
PROPELLING WINDS

whichever is greater. In addition, a creature that Strikes you
with a melee attack takes 5 electricity damage, and you can
cast 5th-level lightning bolt as an innate spell.
BEAST GIFTS
BEAST SENSES
MINOR GIFT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect beast; Prerequisites The relic is a worn item.
The relic grants you an animal’s acute senses as long as you
wear it. You gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light
vision, you instead gain darkvision. At 10th level, the relic
grants you imprecise scent with a range of 10 feet.
CALL OF THE WILD
MINOR GIFT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect beast
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect
Your relic summons a creature to fight at your side, casting
summon animal with a level of half the item’s level rounded up.
You can Sustain this Activation as you would the spell.
PLAYER-DRIVEN RELICS
Though these rules assume you as the GM are providing relic
gifts as a form of treasure with input from the players, you can
instead have the players make all the decisions for their relics.
Encourage the players to choose different styles of items and
aspects to match their characters’ themes, rather than simply
choosing the most powerful combination of options. Have
players describe how their relic gets more powerful in the
story. What acts from previous sessions lent the relic power?
What special meditations or practices did they perform to
unlock new gifts? How does it feel to have the relic grow?
As the item and the character level up, the player
chooses which gifts the item gets from the list as a part of
character advancement. You still adjust treasure as normal
for incorporating relics into your game. In fact, if the player
tries to optimize the combinations, they will likely be more
powerful than under the standard method.

you, transforming you into the same type of animal every
time, chosen when the gift is gained; the spell level is half
the item’s level, rounded down.
At 11th level, the spell is 5th level, and the spell level goes
up by 1 for every 2 levels beyond that.
TRACK OF THE BEAST
MAJOR GIFT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect beast
RUNES AS GIFTS
You can substitute runes for gifts. If you choose to allow property runes on the relic, you’ll want them to take up rune slots. Otherwise,
you can give as many or few as you prefer, just like any other gifts. Runes are sorted into minor, major, and grand categories, but you
should use their normal level and Price when you adjust treasure, instead of the number and levels on the Table 2–22. If you’re using
the player-driven relics variant, it’s recommended you do not include this option.
The spirit of an animal fills you. The relic gives one of the following
benefits, chosen by the GM when the relic gains this gift.
• A +10-foot status bonus to your land Speed.
• A climb Speed equal to your land Speed.
• A swim Speed equal to your land Speed.
FORM OF VENGEANCE
GRAND GIFT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect beast; Prerequisites form of fury gift
Whenever you use the relic’s form of fury activation, it can cast
aerial form or dinosaur form instead of animal form. Like form of
fury, these spells also turn you into the same type of animal each
time (so you have three forms you can assume in total, one from
each spell). The spell level is the same as defined in form of fury.
While transformed, you can switch from one of the three
forms to another by Sustaining the Activation. This doesn’t
change the duration.

GOOD
Aspect celestial
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect Your relic shines with
holy light. This creates bright light in a 30-foot emanation
around the item. Evil creatures in the
area are frightened 1, and can’t lower
their frightened value below 1 as

evil damage. If the relic has
the righteous call gift, this
activation grants the effects
of that gift as well, without
expending its daily use.
You can Dismiss the effect.
If you do, you can unleash a

the alignment.
DEATH GIFTS
DEATH GAZE
MINOR GIFT
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Aspect death
Activate [two-actions] envision, Interact; Effect Your stare causes a
creature’s flesh to rot and wither away. Target a creature
you can see within 30 feet. Your stare deals 1d6 negative
damage to the creature for every 2 levels the relic has
(minimum 1d6; basic Fortitude save). An undead creature
or other creature with negative healing targeted this
way is instead healed 1d6 HP per level of the relic and is
temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes.
LIVING DEATH
MINOR GIFT
NECROMANCY
Aspect death
You stand on the threshold between
the living and the dead. If you attempt
a saving throw against an effect that
would deal negative damage to you,
such as harm, your outcome is one
degree of success better than what you
rolled. If you roll a critical success and
the effect is capable of healing undead,
you regain HP equal to half the spell’s full
damage. Any positive spell or effect that would
heal you has only half the normal effect. All these effects
apply only if you are a living creature.

make you paralyzed, poison, and sleep effects. In addition,
the DC for your recovery checks is 9 + your dying value
instead of 10 + your dying value.
PIERCE THE VEIL
MAJOR GIFT
NECROMANCY
Aspect death; Prerequisites living death gift
The relic allows you to pierce the veil
between life and death. While you are
holding or wearing the relic, you have
the negative healing ability (as though you
were undead; positive energy harms you
and negative energy heals you). In addition,
whenever you are healed by a negative spell or
effect, you gain resistance 5 to all damage (except
force, ghost touch, and positive) until the start of
your next turn. Finally, you gain a +2 item bonus
to all saves against death effects while you are
the bearer of the relic; this increases to a +3 item
bonus at 13th level.
TIDE OF DEATH
MAJOR GIFT
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Aspect death; Prerequisites death gaze gift
You can Activate death gaze with 3 actions instead of 2. If
you do, it targets all living creatures within 30 feet except for
you. If you have the negative healing ability, you can include
yourself to be healed.
GRIM SPECTER
GRAND GIFT
NECROMANCY
Aspect death
Activate [two-actions] command, envision; Frequency once per day;
Effect You can call upon the terrifying powers that fuel
your relic to transform yourself into a specter of death.
You become incorporeal, having no physical body. You are
immune to effects that require a physical body, including
precision damage as well as exposure to most diseases
and poisons. You also have resistance to all damage
equal to half the relic’s level; force damage, ghost touch
attacks, negative damage, and positive damage ignore
this resistance, and the resistance doubles against
non-magical damage.
You can move through solid objects. When inside an
object, you can’t perceive, attack, or Interact with anything
outside it, and you’re always slowed 1 on turns you start
in an object. Corporeal creatures can pass through you
but can’t end their movement in your space. You can’t
attempt Strength-based checks against corporeal creatures
or objects, unless those objects have the ghost touch
property rune. Likewise, corporeal creatures can’t attempt
Strength-based checks against you.
You can Sustain the Activation up to 1 minute.

you increase your maximum Bulk by 2. At 6th
level and every 4 levels thereafter, increase the
Bulk you can carry before becoming encumbered
by 1 and your maximum Bulk by 2.
ROLLING GEODE
MINOR GIFT
CONJURATION
EARTH
Aspect earth
Activate [two-actions] command, envision; Frequency once per

your foes. You create a geode in an unoccupied square
within 30 feet. You can spend a single action, which has
the concentrate trait, to move the geode up to 30 feet
along the ground. If the geode enters a creature’s space,
the creature must succeed at a basic Reflex save or take
2d6 bludgeoning damage; a creature can take damage this
way only once per turn, even if you roll the geode through its
space multiple times. The geode persists for up to 1 minute or
until destroyed or Dismissed; it has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40
Hit Points, and is immune to critical hits and precision damage.

A 10-foot-radius patch of stone or earth within 60 feet is
transformed into difficult terrain. A creature that enters
an affected square during a move action must succeed at
an Acrobatics check or Reflex save or take 1d6 piercing
damage; it needs to roll only once per move action even if
it moves through several squares. At 6th level and every 4
levels thereafter, increase the damage by 1d6.

relic conjures a magical shard of silver, cold iron, gold,
or a non-precious stone or metal material of your choice
(such as bronze or granite). If your relic is a weapon,
it immediately absorbs the shard, causing it to gain a
magical sheen of that metal or stone until your next daily
preparations. If your relic is not a weapon, the shard is not
immediately used, and you can touch it to a stone or metal
weapon using an Interact action to give it a magical sheen
of that metal or stone for 10 minutes. While
coated in the magical sheen, the weapon
interacts with weaknesses, resistances, and
the like as if it were made of the stone or metal
from the shard rather than its own. The sheen and the
shard are obviously magical in nature, and if you don’t
use the shard, it disappears when you make your next

following activation.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision; Frequency once per day;

Effect Your eyes become attuned to heat signatures as
your vision extends into the infrared, granting you a
heatsight precise sense for 1 minute. Your heatsight can see

lesser flames and allowing you to kindle even the smallest

level of the effect, in addition to taking the damage.

critically hit by or critically fails a save against a fire effect
and is not reduced to 0 Hit Points; Effect Flames roar forth
from the triggering creature, dealing 6d6 fire damage to
all creatures in a 15-foot burst centered on it, including
that creature (basic Reflex). You aren’t affected by the
activation, though your allies are. If this damage reduces
the triggering creature to 0 Hit Points, it is reduced to a fine

level equal to one-half the relic’s level and appropriate to
the object (so a broom would become an animated broom).

single-mindedly and uncreatively. The object remains
animated for 1 hour.

per casting that a particular spell heals you.

POSITIVE
Aspect life
Your connection to life force makes you more difficult to
snuff out than others. You die from the dying condition

MAJOR GIFT
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Aspect life
Activate [reaction] envision; Trigger An ally within 60 feet regains
more Hit Points than it is currently down via a targeted
positive healing effect without a duration; Effect Your relic
acts as a relay for vitality. You or an adjacent willing creature
regain a number of Hit Points equal to the amount in excess
of the triggering creature’s maximum Hit Points; for instance,
if the triggering creature was missing 5 Hit Points and was
targeted by a heal spell that restored 12 Hit Points, you or
an adjacent willing creature would regain the remaining 7
Hit Points.

Massive amounts of positive energy surge forth. For 1
minute, you emit positive energy in a 10-foot emanation
centered on you. At the end of your turn, you (if you are
living) and allied living creatures in the emanation regain 10
Hit Points. If you or an allied creature would die due to an
increased dying value, you can Dismiss the activation as a
free action to prevent the death; if you do, their dying value
doesn’t increase.

LINGUISTIC NEXUS MINOR GIFT
DIVINATION
MENTAL
Aspect mind
Your relic grants you a powerful
neural plasticity, and as a
result, you can learn languages

Your relic is imbued with the psychic impressions of ages
past. While the relic is on your person, you are trained in 3
additional Lore skills of the GM’s choice that fit the relic’s
history, decided at the time of gaining this gift. If the relic is

skills, and if the relic is 17th level, you have master proficiency
in these Lore skills.

save, after which the creature is then temporarily immune
for 1 day.

================================================================================

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes a –2 status penalty to Perception
checks to Seek or otherwise detect you.
Failure You filter all of the creature’s senses, making it
difficult for it to notice you. When you are hidden or
undetected from the creature, it doesn’t observe you
as soon as you do anything other than Hide, Sneak, or
Step. If it rolls a Perception check to Seek or otherwise
detect you, it gets the outcome one degree of success
worse than what it rolled, and if you roll a Stealth
check to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise escape its
attention, you get the outcome one degree of
success better than what you rolled against the
creature. If you use a hostile action toward the
creature, the effect ends for that creature
after your hostile action is completed.
Critical Failure As failure, but the effect
doesn’t end for that creature if you use
a hostile action against it.
PSYCHIC SCREAM MAJOR GIFT
DIVINATION
MENTAL
Aspect mind
Activate [two-actions] envision; Effect Your thoughts build before
spilling forth in a powerful telepathic scream. Enemies

Your relic takes over some of your mental
processes and enhances others. You gain
telepathy; if you already have telepathy,

You are permanently quickened
and can use the additional action to
Recall Knowledge.

MINOR GIFT
HEALING

Your relic grows potent natural medicines. Each night,
two medicinal herbs (or other plants) grow from your relic
and can be harmlessly harvested during your next daily
preparations. A living creature that consumes an herb with
an Interact action regains 1d8 Hit Points for every 2 relic
levels (minimum 1d8). At 9th level, the relic grows three
herbs each night, and at 17th level, the relic grows four herbs

MAJOR GIFT
PLANT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect plant
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect Your relic launches a sticky,
multi-stranded vine at a target within 50 feet. Make an
attack roll as you would when using a grappling hook,
but if you roll a critical failure on the check to secure the
vine, you get a failure instead. Once the vine is anchored,
creatures receive a +1 status bonus to Athletics checks to
Climb the vine, and they gain a +5-foot status bonus to the
distance they move with a successful check while
Climbing using the vine.
The vine lasts for 1 day or until you use
Grappling Vine again, at which point your
older vine withers.
PETAL DANCE
MAJOR GIFT
PLANT
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect plant
Activate

You discorporate into a cloud of
petals and leaves. This grants you the

to bludgeoning and slashing damage, and weakness
5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces
only a few inches wide, moving your constituent petals
through the gap. You don’t gain the swarm mind ability,
so you are still affected normally by mental effects. As
a swarm, you can’t speak, cast spells, use manipulate
actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items,
or make any of your Strikes with your normal body. You
remain in this form for 1 minute or until you Dismiss the

MEGAFLORA
GRAND GIFT
CONJURATION
PLANT
Aspect plant
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect With a pulse of natural energy,
your relic grows massive plants
in an instant. The megaflora is
of one of the following types,
chosen by the GM when the
relic gains this gift. A megaflora
appears in an unoccupied 10-foot
space within 30 feet and has
50 Hit Points, weakness to
fire 5, 37 AC, +20 Reflex, and
+30 Fortitude. It persists for
1 minute or until reduced to 0
Hit Points.
• Corpseflower A single putrid-
smelling flower grows at the
target location. While the
flower persists, each round
at the end of your turn, all
creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the plant
except you must succeed at a Fortitude save or be
sickened 2 (also stunned 2 on a critical failure). This is a
poison effect.
• Thorns A 10-foot-tall thorned plant or bamboo stalk
grows at the target location. While the stalk persists,
each round at the end of your turn, sharp stakes erupt
from the ground, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all
creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the plant
except you (basic Reflex)
• Tree of Life A large tree bearing life-giving fruit grows
at the target location. While the tree persists, living
creatures within reach of the tree can use an Interact
action to pick and eat one of the tree’s fruits, regaining
2d8+5 Hit Points; picking a fruit without eating it
causes the fruit to instantly vanish. This is a healing
effect, and a given creature can heal from the tree only
once per round.
SHADOW GIFTS
ENCOMPASSING DARKNESS
MINOR GIFT
CONJURATION
SHADOW
Aspect shadow
The shadows at your feet can hold objects. You can Interact
with your shadow to store or remove objects, just like you
would a mundane container. Your shadow can contain 3
Bulk of objects, which don’t count toward the Bulk you are
carrying. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can
store 1 additional Bulk of objects in your shadow. While the
items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you
gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal
the Objects unless someone knows to check your shadow
for items.
OBSCURE
MINOR GIFT
ILLUSION
SHADOW
Aspect shadow
Your relic absorbs light and wraps shadow around you, hiding
you in darkness. As long as you are in dim
light in an area of shadows, you can attempt
a Stealth check to Hide, even if you aren’t
concealed against the creature, such as with
a creature with darkvision.
SHADOW SMITH
MINOR GIFT
CONJURATION
SHADOW
Aspect shadow
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect Your relic
pulls at nearby shadows, twisting
them into the shape of a simple
weapon or a simple tool or item, such as
a rope or crowbar. It lasts until it is used
for a single activity, until you use shadow
smith again, or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after
which it dissipates.
DANCING SHADOW
MAJOR GIFT
SHADOW
EVOCATION
Aspect shadow; Prerequisites The relic is a weapon.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per hour;
Effect Your relic’s shadow detaches from your relic and
dances through the air to attack an enemy. When you
Activate the relic, designate a target. The relic’s shadow
flies up to 60 feet until it is adjacent to that foe and
then makes a Strike against it, dealing 5d8 damage on a
success or double that on a critical success; the damage
type is of any type normally dealt by your relic. The
shadow uses your attack bonus with the relic, and it uses
and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. While this
activation is in effect, you can use a single action, which
has the attack and concentrate traits, to mentally direct
the shadow to make another Strike against the same
target. The shadow lasts until that target is reduced to
0 Hit Points, that target moves more than 400 feet from
you, or that target moves to an area where no shadow
could be cast, such as an area of complete darkness,
whichever comes first.
The shadow doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have
any other attributes a creature would, and it automatically
follows the chosen foe. The shadow can’t make any attack
other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons
do not apply to it.

path from your shadow to a nearby one, teleporting you
and any items you’re wearing or holding from your current
space to an unoccupied one within 30 feet that you can
see. You can’t use the dark roads gift again for 1d4 rounds.
If the destination is not within an area of bright
light, the range is instead 60 feet. If this would bring
another creature with you—even if you’re carrying it
in an extradimensional container—the gift fails.

SHADOW
TRANSMUTATION
Aspect shadow
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect Shadowy essence

lashing current weapon Strikes with your relic, which deal 1d4

and versatile S traits; and are in the flail group. Your lashing
current Strikes gain the benefit of your relic’s fundamental

can use another Interact action to return to your normal grip
and make Strikes with the relic.

following effects.
• If a fire effect crosses through the wall,
it either uses the outcome one degree of
success worse than the result of its attack
roll or its targets use the outcome one degree of
success better than the result of their saving throw, as
appropriate.
• Creatures with a weakness to water that cross the wall
or start their turn in the wall take damage equal to
their weakness.
• The wall imposes a –2 status penalty to Perception
checks to sense creatures or objects on the other side.

activation to absorb water from a touched creature made
entirely of water, like a water elemental. If you do, it takes
1d6 damage per relic level (basic Fortitude save).
Activate [reaction] Interact; Trigger You are targeted by an acid

the effect, expending 1 gallon of stored liquid. At the GM’s
discretion, you can use this ability on effects made of other
liquids, such as blood.

================================================================================

Stranger and more powerful than other magic items,
artifacts can change the course of history in the right
hands—or the wrong hands. Simply finding an artifact
is a pivotal moment in your campaign, and its presence
then ripples throughout your entire game, warping the
story around it. Some entire adventures revolve around
one artifact!
Adding an artifact to your game should never be taken
lightly. Artifacts shouldn’t be found in normal treasure
hoards, even at 20th level, and you’ll need to structure
moments in your plot that play into the artifact’s presence.
Prepare yourself for encounters being easily overcome
by the artifact. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t include
such encounters, since part of the thrill of an artifact
is that it breaks the normal rules! Though you should
include an artifact mindfully, you should allow it to have
its full impact so that it can do itself and the story of your
game justice.
ARTIFACT RULES
Every artifact is an item with the artifact trait. This trait
means two things: the item can’t be crafted by normal
means, and it can’t be damaged by normal means.
Artifacts are always rare or unique. The ones found here
are all 20th level or higher, which is typical for artifacts.
The other rules for wearing or using the item still apply.
ARTIFACT DESTRUCTION
An artifact’s stat block usually has a destruction entry.
This details the extraordinary method needed to destroy
the item. These entries can be highly specific. It could take
completing an entire quest, or even an entire campaign,
to finally destroy an artifact. However, the story of your
game might require something different, so you can
always change an artifact’s destruction requirement for
your game.
CREATING AN ARTIFACT
Mechanically, an artifact functions in the game just like
any other item—only the scope of its abilities is different.
Artifacts can and should do things normal items can’t,
so you don’t need to apply the normal limitations on
creating items.
When you’re making an artifact, start by defining its
role in the story. Is it meant to be a powerful weapon
against the forces of darkness? A mercurial force
injecting random chance? A terrible danger that needs to
be destroyed? The artifact’s role in the story affects the
ARTIFACTS
A globe of utter darkness that consumes all things. Powerful weapons created in antiquity
carrying the hopes of an entire people. A simple deck of cards representing fortunes both
transcendent and deadly. These are artifacts—items of incredible power, spoken of in
thousands of stories and beyond the capability of modern people to create.
features you give it. Come up with some story beats that
make sense for the item, then create abilities that enable
those moments. An artifact can have more abilities than a
typical item—just make sure they all fit its theme.
Give your item the artifact trait and either the rare trait
(if there multiple items of its kind), or the unique trait (if
only one exists). Other traits work like they do for any
other item. An artifact is usually 20th level or higher, but
its specific level is up to you. Imagine who created it and
what their level likely was.
Though you can disregard most of the normal
limitations on items, be careful not to create an artifact
that will undermine your story. If your item’s abilities are
so useful or strong that the best option in any battle is
to always use the artifact to annihilate the opposition, the
artifact has taken over your story instead of serving it. A
5th-level character with access to 10th-level spells through
an artifact can lead to incredible stories, but if the DC is so
high that enemies are guaranteed to critically fail against
those spells except on a natural 20, the item will probably
distort play more than you intended. To avoid this, you
might set the item’s DCs, attack bonuses, and the spell levels
of its offensive abilities significantly lower than they would
be for an item of its level, especially if they can be used at
will. You could also create artifacts that use the wielder’s
spell DC instead of having their own DC, to make them
more broadly usable at a wider range of levels. In addition,
an artifact’s abilities should be somewhat narrow in their
application; aim to make your artifacts very powerful in
certain situations, rather than having broadly applicable
abilities. For instance, the orbs of dragonkind each work
against only a certain kind of dragon, which makes them
hugely powerful when facing that one creature, but not
against every foe the PCs run across.

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 3
The blade of this +4 major striking keen returning speed
dwarven waraxe is carved with an intricate design depicting
countless generations of great dwarven warriors and leaders.
The axe has the thrown 30 feet weapon trait, in addition to
the normal weapon traits for a dwarven waraxe. Strikes with
the axe deal an additional 1d6 damage to orcs. While the axe

is in your possession, you gain a +4 item bonus when Crafting
armor, jewelry, metalworking, stonemasonry, snares, traps,
and weapons. If you are a dwarf, you gain greater darkvision
(Core Rulebook 465) while holding the axe. If you are not a
dwarf, you are stupefied 4 while holding the
axe, and if you are an orc, you are also drained
4 and enfeebled 4 while holding it.
Activate [three-actions] envision, Interact; Frequency
once per week; Effect The axe casts a
10th‑level summon elemental spell to
conjure an elite elemental avalanche
(Bestiary 6, 147). The spell is automatically
sustained, requiring no action on your part but
still allowing you to command the elemental on each of
your turns. You can Dismiss the Spell.
Destruction If an orc beheads a dwarven king with the Axe of
the Dwarven Lords, the axe rusts away to nothing.
DECK OF MANY THINGS
ITEM 22
RARE
ARTIFACT
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
These 22 cards of heavy vellum, usually stored in a box or a
pouch, bear images or glyphs depicting symbols of magical
power. Looking at a card without activating it shows the card face
but has no magical effect. Once the deck is face down, the cards
randomize themselves—if you look at the top card multiple
times, you may find it changes. Any card removed from the
deck goes missing after a few seconds, reappearing in the
deck. Advice on randomly selecting cards appears on page 108.
Activate [one-action] envision, Interact; Effect You declare how many
cards you will draw facedown from the deck, then draw your
first card. The card takes effect immediately. Any further cards
must be drawn within the next hour, and any card
you don’t voluntarily draw flits off the deck and
affects you anyway. You can never activate
the same deck of many things again.
Once a card is drawn, it produces its
effect immediately and then disappears
back into the deck, which immediately
shuffles itself. (The Dullard and
Jester are exceptions, as described
in their entries below.)
The effects of each card are
as follows.
• Balance Your alignment
changes to a radically
different one. If you fail to
adhere to that alignment, you lose a
level and all the benefits you gained at that
level. Your XP total doesn’t change when you lose a
level this way.
• Comet If you alone defeat the next low‑threat or harder
hostile enemy or enemies you encounter, you gain enough
XP to reach the next level. Otherwise, you gain no benefit.
• Donjon You’re imprisoned by a 10th‑level imprisonment
ritual. This uses the prison option, typically sequestering
you in a distant part of the world. You also lose all your
items. Cease drawing cards.
• Dullard Immediately reduce your Intelligence score by
1d4+1. You can then draw an additional card, and the
Dullard card then disappears forever.
• Euryale (curse) A medusa’s image curses you
with a permanent –1 status penalty to all
saving throws. This can be removed by only
a deity or the Fates card.
• The Fates The Fates respin the fabric of
reality to save you from any situation you
choose. This can reverse even a past event,
and you can make the decision instantly even
if the event would slay you. This intervention
saves only you, not anyone else affected by
the event. There’s no limit on how long you
can wait before using this effect.
• Flames A fiend becomes filled with anger, jealousy, envy,
or some other reason to despise you. Its hatred for you
doesn’t cease until either it or you is dead. It attacks you
or otherwise attempts to foil you within 1d20 days. The
GM determines the specifics of the fiend.
• Fool You lose 1d10×100 XP unless you choose to draw
two more cards.
• Gem Gain your choice of 25 pieces of jewelry worth 200
gp each or 50 gems worth 100 gp each.
• Jester You can either draw two more cards or gain
1d10×100 XP. The card then disappears forever.
• Key Gain a magic weapon of 12th level or higher. The GM
determines the item and what runes it has, if any.
• Knight A palace guard (page 206) arrives and swears
unfailing loyalty to you.
• Moon Roll 1d4 to determine how many wishes the card
grants you, which also affects the phase of the
moon depicted on the card (1: crescent moon;
2: half moon; 3: gibbous moon; 4: full moon).
These wishes each take one action to speak
and have the effect of a wish spell.
• Rogue One NPC ally becomes filled
with hatred and immediately turns
against you forever. The NPC
might keep this hatred secret until
an opportune moment.
• Ruin You lose all your non‑
magical possessions, including
any wealth and property.
• Skull You must immediately battle a lesser death
(Bestiary 197). If slain in the battle, you can never be
revived, except by a deity.
• Star Gain an ability boost you must use immediately on
one ability score of your choice.
• Sun Gain 1,000 XP and a beneficial permanent magic
item of 6th to 11th level, chosen by the GM.
• Talons All your magic items disappear permanently, except
for the deck and any artifact of higher level than the deck.
• Throne You gain a permanent +4 status bonus to

Diplomacy checks, and you now own a small castle in
any open area you wish. You must choose its location
within 1 hour.
• Vizier Upon request, you can learn the solution to any
one problem or the correct answer to any one question,
unless that information is obscured by a deity. This doesn’t
necessarily give you the means to act on that solution. You
have 1 year to take the vizier’s advice or lose its benefits.
• The Void Your mind becomes trapped forever. This card
is fickle, but it often throws the psyche into a prison in
an object on a distant plane or planet. Wish or similarly
powerful magic can reveal your psyche’s location, but it
doesn’t bring you back. Your comatose body continues to
function. Cease drawing cards.
Destruction Trick the Grim Reaper into drawing the Skull card.
ELDER SIGN
ITEM 25
RARE
ABJURATION
ARTIFACT
OCCULT
Usage held in one hand; Bulk 1
This stone tablet is carved with the symbol of a five‑branched
twig. There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each
time one is destroyed, the universe’s doom creeps inexorably
closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (DC 20
Occultism check to do so correctly) allows three different
activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected
to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or
gug; the activations refer to them as “eldritch creatures.”
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder
sign casts a 10th‑level banishment spell on an eldritch
creature. Even if the creature isn’t extraplanar, the elder
sign can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the
Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a
Great Old One, the elder sign banishes it automatically (as
if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder sign
casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature,
using a counteract level of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.
Activate [two-actions] command, envision, Interact; Effect The elder sign
casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only
eldritch creatures. Each time the elder sign casts dimensional
lock in this way, the previous dimensional lock spell ends.
Destruction The only way to destroy an elder sign is to use it
to banish a Great Old One.
ESSENCE PRISM
ITEM 28
UNIQUE
ARTIFACT
TRANSMUTATION
Bulk 5
This enormous, multifaceted prism normally rests on a
pedestal, eerily refracting many‑colored lights even when no
light source is present. In reality, the prism refracts the four
magical essences into the visible spectrum (see page 300 in
the Core Rulebook for more on the four essences). A creature
adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact
action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow
from two input streams into the prism, where the prism
combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a
single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and
is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and
stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly
encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until
anyone reverses the prism’s flow or finishes activating the
prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is
gently pushed back and out of the stream.
Activate [two-actions] Interact; Requirements The prism has only one
input stream; Effect You alter and rearrange the facets of the
essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single
quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like
a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality;
vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like
an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must
succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated
with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for
instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane
and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you
accidentally set the prism for some other quality.
Activate 1 minute (Interact); Requirements The prism has only
one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in
the input stream; Effect Over the course of the next hour,
the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted
through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the
output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end
of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two
new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is
part of the original, separated from the rest based on the

last quality set by the prism’s first activation. For instance,
if you set the prism to “good,” one creature would have all
the original creature’s good aspects and the other would
be the original creature’s evil side. Unless you selected a
physical quality, both new creatures look just like the
original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower
than the original, but if the original creature was strongly
biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance,
if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the
stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is
3 or more levels lower. If calibrated correctly, this activation
can also reverse the effect of the third activation.
Activate 1 minute (Interact); Requirements The prism has two
input streams, and a
creature is encased
in magic in each of the input
streams; Effect Over the course of
the next hour, the essences of both
creatures in the input streams are
refracted through the prism, creating a
cocoon of magic in the output stream
that contains a new creature. At the
end of the process, the original
creatures are gone, and the new
creature breaks free of its cocoon.
The new creature is an amalgam of
the originals, with a new personality
blended from both, and is usually
1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the
original creatures unless the lower‑level creature
was much weaker. This activation also reverses the
effect of the second activation.
Destruction Forcing the essence prism to combine two
incompatible demigods destroys the prism, though it might
also result in a new divinity.
FORGEFATHER’S SEAL
ITEM 24
RARE
ABJURATION
ARTIFACT
DIVINE
Usage etched onto armor
This rune was created by Torag, god of the forge, protection,
and strategy, and shared with his greatest artisans and
warriors. Torag designed a small number of these seals as gifts
to allied good deities; each one is nearly identical but has a
different spell effect when using the reaction activation; for
instance, Sarenrae’s seal casts sunburst instead of earthquake.
A seal constantly rings with the quiet sound of a hammer
striking an anvil when etched onto a runestone. A Forgefather’s
seal can be etched only onto armor that can bear two or more
property runes, and it is so powerful that it takes the place
of two property runes. While wearing armor etched with a
Forgefather’s seal, you gain fire resistance 40. You ignore
the armor’s check penalty and Speed penalty (if any); if the
armor is light or medium, increase its item bonus to AC by 1.
In addition, any shield you wield automatically recovers 10 Hit
Points at the start of your turn each round.
Activate [reaction] Interact; Frequency once per hour; Trigger You
are hit by an attack; Effect The Forgefather’s seal glows
and your armor shakes as it absorbs the blow. The attack’s
damage is reduced by 100 and you cast earthquake
(DC 40), centered directly on the triggering creature. You
decide the area of the earthquake when you Cast the
Spell, from as small as the size of the creature and up to
a 60‑foot burst.
Activate [three-actions] Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect You
call upon on the restorative powers of the seal to repair
an item within reach. The rune instantly restores the item
to full Hit Points, even if the item was destroyed, using
the effects of the remake spell, so long as the majority of
the item is available for
the repair. The seal can
restore even magic items and
artifacts of its level or lower. Once
you have used this ability, the seal’s
ability to automatically repair shields
becomes inactive until the next time
you make your daily preparations.
Activate [free-action] envision; Trigger You
have not acted yet on your turn;
Effect You call upon Torag to
defend your allies and those
around you, sacrificing yourself
in the process. Creatures of
your choosing within 60 feet
recover all their Hit Points. If any
of the creatures are dead, they are
instead brought back to life with half of their
maximum Hit Points. The chosen creatures also
gain a +4 status bonus to AC and saving throws,
and fast healing 15 for 1 hour. You can use this ability
to bring back to life a creature that requires a miracle
spell or divine intervention to raise from the dead, as long
as you choose no other creatures within 60 feet to recover.
Once you use this activation, you are turned into a perfect
statue made from stone or metal that depicts you in a
glorious pose honoring your sacrifice, and you can never be
restored. The Forgefather’s seal remains on this statue and
can be transferred to another suit of armor or a runestone
as normal.
Destruction Using the Forgefather’s seal ability to bring the
dead back to life on an evil demigod causes it to shatter in a
violent explosion that destroys the seal and the statue made
as part of the sacrifice, erasing all knowledge of the user from
existence. It does, however, bring the evil demigod back to life.

damage to you every round. If you die from this damage, you
rise as an undead of an equal level in 1d4 rounds.
Activate [free-action] envision; Trigger You touch a creature as part
of an unarmed attack or melee spell attack roll; Effect The
creature takes 5d6 negative damage. If you are an undead,
you regain Hit Points equal to the negative damage the
creature took.
Activate [three-actions] command; Frequency once per day; Effect
The Horns of Naraga transform into Naraga, an ancient
black dragon (Bestiary 106). Naraga appears in an adjacent
appropriate space, and if no such space is available, she
does not appear. Naraga follows your commands without
question. She remains for up to 1 hour or until you use an
Interact action to dismiss her, after which she reverts
back to the helm. If Naraga is slain, she immediately
reverts back to the helm and can’t be summoned
for 1 week. You don’t receive any of the helm’s
other benefits while it is transformed.
Destruction The helm is utterly obliterated if
crushed between the jaws of an ancient black
dragon’s skull located in a desert while the sun
is at its zenith.
MIRROR OF SORSHEN
ITEM 25
UNIQUE
ARTIFACT
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
Usage bonded (see below); Bulk L
The silvery glass of this oval mirror displays
alluring sights. Its dark wooden frame is
studded with small green gems and is carved
with the shapes of a male figure on one edge of
the glass and a female figure on the other side.
The mirror can form a bond with a spellcaster who
has legendary proficiency in Arcana or Occultism, who
becomes the mirror’s owner. Regardless of where the
mirror is, as long as the bond remains, the owner is
aware of everything the mirror is currently reflecting
and can use the mirror’s activations.
Whenever an intelligent creature looks in the
mirror, they see an image of a person, creature,
or item they find irresistible—most often one they
find attractive. The specific image varies depending on the
observer, even when more than one creature is looking into
the mirror at the same time. Observers are fascinated by
the images in the mirror unless they succeed at a DC 35
Will save each round. On a failure, they stare blankly at
the mirror for as long as it remains in view, and if it leaves
their view, they stare toward the last place they saw the
mirror for several minutes thereafter. This is an emotion,
enchantment, incapacitation, and visual effect. Creatures
that are fascinated by the mirror are so deeply entranced
that they don’t end their fascinated condition automatically
even if a creature uses hostile actions against them or their
allies; instead, they can attempt a DC 30 Will save to end the
fascination. At the GM’s discretion, a truly innocent creature
or a creature that has renounced all worldly pleasures might
be immune to the mirror’s fascination.
Activate [two-actions] envision (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation,
visual); Effect You force a creature looking at the mirror
to attempt an additional Will save against the mirror’s
fascination effect, even if they succeeded at their save.
Activate
[three-actions]
command
(emotion,
enchantment,
incapacitation); Requirements The target must be
fascinated by the mirror; Effect You control the target for
30 days, with the effect of a critically failed saving throw
against dominate. If the victim sees the mirror again at any
point before this duration expires, the control extends for
an additional 30 days from the moment it looked at the
mirror again. While there is no initial saving throw, the
DC to break free due to commands against the creature’s
nature is 35.
Destruction The Mirror of Sorshen shatters into a thousand
pieces if an intelligent but completely innocent creature
resists the mirror’s attraction and then accidentally
drops it.
ORB OF DRAGONKIND
ITEM 25
UNIQUE
ARCANE
ARTIFACT
ENCHANTMENT
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Each of the legendary orbs of dragonkind
contains the essence and personality of a
powerful dragon, with each of the 10 most
famous orbs preserving a different type
of metallic or chromatic dragon’s spirit. It
is believed that orbs for other types of true
dragons exist, though that theory is yet to
be confirmed.
While holding an orb of dragonkind, you are
immune to the breath weapon of the dragon variety
associated with the orb. An orb of dragonkind also grants
a number of additional senses. You can communicate
verbally and visually with the bearers of other orbs as
if you were in the same room with them. You know if
there are any dragons within 10 miles of you at all
times; this extends to 100 miles for dragons of
the type associated with the orb. If an associated
dragon is within 1 mile, you know which direction the
dragon is from you and the dragon’s age, such as young, adult,
or ancient. Each orb grants a 10th‑level arcane innate spell
that you can cast at will, determined by the specific orb.
The Orb of Gold Dragonkind can convey the innate spells of
any of the other orbs, as well as their activated abilities, but it
can grant each individual power only once per day. In addition,
the bearer of the gold orb can use its 3‑action activation to
attempt to cast dominate on the bearer of another orb if
they are within 1 mile, as if that bearer were a dragon of the
associated type within 500 feet. The last reports of the Orb
of Gold Dragonkind on Golarion indicate the orb has been
destroyed, however. GMs running campaigns in settings other
than the Age of Lost Omens might decide the gold orb is still
intact for their campaigns.

of all dragonkind forever because you profited from the

with the orb within 500 feet, except
the effect lasts for 1 month rather
than unlimited. The dragon does not
receive its status bonus to saving

You breathe an elemental blast that deals 25d6 damage (DC

line (your choice). The breath’s damage type matches the
Breath Weapon of the dragon type associated with the orb
of dragonkind (acid for the black orb, electricity for the blue
orb, and so on).
Destruction An orb of dragonkind violently shatters and
explodes when exposed to the Breath Weapon of a dragon
who is a descendant of the dragon trapped within. The
explosion deals damage as the 2‑action activation above to all
creatures within 90 feet.
PHILOSOPHER’S EXTRACTOR
ITEM 28
RARE
ARTIFACT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Bulk 8
This bizarre machine is a complex arrangement of flasks, tubes,
and other alchemical equipment. The philosopher’s extractor
is designed to create the ultimate alchemical concoctions.
The extractor functions as an exceptional set of alchemist’s
tools, granting a +4 item bonus to Crafting checks related to
alchemy. When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item
or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations,
you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable
alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value
possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum
damage with alchemist’s fire or restoring the maximum
number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable
item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an
impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback.
Activate [three-actions] Interact; Frequency once per minute; Effect
You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of
your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor
can create 56 levels’ worth of items per day in this way.
For example, the extractor could create two true elixirs of
life (19th level) and two moderate elixirs of life (9th level),
or eight comprehension elixirs (7th level), and
so on.
Activate 1 hour (Interact); Effect You
take a sizable portion of a creature (at
least two‑thirds of its original mass)
and filter it through the mechanisms
of the extractor. After the end of the
process, the philosopher’s extractor
creates a transmogrifying mutagen that
imparts the essence of the creature to the
drinker. The extractor can make several
transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously
using the same activation if enough mass is
provided at once, up to a maximum of 10
concurrent mutagens. Drinking a
transmogrifying mutagen imparts
you with one of the creature’s
unique abilities for 1 hour. This
could grant one of several abilities
such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon,
darkvision, flight, frightful presence,
or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for
the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your
spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature’s DC.
The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature’s
physiology and never grants magic‑related abilities such
as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately
decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants.
Unlike normal for mutagens and polymorph effects,
you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and
gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying
mutagens made from different creatures, you receive
abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple
transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of
creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls,
you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying
mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from
that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional
concoction you drink.
However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if
you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one
other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a
flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active
transmogrifying mutagens you’ve consumed. On a failure,
you fully transform into a member of the species of the
latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost
always go berserk from your change. The transformation
may leave some amount of your personality and memories
intact, at the GM’s discretion.
Destruction Simultaneously feeding the philosopher’s
extractor sizable portions of an aeon, angel, archon, azata,
daemon, demon, devil, protean, and psychopomp, each of at

She glows as bright as a torch, but you or Serithtial
can suppress or resume this glow as a single action,
which has the concentrate trait. In addition, Strikes with
Serithtial deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures
that are worshippers of Zon‑Kuthon, and while wielding
Serithtial, you constantly benefit from death ward and
freedom of movement spells that function only against
effects created by followers of Zon‑Kuthon.
Serithtial was forged as a bastard sword, and she
reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she
can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder
prefers and transform into it (choosing from dagger,
shortsword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword,
rapier, or bastard sword) using an action, which she
does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell
Serithtial to transform at any time by using a single
action, which has the concentrate
trait, after which Serithtial uses an
action to transform.
Serithtial is willing to work with a
partner of almost any alignment as long as they
are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the
forces of Zon‑Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue
your own agenda instead, before long Serithtial attempts to
seize control of your body (DC 45 Will save to resist her
control), though she typically remains in control for only
long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt
a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.
Activate envision; Frequency once per hour; Effect Serithtial
spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th
level heal or zone of truth spell (DC 45 for either of the
two spells).
Destruction If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who
is a worshipper of Zon‑Kuthon uses its breath weapon on
Serithtial while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool
of mundane iron.
SHOT OF THE FIRST VAULT
ITEM 23
RARE
ARTIFACT
DIVINE
EVOCATION
Ammunition any
Legends claim that some long‑forgotten god stole the original
bundle of shots of the First Vault from Abadar’s repository.
Since then, individual pieces have turned up throughout
the multiverse. When you pick up a shot of the First Vault,
it immediately reshapes itself to function with any ranged
weapon and establishes you as its owner until another
creature picks it up. As its owner, you can use the shot’s
single‑action activation after shooting it.
Instead of rolling weapon damage dice, a shot of the
First Vault deals 25 damage plus any bonuses or additional
damage as if 25 were the result of the weapon’s damage
dice; the damage type matches that normally dealt by
the weapon. Upon damaging a creature, the shot of the
First Vault shatters, and the fragments ricochet to hit
any other enemies within 30 feet, making attack rolls
with the same attack bonus. The shattered fragments
remain lodged in the creatures they damage;
the creatures are clumsy 2 while the fragments
remain in place. A total of 3 actions, which
have the manipulate trait, are required to remove
the fragments from yourself or an adjacent creature;
alternatively, a single action and a successful DC 30
Medicine check can be used. A critical failure on this
Medicine check deals 10 persistent bleed damage to the
creature with the embedded fragment.
Activate [one-action] command; Effect You recall the shot of the
First Vault, which automatically reloads itself into your
weapon. If the shot had fragmented, the fragments
violently dislodge themselves, dealing 15 persistent bleed
damage to each creature in which they were embedded.
The fragments then unite to re‑form the shot of the First
Vault, which automatically reloads itself into your weapon.
Activate [three-actions] Interact; Requirements The shot is loaded in
your ranged weapon, or at hand if your ranged weapon has
a reload of 0; Effect You line up a perfectly aimed attack
directly toward the First Vault. You Strike a creature, then
the shot of the First Vault attempts to bring your target with
it as it returns to the First Vault. Unless your attack roll is
a critical failure, the creature must attempt a DC 45 Reflex
save; this effect has the incapacitation trait. Regardless, the
shot of the First Vault returns to the First Vault.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature is moved 1d20×50 feet in the direction
you fired. If this causes it to hit a solid object, it takes 50
bludgeoning damage.
Failure The creature is transported to a random location on
the plane of Axis.
Critical Failure The creature is transported to the First Vault.
Unless it is capable of eluding Abadar’s precautions, it is
likely unable to escape the Vault on its own.
Destruction If 10 shots of the First Vault are all fired at the
same group of keketar or izfiitar proteans within 1 minute
of each other, each shot was a hit, and the shots are then

SPHERE OF ANNIHILATION
ITEM 27
RARE
ARTIFACT
MAGICAL
TRANSMUTATION
Bulk —
A sphere of annihilation is a floating black sphere that
pulls any matter that comes into contact with it into a
void, destroying it utterly. Anything or anyone destroyed
by the sphere can be brought back only by a deity’s direct
intervention. The sphere can’t be counteracted by dispel
magic or similar effects.
The sphere stays entirely still until caused to move by a
creature controlling it. Taking control of the sphere requires
succeeding at an attempt to activate it. A talisman of the
sphere (see below) makes it easier to control the sphere.
Activate [one-action] command; Requirements You are within 40 feet of
the sphere; Effect You attempt a DC 30 Arcana or Occultism
check to take control of the sphere. If someone else already
controls the sphere, this check uses their Will DC if higher. If
you succeed, you take control of the sphere. If you fail, the
sphere moves 10 feet closer to you (or 20 feet on a critical
failure). You keep control as long as you remain within 80 feet
of the sphere and Sustain the Activation each round.
When you Sustain the Activation, you must attempt a
DC 30 Arcana or Occultism check. If you succeed, you direct
the sphere to move up to 10 feet in a straight line (or up to 20
feet on a critical success). On a failure, you lose control of the
sphere, and it moves 10 feet closer to you in a straight line (or
20 feet on a critical failure).
Destruction When a gate spell is cast such that its rift overlaps
a sphere of annihilation, roll d%. On a result of 1–50, the sphere
is destroyed; on a 51–85, the spell is disrupted; and on a 86–100,
everything within an 180‑foot emanation of the sphere is pulled
to another plane through a tear in the spatial fabric.
If a rod of cancellation (Pathfinder Advanced Player’s
Guide) touches the sphere, both items explode, dealing 14d6
bludgeoning damage (DC 35 basic Reflex save) to everything in
a 60‑foot burst from the point of their destruction.
TALISMAN OF THE SPHERE
ITEM 20
RARE
ARTIFACT
EVOCATION
MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This loop of adamantine can be slung on a chain to be worn as a
necklace, but must be held to convey its benefits. A creature that
can’t cast either arcane or occult spells takes 8d6 mental damage
just from picking up the item, and they take that damage again
at the start of each of their turns if they continue to hold it.
If the wielder can cast arcane or occult spells, they can use
the talisman of the sphere to more easily control a sphere of
annihilation. This reduces the DC of the check to control the
sphere or Sustain the Activation by 10.
Destruction The talisman of the sphere is destroyed if touched
by a sphere of annihilation.

Much like coins, gems and art objects are valuable currency
worth their full Price when sold. When making a treasure
hoard, you can choose gems or art objects you like, or roll
randomly using percentile dice.
GEMS
Gems are naturally occurring minerals, typically in a
crystalline form, or, in a few cases, organic material such
as amber, coral, and pearls. All but the largest gems weigh
about half as much as a coin, so about 2,000 gems is 1
Bulk. Unworked gems are worth half the Price of a finished
gem and can serve as the minimum raw materials necessary
to Craft the finished gem. Lesser semiprecious stones are
level 0 items, moderate and greater semiprecious stones
are 1st-level items, lesser and moderate precious stones
are 4th-level items that require expert proficiency to Craft,
and greater precious stones are 7th-level items that require
master proficiency to Craft.

GEMS AND ART OBJECTS
Many people treasure gems for their brilliant colors and for the alchemical or even magical

ART OBJECTS
These pieces of artwork have listed values, but might be
more valuable to a collector or someone with a personal
connection. When including art objects, consider whether
the PCs could discover this information and secure a greater
reward. For instance, a dwarven crown might be worth
1,000 gp for its exquisite crafting, but even more to the
dwarves who lost the crown of their first queen long ago.
This could also be a plot hook for a later adventure.
On the other hand, the materials used to make an art
object, such as the paint and the canvas of a painting, are
worth far less than the finished object. Some art objects on
Table 2–24 include uncommon or rare precious materials,
though usually not in large enough amounts for other
crafting purposes. If you’re rolling randomly and don’t want
to give out an uncommon or rare material, roll again or
modify the description (for instance, you might change the
mithral crown in the major art objects list to a gold crown).

Afflictions strike creatures with potent and often escalating
results. This section presents a variety of curses, diseases,
and drugs for use in your game. A broad sampling of
poisons can be found beginning on page 550 of the Core
Rulebook, and the rules for afflictions start on 457.
Depending on the tone of the campaign, the GM might
want to roll secret saving throws for PCs affected by an
affliction. This is particularly effective when the affliction
is an element within a survival or horror game, or when
it’s part of a mystery.
CURSES
A curse is a manifestation of potent ill will. Curses
typically have a single effect that takes place upon a failed
saving throw and lasts a specified amount of time, or can
be removed only by certain actions a character must
perform or conditions they must meet. Rarely, curses will
have stages; these follow the rules for afflictions.
Curses may come from a malicious action, such as a
lich’s Paralyzing Touch or a spell from an evil spellcaster.
Guardians of a tomb or treasure might ward their charge
with a curse as protection against thieves. In some rare
cases, a curse might manifest as a response to a terrible act,
such as a massacre. When using a curse in your game, assign
the curse to an item, location, situation, or similar element.
Then, decide on a trigger for the curse—such as a creature
attempting to steal a warded book, destroy a work of art, or
slay a specific creature. A curse can even be tied to a specific
location, in which case it functions as a simple hazard. Once
that trigger occurs, the curse affects the triggering creature
or creatures. Each affected creature must attempt a saving
throw against the curse; if they fail, they are subject to the
effects specified in the curse’s Effect entry.

as long as you are cursed.

you eat, you aren’t satiated. After 1 day, you begin starving
(Core Rulebook 500). Each week, you receive a new saving
throw against the curse.
WIZARD’S WARD
CURSE 6
ABJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
A wizard’s ward is placed upon a single book, usually a
spellbook. If you damage the book, you must attempt a save
against the curse’s effect.
Saving Throw DC 22 Will; Effect You take 5d6 damage of the
same damage type as the damage you dealt to the book,
and the damage can’t be healed as long as the curse lasts.
Repairing the book, including replacing any missing text,
ends this curse.
AFFLICTIONS
Wherever there is life, there are insidious perils that threaten the health and well-being
of living creatures. Some of these afflictions, including many diseases, are inherent to the
natural world. Others, such as drugs, are crafted by people the world over for recreational,
unscrupulous, or other uses. And some—curses being the most notorious—exist solely to
cause harm to others.

be dead; a creature must succeed at a DC 30 Medicine
check to realize you are alive. Noise doesn’t awaken you,
but taking damage gives you a new saving throw against
the curse.
REVILING EARTH
CURSE 12
CURSE
DEATH
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
A reviling earth curse usually appears across a specific
geographical region, such as a ruined town, a necromancer’s
domain, or a similar area.
Saving Throw DC 30 Fortitude; Effect When you enter the area,
you become doomed 1, or doomed 2 on a critical failure.
SPIRIT ANCHOR
CURSE 13
CURSE
MAGICAL
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
This curse prevents your soul from moving on after death.
Saving Throw DC 31 Fortitude; Effect If you die while affected,
your spirit is anchored to the Material Plane, and you
become a ghost or other incorporeal undead.
UNENDING THIRST
CURSE 15
CURSE
TRANSMUTATION
MAGICAL
This curse kills through dehydration in the same vein as the
curse of the ravenous, but with deadly speed.
Saving Throw DC 32 Fortitude; Effect You gain no benefit from
drinking water or other liquids and begin suffering from
thirst (Core Rulebook 500). Each day, you receive a new
saving throw against the curse.
REVILED OF NATURE
CURSE 18
CURSE
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
MAGICAL
MENTAL
This curse makes the hunter into the hunted, drawing the ire
of animals wherever you go.
Saving Throw DC 38 Will; Effect Creatures of the natural
world abhor you. Whenever an animal becomes aware of
you, it must attempt a Will save against the curse. On a
failure, it attacks you and fights to the death.
THIEF’S RETRIBUTION
CURSE 19
CONJURATION
CURSE
MAGICAL
This punishment causes you to lose something dear to you
whenever you rob or steal. If you have nothing to lose, the
curse exacts its punishment upon your body instead.
Saving Throw DC 39 Fortitude; Effect Each time you steal
something, you lose something more valuable—this item
is whisked away and can’t be found again. Typically this
item is one of greater monetary value, but it might be one
of greater value in another sense, such as one of greater
emotional value, or something you need to complete a
task. If you aren’t carrying anything of greater value at
the time of the theft, you lose one of your limbs instead,
taking 10d6 slashing damage and losing use of that limb.
The damage can’t be healed, nor the limb restored, until
the stolen item is returned, even through use of spells
like regenerate.
SWORD OF ANATHEMA
CURSE 20
CURSE
DIVINE
EVOCATION
With divine intervention, followers of a deity can bestow this
curse upon an enemy of the faith.
Saving Throw DC 40 Will; Effect You are marked by the deity
invoked as an enemy of the church. You gain weakness 10
to damage dealt by worshippers of that deity.
GRAVE CURSE
CURSE, LEVEL VARIES
CURSE
NECROMANCY
MAGICAL
A grave curse punishes you for stealing from a tomb or other
resting place.
Saving Throw Will save, with a high spell DC for a monster
of its level (page 65); Effect You are hounded by undead
creatures of the same level as the curse. Every night,
you must attempt a DC 15 flat check. On a failure, an
incorporeal undead manifests to hassle and harry you
throughout the night, retreating before it can take much
damage and often preventing you from gaining a full
night’s rest. Whenever you enter a graveyard or other
area where bodies are buried, you must succeed at the
same flat check or a body animates as a corporeal undead
(typically a skeleton or zombie) to attack you.
 These undead are temporary and exist only to
harry you; if you take control of the undead, move on,
or otherwise avoid their attacks, incorporeal undead
discorporate and corporeal undead collapse into ordinary
corpses. The curse can be removed by returning the stolen
items to their resting place.

DISEASES
Exposure to disease can be a hazard, such as when PCs come
into contact with a plague-ridden corpse; such hazards
grant XP as a simple hazard of the disease’s level. When
a disease gives a sickened condition that can’t be reduced
until it runs its course, that typically means the disease has
symptoms such as a difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite,
or nausea that make eating and drinking difficult but not
impossible. Despite the condition’s prohibition on eating
or drinking, a creature can slowly and carefully eat and
drink as long as they aren’t in an encounter.
BOG ROT
DISEASE 0
DISEASE
Sometimes called bog foot, bog rot is caused by having
waterlogged feet for an extended period of time. In addition to
the usual cures for an affliction, bog rot can be cured through
amputation of the affected appendages.
Saving Throw DC 13 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 clumsy
1 (1 day); Stage 2 clumsy 1 and a –5‑foot status penalty
to Speed (1 day); Stage 3 clumsy 2 and a –10‑foot status
penalty to Speed (1 day)
SCARLET FEVER
DISEASE 1
DISEASE
The relatively simple sore throat caused by this disease leads
many victims to initially dismiss it as a mild illness, but scarlet
fever can be deadly if left untreated. You can’t reduce your
sickened condition while affected with scarlet fever.
Saving Throw DC 13 Fortitude; Onset 2 days; Stage 1 sickened
1 (1 day); Stage 2 sickened 2 (1 day); Stage 3 sickened 3 and
can’t speak (1 day); Stage 4 death
TETANUS
DISEASE 1
DISEASE
An infection introduced through open wounds, tetanus can
produce stiffness, muscle spasms strong enough to break
bones, and ultimately death.
Saving Throw DC 14 Fortitude; Onset 10 days; Stage 1 clumsy
1 (1 week); Stage 2 clumsy 2 and can’t speak (1 day); Stage 3
paralyzed with spasms (1 day); Stage 4 death
TUBERCULOSIS
DISEASE 1
DISEASE
An extended respiratory disease, tuberculosis can pose
particular challenges to spellcasters and some performers due
to the intense coughing fits it produces.
Saving Throw DC 15 Fortitude; Onset 1 week; Stage 1 carrier
with no effects (1 week); Stage 2 coughing requires you to
succeed at a DC 5 flat check to Cast a Spell with a verbal
component or Activate an Item with a command component
(1 week); Stage 3 fatigued, can’t recover from the fatigued
condition, and coughing requires a successful DC 15 flat
check to Cast a Spell with a verbal component or Activate
an Item with a command component (1 week); Stage 4
unconscious (1 week); Stage 5 death
MALARIA
DISEASE 2
DISEASE
A pernicious disease spread by bloodsucking insects, malaria
sometimes enters long periods of dormancy. If you succumb
to malaria, you may continue to be periodically affected by the
disease, even if you’re cured. You can’t reduce your sickened
condition while affected with malaria.
 Saving Throw DC 16 Fortitude; Onset 10 days; Stage 1
sickened 1 (1 day); Stage 2 sickened 2 (1 day); Stage 3
sickened 2, and disease recurs every 1d4 months even if
cured (1 day); Stage 4 unconscious (1 day); Stage 5 death
BUBONIC PLAGUE
DISEASE 3
DISEASE
This widespread illness can sweep through entire communities,
leaving few unaffected. The first indication of the disease is
a telltale swelling of glands. In some cases, the disease can
move into your lungs (pneumonic plague) or blood (septicemic
plague), which is even more fatal. If you have bubonic plague,
you can’t remove the fatigued condition while affected.
Saving Throw DC 17 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 fatigued

impossible. Damage taken from scarlet leprosy can’t be healed
until the disease is cured.
Saving Throw DC 19 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 2d6
bludgeoning damage (1 day); Stage 2 2d6 bludgeoning
damage, and whenever you gain the wounded condition,

Stage 6 death
SEWER HAZE
DISEASE 7
DISEASE
VIRULENT

a supernatural origin, given its association with particularly
strong otyughs.
Saving Throw DC 23 Fortitude; Onset 2 days; Stage 1 stupefied
2 (1 day); Stage 2 drained 2 and stupefied 2 (1 day); Stage 3
drained 3 and stupefied 3 (1 day)
NIGHTMARE FEVER
DISEASE 8
DISEASE
NECROMANCY
OCCULT
Thought to be caused by a night hag’s curse, nightmare fever
inflicts you with terrible nightmares, and you awaken with the
wounds you received in your dreams. Some versions cause
you to dream of being wounded by bludgeoning or piercing
weapons, in which case you take that type of damage instead.
Damage and the fatigued condition caused by the disease
can’t be healed until the disease is removed.
Saving Throw DC 25 Will; Stage 1 2d6 slashing damage and
fatigued (1 day); Stage 2 4d6 slashing damage and fatigued

day); Stage 5 6d6 slashing damage and unconscious
BRAIN WORMS
DISEASE 11
DISEASE
VIRULENT
Scholars suspect these brain parasites have an otherworldly
or extraplanar origin. Though transmitted by the bites of
infected targets, the disease remains relatively rare—most
hosts are killed by the effects before they can pass it on. While
infected, whenever you attack due to confusion, you bite your
target (if you don’t have a jaws or fangs attack, you deal
piercing damage as an unarmed attack with damage equal to
your lowest unarmed attack).
 Saving Throw DC 28 Fortitude; Onset 1 day; Stage 1 stupefied 2
(1 day); Stage 2 stupefied 2, and whenever you take damage,
you must succeed at a Will save against the disease’s DC or

DRUGS
Drugs offer short-term benefits with harmful side effects
and long-term consequences. These short-term benefits,
such as euphoria, draw many to drugs, but addiction
keeps users hooked long after their first dose. A character
can voluntarily fail their initial save against a drug, but for
each dose they consume, they must attempt a saving throw
against addiction, a disease that represents cravings and
withdrawal. Addiction is unique to each drug, so a character
can be affected by multiple instances of addiction at once.
Certain drugs alter how addiction works for that
drug, adding the virulent trait to the addiction, limiting
the maximum stage a character can reach, or adding
additional stages beyond those listed in the base affliction.
ADDICTION
DISEASE, LEVEL VARIES
Track the maximum stage you reach with each drug’s addiction.
This maximum stage is separate from your current addiction
stage for the drug. The maximum stage can’t be reduced, even
if you fully remove the disease. When you take the drug, two
things happen: you attempt a saving throw against addiction,
and you suppress the effects of addiction for 1 day. Failing
a save against addiction caused by taking the drug causes
you to go to 1 stage higher than the maximum stage you had
previously reached (2 stages higher on a critical failure). If
you’re currently suffering from addiction when you attempt
a save from taking the drug, you can’t improve your stage; if
you succeed at the save, the stage remains the same as it was.
When you attempt your save against addiction each week,
the stage you are currently at can’t get worse—it can only
stay the same or improve. The conditions from addiction
can’t be removed while you are affected by the addiction,
and suppressing addiction by taking the drug only avoids the
effects—it doesn’t remove the disease.
Saving Throw Fortitude (DC equals that of the drug); Onset
1 day; Stage 1 fatigued (1 week); Stage 2 fatigued and
sickened 1 (1 week); Stage 3 fatigued, drained 1, and
sickened 1 (1 week); Stage 4 fatigued, drained 2, sickened 2,

DRUGS IN YOUR GAME
Drugs are socially complex, and including them in your
game has the potential to make some of your players
uncomfortable—particularly players who have struggled
with substance abuse themselves or seen friends and family
members go through that struggle. As with any potentially
difficult subject matter, you should discuss the role drugs
play in your game with your players and ensure that
all the players at the table are comfortable with the
material; if they aren’t, avoid the topic.
If you do include drugs in your game, consider the role
they’ll play. In some campaigns, drugs might simply
be an element of flavor and a tool characters use
to reach their goals; in others, the side effects
and risk of addiction might be a terrible price
to pay. The rules assume something of a middle
path, where drugs are addictive substances
that may provide a short‑term benefit but have
consequences. To make drugs more accessible in
your game, remove some of the more severe stages
of addiction. To make them more dangerous, add
the virulent trait to the addiction affliction, add
more stages with increasingly severe effects, or
increase the DC of the save against the addiction by
1 for every use of the drug, decreasing back to normal
over time as they stop using the drug.

BUILDING WORLDS
As a Game Master, you control the details of the world your players explore. The Age of
Lost Omens campaign setting is a lush world suitable for countless adventures, but you
might prefer to adventure in entirely new worlds, where every aspect of the setting and
story is yours to decide!
Building your own campaign world can be a deeply
fulfilling creative process, as it lets you bring to life the
exact setting you envision. It gives you great flexibility,
in that you can build only as much as you need for the
next few adventures, and you can adapt the world on
the fly to meet the demands of your story. It also gives
you great control, allowing you to build precisely the
setting you need for the story you want to tell. Finally, it
bypasses some of the issues that can come with playing
within an existing campaign setting, where you might
create a narrative that contradicts published canon, or
your players might stumble across major plot or setting
spoilers. Whatever your world‑building goals, this chapter
guides you through the design process step by step.
DESIGN APPROACH
World building can be approached in many ways, but it
fundamentally comes down to a simple preference. Do
you start at a high level and zoom in, or do you start small
and build up? This section outlines a largely top‑down
approach, but you can design from the bottom up
simply by starting at the end of this section and working
backwards. Either way, you may find yourself skipping
between sections as inspiration strikes—and that’s OK!
When building a world, there’s a risk of becoming
overwhelmed by the sheer number of decisions to be
made. Remember that you don’t need to make every
decision for every aspect of your world all at once. Focus
first on the elements you need for your story and the
game, then add as much of the rest as you’d like. You’ll
also want to allow room for input from your players—
gaming sessions are more memorable and engaging when
the storytelling experience is shared between everyone
at the table (page 32 has more information on players
contributing to the narrative).
Before you decide anything else, however, you should
establish your concept and your goals. Do you envision
a high‑magic steampunk setting where humans are a
tiny minority? A world where the only magic derives
from squabbling pantheons of gods whose followers
are caught up in their wars for power? A quaint town
isolated from an otherwise‑unknown world beyond a
vast, impenetrable forest of mist‑choked, skeletal trees?
Are you designing a world for a multi‑year campaign,
or for a fast‑paced one‑shot adventure? Having an idea
in mind will help steer your choices as you build your
world, and knowing your goals will help you focus on
building what you need.
TOP DOWN
The top‑down approach is great if you have a lot of time
to dedicate to world building. When designing a setting
from the top down, your initial focus is on the big picture.
You may already have an idea of the big movers and
shakers of your world or your multiverse. You may want
to chronicle a thousand years or more of the setting’s
history. You may have already sketched out a world map
with continents, nations, and trade routes spanning the
globe. This approach begins with broad generalities that
get more detailed as you design and during play.
BOTTOM UP
With a bottom‑up approach to world building, you
start small and local. Focus on the starting location and
immediate needs of your campaign, then expand outward
as the story unfolds. This strategy works well for those
with less time to devote to world building, as you need to
prepare only the minimum detail necessary to entice your
players toward adventure, fleshing out your world only
as the campaign requires it.
THE WORLD
While world building might include building much more
than a single planet, most adventures occur entirely on
one world. It’s a good idea to have a broad understanding
of that world as a whole.
PLANETARY BASICS
When designing the physical features of a campaign
world, you’ll want to determine its shape and the general
distribution of landmasses. You can also establish the
world’s size, though note the scale of a world generally has
a fairly small impact on the adventures taking place there.
Shape
In a fantasy setting, the shape of your world need not be
spherical as governed by the laws of physics. It could be
any shape you desire, and it need not be a planet at all!
Globe: Barring some catastrophe, worlds in our reality
are roughly spherical due to the influence of gravity.
Hollow World: What if the landmasses and civilizations
of a world existed on the inner surface of a hollow sphere?
In such a world, the horizon would climb upwards,
permitting creatures to see landmarks at extraordinary
distances. Light might emanate from a sun‑like orb in
the world’s center, from various other natural or magical
sources, or not at all.
Gamemastery Guide
122
122

PAGE 124
================================================================================

Irregular: What if your world is flat, a toroid, or
shaped into a cylinder, cube, or other polyhedron? What
if it’s something even stranger? With such an unusual
shape, you may need to decide how gravity, atmosphere,
and other details function.
LandmaSS
The next major step in world creation is to sketch out
the planet’s oceans and major landmasses. On Earth,
these geological features are the result of plate tectonics.
In a fantasy world, however, the oceans might have been
cleaved from the land by the actions of titans, or the
continents shaped to suit a god’s whims. The following
are some common landmass types.
Archipelago: A stretch of vast ocean, dotted by chains
of small island groups, atolls, and islets.
Major Islands: A region of seas dominated by large
islands, each several hundred miles across.
Island‑Continent: An enormous island nearly the size
of a continent, surrounded by ocean.
Continent: A substantial landform that (usually) rests
on a tectonic plate and gradually shifts in position over
geologic timescales.
Supercontinent: An assembly of the world’s continental
blocks into a single immense landmass.
ENVIRONMENT
The environment and terrain of a region can pose as
much of a challenge to an adventuring party as any of
the foes they face. The following section references the
environment categories beginning on page 512 of the
Core Rulebook.
Common environmentS
The following environments are common enough that
they might appear in nearly any adventure or world.
Aquatic: Oceans, seas, lakes, and other large waterways
are aquatic environments.
Arctic: Arctic environments usually appear near the
northern and southern extremes of a world, though extreme
elevation, unusually shaped worlds, and supernatural
forces could result in arctic terrain elsewhere.
Desert: Deserts can appear anywhere on a world where
precipitation is scant, even along some oceans. Any large
landmasses that entirely lack bodies of water are likely
to be deserts.
Forest: The composition of a forest depends on the
climate and the elevation, with thick jungles more
common near an equator, hardwood forests in more
temperate zones, and evergreens at higher latitudes and
elevations. Most worlds have a tree line—an elevation
above which trees can’t grow.
Mountain: A world’s highest peaks can stretch tens
of thousands of feet above sea level. This category also
includes hills, which are typically no more than 1,000
feet tall.
Plains: Mostly flat and unobstructed, plains are usually
at lower elevations, but they can also be found at higher
elevation on plateaus.
Urban: Cities and settlements are urban environments.
These areas are detailed in Settlements, beginning on
page 132.
Swamp: Wide floodplains, shallow lakes, and marshes
can appear at most latitudes.
extreme environmentS
Some adventures lead to fantastic reaches of the world or
the multiverse that are seldom tread by mortals.
Aerial: A world might include windy realms of floating
islands and castles in the clouds.
Glacier: Massive sheets of dense ice, constantly
moving under their own immense weight, glaciers are
frozen wastelands riddled with columns of jagged ice and
snow‑covered crevasses.
Volcanic: Hellish landscapes of molten lava, burning
ash, and scorching temperatures pose immediate danger.
Undersea: A subset of aquatic environments, undersea
environments are those areas submerged beneath the waves.
Underground: Some worlds have deep natural
caverns, while others have extensive winding tunnels and
expansive realms below the surface.
MAPPING A WORLD
Many Game Masters like to have an overland map for
their local region, nation, or even the whole world. The
primary goal of this scale of map is to designate sites of
import to the campaign; you need not detail every hamlet
or woodland grove, but having a sense of the major
features can help you and the other players visualize the
world in which they’re playing.
Step 1. Coastlines: The easiest first step is to separate
land from sea. Regional maps may only have a single
shoreline, if any. At larger map scales, consider the
placement of major islands, archipelago chains, atolls,
and islets. A world map should consider the size and
placement of continents.
Step 2. Topography: Pencil in a rough ridgeline for
each mountain range in the region. Mountain ranges
are common along coastlines where continental plates
push together. If extended into the sea, mountain ranges
typically result in a chain of offshore islands. Indicate hills
in the regions adjacent to the mountains and elsewhere as
necessary to demonstrate elevation. Unmarked terrain on
an overland map is usually lowland plains.
Step 3. Watercourses: It’s important to keep in mind
that rivers flow downstream, from high elevation toward
the sea, always taking the path of least resistance.
Powerful watercourses might carve canyons or gorges
over millennia, but they should never cross through
mountain ranges. On a similar note, watercourses
don’t branch—tributaries join into rivers as they
flow downstream.

Step 4. Terrain and Environment: Sketch in interesting
terrain features such as forests, deserts, or tundra. You may
want to differentiate these environs, separating coniferous
and deciduous forests from tropical jungles or arctic taiga.
Environs not specifically called out on an overland map
are typically presumed to be some variety of grassland.
Step 5. Civilization: Now you’re ready to place the
elements of civilization. Major cities should typically be
located near fresh water and natural resources. Major
roads connect larger settlements, circumventing forests
and other difficult environs, but they may wind through
mountain passes when lucrative commerce demands
it. Add smaller settlements along your roads, further
connected by smaller roads and trails. Finally, draw
political boundaries and mark other sites of interest.
CIVILIZATION
With the major geographical features and terrain of your
world decided, you’ll next want to establish significant
nations and settlements.
When it comes to designing a world’s cultures, you
might want to focus primarily on those areas the party
is likely to explore first. This allows you to establish
the details and depth of one region’s peoples before
expanding out to address others. That’s not to say you
shouldn’t have ideas about the cultures beyond your
starting settlement—it just means you don’t need to
decide every detail of every culture all at once.
As always, you don’t need to demarcate every realm
on the globe or indicate every town, hamlet, and thorp.
Keep your focus on what you need for your story and
your adventure—leaving terra incognita can lead to stories
down the road as the party ventures further from home.
SOCIETAL BENCHMARKS
The following sections can help you establish certain
truths about your world as a whole. From there, you can
decide the details of specific cultural groups, including
whether they deviate from these global standards.
teChnoLogy
Throughout history, a major driver of world culture
has been the continuous advancement of technology
in warfare, agriculture, and industry. The following
categories roughly approximate real‑world technological
levels, but progress might vary on your world. What
heights of technology have been achieved? Have any
groups fallen behind or leaped ahead?
Primeval: Weapons and tools in this early era are
crafted primarily from bone, wood, or stone. Knowledge
of stonecutting allows early civilizations to raise stone
walls and buildings.
Ancient: Advancements in mining and metallurgy lead
to weapons and tools made from bronze. Crop rotation
and storage in granaries ensure greater survival in times
of famine. Trade between river and coastal settlements
is aided by oar‑ and sail‑powered galleys. Chariots come
into strong use during warfare.
Classical: Superior military tactics and engineered
roads allow for rapid deployment of infantry wielding
iron weapons and aided by mounted cavalry. Advances
in complex irrigation and construction of aqueducts
lead to an abundance of harvest foods and dramatic
improvements to sanitation.
Medieval: Warfare in this era is defined by iron armor,
crossbows, and weapons forged of fine steel.
Enlightenment: The development of black powder
and muzzle‑loaded, single‑shot firearms greatly changes
warfare, making plate armor mostly obsolete. Larger
ships permit ocean crossings and long‑range trade to
distant shores. The printing press speeds literacy and the
dissemination of new ideas.
Steam: Steam engines replace conveyances drawn
by animal power or sail, leading to a significant shift
from wood fuel to coal. Further advances in science
lead to dirigible airships and observation balloons.
Simple firearms are replaced by repeating revolvers and
bolt action rifles.
divine invoLvement
What is the nature of the gods? Do they even exist? If
so, are they omnipotent and omniscient? How does a
follower request their divine favor? The answers to these
questions will help you determine how strongly divine
faith impacts the cultures of your world.
None: Deities do not exist in this world, or if they do,
they are oblivious to or completely unconcerned with
mortal affairs. If they exist, they don’t make their presence
known, nor do they grant power to their worshippers.
Limited: Deities exist, though they remain aloof from
the mortal world and make their divine presence known
only to a chosen few.
Accepted: Divine influence is an accepted fact of
everyday life. Their will is enacted through priests and
organized religions. Divine avatars may appear in the
world during extreme circumstances.
Ubiquitous: Deities live among mortals, exerting their
divine will directly. Gods rule entire nations, commanding
absolute obedience from their faithful followers.
magiC
Does magic exist? If so, which traditions are available?
What are the sources of a spellcaster’s power, and how do
they gain and channel that magic?
CAMPAIGN REFERENCE
Before the campaign starts, you might want to begin the
outline for a campaign reference: a living document that you
can easily review and annotate during gameplay and that
records the geography, factions, history, characters, and
plots central to your campaign.
Gamemastery Guide
124

PAGE 126
================================================================================

No Magic: Magic of any kind does not exist in this
world. Spells and magic effects do not function. Consider
the variants on page 196 to handle the lack of magic items.
Low Magic: Magic is mysterious and taboo. The few
practitioners of the mystical arts are feared or shunned.
Again, consider the variants on page 196 to handle the
relative scarcity of magic items.
Common: Magic is an accepted fact of everyday life,
though its mysteries are beyond the reach of most people.
Magic portals and gates can whisk travelers “in the
know” halfway across the world or to the other side of
the multiverse.
High Magic: Magic and magical items are commonplace
in society. It may be as easy to learn spellcasting as it is to
learn a new language. Magical objects simulate various
modern technologies.
DESIGNING NATIONS
For any nation you establish in your setting, you’ll want
to provide at least a minimal description—the core
concept of that nation. The amount of additional detail
you provide depends on the needs of your story. You
likely want to establish enough information to create a
stat block (page 130) for the nation your adventurers are
from, any nations they’re likely to spend significant time
in, and those nations’ main allied and enemy nations, if
they are likely to become part of the plot.
When building a nation, remember that the various
elements connect to the history of the land and its people,
its relationships with nearby nations, and the current
residents. This interconnectedness will help you build a
wealth of story hooks and provide immersive detail for
your players.
Beyond those basic details, the following considerations
can help flesh out the nations in your setting.
LoCation, Size, and popuLation
Major geographical boundaries, such as mountains,
seas, and large rivers, often present natural borders
for a realm. Depending on its leadership, culture, and
the resources available, a country may be as small as a
city‑state or as large as a continent‑sweeping empire.
Barring widely available technological or magical travel
and communication, most nations remain relatively
small (only a few hundred miles across), simply because
it becomes too difficult for a single governing entity to
oversee and maintain the entirety of a larger state.
National populations ebb and flow due to a multitude
of external factors. Advances in sanitation, medicine, and
agriculture can spur dramatic population growth, while
war, famine, or plague can devastate it. As a rule, smaller
nation‑states have a population around a hundred
thousand, while a continent‑spanning empire could swell
to well over a hundred million.

================================================================================

Population size is only part of the equation. Figuring out
the ancestry ratios of that population and brainstorming
how the members of various ancestries interact can often
lead to interesting story ideas, or at least give you some
jumping‑off points when dreaming up how the nation
was founded and its later history.
CuLturaL haLLmarkS
What elements of the nation’s predominant culture stand
out? A nation might have an unusual stance on religion,
a specific demographic, distinctive natural features,
noteworthy political views, or any number of unique
elements that differentiate it from other nations in your
region. These hallmarks can inform your decisions about
many other aspects of the nation.
hiStory
How did the nation come to be? Has it stood since time
immemorial, a bastion of stability while the rest of the
world changes around it? Perhaps it was built over the
ruins of another civilization, destroyed by some forgotten
calamity. Or perhaps it is a young nation, born recently
amid ongoing strife in your world. What remnants of
the past can be found, or has the past been deliberately
hidden? How have the residents of the nation adapted to
change, and in what ways have they failed to do so?
eConomy and poLitiCaL StanCeS
Determine the key resources and industries that drive the
nation’s economy. The availability of natural resources can
establish national boundaries, local industry, and other
elements of the resident society. For example, an area with
few resources might have a nomadic society, while a nation
rich in resources might develop an opulent mercantile class.
These resources can also affect international relationships.
An area poor in a specific resource might have a strong trade
relationship with a nearby nation that has it, or they might
be at war! Nations also disagree about political structures,
public policy, religion, and any number of other factors.
You’ll also want to consider the significant NPCs of
each nation. This includes the official ruler, but it also
includes other major players, whether they act in an
official capacity or entirely behind the scenes.
BUILDING SETTLEMENTS
In Pathfinder, settlements are where characters can
rest, recharge, retrain, and dedicate themselves to other
downtime activities all in relative peace. Traditionally,
an adventuring band comes together in some kind of
settlement, be it a small hamlet nestled on the border of
some wild frontier or a bustling port city at the heart of a
nation. Some adventures take place entirely within a single
settlement, while in others the party visits settlements only
briefly between their adventures in the wilderness.
The first thing you should consider when building
a settlement is its role in your story. Is this a major
metropolis the heroes will visit again and again during
their adventurers? A backwater village where their
adventures begin? The distant capital from which an evil
tyrant issues cruel edicts? The settlement’s campaign role
will inform many of the other decisions you make about
the place.
Once you know why you need the settlement, consider
why it would exist in the world. Settlements are typically
founded near sources of fresh drinking water; most
commonly along a riverbank or a place with access to
adequate wells or springs. They additionally require some
kind of transit to other places, either roads or waterways.
While it may be easier to create a village or city merely to
serve the characters’ needs, determining what function it
has independent of the characters adds verisimilitude and
can provide hooks for further stories.
Settlements, on page 132, describes the components
of a settlement stat block, which you should create for
any settlement you expect your characters to visit. The
process of creating that stat block will help you further
flesh out your community.
mapping a SettLement
Don’t underestimate the usefulness of sketching a map of
significant settlements, like the one where your adventure
starts. This isn’t intended to be a picture‑perfect rendition
drawn to scale, but rather to outline the rough shape
and size of the settlement. Be sure to highlight a few key
structures useful to the campaign. For more inspiration,
see the section on Drawing Maps (page 52).
Step 1. City Layout: The layout of a settlement is as
unique as the terrain upon which it is settled. First, decide
the major trade route for the settlement. This is typically
a river, which brings fresh water, fish, and fast transport
to the populace. Larger cities can sustain additional
growth with access to a deep‑water harbor or a major
overland trade road. Even settlements conceived with a
grid plan tend to stretch along established trade routes
before expanding outwards.
Step 2. Districts: Towns with a population over a
thousand typically have defensive walls. As a settlement
grows further in size and population, additional stone
fortifications are often constructed beyond the city center,
which further segment the city into districts or boroughs.
CONSCIENTIOUS CULTURE DESIGN
Creating fantasy cultures is a delicate topic, as it can be all
too easy to create a culture or a group based on damaging
stereotypes or simplistic reductions of real-world groups.
Creating entire cultures out of harmful genre tropes such
as “jungle savage” or “noble samurai” reduces real-world
cultures to caricatures and perpetuates stereotypes about
people from those cultures. Taking inspiration from the real
world is wonderful—our world is filled with an incredible
diversity of cultures and peoples—but you should do so with
care and respect for those sources.
Gamemastery Guide
126

PAGE 128
================================================================================

A metropolis, for example, might have several distinct
neighborhoods: Castle Ward, Noble Quarter, Temple
Hill, the Gardens, Scholars’ Court, Artisan Plaza, the
docks, the slums, and so forth.
Step 3. Markets and Shops: Designate one or more
open spaces in the settlement for a market square. This
marketplace typically grows in the city center, along a
major road intersecting the settlement’s primary trade
route. Lining the perimeter of the temporary tents and
stalls of a bazaar are permanent retail shops offering
pricier goods and services. Here in the beating heart
of city commerce, adventurers can arm themselves for
upcoming expeditions or sell their ill‑gotten gains once
making it back to the settlement.
Step 4. Inns: Heroes need a place to celebrate and
recover between adventures. In addition to both public
and private lodging, a settlement’s inns often serve food
and drink. As with the town market, inns are commonly
built in central locations where trade roads meet. In
your campaign, inns are ideal locations to spread gossip,
introduce notable NPCs, and initiate quests. For the right
price, innkeepers might rent strongboxes to secure money
and other valuables between adventures.
Step 5. Landmarks: To give your cities a sense of
personality and local flavor, design a handful of iconic
landmarks for the PCs to visit. Memorable names make
these landmarks more interesting. A random observatory
might be noteworthy, but the Celestial Watchtower has
an air of intrigue that could lead to a fun adventure hook.
RELIGION
The greatest stories from myth and legend speak of
immortals with incredible powers of creation and
destruction. Some meddle in the affairs of mortals,
shaping heroes and history at a whim, while others
remain aloof or oblivious to the mortal world. Regardless
of the world you’re building, religion (or even the absence
thereof) shapes the people and the stories you tell.
THEOLOGY
Religious traditions are commonly categorized by their
belief in one or more divine entities.
Polytheism: This belief system posits the existence of
many gods. Polytheistic gods typically espouse particular
areas of concern and often reflect the appearance of their
worshippers. The primary religious philosophy of the Age
of Lost Omens is polytheistic.
Dualism: This philosophy espouses an enduring conflict
between two diametrically opposed cosmic forces; most
commonly good and evil or law and chaos. Acolytes of
each faith almost always see themselves as righteous, and
those of the contrasting belief as false.
Monotheism: A monotheistic doctrine recognizes the
existence of only one true god. The supreme deity may
exhibit more than one aspect yet remain a single entity,
like Gozreh from the Age of Lost Omens.
Pantheism: Divine power arises from the universe itself,
or as a byproduct of the collective power of many deities
sharing some common facet, either way forming a vast,
all‑encompassing divine entity. Worshippers sometimes
appeal to or devote themselves to specific fundamental
concepts or aspects of the universe.
Animism: Rather than worshipping gods associated
with souls and spiritual essence from beyond, animism
sees the life force in each part of the world, whether it be
the trees of an old‑growth forest or a towering waterfall.
An example of animism in the Age of Lost Omens is
the connection between the Shoanti people and their
totems, which they forge a relationship with when they
come of age.
Atheism: In some campaign worlds, the gods have all
died, abandoned their worshippers, or never existed at
all. Mortals of this world may still cling to belief and
establish religions in the name of the divine, but there are
no true deities to answer their prayers.
PANTHEONS
In polytheistic traditions, a pantheon is a divine hierarchy
of multiple (or even all) deities.
Universal: All deities in the setting belong to a single
pantheon. Different cultures might have their own names
for the god of magic, for instance, but only a single deity
answers their prayers.
Ancestral or Regional: Each ancestry or region worships
its own distinct pantheon. These pantheons coexist in the
same cosmology but establish control in separate divine
realms. Across the cosmos, several gods from disparate
pantheons may share the same area of concern, but they
seldom compete for worshippers from rival pantheons.
Competitive: The world contains smaller regional
pantheons competing for mortal worship. Only one
deity of a specific area of concern may ascend to greater
power across all the pantheons. As such, deities typically
have little loyalty to their own pantheons and may
actually switch to another pantheon if it earns them
additional worshippers.
None: The deities of this multiverse act as individuals
with no familial ties or common agenda binding them to
each other.
DEITIES
These immortal beings command vast power and influence
fueled by the faith and souls of mortal worshippers. In
Pathfinder, deities also dictate some of the abilities of
those champions and clerics who channel their power.
When designing deities, you’ll need to include the divine
statistics and devotee benefits described below.
divine rank
Gods are usually ranked in a divine hierarchy, from
newly ascended godlings to almighty creator gods of
unfathomable power.

PAGE 129
================================================================================

God: Taking a position atop the divine pyramid, gods
command near unlimited power and resources. Their
mortal congregations are large and (usually) well funded.
Demigod: Demigods still possess a great deal of power,
though often in subservience to another god or simply
inferior to the power of a full god.
Quasi Deity: The weakest rank of divinity, many quasi
deities are recently ascended mortals who attained their
deific powers through ritual apotheosis, or planar natives
who have amassed divine power of their own.
divine StatiStiCS
In Pathfinder, deities are not only a narrative element of the
world, but also a mechanical component of some classes.
Alignment: A deity’s alignment reflects their innate
moral and ethical outlook. In the Lost Omens setting,
most deities maintain realms tied to the Outer Plane that
matches their alignment.
Areas of Concern: Each deity has one or more areas
of concern they have divine influence over. These
portfolios typically embrace universal concepts, such as
honor, night, or tranquility. Deities with similar areas
of concern may work in common cause or against each
other, depending on their goals and divine rank.
Edicts: Every deity has edicts, which are those tenets
they require their faithful—especially divinely empowered
clergy like champions and clerics—to promote in the
world. A deity usually has one to three simple and
straightforward edicts.
Anathema: The opposite of edicts, anathema are those
things a deity will not abide. Champions and clerics must
avoid their deity’s anathema or risk losing their divine
powers, and even lay worshippers usually feel guilty for
performing such acts, as they will be weighed against them
in the afterlife. Like edicts, a deity usually has two to three
simple and straightforward elements to their anathema.
Follower Alignments: Champions and clerics can gain
power from deities only if they share a compatible moral
disposition. Usually these allowed alignments are chosen
from those within one step of the deity’s alignments, with
NG, LN, CN, or NE deities rarely allowing N champions
and clerics. Less restrictive deities are rarer and occur
most often when the deity has multiple aspects or a
particularly wide view of things.
devotee BenefitS
Deities grant favored status and special power to the
most fervent and influential of their flock.
Divine Font: Clerics channel a deity’s divine power
as a font of negative or positive energy. Most often,
good‑aligned deities grant heal while evil deities grant
harm, with neutral deities most often offering a choice
between the two. However, there’s nothing inherently
good about positive energy or evil about negative energy,
so a specific deity’s divine font may vary based on their
areas of concern.
Divine Skill: Champions and clerics automatically
gain the trained proficiency rank in their deity’s divine
skill. Assign the deity one skill that synergizes well with
their areas of concern. For example, Intimidation would
be appropriate for a god of tyranny, or Deception for a
goddess of trickery.
Favored Weapon: Clerics gain access to their deity’s
favored weapon as well as the trained proficiency rank
with it; warpriest clerics gain additional benefits. Every
deity has a favored weapon. Because the benefits of
having an advanced favored weapon are very strong,
you should assign simple or martial favored weapons
unless a deity is so thematically linked with an advanced
weapon that you need to give them one.
Domains: Each deity grants a number of domains
that reflect their divine areas of concern. Champions
and clerics can learn the domain spells from their deity’s
domains. Pathfinder’s deities each have four domains, and
many have one or more alternative domains. Though this
number is usually enough to convey a deity’s portfolio
and give players sufficient options, you can give your
deities as many domains as you like.
Cleric Spells: When preparing spells, clerics can choose
from specific spells granted by the deity, in addition to
those available on the divine spell list. A deity always
grants a 1st‑level spell and usually two others, all chosen
from non‑divine spell lists. The exact number of spells
a deity grants can vary—a magic‑focused deity might
grant one spell per level—though this shouldn’t exceed
one spell per level.
COSMOLOGY
An enduring curiosity among many cultures is to ask
what wonders lie beyond the night sky. Does anyone gaze
back from the moon above? What realms do the gods call
home, and what is it like to walk in their divine presence?
Is the mortal world at the center of the universe, or is all
life utterly insignificant? Spiritual ponderings like these
are central to belief systems across the globe. As a world
builder, you get to answer those enduring questions by
designing the multiverse in all its inexplicable grandeur.
The following are some aspects of your cosmology you
might consider, but as you decide these, you should also
consider how many of these details are known in your
world—and by whom.
THE UNIVERSE
The reality in which mortals live out their short existence
is known to sages and scholars by many names—the
universe, the Material Plane, or the mortal realm, among
others. The structure of the physical universe might follow
any of the following models, or it might be something
completely different.
Vast: The universe is an unimaginably sparse void of
infinite space, littered with stars, planets, and various bits
of detritus.
Gamemastery Guide
128
128

PAGE 130
================================================================================

Limited: The physical universe in your campaign
world may be smaller in scope yet far more fanciful.
For example, in Hinduism, the cosmos is supported
on the backs of four elephants, themselves standing
upon the shell of a world‑sized tortoise, whereas Norse
cosmology describes nine worlds connected by an
immense ash tree.
Bizarre: Sometimes the universe is more complex than
the previous two categories, or possibly nested within
multiple realities. What if the universe the PCs first know
is in fact a magical or mechanical simulation of such
complexity that its inhabitants are unaware that they
themselves exist as an artificial consciousness?
COMPOSITION OF OUTER SPACE
The spaces between the stars can also affect the stories
told in that world.
Vacuum: In conventional astronomy, outer space is an
immense void existing in a near‑perfect vacuum. In some
settings—including the Age of Lost Omens, where it is
known as the Dark Tapestry—the trackless firmament
between the stars is an ominous expanse home only to
terrible beings of incomprehensible malice.
Endless Sky: What if the blue sky overhead extended
outward forever? One need only fly high enough and far
enough to reach another world.
Celestial Spheres: The ancient Greeks posited
that planets, stars, are more were embedded
like jewels within celestial orbs of quintessence
nested within one another.
SOLAR SYSTEM
What is the shape and structure of the solar system
containing your game world?
Heliocentric: Physics dictate that all planets in a system
orbit the sun.
Geocentric: What if your game world
is in fact the center of the star system, or
perhaps even the center of the known universe?
Dyson Sphere: Perhaps a solar system has been
enclosed in an artificial structure designed to harness
the power of the sun.
PLANETS AND MOONS
In antiquity, astronomers noticed that some of the
twinkling lights in the night sky moved differently than the
others. In time, these celestial wanderers would come to be
known as planets, many with their own complement of
orbiting moons. Are there other planets orbiting your
world’s sun? Are they terrestrial, gas giants,
or something less common? How many
moons are there? The characters may
never venture there, but celestial bodies can
have a strong influence on a culture and help
you describe your world in an evocative
and distinctive way.
THE MULTIVERSE
In Pathfinder, the physical universe of your world is one
plane within a much broader multiverse. The Planes, on
page 136, details how planes work and the multiverse of
the Age of Lost Omens, but you can fit planes to your story
and world, or even build a new multiverse from scratch!
Perhaps there are only two planes beyond the material
universe, diametrically opposed and fighting over mortal
souls, or the multiverse consists only of a series of infinite
alternate realities. The options are truly infinite, limited
only by your imagination and the story you want to tell.

================================================================================

NATIONS
From the smallest of city-states to a continent-spanning empire, nations define the political
landscape of a setting and inform local culture and traditions. Knowing the details of a
nation can help you as a Game Master, whether your game revolves around international
disputes or you simply need to know what languages the common people are likely to speak.
Nations vary tremendously, from massive empires to isolated
island realms, and their characteristics can give flavor and
depth to your story and the PCs’ adventures. An encounter
in shadowy Nidal, where allegiance to Zon‑Kuthon has
literally blocked the sun from the sky, is going to have a very
different tone than one in sun‑drenched Thuvia. A nation
working to overcome generations of xenophobia, like
Kyonin, might have a different reaction to adventurers than
a long‑established empire like Taldor. A journey into a new
nation can introduce the heroes to a new people (if the party
visits the hobgoblin nation of Oprak), a new philosophy
(such as the materialistic Prophecies of Kalistrade in Druma),
or a new foe (as visitors to the undead‑ridden Gravelands
will certainly learn).
Nations can also provide adventuring inspiration
and hooks. When the heroes are caught in the crossfire
between two nations in conflict, national concerns
become their own. Learning more about a nation’s history
or practices might lead to a great finding—or a loathsome
practice the characters want to eradicate. A party might
get involved in the political machinations of a nation’s
elite power mongers, or they might fall out of favor and
find themselves on the run from the law!
Nations also influence a character’s story on a personal
level. A nation can suggest a character’s ancestry, inform
the languages they speak, and influence their choice of
deity. As a GM, the relationship between a character and
a nation can provide opportunities to better hook that
character into your campaign. Has the character always
lived there, or have they emigrated from elsewhere—and
why? A character who fled due to political persecution
might have long‑standing enemies, while a hero who left
due to ideological differences might have friends and
family who seek to return them to the fold.
NATION STAT BLOCK
The stat block for a nation presents the core information
about a nation in a simple, streamlined format.
NATION NAME
NATION
ALIGNMENT
OTHER TRAITS
As with any stat block, a nation has a list of traits that convey
its properties at a glance. The most significant of these is the
nation’s alignment trait, which indicates the alignment of the
nation and its government as a whole. This doesn’t necessarily
reflect the alignment of its people, though—a nation is rarely
monolithic, and the alignments of its people may differ
drastically from those of the nation as a whole.
Any other traits in the nation stat block reflect overarching
characteristics about that nation. For example, the elven nation
of Kyonin has the elf trait, indicating that it was created by
and remains almost exclusively populated by elves. Similarly, a
nation with an extremely particular focus might have a trait to
represent that, such as Galt, which has the revolutionary trait.
Following the traits is a brief summary of the nation.
Government This names the formal government and describes
the nation’s governmental structure, such as a hereditary
monarchy, an elected council, or a theocratic dictatorship.
Capital This is the established seat of the nation’s government,
with the city’s population in parentheses.
Population The predominant ancestries of the nation are listed
here, ordered from most to least common.
Languages The languages commonly spoken in the nation
appear here, listed alphabetically.
Religions This lists the religions and philosophies commonly
practiced in the nation. If a nation has a state religion, this is
indicated in parentheses following that religion. If a nation
has prohibited any religions, those are listed in a Prohibited
entry following the common religions.
Other Characteristics A nation might have distinctive
features that set it apart from other nations, such as the
predominance of firearms in Alkenstar. Each such feature is
detailed in this entry, though a nation rarely has more than
one or two of these entries, and many don’t have any.
Primary Exports This lists the nation’s primary exports, such as
raw materials, finished goods, services, and other resources.
If the nation has no exports of note, this entry is omitted.
Primary Imports Much like primary exports, this entry details
the resources commonly imported by the nation. Like exports,
if the nation has no imports of note, this entry is omitted.
Allies This entry lists other nations, and occasionally large
organizations, allied with the nation. It is omitted for
nations with no significant relationships.
Enemies Other nations (and sometimes organizations) that
oppose the nation appear here. This entry is omitted for
nations with no enemies to speak of.
Factions Any significant organizations or factions operating
within the nation are listed in this entry.
Threats This entry lists various threats the nation faces, such
as aggression from neighboring nations, natural disasters,
economic instability, magical anomalies, and so on.
Significant NPCs The final section of the nation’s stat block
presents the most significant NPCs of that nation, including
its ruler. These may not be the most powerful or influential
individuals in the nation, and instead are those most likely
to be known by people within and outside of the nation.

SETTLEMENTS
Adventures have to start somewhere, and everyone needs some semblance of a home.
Settlements are where characters can rest, recharge, retrain, and dedicate themselves to
other downtime activities, all in relative peace. But settlements can also hold their own
intrigues and dangers, providing adventure opportunities of their own.
For some players, a settlement may be nothing more
than a convenient place to purchase gear and sell loot.
For others, a settlement might be a beloved home they’re
willing to risk everything to protect. And sometimes, an
entire campaign takes place entirely within the walls of
a single city.
SETTLEMENTS IN A GAME
Given the variety of roles a settlement can play in
an adventure, a Game Master should have a firm
understanding of how they work in the game and how
to best use them. Virtually every settlement uses the
rules for urban environments presented starting on page
514 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. Those rules are
primarily intended for encounter mode, however, and so
the following guidance can help you best use a settlement
in the broader narrative of your game.
SETTLEMENT ADVENTURES
Designing adventures in a settlement generally follows
the guidelines presented in Adventure Design on page 40.
However, a settlement’s greater population density also
allows for a number of adventure styles and elements that
aren’t as common beyond the city walls.
Social encounters are one of the most common
interactions within a settlement, starting with the guards
at the city gates all the way to an audience with the
queen. The influence and reputation subsystems (pages
151 and 164, respectively) can facilitate these interactions
in a more structured way. Chase scenes, using the rules
starting on page 156, are an iconic component of a
settlement adventure, especially in a larger city, where
dense buildings and a variety of structures make for an
exciting series of obstacles. A settlement is also an ideal
place for a party to conduct an infiltration (page 160).
Since most libraries, archives, and similar repositories of
information are located within settlements, you might
make use of the research rules (page 154). Ambitious
characters might want to build up their own organizations
using the leadership subsystem (page 168).
modeS of pLay
Just like in other adventure locations, all three modes
of play can happen in settlements. Since a settlement
presents far more opportunities for noncombat activities
than most other environments, characters likely spend
most of their time in exploration mode. Downtime almost
exclusively takes place within a settlement.
MARKETPLACES
Where there are people, there is commerce. The Buying
and Selling section on page 24 provides several sets of
guidelines for handling commerce in your game, but it can
also be helpful to have a sense of what items and economic
power a given settlement has on its own merits.
In a given settlement, a character can usually purchase
any common item (including formulas, alchemical items,
and magic items) that is of the same or lower level than
the settlement’s. Usually, fewer of the highest‑level items
are available—you can use Table 10–9: Party Treasure by
Level on page 509 of the Core Rulebook as a guideline for
how many of the highest‑level items might be available,
using the Permanent Items and Consumables entries for a
level 1 lower than the settlement’s actual level. Inhabitants
of a settlement can usually purchase items from PCs as
long as those items are the same or lower level than the
settlement, with limitations on higher‑level items similar
to those available for sale. If a settlement’s population is
significantly smaller than its level would suggest, its ability
to provide and purchase items may be more limited.
If a character’s level is higher than the settlement’s, that
character can usually use their own influence and leverage
to acquire higher‑level items, as they convince shops to place
specialty orders or artisans to craft custom goods, though it
might take a bit of time for such orders to be fulfilled.
Spellcasting services are available in many settlements.
Barring a powerful spellcasting NPC in the city with
whom the party could negotiate for services, a character
can find someone to cast common spells up to a level that
could be cast by an NPC of the settlement’s level. For
example, a character in a 9th‑level city can typically find
and pay someone to cast a 5th‑level common spell—the
highest spell available to a 9th‑level spellcaster.
Some settlements have access to uncommon items,
formulas, and spells. If a settlement could reasonably be
considered to meet the Access entry for an item or spell,
that item or spell is available just like any common item.
For example, the dwarven settlement of Kraggodan has
plenty of dwarf weapons available.
POWER STRUCTURES
Outside of city limits, adventurers spend much of their time
operating on their own terms, accountable only to their own
moral code. But in a settlement, the heroes become part of
a larger system with its own codified laws, procedures, and
enforcement. The details of a settlement’s power structures
shape the party’s interactions within that settlement.

================================================================================

government
The government of a settlement often reflects the nature
of that settlement. A lawful, militaristic city likely has a
hierarchical government with a single figure at the top, a
crossroads market town might be under the control of its
wealthiest merchant families, and a farming community
might simply look to the oldest residents for leadership
as necessary.
That said, the lawful and publicly recognized ruler of
a settlement isn’t always the one calling the shots. They
may merely be a puppet to a secret entity that silently
pulls the strings from the shadows. Some settlements
are ruled by hidden cabals, from strange religious sects
to thieves’ guilds. A settlement might be swayed by
politically powerful residents, such an occult vizier or a
political savvy high priest. In some cases, the legitimate
authority may seem to govern but has actually been
replaced by a faceless stalker, a devil in disguise, or
another powerful shapechanger.
LegaL CodeS
Most civilizations agree that laws are necessary to ensure
a functioning society. The specific laws range from one
settlement to another, and they might be as simple as a
prohibition against murder and theft to exceptionally
convoluted regulatory schemes dictating everything from
clothing details to available confections. How well known
these laws are can further flavor a party’s interactions
with that settlement, as it’s likely easier to navigate a
well‑documented system than one in which the rules are
learned only through experience and word of mouth.
Much like a government, the legal codes reflect the
settlement’s alignment and overall nature. Generally
speaking, a more lawful settlement is likely to have more
complex laws, and a more lax locale to have fewer and
simpler laws.
Law enforCement
Most settlements have systems in place to enforce their
laws. In a small village, the residents might just police
themselves, holding one another accountable to their
shared values. Towns and larger settlements usually have
some system of guards, whether that’s a post filled by a
rotation of volunteers or a city guard of professionals
paid by the city’s government to maintain order. Most
settlements have some way of dealing with criminals, from
fines to public stocks to prison cells, as well as individuals
responsible for meting out those sentences.
organizationS, ChurCheS, and faCtionS
The government isn’t the only influential factor in a
settlement. Prestigious organizations, prominent churches,
and specialized factions all wield power as well, often
in conflict with the official government or one another.

================================================================================

Religious congregations usually wield significant power
in communities where faith is strong. A wizard, sorcerer,
or bard of even moderate magical talent would be a rare
and influential member of society in a small settlement.
An organization can wield overt influence over the
community where they’re based, or subtle control, as
the Pathfinder Society does in Absalom. Other notable
factions may include noble houses, wealthy merchants,
innkeepers, and retired soldiers and adventurers.
Corruption
In any settlement, it’s possible for officials to put their
own interests before those of the people they serve.
Corruption might be as simple as a clerk willing to accept
a bribe to expedite some paperwork, or it might be as
sinister as selling civilians into slavery.
SETTLEMENT STAT BLOCK
A settlement’s stat block consolidates the basic information
about a settlement into a centralized format.
SETTLEMENT NAME
SETTLEMENT (LEVEL)
ALIGNMENT
TYPE
OTHER TRAITS
The first elements of a settlement stat block are its name
and level. A settlement’s level represents its relative size and
economic capacity, as well as roughly corresponding to the
maximum level of NPC that can be found there, not counting
significant NPCs listed below. In general, any common items
with a level no higher than the settlement’s level are available
for purchase (though a character of a higher level can usually
ferret out or custom order higher-level items). In addition, the
settlement’s level is used to help determine the maximum
possible task level that could become available there to Earn
Income (Core Rulebook 504). Both these are simply guidelines,
however, and a GM should make exceptions at their discretion.
Following the settlement’s heading are its traits. The first of
these is the trait representing the settlement’s alignment. This
trait represents the alignment of the settlement’s government
and overall society, and while it may indicate a trend, it doesn’t
dictate the alignment of every individual citizen. After the
alignment trait is the trait for the type of settlement: village,
town, city, or metropolis. This trait generally reflects the size of
the settlement, but it also tends to correlate to a settlement’s
level. A village is usually level 0–1, a town level 2–4, a city level
5–7, and a metropolis 8 or above, though the presence of many
higher-level or wealthy residents could easily skew the level
of a village, town, or city upwards.
A settlement might have other traits in addition to its
alignment and type traits. For example, the dwarven sky
citadel of Kraggodan has the dwarf trait, since it was built and
is predominantly occupied by dwarves. The city of Lepidstadt
in Ustalav has the academic trait, due to its focus around the
prestigious University of Lepidstadt.
Following the settlement’s traits is a simple sentence that
provides a short description of the settlement and its role in
the story or region.
Government This entry describes the settlement’s governing
entity, such as a mayor, the town elder, an elected council,
and so on.
Population The settlement’s total population is listed here,
followed by a breakdown of the population by ancestry
in parentheses.
Languages The languages commonly spoken in the settlement
are listed here, ordered alphabetically.
Religions This entry lists the religions and philosophies
commonly practiced in the settlement. If the settlement
has an official religion, that is indicated in parenthesis. If
the settlement has prohibited any religions or philosophies,
those are listed in a Prohibited entry following the
Religions entry.
Threats This entry lists the major threats facing the settlement,
such as ongoing drought or famine, political uprisings,
criminal activity, and the like.
Other Characteristics A settlement might have distinctive
features that affect its residents or visitors entering the
city, such as a particular trade that makes certain items
more available.
Significant NPCs The final section of the settlement stat block
presents the most significant NPCs of that settlement.
This usually includes the settlement’s official leader, if
it’s a single person. It also includes other movers and
shakers, local celebrities, and persons of particular interest
to adventurers.
SAMPLE SETTLEMENT ABILITIES
Here are some common settlement abilities you can use
to customize a settlement of your own creation.
Artists’ Haven: Residents of this city have a deep
appreciation for fine art. It’s easier to find higher‑level
tasks involving Performance or art, as well as buyers
willing to pay more for art objects.
COMMON NPCS
Several categories of NPCs are quite common in settlements,
if not exclusive to them. The following sections from the
NPC Gallery of this book provide statistics and additional
useful information for running settlements.
• Courtiers (page 206) The upper crust of society is most
common in larger settlements.
• Magistrates (page 224) These public officials create and
implement the law.
• Officers (page 232) Officers are responsible for enforcing
the law in a settlement.
• Performers (page 236) Performers are most common in
settlements, where there are large audiences.
• Publicans (page 238) Nearly every settlement has at least
one gathering place and its regulars.
• Scholars (page 240) Most repositories of lore are located
within settlements.
• Tradespeople (page 244) Tradespeople provide the skilled
labor that keeps a town supplied and running.
Gamemastery Guide

PAGE 136
================================================================================

City of Artisans: Items of up to 4 levels higher are
available from a particular category the settlement is
famous for, such as armor and weapons.
Magical Academy: The settlement prides itself on
teaching magic, and its residents are skilled at teaching
others. Choose a magical tradition or traditions suitable
to your settlement. When a PC pays an NPC to teach
them a new spell of that tradition in the settlement, the
NPC assists the process and provides an additional +2
circumstance bonus to the check to Learn the Spell.
Religious Bias: This settlement has a strong
affiliation with a particular religion. Anyone who is
visibly a worshipper of that deity gains a +1
circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks to
Make an Impression, Request, and Gather
Information. Characters who visibly
worship one of that deity’s foes take
a –1 circumstance penalty to the
same actions.
Scholarly: An abundance
of
public
libraries
or
other
accessible
places
of learning within this
settlement means that with
1d4 hours, a character can
access a scholarly journal
on a relevant common
subject
(Core
Rulebook
291) before attempting to
Recall Knowledge.
CHANGING A SETTLEMENT
Sometimes the characters spend a
long period of time in a single settlement.
Perhaps it’s their home base, where they spend their
downtime between adventures, or perhaps the entire
adventure takes place there. In these cases, you might
find you need to update your settlement stat block as it
changes over time.
Several elements of the settlement stat block are
simple to update; you change the population as it
grows or shrinks, and you change the leaders on your
stat block as different people move between those
positions. But you also might make changes that
reflect the results of the PCs’ adventures. If the heroes
eliminated a major threat facing the settlement, you
should remove that threat from the stat block—but if
they drew the wrath of a new foe in doing so, you
might add that new threat! You can also update the
stat block’s abilities, should the PCs’ actions have that
large an influence on the city. For example, if the party
(using the leadership subsystem on page 168) built up
a wizard school focused on crafting magical items,
you might add an ability to the settlement stat block
that increased the availability of magic items in the
settlement’s markets.

================================================================================

Exploring the planes offers several opportunities for high
adventure, as well chances to discover the secrets of creation.
PLANAR TRAITS
Each plane, dimension, and demiplane has its own properties
and attributes. Planar traits can be broken down into six
categories: alignment, scope, gravity, time, morphic, and
planar essence. Combined, those traits describe the laws and
makeup of the plane. These appear in the plane’s traits entry,
though any trait that matches the Material Plane (described
in the Normal entry in each section below) is omitted.
ENHANCED AND IMPEDED MAGIC
Some planes enhance certain magic and impede opposing
effects. A plane that enhances a particular type of
magic grants anyone Casting a Spell with that trait a +1
circumstance bonus to their spell DC or spell attack roll
with that spell. Impeded magic means a character who Casts
a Spell or Activates an Item with the specified trait must
succeed at a DC 6 flat check or lose the spell or activation.
ALIGNMENT TRAIT
Certain planes, particularly in the Outer Sphere, are attuned
to an alignment. Most inhabitants share that alignment—
even powerful creatures such as deities. Planes with the
neutral alignment trait are more often a mix of alignments
than strongly neutral, and planes with no alignment affinity
simply don’t have an alignment trait, rather than being
neutral. Alignments are given as an abbreviation (Pathfinder
Bestiary 345), which appears first in the plane’s list of traits.
Spells that share any of the plane’s alignment traits are
enhanced, and those with opposing traits are impeded. For
instance, in the chaotic evil Abyss, chaotic and evil spells are
enhanced, and lawful and good spells are impeded.
SCOPE TRAIT
Most planes are immeasurable, so immense they are
impossible to quantify. Which immeasurable planes, if any,
are infinite is a subject of debate among philosophers and
scholars alike. Since so many planes are immeasurable,
those planes omit a scope trait. Otherwise, the plane likely
has either the finite or unbounded trait.
Finite: Finite planes consist of a limited amount of space.
Immeasurable: Immeasurable planes are immeasurably
large, perhaps infinite.
THE PLANES
Beyond the world of Golarion and the void of space beyond it lie the vast planes of
existence referred to as the Great Beyond. Often alien and dangerous, most of these
planes embody some foundational aspect of reality—one of the chief elements that make
up the rest of the multiverse, a kind of fundamental energy, or an alignment. Each plane
is a reality unto itself, with its own laws of existence and its own native inhabitants who
might visit, grant benefits to residents of, or cause havoc on the face of Golarion.
Unbounded: Unbounded planes loop back on themselves
when a creature reaches the plane’s “edge.”
GRAVITY TRAITS
Many planes have unusual gravity.
Normal: Bodies of great mass are the centers of gravity,
and objects fall toward those centers with a measured
amount of force relative to the size of the body.
High Gravity: As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass
act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size of
the body is greater than on the Material Plane. The Bulk
of all creatures and objects is doubled, meaning creatures
acclimated to normal gravity can carry only half as much.
Creatures used to normal gravity move at half Speed and can
jump only half as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are
impossible beyond the third range increment (instead of the
sixth). Creatures that fall in high gravity take bludgeoning
damage equal to the distance they fell.
Low Gravity: As in normal gravity, bodies of great mass
act as centers of gravity, but the force relative to the size
of the body is less than on the Material Plane. The Bulk
of all creatures and objects is halved, meaning creatures
acclimated to normal gravity can carry twice as much and
jump twice as high and far. Physical ranged attacks are
possible up to the twelfth range increment (instead of the
sixth). Creatures that fall in low gravity take no damage for
the first 10 feet of a fall, and then take bludgeoning damage
equal to a quarter of the remaining distance it fell.
Microgravity: There is little to no gravity on this plane.
Creatures float in space unless they can push off a surface or
use some force to propel themselves throughout the plane.
Strange Gravity: All bodies of mass are centers of gravity
with roughly the same force. A creature can stand on any
solid objects that is as large as or larger than themself.
Subjective Gravity: All bodies of mass can be centers
of gravity with the same force, but only if a non‑mindless
creature wills it. Unattended items, objects, and mindless
creatures treat the plane as having microgravity. Creatures
on a plane with subjective gravity can move normally
along a solid surface by imagining “down” near their
feet. Designating this downward direction is a free action
that has the concentration trait. If suspended in midair,
a creature can replicate flight by choosing a “down”
direction and falling in that direction, moving up to their
Speed or fly Speed. This pseudo‑flight uses the Fly action.

PAGE 138
================================================================================

TIME TRAITS
Time flows differently on many planes.
Normal: Time passes the same way it does on the Material
Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals 1 hour
on the Material Plane.
Erratic: Time slows down and speeds up, so an individual
may lose or gain time as they move between planes. When a
creature moves from a plane with erratic time to one with
normal time, roll a DC 11 flat check. Creatures that leave
an erratic time plane together share the same result.
Success Time passed normally on the erratic time plane.
Failure For each hour spent on the erratic time plane, 1 day
passed on the normal time plane.
Critical Failure For each round spent on the erratic time plane,
1 day passed on the normal time plane.
Flowing: The flow of time is consistently faster or slower.
A creature may travel to one of these planes, spend a year
there, and find that only an hour passed on the Material
Plane; alternatively, they might spend a minute on this
plane and find out an hour passed on the Material Plane.
Timeless: Time still passes, but the effects of time are
diminished. Creatures on these planes don’t feel hunger,
thirst, or the effects of aging or natural healing. The effects
of poison, diseases, and other kinds of healing may also
be diminished on certain timeless planes. Spell energy and
other effects still dissipate, so the durations of spells and
other effects function as normal. The danger of this trait
is that when a creature leaves a timeless plane and enters a
plane with another time trait, the effects of hunger, thirst,
aging, and other effects slowed or arrested by the timeless
trait occur retroactively in the instant of transition, possibly
causing the creature to immediately starve or die of old age.
MORPHIC TRAITS
This trait describes how easily the physical nature of the
plane can be changed. The Material Plane is the norm, but
other planes can warp through the plane’s own sentient
designs or be manipulated by extremely powerful creatures.
Normal: Objects remain where they are (and what they
are) unless affected by physical force or magic. Creatures
can change the immediate environment as a result of
tangible effort, such as by digging a hole.
Metamorphic: Things change by means other than
physical force or magic. Sometimes spells have morphic
effects. Other times, the plane’s nature is under the control
of a deity or power, or the plane simply changes at random.
Sentient: The plane changes based on its own whims.
Static: Visitors can’t affect living residents of the plane or
objects the denizens carry in any way. Any spells that would
affect those on the plane have no effect unless the static trait
is somehow removed or suppressed.
PLANAR ESSENCE TRAITS
Planar essence traits describe a plane’s fundamental
nature. For example, many of the Inner Sphere’s planes are
infused with an element or energy, each of which affects
magic on those planes, and the Shadow Plane is awash
with shadow. Outer Planes are fundamentally made up
of quintessence, a philosophically aligned material with
infinite potential for shape and state that conforms to
powerful and prevailing beliefs.
Air: Planes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces
and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also
contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and
energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres,
though they may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas.
Air magic is enhanced, and earth magic is impeded. Earth
creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air
planes, which tend to at least make them uncomfortable, as
there is little solid ground for them to gain their bearings.
Earth: These planes are mostly solid. Travelers arriving
upon an earth plane risk suffocation if they don’t reach a
cavern or some other air pocket within the plane’s solid
matter. Creatures who can’t burrow are entombed in the
plane’s substance and must attempt to dig their way toward
an air pocket. Earth magic is enhanced, and air magic is
impeded. Air creatures are ill at ease, as they rarely have the
space to move freely through even the most lofty warrens.
Fire: Planes with this trait are composed of flames
that continually burn with no fuel source. Fire planes are
extremely hostile to non‑fire creatures.
Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable
materials catch fire almost immediately, and creatures
wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch fire, typically
taking 1d6 persistent fire damage. Extraplanar creatures
take moderate environmental fire damage at the end of
each round (sometimes minor environmental damage in
safer areas, or major or massive damage in even more fiery
areas). Fire magic is enhanced, and cold and water magic
are impeded. Water creatures are extremely uncomfortable
on a fire plane, and any natural resistance they have against
fire doesn’t function against this environmental fire damage.
Water: These planes are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t
breathe water or reach an air pocket likely drown. Water
magic is enhanced, and fire magic is impeded. Creatures
with a weakness to water take damage equal to double
their weakness at the end of each round.
Negative: Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches
that suck the life from the living. They tend to be lonely,
haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds
carrying the moans of those who died within them. At the
end of each round, a living creature takes at least minor
negative environmental damage. In the strongest areas of
a negative plane, they could take moderate or even major
negative damage at the end of each round. This damage
has the death trait, and if a living creature is reduced to 0
Hit Points by this negative damage and killed, it crumbles
into ash and can become a wraith (Bestiary 335). Negative
magic is enhanced, and positive magic is impeded.
Positive: These planes are awash with life energy.
Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and
sensations are more intense. At the end of each round, an

undead creature takes at least minor positive environmental
damage. In the strongest areas of a positive plane, they
could take moderate or even major positive damage at the
end of each round. While this might seem safe for living
creatures, positive planes present a different danger. Living
creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the
environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this
would bring the living creature above their maximum HP,
any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these
temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until
the creature leaves the plane. If a creature’s temporary
HP from a positive plane ever exceeds its maximum
HP, it explodes in a burst of overloaded positive energy,
spreading across the area to birth new souls. Positive magic
is enhanced, and negative magic is impeded.
Shadow: Planes with this trait are umbral with murky
light. On a shadow plane, the radius of all light from light
sources and the areas of light spells are halved. Darkness and
shadow magic are enhanced, and light magic is impeded.
PLANAR STAT BLOCKS
Each of the planes listed in the following pages includes
a short stat block of key information. The plane’s type—
whether it is a plane, dimension, or demiplane—appears
in the stat block’s heading, followed by the traits that
define that plane. The following entries also provide
important information about each plane.
Category: This indicates whether the plane is an Inner
Plane, Outer Plane, Transitive Plane, or dimension.
Divinities: A list of all of the deities, demigods, and other
powers that call this realm their home.
Native Inhabitants: A sample of typical inhabitants of
the plane. Also listed are the plane’s petitioners, the souls
of dead mortals who have been judged and sent on to
whichever plane reflects the life they led. More information
on petitioners can be found in Pathfinder Bestiary 2.
INNER SPHERE PLANES
The planes of the Inner Sphere form the heart of the
cosmos. They are the home of mortal life, the focus of
divine attention, the source of mortal souls, and the origin
point of the great cycle of quintessence that fuels the
motions and stability of reality itself. Arranged in a nested
series of shells, like layers of an onion, the planes of the
Inner Sphere include, from outer to inner: the Elemental
Planes of Fire, Earth, Water, and Air; the universe of the
Material Plane; and at the very core of this cosmological
ensemble, the raw forces of creation and destruction of the
Positive and Negative Energy Planes.

Native Inhabitants dwarves, elves, halflings, humans, gnomes,
goblins, and countless other ancestries
The Material Plane is the prosaic universe and the home
of mortal life. Innumerable galaxies play host to countless
stars and their planets, each housing unique settings for any
campaign, with Golarion as the classic example. Other worlds of
note like Castrovel, Akiton, and Eox exist within Golarion’s own
solar system, and then beyond this, orbiting other distant stars
or in other galaxies still, worlds such as Androffa, Carcosa, and
even Earth swirl within the Material Plane’s vast and silent void.
Yet for all the profound wonder and diversity of life that the
Material Plane houses, in the dark places between the stars,
known as the Dark Tapestry, lurk the inimical gods known
as the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones, the sinister collective
known as the Dominion of the Black.
The Material Plane serves as the destination for pre-incarnate
souls, each mortal life born, living, and dying before sending its
spirit toward the planes of the Outer Sphere for judgment. The
Material Plane is likewise the focus of the gods, each of whom is
invested in fostering their own particular portfolio among mortal
worshippers and the material world at large.

Native Inhabitants sceaduinars, wraiths, and other undead
The vast void of the Negative Energy Plane is a merciless, lightless
expanse of manifest destruction and nothingness. Sapping and
consuming the life force of any living creature exposed to its
energies, it corrodes and disintegrates material objects to rubble,
then dust, and then nothing at all. Yet the Void contains its own
form of anti-life. At their densest concentration, the plane’s
energies aggregate into bizarre, black crystalline snowflake
structures, and these irregularities spontaneously generate the
plane’s resident sceaduinars. Dwelling in beautiful, deadly cities
drifting in the vacuous darkness, these so-called void raptors are
incapable of true creation and blame this flaw on some ancient
betrayal by their rivals on the Positive Energy Plane. Sceaduinars
react violently not only toward creatures sustained by positive
energy, but also toward undead, whom they view as unnatural
parasites unworthy of their plane’s energies.
The black depths also swarm with undead, creatures doomed
to a mockery of life by the interaction of their souls with the
plane’s entropic energy. Yet for all the horrors posed by the
plane’s environment, inhabitants, and its undead victims, its
depths nevertheless hide rare refuges for planar travelers.
Malikar’s Keep offers shelter, for a price, to those willing to
bargain with its titular lich master, while elsewhere the depths
hide entire lost worlds such as Fallen Duromak, and deadly
mysteries like the planet-sized, undead-entrapping glass
sphere, Eternity’s Doorstep.

Native Inhabitants jyoti, petitioners (enlightened)
Known as Creation’s Forge, the Positive Energy Plane is at once
the source of life-sustaining positive energy, the origin of all
pre-incarnate mortal souls, and paradoxically the most innately
hostile of all of the planes. While positive energy is deadly to
undead and beneficial to living beings, such is the intensity of
the plane that unmitigated exposure ultimately incinerates any
extraplanar beings without sufficient magical protection. The
most apt comparison for the plane’s interior is that of the heart
of a burning star, and indeed the stars of the Material Plane each
house natural portals to the Positive Energy Plane within their
glowing, potent cores to foster the movement of pre-incarnate
souls in their first steps in the great cycle of life and death.
Brilliant and blinding, the plane’s interior is sparsely populated,
and the resident phoenix-kin jyoti are intensely xenophobic.
Dwelling in glimmering, radiant crystalline cities such as
Arudrellisiir, they view themselves as gardeners and guardians
of souls spawned from their realm’s burning quintessence.
Intensely distrustful of gods and their servitors, jyoti can
nonetheless be bargained with, and they have frequently taken
into their custodianship any number of artifacts and imprisoned
beings considered too dangerous to house on any other plane.

AIR

Category Inner Plane
Divinities elemental lords of air
Native Inhabitants air elementals, cloud dragons, djinn,
petitioners (air pneuma)
The Plane of Air, innermost of the Elemental Planes, is a vast
realm of wind, storms, and skies. Illuminated by great artificial
globes of flame and distant starlight from the material universe,
the plane is populated by air elementals, dragons, mephits, and
a great empire of djinn. Though mostly clouds and empty skies,
the plane is not entirely bereft of solid ground, including rock
and ice created by the residents or dragged into their realm from
the distant Plane of Earth or neighboring Plane of Water, and
bizarre, drifting spheres of brass and iron. While the former are
aggressively fought over, most housing the cities of the vast djinn
empire, the latter are almost entirely abandoned and shunned by
the plane’s inhabitants, who believe them cursed, entrapping
forgotten, ancient enemies who once ravaged the plane.
The djinn rule from their shining capital city of Armun Kelisk,
built atop a series of seven floating islands. Their vast trade
network crisscrosses the skies and ventures to other planes,
kept aloft by natural and magical flight, including great airships
that allow visitors to quickly and safely traverse the skies. The
djinn are welcoming and gracious hosts to extraplanar travelers
and adventurers, a perspective not shared by Hshurha the
Duchess of All Winds, the evil elemental lord of air.

Native Inhabitants crystal dragons, earth elementals, petitioners
(earth pneuma), shaitans
A great and rocky shell situated between the Plane of Fire and
Plane of Water, the Eternal Delve hosts a unique and varied
ecology of creatures at home in its rocky depths. Far from an
endless, solid expanse, the Plane of Earth is riddled with great
caverns and cave systems, excavated artificial vaults, vast
crystalline geodes, and underground oceans and springs of
magma where it borders its neighboring planes. Housing untold
riches in gemstones and veins of precious metals, the Plane of
Earth is an attractive setting for planar travelers seeking wealth
and willing to risk danger and the wrath of elementals, shaitans,
and other inhabitants who resent the plunder of their home.
While elementals have little organized society, the shaitan
genies’ Peerless Empire rules much of the plane from its capital,
the Opaline Vault—a rainbow-lit city within a 30-mile-wide geode
cavern. The shaitans have long been at war with the efreet
in the neighboring Plane of Fire, and while the earth genies
are less prone to slavery than their rivals, the shaitans brook
little dissent, and their rule can be harsh. They are downright
welcoming, however, compared to Ayrzul the Fossilized King,
the evil elemental lord of earth who rules a great expanse of rock
from his radiation-poisoned domain, the Blistering Labyrinth.

FIRE

Divinities elemental lords of fire, Feronia
Native Inhabitants azers, efreet, fire elementals, magma
dragons, petitioners (fire pneuma)
Like a great, gleaming ball of flame situated at the heart of the
Astral Plane, the Plane of Fire is the outermost plane of the Inner
Sphere. A perpetual ocean of fire with skies of smoke, storms of
raining cinders, and lakes and rivers of magma flowing along its
border with the Elemental Plane of Earth, the plane is incredibly
hostile to those unprepared for its natural hazards. Yet it houses
one of the most well-known and traversed cities in all the planes:
the City of Brass, capital of the Dominion of Flame. Floating above
a sea of fire upon a great hemisphere of magical brass, the City of
Brass is a monument both to efreet cosmopolitan grandeur and
tyranny, the latter embodied by the grand sultana of the efreet.
Outside of the mercantile districts and the palaces and temples
of the fire genies, the city houses a vast enslaved underclass of
salamanders and others, including creatures from other planes.
The efreeti domain is not absolute, and elsewhere in the
plane are nations of fire mephits and the remains of an ancient
azer empire. While they don’t form any cohesive, organized
nations, the plane’s fire elementals are ruled over by the plane’s
most powerful entity, Ymeri the Queen of the Inferno, the evil
elemental lord of fire whose reign has gone unquestioned since
the imprisonment of her good-aligned rival Atreia eons ago.

SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY
WATER
Category Inner Plane
Divinities elemental lords of water
Native Inhabitants brine dragons, marids, petitioners (water
pneuma), water elementals
Beyond the skies of the Plane of Air, the clouds grow darker
and condense into the vast, spherical, liquid shell of the Plane of
Water. Its nearly limitless stretches of saline, fresh, and brackish
seas teem with all manner of oceanic life, lit by light from the
border with the Plane of Air and descending into black, benthic
depths where it borders the Plane of Earth. While the plane is
perfectly amenable to water-breathing creatures, air-breathing
travelers must provide their own supply of air or magical means
to breathe. Bubbles of breathable atmosphere are relatively
rare and securely guarded, anchored over places of trade and
commerce with outsiders, such as the great city of Vialesk,
founded by immigrant undines. The plane’s oceans, dotted by
vast forests of kelp, magical currents, and strange phenomena,
play host to empires of merfolk, predatory and expansionist sea
devils, and the holdings of the plane’s great brine dragons.
While marids once claimed nearly absolute dominion over the
plane of their origin, their empire long ago fell into deterioration
and disunity. Their ravaged cities sank into the depths, and their
present-day holdings remain a shadow of their former grandeur.
Kelizandri the Brackish Emperor, the evil elemental lord of water
and cause of their ruin, rules the dark, saline depths, feasting
on all rivals and hoarding the vast, stolen wealth of the fallen
marid cities. Unlike other subjective gravity planes, on the Plane
of Water, a creature moves based on its swim Speed and must
use actions to Swim if it doesn’t have one.
TRANSITIVE PLANES
At a minimum, each Transitive Plane coexists with one or
more other planes, a relationship oversimplified by stating
that Transitive Planes are just used to get from one plane to
another. The mists of the Ethereal Plane overlap the planes
of the Inner Sphere, while the Astral Plane borders every
other plane in existence like the backstage of the cosmos.
Bright and dark mirrors of the Material Plane, the First
World and Shadow Plane overlap the mortal world, albeit
often in bizarre ways such that a short distance in one might
be a vast gulf in the other. The daring, wise, or desperate can
utilize these planes to bypass barriers in the Material Plane
or rapidly cross vast distances through much swifter travel.

The Silver Sea surrounds the planes of the Inner Sphere,
separating them from those of the Outer Sphere. The Astral Plane
provides the backdrop against which the River of Souls flows
from the Material Plane, ushering departed spirits toward final
judgment. Far from an empty void, the Astral’s silver substance
churns with currents and storms from the metaphysical heat
of the Plane of Fire, and where it touches the chaos of the
Maelstrom, the resulting eddies interact with the memories of
the dead to produce fleeting simulacra and even demiplanes.

The River of Souls draws the attention of soul-hunting
daemons and opportunistic night hags like sharks drawn to the
scent of blood. Led by psychopomps, a cross section of nearly
every type of celestial and monitor in existence, along with some
fiends, defends the proper flow of souls against such predators.
Running opposite the River of Souls is the flow of raw, unaligned
quintessence spun off from the so-called Antipode, channeled by
aeons back toward the Positive Energy Plane.
Travelers within the Astral find the plane untouched by
the passage of time, a property exploited by many mortals
fearing old age. Time, however, is not easily escaped, and upon
exiting the Astral Plane, a creature finds this debt catching up
to them, potentially aging to dust in moments.

SUBJECTIVE GRAVITY
Category Transitive Plane
Divinities Alazhra
Native Inhabitants ether spiders, night hags, petitioners
(terrorized)
The Ethereal Plane is a vast, misty realm overlapping each of the
Inner Planes. Formed by the interacting tidal forces of creation
and destruction from the Positive and Negative Energy Planes,
this plane swirls with currents and eddies of fog, lit only by
erratic pulses of soft green luminescence and dimly visible light
of those planes it overlays, visible but ever intangible. While
mortals most often use the Ethereal as a means of transit, moving
by force of will in the absence of gravity to bypass barriers on
their own plane, the Ethereal hosts dangers and wonders, things
lost or abandoned in the mists, and things spun from local
eddies in the ethereal protomatter. Predatory monsters, ether
spiders, night hags and their goddess Alazhra, and all manner of
incorporeal undead roam the Space Between Spaces.
While travelers can easily become lost in the mists with little
to guide them, the plane does host some permanent structures,
drawing adventurers or dissuading them. One such location,
the House of the Itinerant Soul, houses wayward or lost
souls, offering visitors shelter and a way to avoid turning into
undead while avoiding the pull of the River of Souls. The grand
cathedral also serves as a focus for mortal planar travelers,
given its safety and the presence of friendly spirits willing to
serve as guides in the surrounding mists.

Divinities the Eldest
Native Inhabitants fey, linnorms
The First World was a first draft of the Material Plane, crafted
by divinities to test their metaphorical crafting materials and
palettes of colors before setting it aside to create a second, final
version of their work. A realm of extremes—savage, primal, and
beautiful—with colors and sensations brighter and more intense
than the mundane world created after it, the First World is
populated by fey and the divine entities known as the Eldest.
Mirroring mercurial fey whimsy, the First World’s laws of nature
constantly and unpredictably change. Distance and time are
wildly inconsistent, such that mortal travelers might spend an
hour or a day within the First World, only to find a century or
only a few seconds passed once they return to their own plane.
The First World stands outside the cycle of souls, something
the fey call the Great Abandonment, save for rare worshippers of
the Eldest whose souls incarnate here as fey. However, the plane’s
proximity to the Positive Energy Plane provides an environment
bursting with all manner of strange life and a general absence of
true death for its native fey unless they leave—as did gnomes.
Natural gates in wild places of the mortal realm connect to the
First World, which fey often use to visit the Material Plane or
ensnare mortals for their own capricious desires.

SHADOW
Category Transitive Plane
Divinities velstrac demagogues, Zon-Kuthon
Native Inhabitants caligni, d’ziriaks, kayals (fetchlings),
petitioners (the mutilated), umbral dragons, velstracs
A murky, distorted, and imperfect mirror of the Material Plane,
the Shadow Plane overlaps the Material Plane and serves as a
buffer or conduit between it and the Negative Energy Plane. The
Shadow Plane exists in a state of perpetually dim half-light, the
landscape containing similar features to the overlapping Material
Plane, but in warped or twisted fashions. Cities on the Material
Plane might exist on the Shadow Plane, sometimes in ruins and
sometimes as terrible, frightening replicas. The darkness also
holds points of beauty and relative safety, such as the great city
of Shadow Absalom. The bleak doppelganger of Golarion’s own
Absalom hosts cross-planar trade facilitated by a permanent,
one-way portal out of the gloom.
The Shadow Plane is populated by dark, altered versions of
creatures from the Material Plane, many of them immigrants that
have adapted to the shadow after being trapped in the realm for
generations. The shadow natives known as kayals—also known as
fetchlings—were originally humans before thousands of years of
exposure to the Shadow Plane and breeding with strange beings
forever altered them. Velstracs, who long ago fled from Hell, have
since adopted the Shadow Plane as their home, spreading their
horrific message of perfection through mutilation in service to
their victim and patron, the god Zon-Kuthon. In contrast, d’ziriaks
originated within the Shadow Plane itself, as have the fearsome
umbral dragons ruling self-crafted fiefdoms within the shadows.
Greatest of these is Argrinyxia, who rules over Shadow Absalom.
OUTER SPHERE PLANES
The planes of the Outer Sphere are the manifest realms
of alignment: chaos, evil, good, law, neutrality, and their
admixtures, populated by celestials, fiends, monitors, and
others who promote these moral concepts. These planes are
the backdrop upon which the mortal afterlife reaches its
apparent conclusion, and the end destination of the River
of Souls. The Outer Planes are regions of stability adrift in
the raw, chaotic quintessence of the primordial Maelstrom,
its tides forever gnawing at their edges even as mortal souls

A perpetual eclipse looms above the bleak wastelands of
Abaddon, shedding an eerie half-light over a landscape of toxic,
disease-ridden swamps, volcanic wastes, fog-shrouded forests,
and the glittering, memory-devouring ribbon of the River Styx.
An unnatural silence blankets the plane, cut only by the wails
of petitioners falling from the sky like screaming, falling stars,
or those already condemned upon the ground, desperate to find
safety that doesn’t exist. Daemons, the physical embodiments
of death and oblivion, roam unchecked, owing allegiance only to
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Famine, Pestilence,
and War. In the courts of the Horsemen and the neutral grounds
of trade cities such as Awaiting-Consumption, the soul trade
serves daemonic hunger and industrialized oblivion. Night
hags and other creatures ply the trade or make their way along
the margins of daemonic society, eager to avoid consumption
themselves by the plane’s nihilistic masters. Urgathoa and
Zyphus claim divine domains here, their petitioners granted
freedom from predation. Yet something far worse glares down
upon these gods and the Horseman alike. Abaddon’s perpetual
eclipse may be nothing less than the lidded, comatose eye of the
Bound Prince, the First Horseman, betrayed and cast down by
the Four, forgotten by the cosmos at large, but far too powerful
for them to destroy—waiting, watching, and hungering.

Like a corrosive rot in the roots of the Outer Sphere, or an
antithetical, rival reality run aground into the Maelstrom at the
dawn of time, the Abyss is a place of horror and destruction
fed by mortal sin. Each of its innumerable regions is a unique
iteration of chaos and evil, each with its own terrible and twisted
environment, with one driving maxim: the strong survive, while
the weak suffer and are destroyed. Ruled by demons, and before
them by the alien, nightmarish qlippoth, the Abyss and its native
beings seek only to ravage and destroy. While demons routinely
rampage out into other planes when the Abyss manifests a
great planar rift, the denizens of the Abyss are fractured and
self-destructive. Demon lords such as Dagon, Pazuzu, and Zura,
and even gods including the ascended demon lord Lamashtu, the
Mother of Monsters, fight for dominion over the Abyss as much
or more than they threaten the other planes. Though dangerous,
not every realm of the Abyss is immediately hostile to the
prepared traveler. Shamira’s city of Alushinyrra in the Midnight
Isles and Abraxas’s library-city of Diovengia in the realm of
Pleroma are each welcoming in their own dark ways. Even those
who survive a journey through the Abyss, however, inevitably
must resist being deeply corrupted by the experience.

Axis is a realm of pure, absolute law, unhindered by the
moral concerns of good or evil. The plane takes the form of
a vast, gleaming, perfectly structured city. Built at the base
of Pharasma’s Spire, the Perfect City is a bulwark against
the chaos of the Maelstrom and Abyss, with vast mechanical
armies of inevitables marching forth to explore, define, and
pacify an imperfect, unruly universe. Axis is also home
to axiomites: beings composed of living mathematics and
equations who helped create the first inevitables. Axiomites
continue to work on the maintenance of the inevitables, but
increasingly turn their attentions to the planar city of Axis
itself; as with any city, Axis requires non-stop maintenance
and improvement in order to resist the march of time.
Axis’s natives are far from the only inhabitants of their
cosmopolitan realm. Devils and archons often visit along with
petitioners, mortal travelers, and smaller numbers of most every
other kind of extraplanar being. Abadar and other lawful deities
make their homes here. The empty, former domain of Aroden
languishes here, while below the streets lies Norgorber’s domain,

of the Astral Plane. As the destination of the River of Souls,
the Boneyard is where the souls of the mortal dead arrive for
judgment and for Pharasma and her psychopomp servitors to
direct them to their respective afterlives. Pharasma’s domain is
separated into eight courts, each corresponding to one of the
other planes of the Outer Sphere and collecting the souls due
to that plane. Not every soul goes unchallenged, and proxies
of gods and planes argue and debate over souls, with final
arbitration conducted by Pharasma herself.
While Pharasma rules absolutely within the Boneyard,

she is not the only divinity there. The demigod psychopomp
ushers dwell within the plane in service to her, and the deity
Achaekek dwells below at the spire’s root. Looming high above
as a skull-faced moon waits Groetus, the god of the end times,
his orbit slowly decaying in minuscule iterations supposedly
counting down to the last days of the cosmos.
Pharasma’s courts and the surrounding Graveyard of Souls are
not the only features atop the spire. Beyond the graveyard, the
Spirelands manifest environments much like those of the varied
Material Plane worlds, filled with the souls of neutral petitioners
who have nowhere else to go as they are unclaimed by any gods

Verdant, wild, and unrestrained by law, where passion and
creation are fostered and rewarded, the plane of Elysium is a
place of wild, idealized natural beauty. The so-called Promised
Land and its inhabitants represent a wide variety of freely given
benevolence, often willing to directly aid visitors but more often
serving as inspirations and muses to foster positive change and
self-realized success. Elysium’s petitioners, known as the chosen,
appear as idealized versions of their mortal selves, each pursuing
their own self-determined actions and finding their own unique
paths to join the ranks of the plane’s celestials.
Azatas—the plane’s primary denizens—organize into fleeting,
competitive courts, each rewarding heroism and creativity above
all else. Elysium hosts a number of resident deities, including
Calistria and the elven pantheon, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Gorum,
and various empyreal lords. Visitors from across the planes are
drawn to Elysium’s Wandering City of Emerald Song, a mobile,

as the petitioners grow more and more attuned to the plane.
Likewise, progress from one layer to the next is often impossible
without permission from the archons or spiritual alignment with
Heaven itself. Most visitors arrive at the city of Heaven’s Shore, a
place open to both traders and to pilgrims of good intent. Access
beyond its heavily guarded walls is difficult, to say nothing of
scaling the mountain. At its pinnacle is the Garden, Heaven’s
ultimate layer. Unattended and empty, the Garden is a beautiful,
transcendent mystery even to its resident deities, and the source
of the plane’s call of self-perfection to its petitioners.

Native Inhabitants devils, hellhounds, petitioners (the damned)
Hell is the realm of devils, the multiversal seat of tyranny and
malignant law, and the divine domain of Asmodeus, the Prince
of Darkness. Here every act is authorized, calculated, recorded,
and set like perfectly ordered clockwork within a vast machine
driven on methodical suffering and greased with pain and
purification. The nine inverted layers of Hell violently oppose the
surrounding fabric of the Maelstrom, each layer shaped to reflect
the nature of its ruling archdevil. Avernus’s volcanic wastes,
ruled by Barbatos, are the marshaling place of Hell’s armies,
and where newly damned souls are shackled and shuffled off
to their assigned torment. Dispater’s layer of Dis is a great iron
city: brutal, beautiful, and terrible. The layer of Erebus comprises
both the sewers of Dis and the vaults and treasuries of Hell,
ruled by Mammon, a great genius loci embodied by the very
wealth locked within Hell’s coffers. Ruled by Belial, the layer of
Phlegethon hosts Hell’s forges, while Geryon’s watery realm of
Stygia houses Hell’s libraries. Moloch’s smoldering, ash-draped
forest realm of Malebolge is the training site of the infernal
armies, and Baalzebul’s frozen layer of Cocytus torments the
imprisoned, starving damned. Mephistopheles rules the layer of
Caina, a realm of cages and torture suspended above a pit of
hungry darkness, while at the very bottom of Hell’s infinite pit,
Asmodeus rules unquestioned from his throne in Nessus.

Native Inhabitants proteans, petitioners (the shapeless)
The Maelstrom, infinite and ancient, spawned the other Outer
Planes in cosmological prehistory and surrounds them like a
vast metaphorical—and at times literal—ocean of raw, chaotic
quintessence. Where the Maelstrom borders these other
planes, its structure takes on their characteristics, albeit in
an unpredictable, chaotic fashion. Beyond these so-called
Borderlands, however, the Maelstrom reverts to its true nature,
the Cerulean Void: a trackless, liquid infinity devoid of stability
and permanence where serpentine proteans create and destroy
with profound frivolity. The proteans are paradoxically organized
into discrete choruses, each with its own philosophy and goals
in service to the Maelstrom. Swirling with oddities and wild
magic, bereft of laws and structure, the Maelstrom also serves
as a conduit between the other Outer Planes utilized by armies
of extraplanar beings, hordes of demons spilling forth from the
Abyss, and the innumerable protean choruses seeking to return
the rest of the planes to the true freedom of the chaos from
which they emerged. Sufficiently powerful magic can stabilize
the chaos for a time, allowing for the creation of demiplanes and
stable islands. The massive planar trade city of Galisemni is most
prominent among these, drifting through the chaos.

Native Inhabitants angels, petitioners (the cleansed)
The pastoral paradise of Nirvana is the realm of purest good, a
plane that promises sanctuary to the weary and enlightenment
and transcendence to those who seek it out. Filled with beautiful
wilderness of all types in perfect harmony with its occupants,
Nirvana’s wilds are home to angels and others. The plane’s
petitioners, known as the cleansed, most often take the forms
of glorified, sapient wild animals, though many eventually leave
their carefree existence to aid others, ascending to assist the
benevolent works of angels. Devoted to guiding and assisting
mortals, angels are often charged with delivering important
messages that reflect the will of benevolent deities.
Various divinities make their home amid Nirvana’s wilds,
including a host of empyreal lords and, most prominently,
Sarenrae and Shelyn. While the great cities of High Ninshabur
and Llourith welcome visitors, most mortals visiting Nirvana
witness the plane’s beauty and supernatural feeling of peace
but rarely encounter many of its residents, as the plane itself
protectively hides much of its contents from any but the most
selfless and pure of heart. The plane’s hinterlands hint at hidden
mysteries, including legends that the plane shelters the vanished
heroes of innumerable mortal worlds, peacefully sleeping until
their peoples’ times of greatest need.
DIMENSIONS
Existing in the metaphorical space between the Transitive
Planes and smaller, finite demiplanes, dimensions are a
category unto themselves, defying the neat categorization
of planar scholars and adventurers. Seemingly infinite in

scale, not necessarily spatial in the same way as a plane,
and overlaying every other plane at once—including one
another—dimensions and planes are most significantly
differentiated in how each of them breaks the commonly
held rules of the other. Although some scholars include
other extraplanar realms within the ranks of dimensions,
only two such realms are uniformly agreed upon and
classified as such. The Dreamlands, also known as the
Dimension of Dreams, is readily accessed by mortal
dreamers, while the Dimension of Time is notorious
for the near impossibility of accessing it as well as the
bizarre, often deadly restrictions upon travel to and
within its bounds.

Divinities Tawil at’Umr, Yog-Sothoth
Native Inhabitants hounds of Tindalos, petitioners (the unbound)
Among the most obscure planes of existence, the Dimension
of Time is virtually impossible to access by conventional
methods of planar travel. Instead, travelers much perform
complex and difficult rituals described within the pages of
such monstrously rare tomes as the Necronomicon and the
Book of Serpents, Ash, and Acorns: Shadows of What Was and
Will Be. Compounding the plane’s obscurity, each traveler’s
experience seems to be unique, and most who attempt the
journey never return. Every manner of magic that interacts
with the plane invariably draws the attention of creatures such
as the hounds of Tindalos. The proper flow and continuity of
time seems to self-correct for any attempted meddling, often
with violence.
Those few who have gained entry and returned describe the
plane as a swirling storm of blurred images, the composite of
millions of interwoven timelines around their own, with a single
doorway allowing access to one’s own past. Travelers appear as
transparent images of themselves, but the plane seems averse
to any attempt to alter the past, no matter the means or the
intention. Such attempts often end in the offending individual
erased from existence or trapped within closed time loops to
limit the damage they inflict upon the overall flow of time.
Supposedly, like an eye in a storm, at the dimension’s heart is
the legendary realm of Stethelos and its terrible occupant Tawil
at’Umr. Tales of this realm speak only of a great city, a vast green
meadow, and the rushing sound of an ocean emptying over an
immense and terrible waterfall.
DREAMLANDS
DIMENSION
N
FLOWING
Category dimension
Divinities Elder Mythos pantheon
Native Inhabitants animate dreams, Denizens of Leng, Leng
spiders, petitioners (dreamers)
Created and sustained by the collective dreams of sleeping
mortals, the Dreamlands (also called the Dimension of Dreams)
overlays the Ethereal Plane. When a creature dreams, regardless
of the location of their physical body, they interact directly
with the Dreamlands. Sleeping creatures cast themselves
into the plane in idealized avatars known as lucid bodies, and
their dreamscapes are immune to outside entry by standard
magic such as plane shift, requiring obscure, more specialized
spells to access. The dreamers of each mortal world generate
a cluster of dreamscapes, like drifting bubbles atop a deeper
ocean of permanent dreams formed from the collective mass of
slumbering desires, dreams of especially powerful dreamers, and
the dreams of ancient, obscure entities—including the gods of
the Elder Mythos. While most dreamscapes are safe, travelers
in the deep, permanent Dreamlands face living, animate dreams
and the predation of night hags from the Ethereal Plane, as well
as stranger beings spawned within the core itself.
Some scholars postulate a distinct region within the dimension
for nightmares, much as the more stable inner portions of the
dimension exist separately from the transient, ever-forming and
evaporating mortal dreamscapes at its edges. Others conflate
this nightmare region with the demiplane of Leng, while still
others dismiss this notion but speculate that Leng is somehow
accessible to dreamers who intentionally seek it out.
DEMIPLANES
Demiplanes are much smaller and more limited than
planes or dimensions, and they come into being more
easily. They may arise naturally where the raw chaos
of the Maelstrom churns at the border of the Astral,
crystallize around shed memories of dead mortals on
their way to judgment, or coalesce within the mists of
the Ethereal set into motion by the forces of the Positive
and Negative Energy Planes. They can also be crafted by
will and powerful magic to suit their designers’ whims.
Almost innumerable, each is distinctly finite, with their
own nature and rules set at their creation.
Desna’s demiplanar realm of Cynosure exists as
Golarion’s literal north star, silently visible in the night skies,
hosting her servitors and petitioners in her divine realm at
its heart. Other demiplanes are crafted by mortals, such as
the Refuge of Nex, created by the titular archmage seeking
respite and solitude, and the Hao‑Jin Tapestry, a demiplane
stocked with its creator’s collection and accessed through a
literal tapestry artifact she fashioned as its entrance.
Created not by gods or mortals, the Akashic Record is
a demiplane thought to exist deep within the Astral as a
repository of the collective knowledge and memories of the
cosmos, secure and unchanging, but so difficult to access
that most doubt its very existence. Other demiplanes serve
darker purposes and are perhaps best left forgotten, though
their mysteries often tempt the ignorant, the foolish, and
the desperate. The Prison of the Laughing Fiend serves
to bottle its enigmatic and godlike occupant, Tegresin
the Laughing Fiend, bound by nameless divinities whose
nature and reason changes with each telling of the story,
while the Dead Vault was crafted at Golarion’s core by
the gods themselves to forever bottle Rovagug the Rough
Beast, lest he escape and devour all existence.

CHAPTER 3: SUBSYSTEMS
When your game goes into uncharted territory or you want to emphasize an element of
gameplay that usually gets overlooked or condensed into a single check, you can use a
subsystem. As the name implies, subsystems are extensions of the main rules system that
allow you to explore a particular topic or style of play at your table.
Subsystems are a great way to add depth to aspects of your game that don’t occur in
combat but still have high stakes. This chapter begins with Victory Points, a structure
that underlies much of the chapter, to help you build your own subsystems. Next are
some of the most common subsystems you might need in your game, with advice on
how to use and modify them. This chapter is organized into the following sections.
• Victory Points (page 148) provides you a framework with which to build
your own subsystems, detailing the fundamental structure that Pathfinder
uses for its subsystems.
• Influence (page 151) gives rules for more in-depth social encounters involving
influencing NPCs.
• Research (page 154) shows you how to build an interesting structure for
scenes where PCs research information.
• Chases (page 156) are designed to represent the fast-paced feel of movie
chase scenes.
• Infiltration (page 160) allows you to build infiltrations and heists where
careful planning helps the PCs maintain an edge against their adversaries
and pull off incredible capers.
• Reputation (page 164) breathes life into the world around the PCs, as various
groups of NPCs react favorably or unfavorably to the PCs actions, and PCs’
status with those groups changes.
• Duels (page 166) provides a simple architecture for one-on-one showdowns
between adversaries.
• Leadership (page 168) allows PCs to attract people to a cause, giving them
cohorts and organizations to look after.
• Hexploration (page 170) teaches you how to build exploration maps on
a hexagonal grid to give your PCs the thrill of discovering secrets within
uncharted or unfamiliar territory.
• Vehicles (page 174) allows you to run encounters involving vehicles and capitalize
on their potential to help PCs explore on a larger scale and at a faster pace.
DECIDING TO USE A SUBSYSTEM
When you have an exciting subsystem available, it can be tempting to use it anytime
it can possibly come up (for instance, replacing every social scene with the influence
subsystem). However, subsystems are most effective when used with intention.
Subsystems are best when used for a component of the game that’s meant to be at least
a significant portion of a single session. Think about whether you want a different
style of play than normal before you decide to use a subsystem, since that’s what
subsystems are best suited for. You should avoid using a particular subsystem if many
members of your group don’t like it, or if use of a subsystem during play devolves into
the PCs making a series of rolls that don’t contribute to telling an interesting story.
It’s important to leave enough time and mental energy to make the subsystem
feel special and to bring all the components and elements of the subsystem to life
in the game world. A subsystem stripped of all its life and story depth can become
nothing more than a large number of die rolls, and the last thing you want is to lose
the magic, especially with a subsystem the PCs enjoy. Sometimes, a simple check
is the right way to handle the scene, and that’s okay! The subsystems will be there
when you need them to spice up an adventure or really dive deep into a particular
element or scene.
COMBINING SUBSYSTEMS
Some of the subsystems in
this chapter could interact in
interesting ways when combined.
For instance, the influence
subsystem could be part of how
you build up reputation, or a piece
of the plan in an infiltration. Or
you could have a hexploration
chase with a rival adventuring
group, encountering obstacles
in each hex as you race for the
prize—while using vehicles to
travel faster! Ultimately, it’s up to
you to decide how two combined
subsystems should interact to
tell your group’s particular story,
though a good rule of thumb is
to have a backdrop subsystem
that you’re tracking on a longer
term to which the shorter-term
subsystem contributes.
