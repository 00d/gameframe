INTRODUCTION
The focus of every Pathfinder game is the players—their characters are the stars of the
show and appear in every scene that plays out in game. But what about those scenes?
What stories are being told? What old legends are being discovered, and what new ones
are being forged? Who are the villains, the allies, the traitors, the lovers, the monsters, and
the gods? Who runs the world? When you’re the Game Master, that’s all up to you!
THE GAME MASTER
In a game of Pathfinder, the Game Master (often
abbreviated GM) is the player in charge of the story
and the world the other players are exploring with
their characters. As the GM, you set the stage for the
adventure, show how the rest of the world responds
to the player characters’ actions, and guide the action
along an engaging storyline. It falls to you to describe
the characters’ surroundings, the threats facing them,
and the creatures they interact with. You’re presenting
the challenges the heroes must overcome, whether that’s
a deadly trap of haunted blades in a lost tomb full of
ancient treasures or a vicious troll threatening the
heroes’ home village. It also comes to you to interpret
and adjudicate the rules. Game Mastering involves many
more components than playing a character, but it’s a fun
and tremendously rewarding experience.
Though the word “master” is in the GM’s title, it’s not
a role that requires or even benefits from absolutism.
Pathfinder is a collaborative experience, and while your
role as the Game Master is one of an adjudicator or a
moderator, it doesn’t mean you control everything at the
table—especially not the players and their characters.
Nor does the role require mastery, either of the rules
or the setting. You’ll need to understand the game, but
you don’t need to have every rule memorized. When
everyone shares the goal of having fun and telling a
story together, the details will fall into place.
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The Gamemastery Guide is one of the central rule books
for Pathfinder. It’s not required to play the game, but it
builds upon the basic guidelines provided in the Game
Mastering chapter of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook,
Gamemastery Guide
4

PAGE 6
================================================================================

and you’ll find it helpful to read that chapter before
delving into this book. This book provides more detail
on those topics, as well as many more tools to help you
make your game a fun and memorable experience for
everyone involved.
Throughout most of this book, “you” refers to the
Game Master. In some sections of player-facing material,
however, such as some player-focused variant rules and
the actions for certain subsystems, “you” instead refers
to the player using that material.
Pathfinder as a game is all about customization, and
this book provides you as the Game Master ways to
customize your game just as a player customizes their
character. The toolbox nature of the Gamemastery Guide
makes it easy to take and use whatever components you
need for the game
you’re
running
at any time. As
with any toolbox,
you won’t need to use
everything at once!
CHOOSING
YOUR
TOOLS
The tools of this book
you’ll use most depend
on what kind of Game Master you are, what your players
want, and the story you’re telling together.
No two Game Masters are the same. Perhaps you’re
a veteran Game Master who’s looking for new ways to
customize the game and tailor it to suit your interests
and those of your players. Or perhaps you’re a brand
new GM and looking for guidance to feel comfortable
leading a game of your own. Maybe you’ve been a Game
Master for years, but this is your first time running a
Pathfinder game. No matter where you are as a Game
Master, this book is a valuable tool that can help you
tell the stories you want to tell with your players.
If you’re a newer Game Master, you’ll find a wealth
of information to help you feel confident in running
your games. Chapter 1 in particular can help you better
understand how to run a game in the different modes of
play, how to adjudicate the rules quickly and fairly, and
what to do when special circumstances or problems crop
up at your table. This chapter also contains advice on
using and determining rarity in your game, working with
your players to create a collaborative story, and adapting
your game to meet the needs of the players at your table.
You’ll also find the NPC Gallery in Chapter 5 useful as a
source of stock NPCs to play a role in your game and also
for examples to compare against when using the rules in
Chapter 2 to build your own monsters and NPCs.
If you’re a Game Master running a published
Pathfinder adventure, you’ll find guidance in Chapter 1
specifically for running published adventures, and much
of the advice in that chapter about running a game applies
to published adventures. A number of adventures—
especially scenarios in the Pathfinder Society Organized
Play campaign and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes—
use the subsystems in Chapter 3. The Victory Points
subsystem is the most fundamental of these, but many
adventures also use the other subsystems found here,
such as vehicles, chases, and influence.
If you are looking to create your own Pathfinder
adventures, Chapter 1 provides you design guidance
ranging from the broad strokes of an entire campaign,
to individual adventures, and then to the particular
considerations of any given encounter. Chapter 2 is a
veritable toolbox you can use to build the creatures,
hazards, items, and other elements you want to use in
your adventures. If you plan to set
your adventures in a world of your
own design, the world-building
section of Chapter 2 can guide that
process and help you establish the
details you’ll need to ensure your
setting is a vibrant backdrop for
fantastic adventure. The NPC
Gallery in Chapter 5
can help populate
your story and
world so that
you don’t have
to create every
element from scratch.
If you’re an experienced Game Master, you will find
a wealth of customization options to tailor your games
to the needs of players. The advice in Chapter 1, such as
the guidance to make encounters more dynamic, can help
you fine-tune your GM skills and enrich your game. Using
the tools in Chapter 2, you’ll be able to build precisely the
option you need for any game. Chapter 3 offers a variety
of rules subsystems that provide a framework for specific
endeavors and situations, from chases and duels to social
influence and overland exploration. In Chapter 4, you’ll
find variant rules options that let you tweak specific
elements of the game, from backgrounds to the entire
mathematical underpinning of the game, to suit your
preferences or the needs of a particular setting or story.
REMEMBER THE FIRST RULE
The first rule of Pathfinder is that this game is yours. The
rest of the rules exist for you to use to tell the stories
you want to tell and share exciting adventures with your
friends. There are plenty of rules in this book, but none
of them overrule that first rule. Take the rules that help
you make the game you want, change those that don’t
do quite what you need them to, and leave the ones that
aren’t helping. It’s your game. There’s no right or wrong
way to GM so long as everyone is having fun—and that
includes you!

CHAPTER 1: GAMEMASTERY BASICS
The role of a GM can be complex, challenging, and sometimes difficult, but ultimately
rewarding. Luckily, you’re not on your own! Not only will the other players at your game
table help you tell collaborative stories, but you can use the advice here to make your
games run more smoothly and feel more exciting.
The information presented here provides helpful guidance
on how to be a dynamic and engaging GM, and supplements
the GM advice found in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook.
Some sections either refer back to that chapter or repeat
some of that information for convenience. This chapter
begins with general advice, then covers the following topics.
• Running Encounters (page 10) is the first of three
sections that explains the three modes of play in more
detail. You’ll find help on tracking initiative, improving
the speed of play, running special battles, and more.
• Running Exploration (page 17) gives details on making
exploration activities more interesting, creating an
evocative environment, lost PCs, and more.
• Running Downtime (page 22) covers ways the PCs
can set goals, explains how to make good downtime
events, provides sample downtime tasks, and more.
• Adjudicating Rules (page 28) offers guidance on how
to make effective rules calls and create house rules.
• Resolving Problems (page 30) presents advice on total
party kills, problem players, and power imbalances.
• Narrative Collaboration (page 32) includes tools for
players to control the story more directly.
• Special Circumstances (page 33) discusses organized
play, odd-sized groups, and players with different needs.
• Rarity in Your Game (page 35) details how rarity can
enrich the theme and story of your game.
• Campaign Structure (page 36) clarifies what makes a
good campaign and describes how to determine its
scope and make enemies and treasure more compelling.
• Adventure Design (page 40) includes tools for building
your own adventures.
• Encounter Design (page 46) explains how to build
entertaining encounters and navigate the challenges
that can arise when designing complex encounters.
• Drawing Maps (page 52) describes useful steps for
making maps and commonly used map symbols.
GENERAL ADVICE
This section covers topics related to running the game.
If you want to know how to build specific types of new
content, this information can be found throughout Chapter
2 in sections such as Building Creatures (page 56), Building
Worlds (page 122), and Settlements (page 132).
Both the Core Rulebook and this book explore many
topics, but don’t feel like you have to master them all to be
a good GM! It’s important to remember you’re not perfect,
and the other players won’t expect you to be. Trial and error,
mistakes and triumphs—they’re all part of running any game.
SESSION ZERO
Some groups prefer to have everyone create their characters
in advance and show up ready to play. However, getting
the group together to make characters can be fun, and can
benefit your game down the line. A session for building
characters is commonly called “session zero.” Session
zero is typically shorter than other game sessions, so you
might plan a short introductory scene for after everyone’s
finished building their characters, or just hang out and do
something else after you’ve planned your characters.
Having a session zero lets players share character
details, making it easier for their characters to have links
and relationships with one another before the adventure
starts, and gives players the chance to become invested
in each other’s characters by organically learning what
decisions other players made. These sessions also give
veterans the chance to help less experienced players through
character creation. Lastly, session zero can give you a
better understanding of the characters and help the players
integrate them into the adventure in interesting ways.
PACING GAME SESSIONS
Page 489 of the Core Rulebook explains how to structure,
start, and run a game session. This is all part of pacing your
game. Most sessions should have lulls in the action punctuated
by challenges such as intense encounters, puzzle-based
exploration, and investigation. Presenting players with a
variety of such obstacles can help them feel more engaged at
the table. Information flow matters, too. If the group meets
a large number of NPCs in short order, that can make it
harder for them to remember individuals. It helps to break
things up into smaller scenes and memorable moments.
Knowing when to end a session takes practice. About
20 minutes before a play session is scheduled to conclude,
it can be beneficial to figure out how you’d like to end. It
can be memorable to end with a cliffhanger—a moment so
curious and abrupt it raises questions about what happens
next. Examples include ending play before combat, when
the PCs find vital information, or as they discover treasure.
Doing so can inspire the PCs to discuss the game between
sessions. Note anything that could be satisfying to resolve
over media, such as email. This could include divvying up
treasure, leveling up, or completing downtime tasks.
STAKES AND CONSEQUENCES
A GM should always convey a clear picture of the stakes
and consequences of the PCs’ actions or inaction. What
horrible things will happen if the PCs fail? What can they
