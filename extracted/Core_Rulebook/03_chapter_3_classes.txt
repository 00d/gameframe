Chapter 3: Classes
Just as your character’s ancestry plays a key role in expressing their identity and worldview,
their class indicates the training they have and will improve upon as an adventurer.
Choosing your character’s class is perhaps the most important decision you will make
for them. Groups of players often create characters whose skills and abilities complement
each other mechanically—for example, ensuring your party includes a healer, a combatoriented character, a stealthy character, and someone with command over magic—so you
may wish to discuss options with your group before deciding.
various abilities, equipment, and skills; special abilities
from their class features; and more. Your character’s class
entry also provides the information needed when they
gain levels, so it will be a vital reference throughout the
course of your campaign.
Playing the Class
The first section of each class describes the interests and
tendencies typical of that class, as well as information
on how others view them. This can help inspire you
as you determine your character’s actions and define
their personality, but you aren’t obligated to play your
character as this section describes.
Key Ability
This is the ability score that a member of your class cares
about the most. Many of your most useful and powerful
abilities are tied to this ability in some way.
For instance, this is the ability score you’ll use to
determine the Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your
character’s class features and feats. This is called your
class DC. If your character is a member of a spellcasting
class, this key ability is used to calculate spell DCs and
similar values.
Most classes are associated with one key ability score,
but some allow you to choose from two options. For
instance, if you’re a fighter, you can choose either Strength
or Dexterity as your key ability. A fighter who chooses
Strength will excel in hand-to-hand combat, while those
who choose Dexterity prefer ranged or finesse weapons.
Additionally, when you choose your character’s class,
they gain an ability boost to their key ability score,
increasing that ability score by 2. For more about ability
boosts, see page 20.
Hit Points
This section tells you how many Hit Points your
character gains from their class at each level. To
determine your character’s starting Hit Points, add
together the Hit Points they got when you chose their
ancestry and the amount listed in this entry, which
equals your Constitution modifier plus a fixed number.
Classes that intend for characters to rush into battle
with weapons bared gain a higher number of Hit Points

================================================================================
PAGE 69
================================================================================

each level, while those for characters who cast spells or
engage in trickery gain fewer.
Each time your character gains a level, they increase their
maximum Hit Points by the amount listed in this entry.
For more about calculating your character’s Constitution
modifier and determining their Hit Points, see page 26.
Initial Proficiencies
When you choose your character’s class, they gain a set of
initial proficiencies. Proficiencies measure your character’s
ability to perform tasks, use abilities, and succeed at checks.
Proficiency ranks range from trained to legendary. For
instance, a character who is trained with a longbow can use it
effectively, while a person who is legendary with the weapon
might be able to split an arrow from 100 paces away!
Each class entry specifies your character’s initial
proficiency rank in Perception, saving throws, attacks,
defenses, and either spells or class DC. You gain the trained
proficiency rank in at least one skill that is important to
your class, and you can choose other skills to gain trained
proficiency in—the exact number depends on your class. If
your class would make you trained in a skill you’re already
trained in (typically due to your background), you can select
another skill to become trained in.
A proficiency rank can unlock various feats and class
features, and it also helps determine the modifier for any
check you roll or DC you calculate related to that statistic.
If your character is trained in Perception, a saving throw,
or another statistic, they gain a proficiency bonus equal
to their level + 2, while if they have expert proficiency,
they gain a proficiency bonus equal to their level + 4. For
more about proficiency ranks, see page 13.
Spellcasting classes grant a proficiency rank for spell
attacks and DCs, which are further detailed in each
class’s entry.
If something isn’t listed in your character’s class entry,
their proficiency rank in that statistic is untrained unless
they gain training from another source. If your character
is untrained in something, you add a proficiency bonus of
+0 when attempting a check or calculating a DC related
to that statistic.
Advancement Table
This table summarizes the feats, skill increases, ability boosts,
and other benefits your character gains as they advance in
level. The first column of the class table indicates a level, and
the second column lists each feature your character receives
when they reach that level. The 1st-level entry includes a
reminder to select your ancestry and background.
Class Features
This section presents all the abilities the class grants
your character. An ability gained at a higher level lists
the required level next to the ability’s name. All classes
include the class features detailed below, and each class
also gets special class features specific to it. Many class
features require you to choose between options. Unless
the specific ability states otherwise, such decisions can’t be
changed without retraining (as explained on page 481).
Class Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains class feats—special feats that only members of that
class can access. Class feats are granted beginning at 1st
or 2nd level, depending on the class. Specific class feats
are detailed at the end of each class entry.
Skill Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains feats with the skill trait, called skill feats. Skill
feats can be found in Chapter 5: Feats, beginning on
page 254. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, most
classes gain a skill feat, though rogues gain them earlier
and more often. Your character must be trained in the
corresponding skill to take a skill feat.
General Feats
This section specifies the levels at which your character
gains general feats. Most classes grant a general feat at
3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. At each of these
levels, you can select any general feat (including skill
feats) as long as your character qualifies for it. More
information can be found in Chapter 5: Feats (page 254).
Skill Increases
This section specifies the levels at which your character
can increase their proficiency rank in a skill. At 3rd level
and every 2 levels thereafter, most classes grant a skill
increase, though rogues gain them earlier and more often.
Your character can use a skill increase to either become
trained in one skill in which they’re untrained or become
an expert in one skill in which they’re already trained.
If your character is at least 7th level, they can use a skill
increase to become a master of a skill in which they’re
already an expert. If they’re at least 15th level, they can
use an increase to become legendary in a skill of which
they’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, your character
boosts four different ability scores. Your character can
use these ability boosts to increase their ability scores
above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if
it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.
For more about ability boosts and applying them during
character creation, see page 20.
Ancestry Feats
This section serves as a reminder of the ancestry feats
your character gains at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
Ancestry feats are detailed in each ancestry entry in
Chapter 2, which begins on page 32.

Alchemist
Page 70
The alchemist uses their skill at crafting
to create alchemical items—such as
bombs, elixirs, and poisons—that they
use to defeat foes and aid allies. Smart
and resourceful, an alchemist often has
just the right tool for the job and esoteric
knowledge to help their friends get out of a jam.
Barbarian
Page 82
The barbarian is a fearsome embodiment
of rage, focusing the deadly power
of their anger against anyone who
stands in their way. A barbarian is
quick to enter battle and, once their fury
has been unleashed, is immensely strong,
often unpredictable, and nearly unstoppable.
Bard
Page 94
An artist and a scholar, the bard uses
performance and esoteric learning to
bolster their companions and foil their
enemies. Sometimes sneaky and quite
often charming, the bard adventures
with pizzazz and talent backed up by
an impressive repertoire of occult magic.
Champion
Page 104
A defender of good who straps on
armor and wields a righteous weapon,
the champion protects the innocent
and vanquishes evil. Steadfast in their
beliefs, and devoted to both a deity and
an aspect of good, they follow a strict code
as they fight to make the world a better place.
Cleric
Page 116
The cleric is dedicated to the
worship of a single deity and draws
divine magic from this devotion.
Clerics
can
be
vastly
different
depending on who they worship, and
whether they’re cloistered clerics who
pursue one of their deity’s domains or war
priests who serve as the sword arm of their god.
Druid
Page 128
The druid walks the wild, primordial
places of the world without fear,
harnessing the primal magic of nature
and controlling it with calm purpose.
A devotee of the wilderness, the druid
finds nourishment in its power, allies
among its creatures, and strength in its fury.
Fighter
Page 140
With calculated daring and fearless
determination, the fighter tracks down
and confronts their enemies while
defending allies from harm. A master
of the battlefield, the fighter is quick to
exploit opportunities and strike any who
stumble within reach of their sword or bow.
Monk
Page 154
The monk seeks perfection in all things,
and that includes transforming their
body into the perfect weapon. They
can be walking with calm purpose
and
contemplating
the
subtleties
of existence in one minute and then
transform into a blur of deadly blows in the next.
Ranger
Page 166
Resourceful and cunning, the ranger
is a hunter, tracker, and warrior who
preserves the natural world and
protects civilization from its ravages.
Whether they use a bow, crossbow,
a pair of weapons, or snares, the ranger
is a fearsome enemy and great ally in the wild.
Rogue
Page 178
Cunning and quick, the rogue brings
skill and expertise few of their comrades
can match. In battle, they excel at
sneak attacks and ambushes. Their
racket gives them the tools they need
to get the job done, and their wide array of
skill choices lets them specialize as they see fit.
Sorcerer
Page 190
The intense magic the sorcerer
commands
comes
from
neither
study nor worship—it comes from
their blood. Their magical abilities
depend on whether they have the
blood of dragons, angels, fey, aberrant
creatures, or some other being flowing
through their veins and powering their spells.
Wizard
Page 202
The wizard is the arcane master of
spellcasting, plucking incredible power
from reality through complicated
spell formulas. They stride with
confidence, without a need for armor
or weapons, enacting their will upon the
world and bringing woe upon their enemies.

Alchemist
During combat encounters...
You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party
with potent elixirs. At higher levels, your mutagens warp your body into a resilient
and powerful weapon.
During social encounters...
You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets,
such as poisons and diseases.
While exploring...
You keep an eye out for trouble with your bombs at the ready, while giving advice
on all things alchemical and mysterious.
In downtime...
You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering
your alchemical knowledge.
You Might...
•	 Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a
single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause.
•	 Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you’ve made,
and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
•	 Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools.
Others Probably...
•	 Think you’re some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don’t understand
that you don’t cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only
heighten this misconception.
•	 Don’t understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
•	 Assume that if you haven’t caused a catastrophe with your experimentations,
you inevitably will.
There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker,
and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You’re fascinated by
uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you’re constantly
experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality.
You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your
unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body
to their limits.

them becomes more and more powerful, you advance
in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don’t
understand your strange science.
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (page 258),
even if you don’t meet that feat’s prerequisites, and you
gain the four common 1st-level alchemical formulas
granted by that feat. The catalog of alchemical items
begins on page 543. You can use this feat to create
alchemical items as long as you have the items’ formulas
in your formula book.
Infused Reagents
You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence,
allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each
day during your daily preparations, you gain a number
of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your
Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either
advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy, described below.
Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.
As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your
infused reagents from the previous day’s preparations are
instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your
previous day’s infused items immediately end. While infused
reagents are physical objects, they can’t be duplicated,
preserved, or created in any way other than your daily
preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion
and are useless for advanced alchemy or Quick Alchemy.
Advanced Alchemy
During your daily preparations, after producing new
infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused
reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don’t
need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you
ignore both the number of days typically required to
create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements.
Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For
each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an
alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower
that’s in your formula book, and make a batch of two of
that item. These items have the infused trait and remain
potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations,
whichever comes first.
Quick Alchemy
If you need a specific alchemical item on the fly, you can
use your infused reagents to quickly create it with the
Quick Alchemy action.
QUICK ALCHEMY [o[fre[o[one-action]
ALCHEMIST
MANIPULATE
Cost 1 batch of infused reagents
Requirements You have alchemist’s tools (page 287), the formula

You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at
a moment’s notice. You create a single alchemical item of
your advanced alchemy level or lower that’s in your formula

Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Alchemy
You understand the complex interactions of natural
and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical
items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal
reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special
infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items
quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more
and more alchemical items for free, and since each of

book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in
alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check.
This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until
the start of your next turn.
Formula Book
An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas
for every item they can create. You start with a standard
formula book worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page
290) for free. The formula book contains the formulas for
two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in
addition to those you gained from Alchemical Crafting
and your research field. The catalog of alchemical items
begins on page 543.
Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas
for two common alchemical items to your formula
book. These new formulas can be for any level of item
you can create. You learn these formulas automatically,
but it’s also possible to find or buy additional formulas
in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them
with the Inventor feat (page 262).
Research Field
Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe
have led you to focus on a particular field of research.
You might have a degree from an scientific institute,
correspond with other researchers in your field, or work
as a genius loner. Choose a field of research. The research
fields presented in this book are as follows.
Bomber
You specialize in explosions and other violent
alchemical reactions. You start with the formulas
for two 1st-level alchemical bombs in your
formula book, in addition to your other formulas.
When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash
trait, you can deal splash damage to only your
primary target instead of the usual splash area.
Chirurgeon
You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.
You start with the formulas for two of the
following in your formula book, in addition
to your other formulas: lesser antidote, lesser
antiplague, or lesser elixir of life.
As long as your proficiency rank in Medicine is trained
or better, you can attempt a Crafting check instead of
a Medicine check for any of Medicine’s untrained and
trained uses.
Mutagenist
You focus on bizarre mutagenic transformations
that sacrifice one aspect of a creature’s physical
or psychological being in order to strengthen another.
You start with the formulas for two 1st-level mutagens
in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.
You can gain the benefit of any mutagen, even if
it wasn’t specifically brewed for you. Whenever your
proficiency rank for simple weapons increases, your
proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to the
same rank unless it’s already better.
Alchemist Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter,
you gain an alchemist class feat. Alchemist class feats are
described beginning on page 76.
Skill Feats 
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain
a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter,
you gain a general feat. General feats are
listed in Chapter 5.

Alertness 
9th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Double Brew 
9th
You know your formulas so well that you can concoct
two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy
action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents
to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches
of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items
as described in that action. These items do not have to
be the same.
Juggernaut 
11th
Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards
and resistant to pathogens and ailments. Your proficiency
rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you
roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical
success instead.
Perpetual Potency 
11th
Your perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use
Quick Alchemy to create more powerful items with no
cost. The items you can select depend on your research
field and must be in your formula book.
Bomber: The moderate versions of the bombs you
chose for perpetual infusions.
Chirurgeon: Moderate antidote and antiplague.
Mutagenist: The moderate versions of the mutagens you
chose for perpetual infusions.
Greater Field Discovery 
13th
You learn an incredible discovery that advances your
understanding of your field.
Bomber: You can increase the splash on your bombs
to damage creatures within 10 feet, or 15 feet if you have
Expanded Splash.
Chirurgeon: When you use Quick Alchemy to create
any type of elixir of life, the creature drinking the
elixir gains the maximum Hit Points possible for that
elixir, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit
Points regained.
Mutagenist: If you imbibe another mutagen while
you are under the effects of a mutagen that you created,
you can gain the benefits and the drawbacks of both
mutagens at once, despite the fact that they both have
the polymorph trait and would not normally function
together. If you come under the effects of any further
mutagens while benefiting from two mutagens, you lose
the benefit of one of the former mutagens of your choice,
while retaining the drawbacks of all the mutagens. If
you are under the effects of two mutagens and you come
under the effect of a non-mutagen polymorph effect,
you lose the benefits of the mutagens while retaining the
drawbacks of both.
Light Armor Expertise 
13th
You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or
no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and
unarmored defense increase to expert.
Weapon Specialization 
13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
to 4 if you’re legendary.
Alchemical Alacrity 
15th
Your comfort in concocting items is such that you can
create three at a time. When using the Quick Alchemy
action, you can spend up to three batches of infused
reagents to make up to three alchemical items as
described in that action. These items do not have to be
the same.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many alchemist
abilities.
Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you
to spend actions to add special substances to bombs
or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single
alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils
the item. You can typically use actions with the additive
trait only when you’re creating an infused alchemical
item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy
action. The additive trait is always followed by a level,
such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level
of the alchemical item you’re modifying; the result is the
new level of the mixture. The mixture’s item level must be
no higher than your advanced alchemy level.
Infused: You created an alchemical item with the
infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a
limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent
effects from your infused alchemical items, with the
exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end
when you make your daily preparations again.

Your alchemical concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your
alchemist class DC increases to master.
Perpetual Perfection 
17th
You have perfected your perpetual infusions, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to
create even more powerful items at no cost. The items you can select depend on your
research field and must be in your formula book.
Bomber: The greater versions of the bombs you chose for perpetual infusions.
Chirurgeon: Greater antidote and antiplague.
Mutagenist: The greater versions of the mutagens you chose for perpetual infusions.
Light Armor Mastery 
19th
Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your
proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.
Alchemist Feats
At every level that you gain an alchemist feat, you can select one of the following
feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ALCHEMICAL FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials,
reagents, and a bit of your own blood. This alchemical familiar appears to be a small
creature of flesh and blood, though it might have some unusual or distinguishing aspects
depending on your creative process. Like other familiars, your alchemical familiar assists
you in your laboratory and on adventures. The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to
determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers (see Familiars on page 217 for
more information).
ALCHEMICAL SAVANT
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to Identify Alchemy
on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate
and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes. If you have the formula for the item
you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you
roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
FAR LOBBER
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You’ve learned how to throw a longer distance. When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has
a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.
QUICK BOMBER [one-action]
FEAT 1
ALCHEMIST
You keep your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches from which you draw without thinking. You
Interact to draw a bomb, then Strike with it.

================================================================================

2ND LEVEL
POISON RESISTANCE
FEAT 2
ALCHEMIST
Repeated exposure to toxic reagents has fortified your body
against poisons of all kinds. You gain poison resistance equal
to half your level, and you gain a +1 status bonus to saving
throws against poisons.
REVIVIFYING MUTAGEN
FEAT 2
ALCHEMIST
While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that
mutagen’s power to heal yourself. This uses a single action,
which has the concentrate and manipulate traits. Once the
action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2
item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen’s
duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of
Persistent Mutagen.
SMOKE BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 2
ADDITIVE 1
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb with
a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.
You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in
addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates
a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which
corner of the target’s space (or the space in which the bomb
lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have
the concealed condition, and all other creatures are concealed
to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a
strong wind.
4TH LEVEL
CALCULATED SPLASH
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb’s
splash. When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash
trait, you can cause the bomb to deal splash damage equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the
normal amount.
EFFICIENT ALCHEMY
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
Thanks to the time you’ve spent studying and experimenting,
you know how to scale your formulas into larger batches
that don’t require any additional attention. When spending
downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice
as many alchemical items in a single batch without spending
additional preparatory time. For instance, if you are creating
elixirs of life, you can craft up to eight elixirs in a single batch
using downtime, rather than four. This does not reduce the
amount of alchemical reagents required or other ingredients
needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of
progress for days past the base downtime spent. This also
does not change the number of items you can create in a batch
using advanced alchemy.

================================================================================

SAMPLE ALCHEMIST
ENDURING ALCHEMY
FEAT 4
ALCHEMIST
You’ve learned how to make your personal energy last just
a little bit longer when quickly brewing ad hoc concoctions.
When using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or
elixir, that tool or elixir remains potent until the end of your
next turn, instead of losing its potency at the start of your
next turn.
6TH LEVEL
COMBINE ELIXIRS [free-action]
FEAT 6
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item
that has the elixir trait and is at least 2 levels lower than
your advanced alchemy level.
You’ve discovered how to mix two elixirs into a single hybrid
concoction. You can spend 2 additional batches of infused
reagents to add a second elixir to the one you’re crafting.
The second elixir must also be at least 2 levels lower than
your advanced alchemy level, and the combination elixir is
an alchemical item two levels higher than the higher of the
two elixirs’ levels. When this combination elixir is consumed,
both the constituent elixirs take effect. For example, you can
combine two elixirs of life to create a combined elixir that
heals twice the normal amount, or you can combine a lesser
darkvision elixir with a lesser eagle-eye elixir to both gain
darkvision and find secret doors.
DEBILITATING BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 6
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical
bomb that is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced
alchemy level.
Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies.
You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the
following: dazzled, deafened, flat-footed, or a –5-foot status
penalty to Speeds. If the attack with that bomb hits, the
target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer
that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class
DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws
the bomb).
DIRECTIONAL BOMBS
FEAT 6
ALCHEMIST
You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to
angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When
throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of
splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the
target’s space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone
directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid
allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes
up more than a single square, the target’s square closest to
you is the first affected square of the cone.
BOMBER
You can mix an explosive out of just about anything!
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Intelligence and Dexterity. Constitution helps
you survive explosions gone wrong, and Wisdom
prevents you from bombing the wrong target.

================================================================================

8TH LEVEL
FERAL MUTAGEN
FEAT 8
ALCHEMIST
Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you,
granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a
ferocious appearance. Whenever you’re affected by a bestial
mutagen you created, you gain the mutagen’s item bonus to
your Intimidation checks. In addition, your claws and jaws
are increasingly vicious, and they gain the deadly d10 trait.
Finally, you can increase the mutagen’s penalty to AC from –1
to –2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your
claws and jaws by one step.
POWERFUL ALCHEMY
FEAT 8
ALCHEMIST
Alchemical items you create on the fly are particularly potent.
When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical
item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your
class DC.
STICKY BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 8
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You use Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical bomb,
and that bomb’s level is at least 2 levels lower than your
advanced alchemy level.
You mix in an additive to make your bomb’s contents adhere
to the target and continue to deal damage. A creature that
takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes
persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the
bomb’s splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent
damage, combine the two amounts.
10TH LEVEL
ELASTIC MUTAGEN
FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
You can cause your body to twist and flow like the quicksilver
within your mutagens. Whenever you are under the effects
of a quicksilver mutagen you created, you can stretch your
legs and Step up to 10 feet, and you can squish and compress
your body, allowing you to make it through tight spaces
as if you were one size smaller, in addition to any effect
from Squeezing.
EXPANDED SPLASH
FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Calculated Splash
The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your
bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful
explosions. When you throw an alchemical bomb you
created and that bomb has the splash trait, you can add your
Intelligence modifier to the bomb’s usual splash damage, and
it deals splash damage to every creature within 10 feet of
the target.
GREATER DEBILITATING BOMB
FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Debilitating Bomb
You have learned enhanced techniques and alchemical
secrets that allow you to expand the range of effects you
can impose with your bombs. When you use Debilitating
Bomb, add the following to the list you can choose from:
clumsy 1, enfeebled 1, stupefied 1, or –10-foot status penalty
to Speeds.
MERCIFUL ELIXIR [free-action]
FEAT 10
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You craft an elixir of life using Quick Alchemy, and
that elixir is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced
alchemy level.
You mix a special additive into your elixir that calms the
drinker’s body and mind. The elixir of life attempts to
counteract one fear effect or one effect imposing the paralyzed
condition on the drinker.
POTENT POISONER
FEAT 10
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Powerful Alchemy
By concentrating your poisons’ toxic components, you
make them harder for victims to resist. When you craft an
alchemical item with the poison trait by any means, the DC is
increased by up to 4, to a maximum of your class DC.
12TH LEVEL
EXTEND ELIXIR
FEAT 12
ALCHEMIST
Integrating your own personal energy into the elixirs you
create causes them to affect you for longer. When you
consume one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and
infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or longer, that elixir’s
duration is doubled.
INVINCIBLE MUTAGEN
FEAT 12
ALCHEMIST
The fortifying additives you brew into your mutagens make
your juggernaut form impervious. Whenever you’re affected
by a juggernaut mutagen you created, you gain resistance
to all physical damage equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 0).
UNCANNY BOMBS
FEAT 12
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Far Lobber
You lob bombs unerringly, despite obstructions or distance.
When you throw an alchemical item with the bomb trait,
its range increment increases to 60 feet, you reduce any
circumstance bonus to the target’s AC from cover by 1, and
you automatically succeed at the flat check when targeting a
concealed creature.

SAMPLE ALCHEMIST
14TH LEVEL
GLIB MUTAGEN
FEAT 14
ALCHEMIST
Your silvertongue mutagen transcends languages and
plausibility. When affected by a silvertongue mutagen
you have created, you ignore circumstance penalties to
Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Performance
checks. In addition, your words transcend linguistic barriers;
everyone listening to you speak hears your words as if you
were speaking in their own language (though you do not
actually speak that language, nor does this ability allow you
to understand any additional languages).
GREATER MERCIFUL ELIXIR
FEAT 14
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Merciful Elixir
Your additives contain panaceas that can remedy a plethora
of maladies. When you use Merciful Elixir, your elixir
can instead attempt to counteract the blinded, deafened,
sickened, or slowed condition.
TRUE DEBILITATING BOMB
FEAT 14
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Greater Debilitating Bomb
Ever inventive, you have discovered increasingly devastating
ways for your bombs to impede and hamper your foes. When
you use Debilitating Bomb, add the following to the list of
effects you can choose from: enfeebled  2, stupefied 2, or
a –15-foot status penalty to Speeds. If you instead apply
one of the effects listed in Debilitating Bomb, the target
avoids the effect only if the result of its saving throw is a
critical success.
16TH LEVEL
ETERNAL ELIXIR
FEAT 16
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Extend Elixir
Your body readily accepts and retains minor changes. When
you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and
infused traits and a duration of 1 minute or more, you can
make the elixir’s duration indefinite. You can do so only if the
elixir’s level is half your level or lower. If you later consume
a different elixir and make it indefinite, the effect of the
previous indefinite elixir ends.
EXPLOITIVE BOMB [free-action]
FEAT 16
ADDITIVE 2
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once per round
Trigger You craft an alchemical bomb using Quick Alchemy
that’s at least 2 levels lower than your advanced
alchemy level.
You mix a substance into the bomb to foil resistances. The
bomb reduces any resistance the enemy has to its damage
type by an amount equal to your level, but only for that attack.
MUTAGENIST
You transform yourself and others with mutagens.
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Intelligence and Strength. Constitution helps
you survive transformations and combat, and Wisdom

GENIUS MUTAGEN
FEAT 16
ALCHEMIST
Specialized tweaks to your formula that supplements your
genius considerably broaden the benefits you gain from
cognitive mutagens. When you’re affected by a cognitive
mutagen you created, you also gain the mutagen’s item bonus
to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Medicine, Nature,
Performance, Religion, and Survival checks. In addition, you
can communicate telepathically with creatures within 60 feet
with whom you share a language. The communication is two-
way once you establish it, so a creature you contact can also
communicate with you.
PERSISTENT MUTAGEN
FEAT 16
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Extend Elixir
You’ve trained your physical form to remain stable within the
a given altered state. Once per day, when you consume an
alchemical item with the infused and mutagen traits that you
have crafted, you can retain its effects until the next time you
make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration.
18TH LEVEL
IMPROBABLE ELIXIRS
FEAT 18
ALCHEMIST
Your mastery of alchemical secrets enables you to replicate
effects most believe can be achieved only via magic. Select
a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum 1) of 9th level or lower. You gain formulas to
Craft these potions as alchemical items with the elixir
trait. When Crafting these alchemical elixirs, you can
substitute alchemical reagents for an equal value of magical
components, and you can use alchemist’s tools instead of
any other required tool kits. Other than that, the formula
does not change. Once you’ve chosen the potion formulas,
they can’t be changed.
MINDBLANK MUTAGEN
FEAT 18
ALCHEMIST
With a minor adjustment of ratios in the formula for your
serene mutagen, you gain mental protections. When you’re
affected by a serene mutagen you created, detection,
revelation, and scrying effects of 9th level or lower detect
nothing from you or your possessions and auras. For instance,
detect magic would still detect other magic in the area, but not
any magic on you.
MIRACLE WORKER
FEAT 18
ALCHEMIST
Frequency once every 10 minutes
Your alchemical mastery can resuscitate the recently slain.
You can administer a true elixir of life to a creature who has
been dead for no more than 2 rounds. When you do, that
creature is immediately returned to life with 1 Hit Point and
becomes wounded 1.
PERFECT DEBILITATION
FEAT 18
ALCHEMIST
You have perfected the formulas for bombs that impede your
enemies. When you use Debilitating Bomb, your target avoids
the condition the bomb imposes only if it critically succeeds
at its saving throw.
20TH LEVEL
CRAFT PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
FEAT 20
ALCHEMIST
Your research has paid off, culminating in the legendary
philosopher’s stone. You learn the formula for the philosopher’s
stone (page 554) and can add it to your formula book.
MEGA BOMB [one-action]
FEAT 20
ADDITIVE 3
ALCHEMIST
Prerequisites Expanded Splash
Requirements You are holding an infused alchemical bomb
you crafted, with a level at least 3 lower than your advanced
alchemy level.
You add an incredibly powerful additive to a held bomb to
create a mega bomb, greatly increasing its area and power.
You use an Interact action to throw the mega bomb, rather
than Strike, and you don’t make an attack roll. The mega
bomb affects creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst, centered
within 60 feet of you. The bomb deals damage as if each
creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save.
On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that
affect a primary target (such as flat-footed from bottled
lightning). While all targets in the area take splash damage
as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that
area. If your next action after creating a mega bomb isn’t an
Interact action to throw it, the mega bomb denatures and
loses all effects.
PERFECT MUTAGEN
FEAT 20
ALCHEMIST
You have enhanced the formulas for your mutagens, aligning
them perfectly to your physiology. When under the effect of a
mutagen you crafted, you do not suffer its drawback.
SAMPLE FORMULA BOOK
You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items
for your formula book, but the list below contains a good
selection of starter formulas. A beginner’s book with these
formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become
popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away
from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has
drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling
alchemists away from more innovative experiments.
Alchemical Item Formulas: Lesser acid flask, lesser
alchemist’s fire, lesser antidote, lesser antiplague, lesser
cheetah’s elixir, lesser elixir of life, lesser tanglefoot
bag, lesser smokestick.

Core Rulebook

PAGE 84
================================================================================

During combat encounters...
You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through.
Offense is your best defense—you’ll need to drop foes before they can exploit your
relatively low defenses.
During social encounters...
You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can’t
get the job done.
While exploring...
You look out for danger, ready to rush headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb
the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the
risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something
needs breaking, you’re up to the task!
In downtime...
You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty
deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right.
You Might...
•	 Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration.
•	 Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium.
•	 Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness—and punch anyone who says this
conflicts with your distaste for patience and tedium.
Others Probably...
•	 Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in
a fight.
•	 See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society.
•	 Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the
fight is done.
Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful
weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without
needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious
instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many
barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to
hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a barbarian. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at
1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry
and background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted in at the start of this class.
Rage
You gain the Rage action, which lets you fly into a frenzy.
RAGE [one-action]
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
MENTAL
Requirements You aren’t fatigued or raging.
You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a
number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus
your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute,
until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall
unconscious, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop
raging. While you are raging:
•	 You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and
unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if
your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
•	 You take a –1 penalty to AC.
•	 You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless
they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.
After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary
Hit Points from Rage, and you can’t Rage again for 1 minute.
Instinct
Your rage wells up from a dominant instinct—one you
learned from a tradition or that comes naturally to you. Your
instinct gives you an ability, requires you to avoid certain
behaviors, grants you increased damage and resistances
at higher levels, and allows you to select feats tied to your
instinct. For more information, see Instincts on page 86.
Barbarian Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter,
you gain a barbarian class feat. Barbarian class feats are
described beginning on page 88.
Skill Feats 
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Deny Advantage 
3rd
Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren’t flat-
footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your
level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using
surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
General Feats 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts 
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if
it starts below 18.

Greater Weapon Specialization 
15th
The weapons you’ve mastered become truly fearsome in
your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization
increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in
which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if
you’re legendary. You gain a greater benefit from your
instinct’s specialization ability.
Indomitable Will 

17th
Your instinct heightens each of your senses further. Your
proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.
Quick Rage 
17th
You recover from your Rage quickly, and are soon ready
to begin anew. After you spend a full turn without raging,
you can Rage again without needing to wait 1 minute.
Armor of Fury 
19th
Your training and rage deepen your connection to your
armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium
armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.
Devastator 
19th
Your Strikes are so devastating that you hardly care about
resistance, and your barbarian abilities are unparalleled.
Your proficiency rank for your barbarian class DC
increases to master. Your melee Strikes ignore 10 points
of a creature’s resistance to their physical damage.
Instincts
You channel your rage through an instinct. You decide
what your instinct means to you. It could be a creature or
symbol beloved by your clan, or a purely internal source
or filter of your rage, such as a belief, curse, heritage,
or state of mind. Each instinct grants an instinct ability,
plus more abilities you can gain via instinct feats. It also
determines what damage you resist with raging resistance
and, at higher levels, increases the additional damage you
deal when you Rage.
Each instinct lists acts that are anathema to it.
Whenever you perform such acts, you lose the instinct’s
abilities and any instinct feats until you spend 1 day of
downtime re-centering yourself, though you keep all of
your other barbarian abilities.
Animal Instinct
The fury of a wild predator fills you when you Rage,
granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures that
revere vicious animals (such as apes or bears) give rise
to barbarians with this instinct. You might also be at
war with an uncontrollable, animalistic side of your
personality, or you might be a descendant of a werewolf
or another werecreature. Select an animal from Table 3–3:
Animal Instincts that best matches your chosen animal.

Anathema
Flagrantly disrespecting an animal of your chosen kind is
anathema to your instinct, as is using weapons while raging.
Bestial Rage (Instinct Ability)
When you Rage, you gain your chosen animal’s unarmed
attack (or attacks). The specific attack gained, the damage it
deals, and its traits are listed on Table 3–3: Animal Instincts.
These attacks are in the brawling group. Your Rage action
gains the morph, primal, and transmutation traits.
Specialization Ability
Increase the damage die size for the unarmed attacks
granted by your chosen animal by one step, and increase the
additional damage from Rage from 2 to 5 for your chosen
animal’s unarmed attacks. The frog’s tongue attack and
deer’s antler attack gain reach 10 feet. If you have greater
weapon specialization, increase the damage from Rage
from 5 to 12 for your chosen animal’s unarmed attacks.
Raging Resistance
You resist piercing and slashing damage.
Dragon Instinct
You summon the fury of a mighty dragon and manifest
incredible abilities. Perhaps your culture reveres draconic
majesty, or you gained your connection by drinking or
bathing in dragon’s blood or after watching a marauding
wyrm burn your village. Select a type of dragon from Table
3–4: Dragon Instincts to be your instinct’s dragon type.
Chromatic dragons tend to be evil, and metallic dragons
tend to be good.

Anathema
Letting a personal insult against you slide is anathema to
your instinct. Choose whether your character respects or
abhors your dragon type. If you respect it, defying such a
dragon is anathema, and if you abhor it, failing to defeat
such a dragon you come across is anathema.
Draconic Rage (Instinct Ability)
While raging, you can increase the additional damage
from Rage from 2 to 4 and change its damage type to
match that of your dragon’s breath weapon instead of the
damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack. If you
do this, your Rage action gains the arcane and evocation
traits, as well as the trait matching the damage type.
Specialization Ability
When you use draconic rage, you increase the additional
damage from Rage from 4 to 8. If you have greater
weapon specialization, instead increase the damage from
Rage when using draconic rage from 8 to 16.
Raging Resistance
You resist piercing damage and the damage type of your
dragon’s breath weapon.
Fury Instinct
Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well
within you. You use your rage as you choose.
Anathema and Instinct Ability
You don’t have an anathema or an instinct ability. Instead,
you gain an additional 1st-level barbarian feat.
Specialization Ability
Increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6. If
you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase
the additional damage from Rage to 12.
Raging Resistance
You resist physical weapon damage, but not physical
damage from other sources (such as unarmed attacks).
Giant Instinct
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant. This
doesn’t necessarily mean you revere giants—you might
scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead
seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional
strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego.
Anathema
Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.
Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability)
You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you
are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If
you’re not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built
for a creature one size larger than you. You gain access to
one weapon one size larger than you, of any weapon type
otherwise available at character creation. It has the normal
Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size (page 295). When
wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional
damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the clumsy
1 condition (page 618) because of the weapon’s unwieldy
size. You can’t remove this clumsy condition or ignore its
penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.
Specialization Ability
Increase the damage from Rage when using a larger weapon
from 6 to 10; if you have greater weapon specialization,
increase it from 10 to 18.
Raging Resistance
You resist bludgeoning damage and your choice of cold,
electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain raging resistance.
Spirit Instinct
Whether you are emotionally sensitive to the spirits around
you; worship ancestors or apparitions; or are haunted by
the specter of an ancestor, relative, friend, or foe, your rage
takes the form of a spiritual possession.
Anathema
Disrespecting corpses or spirits is anathema to your
instinct; defending yourself against undead creatures is not.
Spirit Rage (Instinct Ability)
When you are raging, you can increase your damage from
Rage from 2 to 3 and deal negative or positive damage,
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many barbarian
class features.
Flourish: Flourish actions are techniques that require
too much exertion to perform a large number in a row.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Instinct: Instinct abilities require a specific instinct; you
lose access if you perform acts anathema to your instinct.
Open: These maneuvers work only as your first salvo on
your turn. You can use an open action only if you haven’t
used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.
Rage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage
trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.

instead of the normal damage type for your weapon or unarmed attack (choose each
time you Rage). If you choose to deal negative or positive damage, your weapon or
unarmed attack gains the effects of the ghost touch property rune, which makes it
more effective against incorporeal creatures, and your Rage action gains the divine
and necromancy traits, plus negative or positive, as appropriate.
Specialization Ability
When using spirit rage, increase the damage from Rage from 3 to 7. If you have greater
weapon specialization, instead increase the damage when using spirit rage to 13.
Raging Resistance
You resist negative damage, as well as damage dealt by the attacks and abilities of
undead creatures, regardless of the damage type.

FURIOUS FINISH [one-action]

RAGE
Desperate to finish the fight, you pour all your rage into one final
blow. Make a Strike. If it hits, you gain a circumstance bonus to

and you are fatigued until you rest for at least 10 minutes.
NO ESCAPE [reaction]
FEAT 2
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Trigger A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.
You keep pace with a retreating foe. Stride up to your Speed,

SECOND WIND

critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on a critical success.

FEAT 12
ATTACK
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
INSTINCT RAGE
Prerequisites spirit instinct
You call forth an ephemeral apparition, typically the ghost
of an ancestor or a nature spirit, which takes the form of a
wisp. The spirit wisp makes a melee wisp rush unarmed
attack against an enemy within 120 feet of you. The wisp’s
attack modifier is equal to your proficiency bonus for martial
weapons plus your Strength modifier plus a +2 item bonus,
and it applies the same circumstance and status bonuses
and penalties that you have. On a hit, the wisp deals damage
equal to 4d8 plus your Constitution modifier. The damage is
your choice of negative or positive damage; don’t apply your
Rage damage or your weapon specialization damage, but
circumstance and status bonuses and penalties that would

FEAT 14
BARBARIAN
RAGE

DRAGON TRANSFORMATION [one-action]
FEAT 16
BARBARIAN CONCENTRATE INSTINCT POLYMORPH PRIMAL RAGE TRANSMUTATION
Prerequisites dragon instinct, Dragon’s Rage Wings
You transform into a ferocious Large dragon, gaining the effects
of 6th-level dragon form except that you use your own AC and
attack modifier; you also apply your extra damage from Rage.
The action to Dismiss the transformation gains the rage trait.
At 18th level, you gain a +20-foot status bonus to your fly
Speed, your damage bonus with dragon Strikes increases to
+12, your breath weapon DC increases to 30, and you gain a
+14 status bonus to your breath weapon damage.
RECKLESS ABANDON [free-action]
FEAT 16
BARBARIAN
RAGE
Trigger Your turn begins, and you are at half or fewer Hit Points.
Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution
to the wind to finish the fight. You gain a +2 circumstance

saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your Rage ends
or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.
18TH LEVEL
BRUTAL CRITICAL
FEAT 18
BARBARIAN
Your critical hits are particularly devastating. On a critical hit,
add one extra damage die. This is in addition to any extra dice
you gain if the weapon is deadly or fatal. The target also takes
persistent bleed damage equal to two damage dice.
PERFECT CLARITY [reaction]
FEAT 18
BARBARIAN
CONCENTRATE
FORTUNE RAGE
Trigger You fail or critically fail an attack roll or Will save.
You burn out all of your rage to ensure that your attack lands
and your mind remains free. Reroll the triggering attack roll or
Will save with a +2 circumstance bonus, use the better result,
and resolve the effect. You then immediately stop raging.
VICIOUS EVISCERATION [two-action][two-actions]
FEAT 18
BARBARIAN
RAGE
You make a vicious attack that maims your enemy. Make a
melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the target is
drained 1, or drained 2 on a critical success.
20TH LEVEL
CONTAGIOUS RAGE
FEAT 20
AUDITORY
BARBARIAN
RAGE
VISUAL
Prerequisites Share Rage
You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible
benefits. You can ignore the requirements on Share Rage,
using it multiple times in a Rage. Allies affected by Share Rage
who accept your anathema for the duration of the Rage gain
your instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from
weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization.

Core Rulebook

PAGE 96
================================================================================

During combat encounters...
You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently
alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed.
During social encounters...
You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease.
While exploring...
You’re a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context
and helpful reconnaissance for the group’s adventure. Your spells and performances
inspire your allies to greater discovery and success.
In downtime...
You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for
yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might
attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college.
You Might...
•	 Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it.
•	 Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required.
•	 Follow your muse, whether it’s a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical
concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret
lore that few others have.
Others Probably...
•	 Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a
guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles.
•	 Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more
than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic.
•	 Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of
your beguiling magic.
You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a captivating
persuader. Using powerful performances, you influence minds and elevate
souls to new levels of heroics. You might use your powers to become a
charismatic leader, or perhaps you might instead be a counselor, manipulator, scholar,
scoundrel, or virtuoso. While your versatility leads some to consider you a beguiling ne’er-
do-well and a jack-of-all-trades, it’s dangerous to dismiss you as a master of none.

================================================================================

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a bard. Abilities gained at higher
levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies, representing
your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.
Occult Spellcasting
You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You can
cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you
can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when
casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because
you’re a bard, you can usually play an instrument for
spells requiring somatic or material components, as long
as it takes at least one of your hands to do so. If you use
an instrument, you don’t need a spell component pouch or
another hand free. You can usually also play an instrument
for spells requiring verbal components, instead of speaking.
Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells
per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can
cast, as shown on Table 3–6: Bard Spells per Day on page 98.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies
roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell
attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill
those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This
increases the spell’s level to match the spell slot. You must
have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to
cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have
specific improvements when they are heightened to certain
levels (page 299). The signature spells class feature lets you
heighten certain spells freely.
Cantrips
Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type
of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at
will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically
heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the
highest level of spell you can cast as a bard. For example, as
a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a
5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level occult spells
of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You
choose these from the common spells from the occult list
(page 311) or from other occult spells to which you have
access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by
using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–6), you add a
spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level,
you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select
two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you
might add a higher-level version of a spell you already
have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire,
it wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

================================================================================

Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might
want to replace some of the spells you previously learned.
Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can
swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the
same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap
out spells by retraining during downtime (page 481).
Composition Spells
You can infuse your performances with magic to create
unique effects called compositions. Compositions are
a special type of spell that often require you to use the
Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells
are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus
spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You
refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and
you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using
the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition,
or otherwise engage your muse.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell
slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and
increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus
pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full
rules for focus spells appear on page 300.
You learn the counter performance composition spell
(page 386), protecting against auditory and visual effects.
Composition Cantrips
Composition cantrips are special composition spells that
don’t cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you
like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips
you choose from the occult list. Generally, only feats can
give you more composition cantrips. Unlike other
cantrips, you can’t swap out composition cantrips
gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you
swap out the specific feat via retraining (page 481).
You learn the inspire courage composition
cantrip (page 386), which boosts your allies’
attacks, damage, and defense against fear.
Muses
As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads
you to great things, and might be a physical creature, a
deity, a philosophy, or a captivating mystery.
Enigma
Your muse is a mystery, driving you to uncover the hidden
secrets of the multiverse. If your muse is a creature, it
might be a dragon or otherworldly being; if a deity, it
might be Irori or Nethys. You gain the Bardic Lore feat
and add true strike to your spell repertoire.
Maestro
Your muse is a virtuoso, inspiring you to greater heights.
If it’s a creature, it might be a performance-loving creature
such as a choral angel or lillend azata; if a deity, it might
be Shelyn. As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an
inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and
oratorical abilities. You gain the Lingering Composition feat
and add soothe to your spell repertoire.
Polymath
Your muse is a jack of all trades, flitting between skills and
pursuits. If it’s is a creature, it might be an eclectic creature
like a fey; if a deity, it might be Desna or Calistria. As a bard
with a polymath muse, you are interested in a wide array of
topics but rarely dedicated to any one, and you rarely make
up your mind—you want to try everything. You gain the
Versatile Performance feat and add unseen servant to your
spell repertoire.

different spell of that level without swapping any spells;
this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases 
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts 
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats 
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.

signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
level at which you learned the previous spell. You can
also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a

Your command of occult magic is the stuff of legends.
Your proficiency ranks for occult spell attack rolls and
spell DCs increase to legendary.
Bard Feats
At every level that you gain a bard feat, you can select one

before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
BARDIC LORE
FEAT 1
BARD
Prerequisites enigma muse
Your studies make you informed on every subject. You
are trained in Bardic Lore, a special Lore skill that can be
used only to Recall Knowledge, but on any topic. If you
have legendary proficiency in Occultism, you gain expert
proficiency in Bardic Lore, but you can’t increase your
proficiency rank in Bardic Lore by any other means.
LINGERING COMPOSITION
FEAT 1
BARD
Prerequisites maestro muse, focus pool
By adding a flourish, you make your compositions last longer.
You learn the lingering composition focus spell (page 387).
Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
BARD
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
You can extend your spells’ range. If the next action you use is
to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many bard class features.
Composition: To cast a composition cantrip or focus
spell, you use a type of Performance (page 250). If the spell
includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory
performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you
must use a visual one. The spell gains all the traits of the
performance you used. You can cast only one composition
spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time.
If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects
from your previous composition spell end immediately.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.

30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch,
you extend its range to 30 feet.
VERSATILE PERFORMANCE
FEAT 1
BARD
Prerequisites polymath muse
You can rely on the grandeur of your performances rather than ordinary social skills.
You can use Performance instead of Diplomacy to Make an Impression and instead of
Intimidation to Demoralize. You can also use an acting Performance instead of Deception to
Impersonate. You can use your proficiency rank in Performance to meet the requirements
of skill feats that require a particular rank in Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
BARD
Study broadens your range of simple spells. Add two additional cantrips from your spell list
to your repertoire.
ESOTERIC POLYMATH
FEAT 2
BARD
Prerequisites polymath muse
You keep a book of occult spells, similar to a wizard’s spellbook, and can use its spells to
supplement your spell repertoire. Add all the spells in your repertoire to this book for free.
You can use the Occultism skill to Learn Spells (page 238) and add them to your spellbook by
paying the appropriate cost, similar to a wizard.
During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of occult spells. If that
spell is already in your spell repertoire, you can treat it as an additional signature spell that
day. If it isn’t in your repertoire, treat it as though it were until your next daily preparations.

MELODIOUS SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 4
BARD
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
You subtly weave your spellcasting into your performance.
If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a
Performance check against all observers’ Perception DCs. If
your Performance check is successful against an observer’s
Perception DC, that observer doesn’t notice that you are
Casting a Spell, even though normally spells have sensory
manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious
to those around you, and verbal, somatic, and material
components are extremely overt. You hide all of these as part
of an ordinary performance.
This hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a
ray streak out from you or see you vanish.
TRIPLE TIME
FEAT 4
BARD
You learn the triple time composition cantrip (page 387),
which speeds up you and your allies for a round.
VERSATILE SIGNATURE
FEAT 4
BARD
Prerequisites polymath muse
While most bards are known for certain signature
performances and spells, you’re always tweaking your
available repertoire. When you make your daily preparations,
you can change one of your signature spells to a different
spell of that level from your repertoire.
6TH LEVEL
DIRGE OF DOOM
FEAT 6
BARD
You learn the dirge of doom composition cantrip (page 386),
which frightens your enemies.
HARMONIZE [one-action]
FEAT 6
BARD
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites maestro muse
You can perform multiple compositions simultaneously. If your
next action is to cast a composition, it becomes a harmonized
composition. Unlike a normal composition, a harmonized
composition doesn’t end if you cast another composition,
and you can cast another composition on the same turn as
a harmonized one. Casting another harmonized composition
ends any harmonized composition you have in effect.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 
FEAT 6
BARD
You don’t lose spells easily. If a reaction would disrupt your
spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed,
your action isn’t disrupted.

Your continued study of occult magic has increased your
magical capacity, allowing you to cast spells even when it seems

Prerequisites maestro muse
The world is a stage upon which you are always playing. You
are permanently quickened; you can use your extra action
only to cast a composition cantrip that requires 1 action to
cast. While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are
performing an eligible composition cantrip while using any
exploration tactic. Even before your first turn in a combat
encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your
previous turn.
IMPOSSIBLE POLYMATH
FEAT 18
BARD
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, or Religion,
Esoteric Polymath
Your esoteric formulas are so unusual that they allow you to
dabble in magic from diverse traditions that other bards don’t
understand. As long as you’re trained in Arcana, you can add
arcane spells to your book from Esoteric Polymath; as long
as you’re trained in Nature, you can add primal spells to your
book; and as long as you are trained in Religion, you can add
divine spells to your book.
Like your other spells in your book, you can add one of
these spells from another tradition to your repertoire as an
occult spell each day using Esoteric Polymath, but you can’t
retain any spells from another tradition when you prepare
again, even if you have Eclectic Polymath.
20TH LEVEL
FATAL ARIA
FEAT 20
BARD
Prerequisites focus pool
Your songs overwhelm the target with unbearable emotion,
potentially striking them dead on the spot. You learn the
fatal aria composition spell (page 386). Increase the number

================================================================================

Champion
During combat encounters...
You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself
to protect your allies.
During social encounters...
You are a voice of hope, striving to reach a peaceful solution that strengthens bonds
and yields good results for all.
While exploring...
You overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to your
allies through your actions and—when your fellow adventurers ask for it—providing
moral and ethical guidance.
In downtime...
You spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous training,
charity work, and fulfilling the tenets of your code, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t
time to take up a craft or hobby.
You Might...
•	 Believe there is always hope that good will triumph over evil, no matter how grim
the odds.
•	 Know the ends don’t justify the means, since evil acts increase the power of evil.
•	 Have a strong sense of right and wrong, and grow frustrated when greed or
shortsightedness breeds evil.
Others Probably...
•	 See you as a symbol of hope, especially in a time of great need.
•	 Worry you secretly despise them for not living up to your impossible standard, or
that you are unwilling to compromise when necessary.
•	 Know that you’ve sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep.
You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty
mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around
you. While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you
provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely
with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of
evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a champion. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Champion’s Code
You follow a code of conduct, beginning with tenets
shared by all champions of an alignment (such as good),
and continuing with tenets of your cause. Deities often add
additional strictures (for instance, Torag’s champions can’t
show mercy to enemies of their people, making it almost
impossible for them to follow the redeemer cause). Only rules
for good champions appear in this book. Tenets are listed
in order of importance, starting with the most important.
If a situation places two tenets in conflict, you aren’t in a
no-win situation; instead, follow the more important tenet.
For instance, as a paladin, if an evil king asked you if you’re
hiding refugees so he could execute them, you could lie
to him, since the tenet against lying is less important than
preventing harm to innocents. Trying to subvert your code
by creating a situation that forces a higher tenet to override
a lower tenet (for example, promising not to respect
authorities and then, to keep your word, disrespecting
authorities) is a violation of the champion code.
If you stray from your alignment or violate your code of
conduct, you lose your focus pool and divine ally until you
demonstrate your repentance by conducting an atone ritual
(page 409), but you keep any other champion abilities that
don’t require those class features. If your alignment shifts
but is still one allowed by your deity, your GM might let
you retrain your cause while still following the same deity.
The Tenets of Good
All champions of good alignment follow these tenets.
•	 You must never perform acts anathema to your
deity or willingly commit an evil act, such as
murder, torture, or the casting of an evil spell.
•	 You must never knowingly harm an innocent, or
allow immediate harm to one through inaction
when you know you could reasonably prevent it.
This tenet doesn’t force you to take action against
possible harm to innocents at an indefinite time in
the future, or to sacrifice your life to protect them.
Deity and Cause
Champions are divine servants of a deity. Choose a deity
to follow (pages 437–440); your alignment must be one
allowed for followers of your deity. Actions fundamentally
opposed to your deity’s ideals or alignment are anathema
to your faith. A few examples of acts that would be
considered anathema appear in each deity’s entry. You and
your GM determine whether other acts are anathema.
You have one of the following causes. Your cause must
match your alignment exactly. Your cause determines
your champion’s reaction, grants you a devotion spell
(page 107), and defines part of your champion’s code.
Paladin (Lawful Good)
You’re honorable, forthright, and committed to pushing
back the forces of cruelty. You gain the Retributive Strike
champion’s reaction and the lay on hands devotion spell.
After the tenets of good, add these tenets:
•	 You must act with honor, never taking advantage
of others, lying, or cheating.
•	 You must respect the lawful authority of legitimate
leadership wherever you go, and follow its laws.
Redeemer (Neutral Good)
You’re full of kindness and forgiveness. You gain the
Glimpse of Redemption champion’s reaction and the lay on
hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good, add these:

================================================================================

•	 You must first try to redeem those who commit
evil acts, rather than killing them or meting out
punishment. If they then continue on a wicked path,
you might need to take more extreme measures.
•	 You must show compassion for others, regardless
of their authority or station.
Liberator (Chaotic Good)
You’re committed to defending the freedom of others.
You gain the Liberating Step champion’s reaction and
the lay on hands devotion spell. After the tenets of good,
add these tenets:
•	 You must respect the choices others make over their
own lives, and you can’t force someone to act in a
particular way or threaten them if they don’t.
•	 You must demand and fight for others’ freedom to
make their own decisions. You may never engage
in or countenance slavery or tyranny.
Deific Weapon
You zealously bear your deity’s favored weapon. If it’s
uncommon, you gain access to it. If it’s a simple weapon,
increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8,
d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
Champion’s Reaction
Your cause gives you a special reaction: Retributive
Strike for paladin, Glimpse of Redemption for
redeemer, or Liberating Step for liberator.
RETRIBUTIVE STRIKE [reaction]
CHAMPION
Trigger An enemy damages your ally, and both are within
15 feet of you.
You protect your ally and strike your foe. The ally gains
resistance to all damage against the triggering damage
equal to 2 + your level. If the foe is within reach, make a
melee Strike against it.
GLIMPSE OF REDEMPTION [reaction]
CHAMPION
Trigger An enemy damages your ally, and
both are within 15 feet of you.
Your foe hesitates under the weight of sin as
visions of redemption play in their mind’s eye. The
foe must choose one of the following options:
•	 The ally is unharmed by the triggering damage.
•	 The ally gains resistance to all damage against
the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level.
After the damaging effect is applied, the enemy
becomes enfeebled 2 until the end of its next turn.
LIBERATING STEP [reaction]
CHAMPION
Trigger An enemy damages, Grabs, or Grapples your ally, and
both are within 15 feet of you.
You free an ally from restraint. If the trigger was an ally
taking damage, the ally gains resistance to all damage
against the triggering damage equal to 2 + your level. The
ally can attempt to break free of effects grabbing, restraining,
immobilizing, or paralyzing them. They either attempt a new
save against one such effect that allows a save, or attempt
to Escape from one effect as a free action. If they can move,
the ally can Step as a free action, even if they didn’t need
to escape.

skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase
your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re
untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one
skill in which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four
different ability scores. You can use these boosts to
increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score
increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it
starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in
your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Weapon Expertise
5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of
your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons
and martial weapons increase to expert.
Armor Expertise
7th
You have spent so much time in armor that you know
how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency
ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for
unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor
specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.
Weapon Specialization
7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to
4 if you’re legendary.
Champion Expertise
9th
Prayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency
ranks for your champion class DC and divine spell attack
rolls and DCs increase to expert.
Divine Smite
9th
Your champion’s reaction improves.
Paladin: You surround evil targets in a punishing halo.
If you hit with your Retributive Strike, the target takes
persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Redeemer: A guilty conscience assails foes who spurn
your Glimpse of Redemption. A foe that responds to
your Glimpse of Redemption by dealing damage takes
persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Devotion Spells
Your deity’s power grants you special divine spells called
devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1
Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus
pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during
your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by
spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to
your deity or do service toward their causes.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Certain feats can give you more focus
spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your
focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full
rules are on page 300. You gain a devotion spell depending
on your cause, and you are trained in divine spell attack
rolls and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is Charisma.
Champion Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter,
you gain a champion class feat. Champion class feats are
presented beginning on page 109.
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (page 266), a
reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Divine Ally
3rd
Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity’s alignment.
Once you choose an ally, your choice can’t be changed.
The following are divine allies:
Blade Ally: A spirit of battle dwells within your weapon.
Select one weapon when you make your daily preparations.
In your hands, the weapon gains the effect of a property
rune. For a champion following the tenets of good, choose
disrupting, ghost touch, returning, or shifting. You also
gain the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
Shield Ally: A spirit of protection dwells within your
shield. In your hands, the shield’s Hardness increases by 2
and its HP and BT increase by half.
Steed Ally: You gain a young animal companion as a
mount (page 214). Ordinarily, your animal companion is
one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You
can select a different animal companion (GM’s discretion),
but this ability doesn’t grant it the mount special ability.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or
paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes
persistent good damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

Your faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Exalt
11th
Your champion’s reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing
them to benefit as well.
Paladin: When you use Retributive Strike, each ally
within 15 feet of you with the target in their melee reach
can spend a reaction to Strike the target with a –5 penalty.
Redeemer: You protect multiple allies. You can apply
the resistance granted by Glimpse of Redemption to
yourself and all allies within 15 feet of you, including the
triggering ally, except the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.
Liberator: You can help your whole group get into
position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn’t
attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within
15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.

Your skill with armor improves, helping you avoid more
blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy
armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.
Weapon Mastery
13th

Champion Feats

select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
DEITY’S DOMAIN
FEAT 1
CHAMPION
You embody an aspect of your deity. Choose one of your
deity’s domains from those listed on page 441. You gain the
domain’s initial domain spell as a devotion spell.
RANGED REPRISAL
FEAT 1
CHAMPION
Prerequisites paladin cause
You can use Retributive Strike with a ranged weapon. In
addition, if the foe that triggered your reaction is within 5 feet
of your reach but not in your reach, as part of your reaction
you can Step to put the foe in your reach before making a
melee Retributive Strike.
UNIMPEDED STEP
FEAT 1
CHAMPION
Prerequisites liberator cause
KEY TERMS
You’ll see these terms in many champion abilities.
Flourish: Flourishes are techniques that require too
much exertion to perform a large number in a row. You
can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Metamagic: These actions tweak your spells. You must
use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell
you want to alter. If you use any action (including free
actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly
after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action.
Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the
spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action.
Oath: Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You
can usually have only one feat with this trait.

in a mission that would prevent your doing so.”

harming an innocent or a good ally as if it were undead; in this
case, lay on hands deals good damage instead of positive damage

presence of an aura of evil that is powerful or overwhelming
(page 328), you eventually detect the aura, though you might
not do so instantly, and you can’t pinpoint the location. This
acts as a vague sense, similar to humans’ sense of smell. An
evil creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its
presence attempts a Deception check against your Perception
DC to hide its aura from you. If the creature succeeds at its
Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense
Evil for 1 day.
10TH LEVEL

================================================================================

Cleric
During combat encounters...
If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons—
typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily
cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on
your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.
During social encounters...
You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you’re
wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.
While exploring...
You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You
might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a
battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.
In downtime...
You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity,
research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.
You Might...
•	 Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate
affinity with other worshippers of your deity.
•	 Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.
•	 Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will.
Others Probably...
•	 Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it.
•	 Expect you to heal their wounds.
•	 Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a cleric. Abilities gained at
higher levels list requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.
Deity
As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere
above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder
appear on pages 437–440, along with their alignments,
areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a
cleric of that deity. Your alignment must be one allowed
by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants
you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with
the deity’s favored weapon. If the favored weapon is
uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.
Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can
prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell
list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric.
Some of these spells aren’t normally on the divine list, but
they’re divine spells if you prepare them this way.
Anathema
Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s alignment
or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting
spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema
to your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces.
Casting spells with the evil trait is almost always
anathema to good deities, and casting good spells is
likewise anathema to evil deities; similarly, casting
chaotic spells is anathema to lawful deities, and casting
lawful spells is anathema to chaotic deities. A neutral
cleric who worships a neutral deity isn’t limited this
way, but their alignment might change over time if
they frequently cast spells or use abilities with a certain
alignment. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to
the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your
connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell
to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the
goddess of death. For borderline cases, you and your GM
determine which acts are anathema.
If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your
deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by
your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from
your connection to your deity. The class features that you
lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include
your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities
can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance
by conducting an atone ritual (found on page 409).
Divine Spellcasting
Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells.
You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and
you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components
when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because
you’re a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a
religious symbol) for spells requiring material components
instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.
At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and
five cantrips each morning from the common spells on
the divine spell list in this book (page 309) or from other
divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells
remain available to you until you cast them or until you
prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can
prepare is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells
you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest
level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–9: Cleric
Spells per Day on page 120.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell
attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies
to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a
saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your
spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.

================================================================================

Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the
spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when
they are heightened to certain levels.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell
slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to
half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the
highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example,
as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and
as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Divine Font
Through your deity’s blessing, you gain additional spells
that channel either the life force called positive energy or
its counterforce, negative energy. When you
prepare your spells each day, you can
prepare additional heal or harm spells,
depending on your deity. The divine
font spell your deity provides is listed in
the Divine Font entry for your deity on
pages 437–440; if both are listed, you can
choose between heal or harm. Once you
choose, you can’t change your choice short
of an ethical shift or divine intervention.
Healing Font: You gain additional spell
slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots.
You can prepare only heal spells (page 343) in these
slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your
Charisma modifier.
Harmful Font: You gain additional spell slots each
day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can
prepare only harm spells (page 343) in these slots,
and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your
Charisma modifier.
Doctrine
Even among followers of the same deity, there
are numerous doctrines and beliefs, which
sometimes vary wildly between clerics. At 1st
level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits
of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in
this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest.
Each doctrine grants you initial benefits
at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and
19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your
doctrine’s second, third, fourth, fifth, and final
doctrines respectively.
Cloistered Cleric
You are a cleric of the cloth, focusing on divine magic and
your connection to your deity’s domains.
First Doctrine (1st): You gain the Domain Initiate cleric
feat (page 121).
Second Doctrine (3rd): Your proficiency rank for
Fortitude saves increases to expert.
Third Doctrine (7th): Your proficiency ranks for divine
spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
Fourth Doctrine (11th): You gain expert proficiency
with your deity’s favored weapon. When you
critically succeed at an attack roll
using that weapon, you apply
the weapon’s critical specialization
effect; use your divine spell DC
if necessary.

Miraculous Spell
19th
You’re exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible
spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can
prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting.
You don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up,
though you can take the Maker of Miracles feat to gain
a second slot.
Cleric Feats
At each level that you gain a cleric feat, you can select one
of the following feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites
before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
DEADLY SIMPLICITY
FEAT 1
CLERIC
Prerequisites deity with a simple favored weapon, trained
with your deity’s favored weapon
Your deity’s weapon is especially powerful in your hands.
When you are wielding your deity’s favored weapon, increase
the damage die size of that weapon by one step.
If your deity’s favored weapon is an unarmed attack (such
as a fist, if you worship Irori) and its damage die is smaller
than d6, instead increase its damage die size to d6.
DOMAIN INITIATE
FEAT 1
CLERIC
Your deity bestows a special spell related to their powers.
Select one domain—a subject of particular interest to you
within your religion—from your deity’s list. You gain an initial
domain spell for that domain, a spell unique to the domain
and not available to other clerics. Each domain’s theme and
domain spells appear in Table 8–2: Domains on page 441.
Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus
Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool
of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily
preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10
minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do
service toward their causes.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, nor
can you cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you
more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool,
though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus
Points. The full rules for focus spells appear on page 300.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, selecting a
different domain each time and gaining its domain spell.
HARMING HANDS 
FEAT 1
CLERIC
Prerequisites harmful font
The mordant power of your negative energy grows. When you
cast harm, you roll d10s instead of d8s.
HEALING HANDS 
FEAT 1
CLERIC
Prerequisites healing font
Your positive energy is even more vibrant and restorative.
When you cast heal, you roll d10s instead of d8s.
HOLY CASTIGATION 
FEAT 1
CLERIC
Prerequisites good alignment
You combine holy energy with positive energy to damage
demons, devils, and their evil ilk. Heal spells you cast damage
fiends as though they were undead.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following term in many cleric class features.
Metamagic: These actions tweak your spells. You must
use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell
you want to alter. If you use any action (including free
actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly
after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action.
Effects added by a metamagic action are part of the
spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action.

REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
a range, increase that spell’s range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if
the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
CLERIC
You study a wider range of simple spells. You can prepare two additional cantrips each day.
COMMUNAL HEALING
FEAT 2
CLERIC
HEALING
POSITIVE
You’re a conduit for positive energy, and as you channel it through you, it heals some of your
minor injuries. When you cast the heal spell to heal a single creature other than yourself,
you regain Hit Points equal to the spell level of the heal spell.
EMBLAZON ARMAMENT
FEAT 2
CLERIC
EXPLORATION
Carefully etching a sacred image into a physical object, you steel yourself for battle. You
can spend 10 minutes emblazoning a symbol of your deity upon a weapon or shield. The
symbol doesn’t fade until 1 year has passed, but if you Emblazon an Armament, any symbol
you previously emblazoned and any symbol already emblazoned on that item instantly
disappears. The item becomes a religious symbol of your deity and can be used as a divine
focus while emblazoned, and it gains another benefit determined by the type of item. This
benefit applies only to followers of the deity the symbol represents.
•	 Shield The shield gains a +1 status bonus to its Hardness. (This causes it to reduce
more damage with the Shield Block reaction.)
•	 Weapon The wielder gains a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.
SAP LIFE
FEAT 2
CLERIC
HEALING
You draw the life force out of your enemies to heal your own wounds. When you cast a
harm spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell
level of your harm spell. If you aren’t a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
TURN UNDEAD
FEAT 2
CLERIC
Undead harmed by your positive energy might flee, compelled by an innate aversion to the
force opposite undeath. When you use a heal spell to damage undead, each undead of your
level or lower that critically fails its save gains the fleeing condition for 1 round.
VERSATILE FONT
FEAT 2
CLERIC
Prerequisites harmful font or healing font, deity that allows clerics to have both fonts
As you explore your deity’s aspects, you move beyond restrictions on healing or harming. You
can prepare either harm or heal in the spell slots gained from the harmful font or healing font.

into your foe. Make a melee Strike and add the spell’s damage
to the Strike’s damage. This is negative damage if you expended
a harm spell or positive damage if you expended a heal spell.
The spell is expended with no effect if your Strike fails or
hits a creature that isn’t damaged by that energy type (such as
if you hit a non-undead creature with a heal spell).
COMMAND UNDEAD [one-action]
FEAT 4
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites harmful font, evil alignment
You grasp the animating force within an undead creature and
bend it to your will. If the next action you use is to cast harm
targeting one undead creature, you transform the effects of
that harm spell. Instead of harm’s normal effects, the target
becomes controlled by you if its level is equal to or lower than
your level – 3. It can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being
controlled by you. If the target is already under someone else’s
command, the controlling creature also rolls a saving throw,
and the undead uses the better result.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and is temporarily
immune for 24 hours.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The undead creature becomes a minion under your
control. The spell gains a duration of 1 minute, but it is
dismissed if you or an ally attacks the minion undead.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
DIRECTED CHANNEL
FEAT 4
CLERIC
You can shape the energy you channel in a single direction,
reaching farther and in a more directed fashion. When you
cast a version of harm or heal that has an area, you can make
its area a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot emanation.
IMPROVED COMMUNAL HEALING
FEAT 4
CLERIC
Prerequisites Communal Healing
You can direct excess channeled energy outward to benefit
an ally. You can grant the Hit Points you would regain from
Communal Healing to any one creature within the range of
your heal spell instead of yourself. You can also use Communal
Healing when you target only yourself with a heal spell,
though if you do, you must grant the additional healing to
someone other than yourself.
NECROTIC INFUSION [one-action]
FEAT 4
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites harmful font, evil alignment
You pour negative energy into your undead subject to
empower its attacks. If the next action you use is to cast harm
to restore Hit Points to a single undead creature, the target
then deals an additional 1d6 negative damage with its melee
weapons and unarmed attacks until the end of its next turn.
If the harm spell is at least 5th level, this damage increases
to 2d6, and if the harm spell is at least 8th level, the damage
increases to 3d6.
6TH LEVEL
CAST DOWN [one-action]
FEAT 6
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites harmful font or healing font
The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If
the next action you use is to cast harm or heal to damage one
creature, the target is knocked prone if it takes any damage from
the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it
also takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
DIVINE WEAPON [free-action]
FEAT 6
CLERIC
Frequency once per turn
Trigger You finish Casting a Spell using one of your divine
spell slots on your turn.
You siphon residual spell energy into a weapon you’re
wielding. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an
additional 1d4 force damage. You can instead deal an additional
1d6 damage of an alignment type that matches one of your
deity’s alignment components. As usual for aligned damage,
this can damage only creatures of the opposite alignment.
SELECTIVE ENERGY
FEAT 6
CLERIC
As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies
from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast
a version of harm or heal that has an area, you can designate
a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1) that are not targeted by the spell.
STEADY SPELLCASTING
FEAT 6
CLERIC
Confident in your technique, you don’t lose spells easily. If a
reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC
15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
ADVANCED DOMAIN
FEAT 8
CLERIC
Prerequisites Domain Initiate
Your studies or prayers have unlocked deeper secrets of your
deity’s domain. You gain an advanced domain spell from one
CONTROLLING UNDEAD
Controlled undead gain the minion trait. Minions can use 2
actions per turn and can’t use reactions. A minion acts on your
turn in combat when you spend an action to issue it verbal
commands (this action has the auditory and concentrate
traits). If given no commands, undead minions use no actions
except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm.
If left unattended for at least 1 minute, mindless undead
minions don’t act, and intelligent ones act as they please. You
can’t have more than four undead minions at a time.

spell to damage undead, each undead that takes damage also
takes persistent fire damage equal to the spell’s level.
EMBLAZON ENERGY
FEAT 8
CLERIC
Prerequisites Emblazon Armament
With elemental forces, you make your emblazoned symbols
more potent. When you Emblazon an Armament, you can choose
from the following effects instead of the effects listed in that feat.
These effects have the same restrictions as the base options.
•	 Shield Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
The wielder gain the shield’s circumstance bonus to
saving throws against that damage type and can use
Shield Block against damage of that type. The shield
also gains resistance to that damage type equal to
half your level if you have a domain spell with a trait
matching that type (such as fire).
Core Rulebook
124

PAGE 126
================================================================================

•	 Weapon Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
The weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage of that type.
Increase this extra damage to 1d6 if you have a domain
spell with a trait matching that type (such as fire).
10TH LEVEL
CASTIGATING WEAPON
FEAT 10
CLERIC
Prerequisites Holy Castigation
The force of your deity’s castigation strengthens your body so
you can strike down the wicked. After you damage a fiend using
a heal spell, your weapon or unarmed Strikes deal extra good
damage to fiends equal to half the level of the heal spell until
the end of your next turn. This is cumulative with any good
damage the weapon already deals (such as from a holy rune).
HEROIC RECOVERY [one-action]
FEAT 10
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites healing font, good alignment
The restorative power of your healing invigorates the
recipient. If the next action you use is to cast heal targeting
a single living creature and the target regains Hit Points from
the spell, it also gains three bonuses until the end of its next
turn: a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed, a +1 status bonus to
attack rolls, and a +1 status bonus to damage rolls.
IMPROVED COMMAND UNDEAD
FEAT 10
CLERIC
Prerequisites harmful font, Command Undead, evil alignment
Undead creatures find it all but impossible to resist your
commands. When you use Command Undead, if the undead
succeeds at its save but doesn’t critically succeed, it is your
minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it is your
minion for 10 minutes. If it critically fails, it is your minion for
24 hours.
REPLENISHMENT OF WAR
FEAT 10
CLERIC
Prerequisites expert in your deity’s favored weapon
Striking out against your enemies draws praise and protection
from your deity. When you damage a creature with a Strike
using your deity’s favored weapon, you gain a number of
temporary Hit Points equal to half your level, or equal to your
level if the Strike was a critical hit. These temporary Hit Points
last until the start of your next turn.
12TH LEVEL
DEFENSIVE RECOVERY [one-action]
FEAT 12
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
Prerequisites harmful font or healing font
Your faith provides temporary protection in addition to healing.
If the next action you use is to cast harm or heal on a single
target and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also
gains a +2 status bonus to AC and saving throws for 1 round.
DOMAIN FOCUS
FEAT 12
CLERIC
Prerequisites one or more domain spells
Your devotion to your deity’s domains grows greater, and so
does the power granted to you. If you have spent at least 2
Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 2
Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
EMBLAZON ANTIMAGIC
FEAT 12
CLERIC
Prerequisites Emblazon Armament
Your deity’s symbol protects against offensive magic. When
you Emblazon an Armament, you can choose from the
following effects instead of the effects listed in that feat.
These effects have the same restrictions as the base options.
•	 Shield When the wielder has the shield raised, they
gain the shield’s circumstance bonus to saving throws
against magic, and they can use Shield Block against
damage from their enemies’ spells.
•	 Weapon When the weapon’s wielder critically hits
with the weapon, they can attempt to counteract a
spell on their target, using their level as the counteract
level. If they attempt to do so, the emblazoned symbol
immediately disappears.
SHARED REPLENISHMENT
FEAT 12
CLERIC
Prerequisites Replenishment of War
When your deity blesses your warlike acts, you can extend
that favor to your allies. You can grant the temporary Hit Points
from Replenishment of War to an ally within 10 feet instead
of gaining them yourself. You can grant these temporary Hit
Points to a different ally each time, meaning you might be able
to grant them to multiple creatures in a single turn.
14TH LEVEL
DEITY’S PROTECTION
FEAT 14
CLERIC
Prerequisites Advanced Domain
When you call upon your deity’s power to fulfill the promise
of their domain, you gain divine protection. After you cast a
domain spell, you gain resistance to all damage until the start
of your next turn. The amount of resistance is equal to the
level of the domain spell you cast.
EXTEND ARMAMENT ALIGNMENT
FEAT 14
CLERIC
Prerequisites Align Armament
The alignment you impose on a weapon lasts much longer. The
duration of Align Armament increases to 1 minute.
FAST CHANNEL 

to your call. When you cast harm or heal by spending 2
actions, you can get the effects of the 3-action version instead
of the 2-action version.
You can do this with harm if you have harmful font or heal
if you have healing font (or both if you have Versatile Font).
SWIFT BANISHMENT [reaction] 
FEAT 14
CLERIC
Trigger You critically hit a creature that is not on its
home plane.
Requirements You have a banishment spell prepared.
The force of your blow sends your victim back to its home
plane. You expend a banishment spell you have prepared,
affecting the creature you critically hit without needing to
cast the spell. The creature can attempt to resist the spell
as normal.
16TH LEVEL
ETERNAL BANE
FEAT 16
CLERIC
Prerequisites evil alignment
A life of evil has made you a nexus for your deity’s vile power.
You’re continuously surrounded by a bane spell with a spell
level equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15
feet, and you can’t increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you
do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
ETERNAL BLESSING
FEAT 16
CLERIC
Prerequisites good alignment
Your good deeds have brought your deity’s grace to you for
all of eternity. You’re continuously surrounded by a bless
spell with a spell level equal to half your level (rounded
up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can’t increase it. You can
Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after
1 minute.
RESURRECTIONIST
FEAT 16
CLERIC
You can cause a creature you bring back from the brink of
death to thrive and continue healing. When you restore Hit
Points to a dying creature or bring a dead creature back to
life and restore Hit Points to it, you grant that creature fast
healing 5 for 1 minute. This fast healing ends if the creature is
knocked unconscious.
18TH LEVEL
DOMAIN WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
CLERIC
Prerequisites Domain Focus
The intensity of your focus grows from the investment you’ve
placed in your domains. If you have spent at least 3 Focus
Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 3 Focus
Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
PHARASMIN
A follower of the Lady of Graves, you respect the

ECHOING CHANNEL [one-action]
FEAT 18
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
When you pull forth positive or negative energy, you also
create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you
use is to cast a 2-action harm or heal to heal or damage a single
creature, choose one additional creature adjacent to either
you or the target. Target that creature with a 1-action version
of the same spell. This spell is the same level as the 2-action
harm or heal you cast and doesn’t cost another spell slot.
IMPROVED SWIFT BANISHMENT
FEAT 18
CLERIC
Prerequisites Swift Banishment
You easily banish creatures with your weapon. You can use
Swift Banishment as long as you have a spell slot of 5th level or
higher remaining, even if you don’t have banishment prepared.
You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th level or higher, and the
banishment effect you create is heightened to the level of that
spell. Your weapon serves as the special material component
of banishment, causing the target to take the –2 penalty to its
save against any banishment you cast using Swift Banishment.
20TH LEVEL
AVATAR’S AUDIENCE
FEAT 20
CLERIC
Your extensive service has made you a lesser herald of your
deity, which affords you certain privileges. First, any creature
you encounter knows instinctively that you speak for
your deity. Second, if you conduct the commune ritual to
contact your deity, you don’t have to pay any cost and you
automatically get a critical success. Third, once per day, you
can cast plane shift as a divine innate spell, but only to travel
to the realm of your deity. When you cast it this way, its
casting time is 1 minute, your religious symbol is a sufficient
tuning fork for this spell, and you appear exactly where you
want to be. If you’re in your deity’s realm due to this spell, you
can return to the point you left when you cast it by spending
a single action, which has the concentrate and divine traits.
MAKER OF MIRACLES
FEAT 20
CLERIC
Prerequisites miraculous spell
You are a conduit for truly deific power. You gain an additional
10th-level spell slot.
METAMAGIC CHANNEL [free-action]
FEAT 20
CLERIC
CONCENTRATE
Deep understanding of divine revelations into the nature of
vital essence allows you to freely manipulate the effects of
your positive or negative energy. Use 1 metamagic action
that you can perform that normally takes 1 action and can be
applied to the harm or heal spell. If you use it in this way, its
effects apply only to a harm or heal spell.

PAGE 130
================================================================================

The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to the stoutest
fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them
to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath
the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it—
and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature’s
call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service.
During combat encounters...
You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies.
You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends,
heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on
your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape
into a terrifying beast.
During social encounters...
You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions
that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to
live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to
gain what they truly need, even if they can’t have all that they desire.
While exploring...
Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness,
and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals
to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group.
In downtime...
You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead
you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by
civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques
that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance.
You Might...
•	 Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature.
•	 Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of
their influence upon it.
•	 Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals.
Others Probably...
•	 View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it.
•	 Assume you’re a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild.
•	 Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a druid. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies,
representing your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Primal Spellcasting
The power of the wild world flows through you. You can
cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you
can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when
casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because
you’re a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as
holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components
instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.
At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and
five cantrips each morning from the common spells on
the primal spell list in this book (page 314), or from other
primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells
remain available to you until you cast them or until you
prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can
prepare is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells
you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest
level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3–11: Druid
Spells per Day on page 132.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell
attack roll to see how effective they are, or have
your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by
attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is
Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your
Wisdom modifier. Details on calculating these statistics
appear on page 447.
Heightening Spells
When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the
spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when
they are heightened to certain levels.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell
slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened
to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to
the highest level of spell you can cast as a druid. For
example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-level
spells, and as a 5th-level druid, your cantrips are 3rd-
level spells.
Anathema
As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts
to nature anathema. If you perform enough acts that
are anathema to nature, you lose your magical abilities
that come from the druid class, including your primal
spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities
can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance
by conducting an atone ritual (page 409).
The following acts are anathema to all druids:
•	 Using metal armor or shields.
•	 Despoiling natural places.
•	 Teaching the Druidic language to non-druids.
Each druidic order also has additional anathema acts,
detailed in the order’s entry.
Druidic Language
You know Druidic, a secret language known to only
druids, in addition to any languages you know through
your ancestry. Druidic has its own alphabet. Teaching the
Druidic language to non-druids is anathema.

================================================================================

Druidic Order
Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic
order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell
(see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your
order. While you’ll always be a member of your initial
order, it’s not unheard of for a druid to request to study
with other orders in search of greater understanding of
the natural world, and PC druids are among the most
likely to blend the powers of different orders.
Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus
Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus
pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during
your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus
Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity
to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to
the wilderness in a way befitting your order.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t
require spell slots to cast, and you can’t cast them using
spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus
spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though
your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.
The full rules for focus spells appear in Chapter 7 on
page 300.
Animal
You have a strong connection to beasts, and you are allied
with a beast companion. You are trained in Athletics.
You also gain the Animal Companion druid feat. You
gain the heal animal order spell. Committing wanton
cruelty to animals or killing animals unnecessarily
is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t prevent you
from defending yourself against animals or killing them
cleanly for food.)
Leaf
You revere plants and the bounty of nature, acting as
both a gardener and warden for the wilderness, teaching
sustainable techniques to communities, and helping
areas regrow after disasters or negligent humanoid
expansion. You are trained in Diplomacy. You also gain
the Leshy Familiar druid feat. You gain the goodberry
order spell, and you increase the number of Focus
Points in your focus pool by 1. Committing wanton
cruelty to plants or killing plants unnecessarily is
anathema to your order. (This doesn’t
prevent you from defending yourself
against plants or harvesting them
when necessary for survival.)

Wild Empathy
You have a connection to the creatures of the natural
world that allows you to communicate with them on a
rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to Make an
Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests
of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to
make your case.

At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
druid class feat.

*	The primal hierophant class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.
Storm
You carry the fury of the storm within you, channeling
it to terrifying effect and riding the winds through the
sky. You are trained in Acrobatics. You also gain the
Storm Born druid feat. You gain the tempest surge order
spell, and you increase the number of Focus Points in
your focus pool by 1. Polluting the air or allowing those
who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go
unpunished is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t
force you to take action against merely potential harm
to the environment or to sacrifice yourself against an
obviously superior foe.)
Wild
The savage, uncontrollable call of the natural world
infuses you, granting you the ability to change your
shape and take on the ferocious form of a wild creature.
You are trained in Intimidation. You also gain the
Wild Shape druid feat. You gain the wild morph order
spell. Becoming fully domesticated by the temptations
of civilization is anathema to your order. (This doesn’t
prevent you from buying and using processed goods or
staying in a city for an adventure, but you can never come
to rely on these conveniences or truly call such a place
your permanent home.)
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (found on page
266), a reaction that lets you reduce damage with
your shield.

================================================================================

Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in
your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Lightning Reflexes
5th
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
Expert Spellcaster
7th
Your command of primal forces has deepened, empowering
your spells. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell attack
rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
Druid Weapon Expertise
11th
You have become thoroughly familiar with the weapons
of your trade. Your proficiency ranks for all simple
weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.
Resolve
11th
You’ve steeled your mind with incredible resolve. Your
proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master.
When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a
critical success instead.
Medium Armor Expertise
13th
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
Weapon Specialization
13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with
weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.
This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if
you’re legendary.
Master Spellcaster
15th
Primal magic answers your command. Your proficiency
ranks for primal spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase
to master.
Legendary Spellcaster
19th
You have developed an unparalleled rapport with the
magic of nature. Your proficiency ranks for primal spell
attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.
Primal Hierophant
19th
You command the most potent forces of primal magic
and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain
a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in
that slot using primal spellcasting. Unlike with other spell
slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level
up, though you can take the Hierophant’s Power feat to
gain a second slot.
Druid Feats
At every level that you gain a druid feat, you can select one
of the following feats. You must satisfy any prerequisites
before selecting the feat.
1ST LEVEL
ANIMAL COMPANION
FEAT 1
DRUID
Prerequisites animal order
You gain the service of a young animal companion that
travels with you on your adventures and obeys any simple
commands you give it to the best of its abilities. See Animal
Companions on page 214 for more information.
LESHY FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
DRUID
Prerequisites leaf order
You gain a leshy familiar, a Tiny plant that embodies one of the
many spirits of nature. Other than taking the form of a plant
instead of an animal, this familiar uses all the same rules as
other familiars, which are detailed on page 217.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key term in many druid
class features.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use the metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.

abilities requiring that order but retain your other druid feats and abilities. You don’t gain

FORM CONTROL [one-action]
FEAT 4
DRUID
MANIPULATE

of time. If your next action is to cast wild shape, wild shape’s spell level is 2 lower than
normal (minimum 1st level), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed
duration (whichever is longer). You can still Dismiss the form at any time, as permitted
by the spell.
MATURE ANIMAL COMPANION
FEAT 4
DRUID
Prerequisites Animal Companion
Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion, which grants it
additional capabilities. See the animal companion rules on page 214 for more information.
Your animal companion is better trained than most. During an encounter, even if you don’t
use the Command an Animal action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your
turn that round to Stride or Strike.

SAMPLE DRUID
6TH LEVEL
GREEN EMPATHY
FEAT 6
DRUID
Prerequisites leaf order
You can communicate with plants on a basic level and use
Diplomacy to Make an Impression on them and to make very
simple Requests of them. Non-creature plants typically can’t
fulfill most requests you might ask of them unless you have
access to other magic such as speak with plants. Because of
your affiliation with the leaf order, plants have a sense that
you support them, so you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on
your check to Make a Request of a plant using Green Empathy.
INSECT SHAPE
FEAT 6
DRUID
Prerequisites Wild Shape
Your understanding of life expands, allowing you to mimic a
wider range of creatures. Add the forms in insect form to your

is 24 hours instead of 10 minutes.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 

fails. This movement is forced movement.

FEROCIOUS SHAPE
FEAT 8
DRUID
Prerequisites Wild Shape

magic toward illusions and trickery. Add illusory disguise,
STORM DRUID
You call upon the power of nature to let loose bolts

wild shape list. If you have Ferocious Shape, you also add the
pterosaur form to your wild shape list. Whenever you use
wild shape to gain a form that grants you a specific Acrobatics
modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to Acrobatics checks.
WIND CALLER
FEAT 8

you can imbue them into your body and manifest as a living
embodiment of those elements. Add the forms in elemental
form to your wild shape list. Whenever you’re polymorphed
into another form using wild shape, you gain resistance
5 to fire.
HEALING TRANSFORMATION [one-action]
FEAT 10
DRUID
METAMAGIC
You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close
wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a
non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature,
your polymorph spell also restores 1d6 Hit Points per spell
level to that creature. This is a healing effect.
OVERWHELMING ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 10
DRUID
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
With a complex gesture, you call upon the primal power
of your spell to overcome enemies’ resistances. If the next
action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount
of the target’s resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic
damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the
spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused

Your connection to nature is particularly strong, and the
spirits of nature flock around you, helping you replenish your

form (typically humanoid for a PC, but also possibly animal or
fungus). You can change from a form that looks mostly like
your old self into a tree or any other non-creature plant as
a single action, which has the concentrate trait. This has the
same effect as tree shape, except you can turn into any kind of
non-creature plant and your AC is 30.
If you rest for 10 minutes while transformed into a non-
creature plant during daylight hours under direct sunlight,
you recover half your maximum Hit Points. If you take your
daily rest in this way, the rest restores you to maximum Hit

PAGE 142
================================================================================

During combat encounters...
You strike with unmatched accuracy and use specialized combat techniques. A melee
fighter stands between allies and enemies, attacking foes who try to get past. A
ranged fighter delivers precise shots from a distance.
During social encounters...
You can be an intimidating presence. This can be useful when negotiating with
enemies, but is sometimes a liability in more genteel interactions.
While exploring...
You keep up your defenses in preparation for combat, and keep an eye out for
hidden threats. You also overcome physical challenges in your way, breaking down
doors, lifting obstacles, climbing adeptly, and leaping across pits.
In downtime...
You might perform manual labor or craft and repair armaments. If you know
techniques you no longer favor, you might train yourself in new ones. If you’ve
established your reputation, you might build an organization or a stronghold of
your own.
You Might...
•	 Know the purpose and quality of every weapon and piece of armor you own.
•	 Recognize that the danger of an adventurer’s life must be balanced out with great
revelry or ambitious works.
•	 Have little patience for puzzles or problems that require detailed logic or study.
Others Probably...
•	 Find you intimidating until they get to know you—and maybe even after they get
to know you.
•	 Expect you’re all brawn and no brains.
•	 Respect your expertise in the art of warfare and value your opinion on the quality
of armaments.
Fighter
Fighting for honor, greed, loyalty, or simply the thrill of battle, you are an
undisputed master of weaponry and combat techniques. You combine your
actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and
counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you
are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills
into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies.
Initial Proficiencies

listed proficiency ranks in
the following statistics. You

not listed unless you gain a
better proficiency rank in some
other way.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a fighter. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Attack of Opportunity
Ever watchful for weaknesses, you can quickly attack
foes that leave an opening in their defenses. You gain the
Attack of Opportunity reaction.
ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY [reaction]
Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action
or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square
during a move action it’s using.
You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike
against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and
the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.
This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty,
and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.
Fighter Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a fighter class feat. Fighter class feats are described
beginning on page 144.
Shield Block
You gain the Shield Block general feat (found on page
266), a reaction that lets you reduce damage with
your shield.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
Bravery
3rd
Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you
have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and
keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves
increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save
against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition,
reduce its value by 1.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many fighter
class features.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.
Open: These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in
the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action
with the open trait only if you haven’t used an action with
the attack or open trait yet this turn.
Press: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up
earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be
used only if you are currently affected by a multiple
attack penalty.
Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect
on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don’t
apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds,
you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For
example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals
no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action
requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when
it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that
you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance,
whichever comes first. After you take an action with the
stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use
the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the
feats’ prerequisites.
Armor Mastery 

Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your
proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored
defense, increase to master.
Versatile Legend 
19th
You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon. Your proficiency ranks for simple
weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to legendary, and your
proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to master. Your proficiency rank
for your fighter class DC increases to master.
Fighter Feats
At each level that you gain a fighter feat, you can select one of the following feats.
You must satisfy any prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
DOUBLE SLICE [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.
You lash out at your foe with both weapons. Make two Strikes, one with each of your two
melee weapons, each using your current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have
the same target. If the second Strike is made with a weapon that doesn’t have the agile trait,
it takes a –2 penalty.
If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects
from both weapons. You add any precision damage only once, to the attack of your choice.
Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once.
This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
EXACTING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
PRESS
You make a controlled attack, fully accounting for your momentum. Make a Strike. The
Strike gains the following failure effect.
Failure This attack does not count toward your multiple attack penalty.
POINT-BLANK SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
OPEN
STANCE
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon.
You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. When using a ranged volley weapon while
you are in this stance, you don’t take the penalty to your attack rolls from the volley trait.
When using a ranged weapon that doesn’t have the volley trait, you gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to damage rolls on attacks against targets within the weapon’s first range increment.
POWER ATTACK [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit
unsteady. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple
attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least
10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to
three extra dice.

REACTIVE SHIELD [reaction]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Trigger An enemy hits you with a melee Strike.
Requirements You are wielding a shield.
You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the
last second. You immediately use the Raise a Shield action and gain your shield’s bonus to
AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you’re determining
the outcome of the triggering attack.
SNAGGING STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
Requirements You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
You combine an attack with quick grappling moves to throw an enemy off balance as long
as it stays in your reach. Make a Strike while keeping one hand free. If this
Strike hits, the target is flat-footed until the start of your next turn or until
it’s no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
SUDDEN CHARGE [two-actions]
FEAT 1
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
OPEN
With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If you
end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a
melee Strike against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing,
Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.
2ND LEVEL
AGGRESSIVE BLOCK [free-action]
FEAT 2
FIGHTER
Trigger You use the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent
that triggered Shield Block is adjacent to you and is your
size or smaller.
You push back as you block the attack, knocking your
foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push
the triggering creature, either automatically Shoving it 5
feet or causing it to become flat-footed until the start of
your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether
to be moved or become flat-footed. If it chooses to be
moved, you choose the direction. If the Shove would
cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult
terrain, or enter another creature’s space, it must
become flat-footed instead of being moved.
ASSISTING SHOT [one-action]
FEAT 2
FIGHTER
With a quick shot, you interfere with a foe in combat.
You can use the Aid action with a ranged weapon you
wield. Instead of being within reach of the target,
you must be within maximum range of the target. An
Assisting Shot uses ammunition and incurs penalties
just like any other attack.

FEAT 4
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
Requirements You are wielding a one-handed melee weapon
and have a free hand.
You snap your free hand over to grip your weapon just long
enough to add momentum and deliver a more powerful
blow to your opponent. Make a Strike with the required
weapon. You quickly switch your grip during the Strike in
order to make the attack with two hands. If the weapon
doesn’t normally have the two-hand trait, increase its
weapon damage die by one step for this attack. (Rules on
increasing die size appear on page 279.) If the weapon has
the two-hand trait, you gain the benefit of that trait and
a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the weapon’s
number of damage dice. When the Strike is complete, you
resume gripping the weapon with only one hand. This action
doesn’t end any stance or fighter feat effect that requires
you to have one hand free.
KNOCKDOWN [two-actions]
FEAT 4
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You make an attack to knock a foe off balance, then follow
up immediately with a sweep to topple them. Make a
melee Strike. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt
an Athletics check to Trip the creature you hit. If you’re
wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you can ignore Trip’s
requirement that you have a hand free. Both attacks count
toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn’t
increase until after you’ve made both of them.
POWERFUL SHOVE
FEAT 4
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Aggressive Block or Brutish Shove
You can push larger foes around with your attack. You can use
Aggressive Block or Brutish Shove against a creature up to
two sizes larger than you.
When a creature you Shove has to stop moving because it
would hit an object, it takes damage equal to your Strength
modifier (minimum 1). This happens regardless of how you
Shoved the creature.
QUICK REVERSAL [one-action]
FEAT 4
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
PRESS
Requirements You are flanked by at least two enemies.
You turn your foes’ flanking against them with a quick
reverse. Make a melee Strike against one of the flanking

of the initial attack and doesn’t count toward your multiple
attack penalty.
SHIELDED STRIDE

FIGHTER
When your shield is up, your enemies’ blows can’t touch you.
opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a
Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target
that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until
the end of your current turn, and you can automatically
Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action
(including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a
critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement
doesn’t trigger reactions.
This Strike has the following failure effect.
Failure The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your
current turn.

FEAT 2
FIGHTER
PRESS
Requirements You have one hand free, and your target is
within reach of that hand.

FIGHTER
Requirements You are wielding only a single one-handed
melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
You can parry attacks against you with your one-handed
weapon. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the

the requirements.
INTIMIDATING STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 2
EMOTION
FEAR
FIGHTER
MENTAL
Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their
confidence. Make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage,
the target is frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit.
LUNGE [one-action]
FEAT 2
FIGHTER
Requirement You are wielding a melee weapon.
Extending your body to its limits, you attack an enemy that
would normally be beyond your reach. Make a Strike with a
melee weapon, increasing your reach by 5 feet for that Strike.
If the weapon has the disarm, shove, or trip trait, you can use
the corresponding action instead of a Strike.
4TH LEVEL
DOUBLE SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 4
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon with reload 0.
You shoot twice in blindingly fast succession. Make two
Strikes, each against a separate target and with a –2 penalty.
Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but
the penalty doesn’t increase until after you’ve made both
of them.
Core Rulebook
146

PAGE 148
================================================================================

When you have your shield raised, you can Stride to
move half your Speed without triggering reactions that
are triggered by your movement (such as Attacks of
Opportunity). You can use Shielded Stride while Flying or

movement type.
SWIPE [two-actions]
FEAT 4
FIGHTER

You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a melee Strike and
compare the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes,
each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent

multiple attack penalty.
If you’re using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier
applies to all your Swipe attacks.
TWIN PARRY [one-action]
FEAT 4
FIGHTER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, one in
each hand.
You use your two weapons to parry attacks. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn,
or a +2 circumstance bonus if either weapon has the parry
trait. You lose this circumstance bonus if you no longer meet
this feat’s requirement.
6TH LEVEL
ADVANCED WEAPON TRAINING 
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
You’ve studied the art of wielding an advanced weapon.
Choose a weapon group. You gain proficiency with all advanced
weapons in that group as if they were martial weapons of
their weapon group.
ADVANTAGEOUS ASSAULT [one-action]
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
PRESS
When an enemy’s movement is compromised, you deliver a
more deadly blow. Make a Strike against a creature that is
grabbed, prone, or restrained. You gain a circumstance bonus
to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon
damage dice, or that number + 2 if you’re wielding the weapon
in two hands. The Strike gains the following failure effect.
Failure You deal damage to the target equal to the number of
weapon damage dice, or that number + 2 if you’re wielding
the weapon in two hands. This damage has the same
damage type as the weapon.

You adopt a fencing stance that improves your control over
your weapon. While you are in this stance, you gain a +1

+2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending
against checks to Disarm you. In addition, you can attempt to
Disarm creatures up to two sizes larger than you.
FURIOUS FOCUS 
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Power Attack
You’ve learned to maintain your balance even when swinging
furiously. When you make a Power Attack with a melee
weapon you’re wielding in two hands, it counts as one attack
toward your multiple attack penalty instead of two.
GUARDIAN’S DEFLECTION [reaction]
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
Trigger An ally within your melee reach is hit by an attack,
you can see the attacker, and the ally gaining a +2
circumstance bonus to AC would turn the critical hit
into a hit or the hit into a miss.
Requirements You are wielding a single one-handed
melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.
You use your weapon to deflect the attack against your ally,
granting a +2 circumstance bonus to their Armor Class against
the triggering attack. This turns the triggering critical hit into
a hit, or the triggering hit into a miss.
REFLEXIVE SHIELD
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
You can use your shield to fend off the worst of area effects
and other damage. When you Raise your Shield, you gain
your shield’s circumstance bonus to Reflex saves. If you have
the Shield Block reaction, damage you take as a result of a
Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn’t
physical damage.
REVEALING STAB [two-actions]
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon that deals
piercing damage.
You drive your piercing weapon into an imperceptible foe,
revealing its location to your allies. Make a Strike with the
required melee weapon. You don’t have to attempt a flat check
to hit a concealed creature, and you have to succeed at only a
DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature. If you hit and deal
damage, you can drive the required weapon into a corporeal
target, revealing its current position. You Release the weapon,
and it becomes lodged in the target. If the target is concealed,
other creatures don’t need to succeed at a flat check to hit
it. If the target is hidden, other creatures have to succeed at
only a DC 5 flat check to target it. The creatures need to be
able to see your weapon to gain any of these benefits, and
the target can’t become undetected to anyone who sees your
weapon. If the target is invisible, the weapon remains visible
while lodged in it.
BULLY
Using a two-handed weapon, you push your foes
about the battlefield and deal grievous wounds. You
excel at taking down the biggest enemy standing in
your way.

SHATTER DEFENSES [one-action]
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
PRESS
Requirements A frightened creature is in your melee reach.
Your offense exploits your enemy’s fear. Make a melee Strike
against a frightened creature. If you hit and deal damage, the
target becomes flat-footed until its frightened condition ends.

it with this Strike, it can’t reduce its frightened value below 1
until the start of your next turn.
SHIELD WARDEN
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
Prerequisites shield block
You use your shield to protect your allies. When you have a
shield raised, you can use your Shield Block reaction when
an attack is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do,
the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of
preventing you from taking damage, following the normal
rules for Shield Block.
TRIPLE SHOT
FEAT 6
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Double Shot
You can quickly fire multiple shots with greater control. When
you use Double Shot, you can make the attacks against the
same target. You can add an additional action to Double Shot

penalty, but the penalty doesn’t increase until after you’ve
made all of them.
8TH LEVEL
BLIND-FIGHT
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
Prerequisites master in Perception
Your battle instincts make you more aware of concealed
and invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat
check to target concealed creatures. You’re not flat-footed
to creatures that are hidden from you (unless you’re flat-
footed to them for reasons other than the hidden condition),
and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a
hidden creature.

level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
DUELING RIPOSTE [reaction]
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Dueling Parry

against you.
Requirements You are benefiting from Dueling Parry.
You riposte against your flailing enemy. Make a melee Strike
against or attempt to Disarm the triggering creature.
FELLING STRIKE [two-actions]
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
Your attack can ground an airborne foe. Make a Strike. If it
hits and deals damage to a flying target, the target falls up to
120 feet. The fall is gradual enough that if it causes the target
to hit the ground, the target takes no damage from the fall. If
the attack is a critical hit, the target can’t Fly, Leap, levitate,
or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
INCREDIBLE AIM [two-actions]
FEAT 8
CONCENTRATE
FIGHTER
By spending a moment to focus, you can ensure your attack
strikes true. Make a ranged weapon Strike. On this Strike, you
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the
target’s concealed condition.
MOBILE SHOT STANCE [one-action]
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
STANCE
Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you’re in this
stance, your ranged Strikes don’t trigger Attacks of Opportunity
or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.
If you have Attack of Opportunity, you can use it with a
loaded ranged weapon you’re wielding. The triggering creature
must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
POSITIONING ASSAULT [two-actions]
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
FLOURISH
Requirements You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon
and your target is within your reach.
With punishing blows, you force your opponent into position.
Make a Strike with the required weapon. If you hit, you move
the target 5 feet into a space in your reach. This follows the
forced movement rules found on page 475.
QUICK SHIELD BLOCK 
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
Prerequisites shield block, Reactive Shield
You can bring your shield into place with hardly a thought. At
the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction
that you can use only to Shield Block.
SUDDEN LEAP [two-actions]
FEAT 8
FIGHTER
You make an impressive leap and swing while you soar. Make
a Leap, High Jump, or Long Jump and attempt one melee Strike
at any point during your jump. Immediately after the Strike,
you fall to the ground if you’re in the air, even if you haven’t
reached the maximum distance of your jump. If the distance
you fall is no more than the height of your jump, you take no
damage and land upright.
When attempting a High Jump or Long Jump during a
Sudden Leap, determine the DC using the Long Jump DCs, and
increase your maximum distance to double your Speed.

from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, in addition
to weapon damage dice.)
COMBAT REFLEXES
FEAT 10

SPRING ATTACK [one-action]
FEAT 12
FIGHTER
PRESS
Requirements You are adjacent to an enemy.
Springing away from one foe, you Strike at another. Stride up
to your Speed, but you must end that movement within melee
reach of a different enemy. At the end of your movement,
make a melee Strike against an enemy now within reach. You

FIGHTER
Trigger You complete the last action on your turn, and your

DETERMINATION [one-action]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
FIGHTER
Frequency once per day
Your training allows you to shrug off your foes’ spells
and conditions when the need is dire. Choose a single
nonpermanent spell or condition that is affecting you. If you
chose a condition, its effect on you ends. If you chose a spell,
attempt to counteract the spell (your level is your counteract
level, and you attempt a Will save as your counteract check).
This doesn’t remove any Hit Point damage normally
dealt by the spell or condition, and it doesn’t prevent the
spell or debilitating effect from affecting other allies or the
environment around you. It can’t remove an ongoing affliction
or prevent such an affliction from inflicting conditions on you
later. It can’t remove conditions from the situation (such as
prone or flanked). If the effect comes from a creature, hazard,
or item of 20th level or higher, Determination can’t remove its
effect on you.

GRACEFUL POISE [one-action]
FEAT 16
FIGHTER
STANCE
Prerequisites Double Slice

like a scorpion’s stinger. While you are in this stance, if you
make your second Strike from Double Slice with an agile
weapon, Double Slice counts as one attack when calculating
your multiple attack penalty.
IMPROVED REFLEXIVE SHIELD
FEAT 16
FIGHTER
Prerequisites Reflexive Shield

but do not increase your penalty until you have made all
your attacks.
SAVAGE CRITICAL
FEAT 18
FIGHTER
The wounds you inflict are grievous. When you Strike with
a weapon or unarmed attack for which you have legendary
proficiency, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die as
long as that result is a success. This has no effect on a 19 if the
result would be a failure.
20TH LEVEL
BOUNDLESS REPRISALS

Monk
During combat encounters...
You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers.
You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding
specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let
you change up your combat style for different situations, and ki abilities allow you
to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air.
During social encounters...
Your perceptiveness lets you see through falsehoods, and your philosophical training
provides insight into any situation.
While exploring...
You climb up walls, dodge traps, overcome obstacles, and leap over pits. You usually
stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you’re
well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily.
In downtime...
You diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies.
You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect.
You Might...
•	 Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation.
•	 Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or
succumbing to despair.
•	 Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace with your
present self.
Others Probably...
•	 Marvel at your feats of physical prowess.
•	 Think you’re more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets.
•	 Come to you for philosophical advice.
The strength of your fist flows from your mind and spirit. You seek
perfection—honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into
an orderly bastion of wisdom. You’re a fierce combatant renowned for martial
arts skills and combat stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge
of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating
on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a monk. Abilities gained at higher
levels list the requisite levels next to the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies representing
your basic training, which are noted at the start of this class.
Flurry of Blows
You can attack rapidly with fists, feet, elbows, knees, and
other unarmed attacks. You gain the Flurry of Blows action.
FLURRY OF BLOWS [one-action]
FLOURISH
MONK
Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature,
combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and
weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes
normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of
Blows only once per turn.
Monk Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a monk class feat.
Powerful Fist
You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons.
The damage die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of
1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance penalty when
making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks,
because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly
force. You don’t take this penalty when making a lethal
attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats are listed in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Incredible Movement
3rd
You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status
bonus to your Speed whenever you’re not wearing armor.
The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have
beyond 3rd.
Mystic Strikes
3rd
Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues
them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks
become magical, allowing them to get past resistances
to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item
such as handwraps of mighty fists to gain an item bonus to
attack rolls or increase your attacks’ weapon damage dice.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability

expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
Metal Strikes
9th
You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks

unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver.
This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of
supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.

to expert. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for

the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.
Graceful Mastery
13th
You move with perpetual grace in battle, eluding and
turning aside blows. Your proficiency rank for unarmored
defense increases to master.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many monk abilities.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.
You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.
Incapacitation: An ability with this trait can take a
character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation
effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce
the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and
that creature improves the degree of success of its saving
throws for that effect by one step.
Ki Spells: By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve
called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant
you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus
spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you
gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus
Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations,
and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using
the Refocus activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.
When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki
spells are divine spells or occult spells. You become trained
in spell attacks and spell DCs of that tradition.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus
spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your
focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules
for focus spells appear on page 300.
Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you
enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that
you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get
knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated,
until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance,
whichever comes first. After you take an action that has
the stance trait, you can’t take another one for 1 round. You
can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the
forceful, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.
While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 status bonus to
AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against

the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could
champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts,
haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and
are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a ranger. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Hunt Prey
When you focus your attention on a single foe, you become
unstoppable in your pursuit. You gain the Hunt Prey action.
HUNT PREY [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
RANGER
You designate a single creature as your prey and focus your
attacks against that creature. You must be able to see or hear
the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks
when you Seek your prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to
Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also ignore the
penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range
increment against the prey you’re hunting.
You can have only one creature designated as your prey
at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you
already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses
the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your
designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
Hunter’s Edge
You have trained for countless hours to become a more
skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an additional benefit
when you Hunt Prey depending on the focus of your
training. Choose a hunter’s edge.
Flurry: You have trained to unleash a devastating flurry
of attacks upon your prey. Your multiple attack penalty
for attacks against your hunted prey is –3 (–2 with an
agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn instead
of –5, and –6 (–4 with an agile weapon) on your third or
subsequent attack of the turn, instead of –10.
Precision: You have trained to aim for your prey’s weak
points. The first time you hit your hunted prey in a round,
you also deal 1d8 additional precision damage. (Precision
damage increases the damage you already deal, using the
same type, but is ineffective against creatures that lack vital
organs or weak points.) At 11th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8 precision damage, and at 19th level, the
extra damage increases to 3d8 precision damage.
Outwit: You are talented at outwitting and evading
your prey. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception
checks, Intimidation checks, Stealth checks, and any checks
to Recall Knowledge about the prey, and a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC against your prey’s attacks.
Ranger Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a ranger
class feat. Ranger feats are listed beginning on page 170.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Iron Will
3rd
Your training has hardened your resolve. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to expert.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill, or become an expert in one skill in
which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in
your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Trackless Step
5th
When you move through natural terrains, you are difficult
to track. You always gain the benefits of the Cover Tracks
action in such terrains, without moving at half your Speed.
Weapon Expertise
5th
You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of
your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and
martial weapons increases to expert. You gain access to
the critical specialization effects of all simple and martial
weapons when attacking your hunted prey.
Evasion
7th
You’ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions,
dragons’ breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success
on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.
Vigilant Senses
7th
Through your adventuring, you’ve developed keen
awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank
for Perception increases to master.
Weapon Specialization
7th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with
weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.
This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if
you’re legendary.
Nature’s Edge
9th
You always find the weak points in your foes’ defenses when
they’re on unfavorable terrain. Enemies are flat-footed to
you if they’re in natural difficult terrain, on natural uneven
ground, or in difficult terrain resulting from a snare.
Ranger Expertise
9th
You’ve practiced your techniques to make them harder
to resist. Your proficiency rank for your ranger class DC
increases to expert.
Juggernaut
11th
Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and
resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude
saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a
Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
Medium Armor Expertise
11th
You’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks.
Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor,
and unarmored defense increase to expert.
Wild Stride
11th
You move quickly through obstacles, whether they’re
tumbled stone, tangled undergrowth, or sucking mud.
You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult
terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also
lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain
as those of difficult terrain.
Weapon Mastery
13th
You fully understand the intricacies of your weapons.
Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons
increase to master.
Greater Weapon Specialization
15th
Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an
expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see these key terms in many ranger class features.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait
per turn.
Open: These maneuvers work only as the first salvo in
the attacks you make on your turn. You can use an action
with the open trait only if you haven’t used an action
with the attack or open trait yet this turn.
Press: Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier
attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if
you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty.
Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect
on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don’t
apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds,
you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For
example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals
no damage due to resistance.) Because a press action
requires a multiple attack penalty, you can’t use one when
it’s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.

Improved Evasion

to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead.
When you fail a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
Incredible Senses

You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to legendary.
Masterful Hunter
17th
You have honed your abilities as a hunter to incredible levels. Your proficiency rank
for your ranger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon that you
have master proficiency in, you can ignore the penalty if attacking your hunted prey
within the weapon’s second and third range increments.
If you have master proficiency in Perception, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks when you Seek your prey, and if you have master proficiency in
Survival, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey.
You also gain an additional benefit depending on your hunter’s edge.
Flurry: You can blend your weapon mastery with skillful targeting to make a
series of precise attacks. If you have master proficiency with your weapon, your
multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is –2 (–1 with an agile
weapon) on your second attack of the turn, and –4 (–2 with an agile weapon) on
your third and subsequent attacks of the turn.
Precision: Your weapon mastery allows you to hit your prey’s vital areas multiple
times. The second time in a round you hit your hunted prey, you also deal 1d8
precision damage. At 19th level, your second hit in a round against your hunted prey
deals 2d8 precision damage, and your third hit in a round against your hunted prey
deals 1d8 precision damage.
Outwit: Your mastery of skills allows you to overwhelm your prey. If you have
master proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, or the skill you use to Recall
Knowledge about your prey, increase the circumstance bonus against the prey with
that skill from +2 to +4. If you have master proficiency with your armor, increase the
circumstance bonus to AC against the prey from +1 to +2.
Second Skin
19th
Your armor has become akin to a second skin for you. Your proficiency ranks
for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When

you to make a melee weapon Strike to instead make a ranged
weapon Strike. You must be Striking an adjacent target. If
necessary for the reaction’s trigger, you treat your ranged
weapon as if it had a reach of 5 feet. If the reaction has other
requirements, such as wielding a specific kind of weapon, Snap
Shot doesn’t allow you to ignore them; it allows you only to
replace a melee weapon Strike with a ranged weapon Strike.
SWIFT TRACKER
FEAT 6
RANGER
Prerequisites expert in Survival, Experienced Tracker

an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee Strike or use a
Disarm action against the triggering opponent.
WARDEN’S STEP
FEAT 10
RANGER
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You can guide your allies to move quietly through the
wilderness. When you Sneak during exploration in natural
terrain, you can designate any number of your allies to gain
the benefits as if they were using that activity during that
exploration. This requires no action on their part.
12TH LEVEL
DISTRACTING SHOT
FEAT 12
RANGER
The sheer power of your attacks, or the overwhelming number
of them, leaves an enemy flustered. If you critically hit your
hunted prey with a ranged weapon, or hit it at least twice on
the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until the
start of your next turn.
DOUBLE PREY
FEAT 12
RANGER
You can focus on two foes at once, hunting both of them down.
When you use the Hunt Prey action, you can pick two creatures
as your prey.
LIGHTNING SNARES
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites master in Crafting, Snare Specialist
You can rig a trap with incredible speed. When you create a
snare that normally takes 1 minute to Craft, you can Craft it
using a single Interact action instead.
SECOND STING [one-action]
FEAT 12
PRESS
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a
different hand.
You read your prey’s movements and transform them into
openings, so failures with one weapon set up glancing blows
with the other. Make a melee Strike with one of the required
weapons against your hunted prey. The Strike gains the
following failure effect.
Failure You deal the damage the other required weapon would
have dealt on a hit, excluding all damage dice. (This removes
dice from weapon runes, spells, and special abilities, not
just weapon damage dice.)
SIDE BY SIDE
FEAT 12
RANGER
Prerequisites an animal companion
You and your animal companion fight in tandem, distracting
your foes and keeping them off balance. Whenever you and
your animal companion are adjacent to the same foe, you are
both flanking that foe with each other, regardless of your
actual positions.
14TH LEVEL
SENSE THE UNSEEN [reaction]
FEAT 14
RANGER
Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you can catch even the slightest
cues, such as their minute movements or the shifting of
air currents on your skin. Even though you failed at the
triggering check, you automatically sense any undetected
creatures in the area where you’re Seeking, making them
merely hidden to you.
SHARED PREY
FEAT 14
RANGER
Prerequisites Double Prey, Warden’s Boon
Hunting as a duo, you and your ally both single out your prey.
When you use Hunt Prey and select only one prey, you can
grant your Hunt Prey benefits and hunter’s edge to an ally
in addition to gaining them yourself. The ally retains these
benefits until you use Hunt Prey again.

SAMPLE RANGER
STEALTHY COMPANION
FEAT 14
RANGER
Prerequisites Camouflage
You’ve trained your animal companion to blend in to its
surroundings. Your animal companion gains the benefit of the

FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
PRESS
RANGER
Prerequisites Hunter’s Aim

ignore the target’s concealed condition and all cover.
WARDEN’S GUIDANCE
FEAT 14
RANGER
You can convey your prey’s location to your allies, no matter
how well hidden it is. As long as your hunted prey is observed
by you, all your allies who roll failures and critical failures
when Seeking it get a success instead. Your allies need to be
able to see or hear you to gain this benefit. You have to be able
to call out or use gestures for your allies to get this benefit.
16TH LEVEL
GREATER DISTRACTING SHOT
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites Distracting Shot
Even a single missile can throw off your enemy’s balance, and
more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit
your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it’s flat-footed until
the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit
it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it’s flat‑footed
until the end of your next turn instead.
IMPROVED TWIN RIPOSTE
FEAT 16
RANGER
At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional
reaction that you can use only to perform a Twin Riposte
against your hunted prey. You can use this extra reaction even
if you are not benefiting from Twin Parry.
LEGENDARY MONSTER HUNTER
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites legendary in Nature, Master Monster Hunter
Your knowledge of monsters is so incredible that it reveals
glaring flaws in your prey. Your bonus from Monster Hunter
(and the bonus from Monster Warden if you have it) increases
from +1 to +2 for you and any allies who benefit.

FEAT 16
RANGER

UBIQUITOUS SNARES
FEAT 16
RANGER
Prerequisites Snare Specialist
You can prepare a seemingly impossible number of snares in
advance, and you’re ready to spring them on unsuspecting foes.
Double the number of prepared snares from Snare Specialist.
18TH LEVEL
IMPOSSIBLE FLURRY [three-actions]
FEAT 18
FLOURISH
OPEN
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a
different hand.

these Strikes take the maximum multiple attack penalty, as if
you had already made two or more attacks this turn.
IMPOSSIBLE VOLLEY [three-actions]
FEAT 18
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding a ranged weapon with the
volley trait and reload 0.
You fire a volley at all foes in an area. Make one Strike with a
–2 penalty against each enemy within a 10-foot-radius burst
centered at or beyond your weapon’s volley range. Roll the
damage only once for all targets.
Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty,
but do not increase your penalty until you have made all
your attacks.
MANIFOLD EDGE
FEAT 18
RANGER
Prerequisites hunter’s edge, masterful hunter
You’ve learned every possible edge to use against your foes.
When you use Hunt Prey, you can gain a hunter’s edge benefit
other than the one you selected at 1st level. If you do, you
don’t gain the additional benefit from masterful hunter.
MASTERFUL COMPANION
FEAT 18
RANGER
Prerequisites masterful hunter, Animal Companion
Your animal companion shares your incredible hunting skills,
allowing it to take down your shared prey with ease. When
you Hunt Prey, your animal companion gains the masterful
hunter benefit associated with your hunter’s edge, rather than
just your original hunter’s edge benefit.
PERFECT SHOT [three-actions]
FEAT 18
FLOURISH
RANGER
Requirements You are wielding a loaded ranged weapon with
reload 1 or more, and you have not reloaded your weapon
since your last turn.
After watching the motions of combat with incredible intensity
and precision, you fire at your prey at the perfect moment to
deliver maximum pain. Make a ranged Strike with the required
weapon against your hunted prey. If you hit, the Strike deals
maximum damage. After the Strike, your turn ends.
SHADOW HUNTER
FEAT 18
RANGER
Prerequisites Camouflage
You blend in to your surroundings so well that others have
trouble telling you apart from the terrain. While in natural
terrain, you’re always concealed from all foes if you choose to

LEGENDARY SHOT
FEAT 20
RANGER
Prerequisites masterful hunter, legendary in Perception, Far Shot
You focus on your hunted prey, perceiving angles, air
resistance, and every variable that would affect your ranged
attack. If you have master proficiency with your ranged
weapon, you can ignore the penalty for attacking up to five
range increments away when attacking your hunted prey.
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
FEAT 20
RANGER
Prerequisites legendary in Survival
Your ability to track your prey has surpassed explanation,
allowing you to trace your prey’s movements and predict its
location with ease. When you use Hunt Prey on a creature
within 100 feet, you can follow that creature’s movements,
allowing you to know the creature’s exact location no matter
how far away it becomes, as long as it remains your prey. You
must be legendary in Nature to track your prey’s location across
teleportation or planar travel. This feat gains the detection,
divination, and primal traits if you’re legendary in Nature.
TRIPLE THREAT
FEAT 20
RANGER
Prerequisites Shared Prey
You can divide your attention three ways when hunting. When
you use Hunt Prey, you can designate three creatures as prey,

ally (as Shared Prey), or designate one creature as prey and
share the effect with two allies.
ULTIMATE SKIRMISHER
FEAT 20
RANGER
Prerequisites wild stride
You are so skilled at navigating the wild, your movement is
completely unaffected by terrain. You ignore the effects of
all difficult terrain, greater difficult terrain, and hazardous
terrain, and you don’t trigger traps and hazards that are
triggered by moving into an area (such as trip wires and
pressure plates), unless you want to.

================================================================================

Rogue
During combat encounters...
You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision
instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against
rank-and-file soldiers.
During social encounters...
Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and
ferreting out information are second nature to you.
While exploring...
You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset,
since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers.
In downtime...
You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a
thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own.
You Might...
•	 Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world.
•	 Know where to attain illicit goods.
•	 Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code.
Others Probably...
•	 Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to
trust you.
•	 Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use
questionable methods.
•	 Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.
You are skilled and opportunistic­. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions,
you take advantage of your opponents’ missteps and strike where it hurts
most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and
likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of
every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is
the breadth and depth of your skills.

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a rogue. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the level at which you gain them next to
the features’ names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level,
you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Rogue’s Racket
As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to
develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities.
Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way
you approach a job, while building your reputation in the
criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client
with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a
particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in
order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue’s racket. The
rackets presented in this book are as follows.
Ruffian
You prefer to strong-arm or intimidate others rather than
rely on finesse or fancy tricks. You might be an enforcer for
organized crime, a highway bandit, or a noble who bullies
others with threats of your family’s power. Or, you might
use your skills on the up and up, in a private security detail
or as a guard in a city with the right temperament.
You use whatever tools you have at hand to get the job
done. You can deal sneak attack damage with any simple
weapon, in addition to the weapons listed in the sneak
attack class feature. When you critically succeed at an
attack roll using a simple weapon and the target has the
flat-footed condition (unable to focus on defending itself),
you also apply the critical specialization effect for the
weapon you’re wielding (page 283). You don’t gain these
benefits if the weapon has a damage die larger than d8
(after applying any abilities that alter its damage die size).
You’re trained in Intimidation and medium armor. You
can choose Strength as your key ability score. When you
gain light armor expertise, you also gain expert proficiency
in medium armor, and when you gain light armor mastery,
you also gain master proficiency in medium armor.
Scoundrel
You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid
danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter
or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story
or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable
professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician.
When you successfully Feint (page 246), the target is
flat-footed against melee attacks you attempt against it
until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the
target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end
of your next turn, not just yours.
You’re trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can
choose Charisma as your key ability score.
Thief
Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs
to someone else, especially if you can do so completely
unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets,
a cat burglar sneaking through windows and escaping via
rooftops, or a safecracker breaking into carefully guarded
vaults. You might even work as a consultant, testing
clients’ defenses by trying to steal something precious.
When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight
weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack
with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity
modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.
You are trained in Thievery.

================================================================================

Sneak Attack
When your enemy can’t properly defend itself, you take
advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature
that has the flat-footed condition (page 620) with an
agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed
attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6
precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown
melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.
As your rogue level increases, so does the number of
damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number
of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.
Surprise Attack
You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On
the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth
for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted are flat-footed
to you.
Rogue Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
rogue class feat.
Skill Feats
You gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level
and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats
can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.
Skill Increases
2nd
You gain more skill increases than members of other
classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use this increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to become an
expert in one skill in which you’re already trained.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
Deny Advantage
3rd
As someone who takes advantage of others’ defenses,
you are careful not to leave such openings yourself.
You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking
creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level
or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still
help their allies flank.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many rogue
class features.
Debilitation: Debilitations apply conditions and other
negative effects to a creature. When the creature is
affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was
affected by ends.
Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques
that require too much exertion for you to perform
frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish
trait per turn.

weapon or any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical
specialization effect for the weapon you’re wielding.

SAMPLE ROGUE
MINOR MAGIC
FEAT 2
ROGUE
You’ve dabbled in a variety of tricks, gaining minor magical
abilities from a particular tradition. Choose arcane, divine,
occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the
common cantrips available to that tradition.
MOBILITY
FEAT 2
ROGUE
You move in a way that denies your enemies the opportunity
to retaliate. When you take a Stride action to move half your
Speed or less, that movement does not trigger reactions. You
can use Mobility when Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead
of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
QUICK DRAW [one-action]
FEAT 2
ROGUE
You draw your weapon and attack with the same motion. You
Interact to draw a weapon, then Strike with that weapon.
UNBALANCING BLOW
FEAT 2
ROGUE
Prerequisites thief racket
Interweaving your most powerful attacks in a graceful flow,
you temporarily unbalance your foes. Whenever your Strike is
a critical hit and deals damage, the target is flat‑footed against
your attacks until the end of your next turn.
4TH LEVEL
BATTLE ASSESSMENT [one-action]
FEAT 4
ROGUE
SECRET
With careful observation during battle, you identify an
enemy’s strengths and weaknesses. The GM rolls a secret
Perception check for you against the Deception or Stealth DC
(whichever is higher) of an enemy of your choice who is not
concealed from you, hidden from you, or undetected by you,
and who is engaged in combat. The GM might apply a penalty
for the distance between you and the enemy. The enemy is
then temporarily immune to your Battle Assessment for 1 day.
Critical Success The GM chooses two of the following pieces
of information about the enemy to tell you: which of the
enemy’s weaknesses is highest, which of the enemy’s
saving throws has the lowest modifier, one immunity the
enemy has, or which of the enemy’s resistances is highest.
If the event of a tie, the GM should pick one at random.
Success The GM chooses one piece of information from the
above list to tell you about the enemy.
Critical Failure The GM gives you false information (the GM
makes up the information).
DREAD STRIKER
FEAT 4
ROGUE
You capitalize on your enemies’ fear to slip past their defenses.
Any creature that has the frightened condition is also
flat-footed against your attacks.
SCOUNDREL
Your attacks are made deadly through distraction.
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Dexterity, plus Charisma to improve your feints.

REACTIVE PURSUIT [[reaction]
FEAT 4
ROGUE
Trigger An adjacent foe moves away from you, and you can reach
at least one space adjacent to the foe with a Stride action.
You keep pace with a retreating foe. You Stride, but you must
end your movement adjacent to the triggering enemy. Your
move does not trigger reactions from the triggering enemy. You
can use Reactive Pursuit to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead
of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
SABOTAGE [one-action]
FEAT 4
INCAPACITATION
ROGUE
Requirements You have a free hand.
You subtly damage others’ equipment. Choose one item that a
creature within your reach wields or carries. The item must have
moving parts that you could possibly sabotage (a shortbow
could be sabotaged, but a longsword could not). Attempt a
Thievery check against the Reflex DC of the creature. Damage
dealt by Sabotage can’t take the item below its Break Threshold.
Critical Success You deal damage equal to four times your
Thievery proficiency bonus.
Success You deal damage equal to double your Thievery
proficiency bonus.
Critical Failure Temporarily immune to your Sabotage for 1 day.
MAGICAL TRICKSTER
FEAT 4
ROGUE
Whether you’re using magic items, wielding innate magic,
or dabbling in spellcasting, you can sneak spells past your
foes’ defenses as easily as any blade. When you succeed at
a spell attack roll against a flat-footed foe’s AC and the spell
deals damage, you can add your sneak attack damage to the
damage roll. If your single spell leads to multiple separate
damage rolls, apply your sneak attack damage only once
per target.
POISON WEAPON [one-action]
FEAT 4
MANIPULATE
ROGUE
Requirements You are wielding a piercing or slashing weapon
and have a free hand.
You apply a poison to the required weapon. If your next attack
with that weapon before the end of your next turn hits and
deals damage, it applies the effects of the poison, provided that
poison can be delivered by contact or injury. If you critically fail
the attack roll, the poison is wasted as normal.
Special During your daily preparations, you can prepare a
number of simple injury poisons equal to your rogue level. These
poisons deal 1d4 poison damage. Only you can apply these
poisons properly, and they expire the next time you prepare.

SAMPLE ROGUE
SCOUT’S WARNING [free-action]
FEAT 4
ROGUE
Trigger You are about to roll a Perception or Survival check
for initiative.
You visually or audibly warn your allies of danger, granting
them each a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls.
Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this action
gains either the visual or auditory trait, respectively.
6TH LEVEL
GANG UP
FEAT 6
ROGUE
You and your allies harry an opponent in concert. Any enemy is
flat-footed against your melee attacks due to flanking as long as
the enemy is within both your reach and your ally’s. Your allies
must still flank an enemy for it to be flat-footed to them.
LIGHT STEP
FEAT 6
ROGUE
You aren’t bothered by tricky footing. When you Stride or Step,
you can ignore difficult terrain.
SKIRMISH STRIKE [one-action]
FEAT 6
FLOURISH
ROGUE
Your feet and weapon move in tandem. Either Step and then
Strike, or Strike and then Step.
TWIST THE KNIFE [one-action]
FEAT 6
ROGUE
Requirements Your last action was a melee Strike that dealt
sneak attack damage to a flat-footed target.
After stabbing your opponent in a weak spot, you tear the
wound open. You deal persistent bleed damage to the target
equal to your number of sneak attack damage dice.
8TH LEVEL
BLIND-FIGHT
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Prerequisites master in Perception
Your battle instincts make you more aware of concealed and
invisible opponents. You don’t need to succeed at a flat check to
target concealed creatures. You’re not flat-footed to creatures
that are hidden from you (unless you’re flat-footed to them for
reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a
successful DC 5 flat check to target a hidden creature.
While you’re adjacent to an undetected creature of your
level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
DELAY TRAP [reaction]
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Trigger A trap within your reach is triggered.
You can jam the workings of a trap to delay its effects. Attempt
a Thievery check to Disable a Device on the trap; the DC to do
so is increased by 5, and the effects are as follows.
THIEF
Furtive and swift, you pick locks, find secret doors
and traps, and collect all the best loot.
ABILITY SCORES
Prioritize Dexterity. Constitution improves your health and
Wisdom helps you notice traps.

you delay the activation until the end of your next turn
(whichever is worse for you; GM’s choice).
Failure No effect.
Critical Failure You’re flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
IMPROVED POISON WEAPON
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Prerequisites Poison Weapon
You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful
effects. When you apply a simple poison with Poison Weapon,
the poison deals 2d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison
damage. You don’t waste a poison you apply with Poison
Weapon on a critically failed attack roll.
NIMBLE ROLL
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Prerequisites Nimble Dodge
You throw yourself into a roll to escape imminent danger.
You can use Nimble Dodge before attempting a Reflex save
in addition to its original trigger. If you do, the circumstance
bonus applies to your Reflex save against the triggering effect.
When you use Nimble Dodge and the triggering attack fails
or critically fails, or when you succeed or critically succeed
at the saving throw, you can also Stride up to 10 feet as part
of the reaction. If you do, the reaction gains the move trait.
You can use Nimble Roll while Flying or Swimming instead of
Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
OPPORTUNE BACKSTAB [reaction]
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Trigger A creature within your melee reach is hit by a melee
attack from one of your allies.
When your enemy is hit by your ally, you capitalize upon the
distraction. Make a Strike against the triggering creature.
SIDESTEP [reaction]
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Trigger The attack roll for a Strike targeting you fails or
critically fails.
You deftly step out of the way of an attack, letting the blow
continue to the creature next to you. You redirect the attack to
a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the
reach of the triggering attack. The attacker rerolls the Strike’s
attack roll against the new target.
SLY STRIKER
FEAT 8
ROGUE
Prerequisites sneak attack
Your attacks deal more damage, even against creatures that
aren’t flat-footed. When you succeed or critically succeed at a
Strike against a creature that isn’t flat-footed, you also deal 1d6
precision damage. This applies only if you’re using a weapon or
unarmed attack you could deal sneak attack damage with. At
14th level, if you would normally deal 3d6 or more sneak attack
damage to flat-footed creatures, you deal 2d6 precision damage
to creatures that aren’t flat‑footed.
10TH LEVEL
PRECISE DEBILITATIONS
FEAT 10
ROGUE
Prerequisites thief racket, Debilitating Strike
You carefully aim and gracefully deliver your debilitations.
Add the following debilitations to the list you can choose from
when you use Debilitating Strike.
•	 Debilitation The target takes an additional 2d6
precision damage from your attacks.
•	 Debilitation The target becomes flat-footed.
SNEAK SAVANT
FEAT 10
ROGUE
Prerequisite master in Stealth
It is almost impossible to spot you without taking effort to
look. When you roll a failure on a Sneak action, you get a
success instead. You can still critically fail.
TACTICAL DEBILITATIONS
FEAT 10
ROGUE
Prerequisites scoundrel racket, Debilitating Strike
You learn new debilitations that grant you tactical advantages
against your foes. Add the following debilitations to the list
you can choose from when you use Debilitating Strike.
•	 Debilitation The target can’t use reactions.
•	 Debilitation The target can’t flank or contribute to allies’
flanking.
VICIOUS DEBILITATIONS
FEAT 10
ROGUE
Prerequisites ruffian racket, Debilitating Strike
The debilitations you dish out seriously impair your foes. Add
the following debilitations to the list you can choose from
when you use Debilitating Strike.
•	 Debilitation The target gains weakness 5 to your
choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
•	 Debilitation The target becomes clumsy 1.
12TH LEVEL
CRITICAL DEBILITATION
FEAT 12
INCAPACITATION
ROGUE
Prerequisites Debilitating Strike
Your debilitations are especially effective on your most
powerful attacks. Whenever you critically succeed at an
attack roll against an enemy and use Debilitating Strike, add
the following debilitation to the list you can choose from.
•	 Debilitation The target attempts a Fortitude save
against your class DC with the following effects.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

Dropping into a roll to disperse the force of the blow, you can
partially evade a lethal attack and stay conscious. You take
half damage from the triggering attack.
INSTANT OPENING [one-action]
FEAT 14
CONCENTRATE
ROGUE
You distract your opponent with a few choice words or a rude
gesture. Choose a target within 30 feet. It’s flat-footed against
your attacks until the end of your next turn. Depending on the
way you describe your distraction, this action gains either the
auditory or visual trait.
LEAVE AN OPENING
FEAT 14
ROGUE
When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your
ally can jump in on the action. Whenever you critically hit a
flat‑footed opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the
target triggers an Attack of Opportunity reaction from one ally
of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used
a manipulate action.
SENSE THE UNSEEN [reaction]
FEAT 14
ROGUE
Trigger You fail a check to Seek.
When you look for foes, you catch the slightest of cues. Even
though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically
sense any undetected creatures in the area where you’re
Seeking, making them merely hidden to you.
16TH LEVEL
BLANK SLATE
FEAT 16
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Deception
Your deceptions confound even the most powerful mortal
divinations. Detection, revelation, and scrying effects pass
right over you, your possessions, and your auras, detecting
nothing unless the detecting effect has a counteract level of
20 or higher. For example, detect magic would still detect other
magic in the area but not any magic on you, true seeing wouldn’t
reveal you, locate or scrying wouldn’t find you, and so on.
CLOUD STEP
FEAT 16
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Acrobatics
Using fantastic acrobatic skill, you can walk for brief stretches
across insubstantial surfaces. When you Stride, you can move
across water, air, and solid surfaces that can hold only limited
weight as if they were normal ground. If you Stride over a trap
with a weight-sensitive pressure plate, you don’t trigger it. At
the end of your turn, you sink, fall, break fragile surfaces, or
trigger traps as normal for your current location.
COGNITIVE LOOPHOLE [reaction]
FEAT 16
ROGUE
Trigger Your turn ends.
Success The target is slowed 1 until the end of your next turn.
Failure The target is slowed 2 until the end of your next turn.
Critical Failure The target is paralyzed until the end of your
next turn.
FANTASTIC LEAP [two-actions]
FEAT 12
ROGUE
You launch yourself through the air at a foe. Attempt a High
Jump or Long Jump. If you attempt a High Jump, determine the
distance you can travel using the scale of a Long Jump. At the
end of your jump, you can make a melee Strike.
After your Strike, you fall to the ground if you’re in the air.
If the distance of your fall is no more than the height of your
jump, you take no damage and land upright.
FELLING SHOT [two-actions]
FEAT 12
ROGUE
Your ranged attacks can shoot an unprepared foe right out
of the air. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon or a thrown
weapon against a flat-footed creature. If the Strike is a success
and deals damage, the target must attempt a Reflex save
against your class DC with the following effects.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target falls up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it
takes no damage from the fall.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target can’t fly, jump, levitate,
or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
REACTIVE INTERFERENCE [reaction]
FEAT 12
ROGUE
Trigger An adjacent enemy begins to use a reaction.
Grabbing a sleeve, swiping with your weapon, or creating
another obstruction, you reflexively foil an enemy’s
response. If the triggering creature’s level is equal to or
lower than yours, you disrupt the triggering reaction. If the
triggering creature’s level is higher than yours, you must
make an attack roll against its AC. On a success, you disrupt
the reaction.
SPRING FROM THE SHADOWS [one-action]
FEAT 12
FLOURISH
ROGUE
Leaping out from hiding, you assail your target when they least
expect it. You Stride up to your Speed, but you must end your
movement next to an enemy you’re hidden from or undetected
by. You then Strike that enemy; you remain hidden from or
undetected by that creature until after you Strike. You can use
Spring from the Shadows while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or
Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding
movement type.

PAGE 190
================================================================================

Requirements You are currently affected by a mental effect that
you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.
You can find a loophole in a mental effect to temporarily
overcome it. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single
mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a
particular effect using Cognitive Loophole only once.
Special You can use this reaction even if the mental effect is
preventing you from using reactions.
DISPELLING SLICE [two-actions]
FEAT 16
ROGUE
Your sneak attack slices through the threads binding magic
to a target. Make a Strike against a flat-footed creature
(your choice). If your Strike deals sneak attack damage, you
attempt to counteract a single spell active on the target.
Your counteract level is equal to your rogue level, and your
counteract check modifier is equal to your class DC – 10.
PERFECT DISTRACTION [one-action]
FEAT 16
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Deception
You use clever tactics to mislead your foes as you sneak away.
You Sneak while leaving a decoy behind. The decoy acts as
the spell mislead, though you aren’t invisible, just undetected.
You can continue to concentrate to move your decoy, as with
the spell, whether or not you remain hidden throughout the
duration. Once you use Perfect Distraction, you need to spend
10 minutes to set up another decoy before you can use it again.
18TH LEVEL
IMPLAUSIBLE INFILTRATION [two-actions]
FEAT 18
MAGICAL
MOVE
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Acrobatics, Quick Squeeze
Requirements You are adjacent to a floor or vertical wall.
You find tiny holes or imperfections that no one else could see
and try to somehow fit yourself through them, possibly moving
directly through the wall or floor from one side to the other. Your
movement attempt fails if the wall or floor is made of something
other than wood, plaster, or stone; is thicker than 10 feet; or
contains even a thin layer of metal. If you have a climb Speed,
you can use this ability to attempt to move through a ceiling.
POWERFUL SNEAK
FEAT 18
ROGUE
You have learned to exploit your enemies’ lowered defenses.
When you succeed or critically succeed at a Strike using your
Strength modifier on the attack roll and you would deal sneak
attack damage, you can change the additional damage from
sneak attack into ordinary damage of the same type as your
Strike, rather than precision damage.
TRICKSTER’S ACE [reaction]
FEAT 18
CONCENTRATE
ROGUE
Trigger You specify the trigger when you make your daily
preparations (see Requirements below).
Requirements When you make your daily preparations, you
must specify a trigger for this reaction using the same
restrictions as the triggers for the Ready action. You also
choose a single spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or
primal list of 4th level or lower. The spell can’t have a cost,
nor can its casting time be more than 10 minutes. The spell
must be able to target a single creature, and you must be a
valid target for it.
Whether from jury-rigged magic items, stolen magical
essence, or other means, you have a contingency in your
back pocket for desperate situations. When the trigger
occurs, you cause the spell to come into effect. The spell
targets only you, no matter how many creatures it would
affect normally. If you define particularly complicated
conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail.
Once the contingency is triggered, the spell is expended until
your next daily preparations.
20TH LEVEL
HIDDEN PARAGON [reaction]
FEAT 20
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Stealth
Frequency once per hour
Trigger You successfully use Stealth to Hide and become
hidden from all of your current foes, or use Stealth to Sneak
and become undetected to all your current foes.
When you put your mind to slipping out of sight, you disappear
completely. You become invisible for 1 minute, even if you use
a hostile action. Not even glitterdust, see invisibility, or similar
effects can reveal you, though creatures can still use the Seek
action to locate you as normal.
IMPOSSIBLE STRIKER
FEAT 20
ROGUE
Prerequisites Sly Striker
Your attacks are swift and deadly beyond explanation.
Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even
if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of
dealing the damage from Sly Striker, you can deal your full
sneak attack damage to a target even if the target isn’t
flat-footed.
REACTIVE DISTRACTION [reaction]
FEAT 20
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
ROGUE
Prerequisites legendary in Deception, Perfect Distraction
Trigger You would be hit by an attack or targeted by an effect,
or you are within an effect’s area.
Requirements You have Perfect Distraction ready to use.
You reactively switch with your decoy to foil your foe. You use
Perfection Distraction, even if you were observed, as long as
you end the movement of your Sneak while concealed or in a
location with cover or greater cover. Your decoy is targeted
by the attack or effect instead of you. In the case of an area
effect, if your Sneak doesn’t move you out of the area, both
you and the decoy are targeted by the effect.

================================================================================

Sorcerer
During combat encounters...
You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their
movements. You might be too vulnerable to get into melee combat, or your bloodline
might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. While your magic is
powerful, to conserve your best spells—or when you’ve used them all up—you also
rely on cantrips.
During social encounters...
Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.
While exploring...
You detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your adventuring
group of magical traps. When the group encounters mysteries or problems related to
your bloodline, you try to solve them.
In downtime...
You craft magic items or scribe scrolls. Your bloodline might drive you to research
your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures.
You Might...
•	 Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your
magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an
individual.
•	 View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from
wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.
•	 Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited
selection of spells.
Others Probably...
•	 Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with
equal parts admiration and mistrust.
•	 Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other
practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally.
•	 Assume you’re as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your
personality proves otherwise.
You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s magic
in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear
communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line.
Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more
powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face
the choice of whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain the
listed proficiency ranks in
the following statistics. You
are untrained in anything
not listed unless you gain a
better proficiency rank in some
other way.
Perception

KEY ABILITY
CHARISMA

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a sorcerer. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the requisite levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Bloodline
Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent.
This choice determines the type of spells you cast and
the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you
learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus
Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline.
The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.
Aberrant: A strange and unknowable influence gives
you occult spells.
Angelic: Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.
Demonic: A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.
Diabolic: A bond with devils gives you divine spells.
Draconic: The blood of dragons grants you
arcane spells.
Elemental: The power of the elements manifests in
you as primal spells.
Fey: Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.
Hag: The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.
Imperial: An ancient power grants you arcane spells.
Undead: The touch of death gives you divine spells.
See Bloodlines on page 194 for more information.
Sorcerer Spellcasting
Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical
power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity,
and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal
components when casting spells  (see Casting Spells on
page 302). Because you’re a sorcerer, you can usually
replace material components with somatic components,
so you don’t need to use a spell component pouch.
Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You
must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the
spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can
cast each day is called your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of
spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells
you can cast, as shown on Table 3–17: Sorcerer Spells per
Day on page 193.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies
roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell
attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you
can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level
spells. This increases the spell’s level to match the spell
slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the
level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level.
Many spells have specific improvements when they are
heightened to certain levels (page 299). The signature
spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots.
You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day.
A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level
of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-
level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a
5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell
repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of
your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as
an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline (page
194). You choose these from the common spells from the
tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other
spells from that tradition to which you have access. You
can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell
slot of an appropriate spell level.
You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level.
Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 3–17), you add a
spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you
gain access to a new level of spells, your first new spell is
always your bloodline spell, but you can choose the other
spells you gain. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level
spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two
other 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you
might choose a higher-level version of a spell you already
have so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.
Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots
and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a
feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it
wouldn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.
Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might
want to replace some of the spells you previously learned.
Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can
swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of

swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells
by retraining during downtime (page 481).
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
feat. Skill feats appear in Chapter 5 and have the skill
trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding
skill to select a skill feat.
Sorcerer Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a
sorcerer class feat. These begin on page 198.
General Feats

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Signature Spells

You’ve learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly.
For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of
that level to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn
heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead,
you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a
signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you
can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning
those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you
can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell
level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also
retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different

spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as
much time as retraining a spell normally does.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a
skill increase. You can use an increase to either become
trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase
your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already
trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a
master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and
at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a
skill in which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if
it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in
your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Magical Fortitude
5th
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
Expert Spellcaster
7th
Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to
your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack
rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline’s tradition
increase to expert.
Lightning Reflexes
9th
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
Alertness 
11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Simple Weapon Expertise
11th
Training and magic improved your weapon technique. Your
proficiency rank for simple weapons increases to expert.
Defensive Robes
13th
The flow of magic and your defensive training combine
to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your
proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.
Weapon Specialization
13th
You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your practiced
weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and
unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage
increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.
Master Spellcaster
15th
You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood.
Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs
for spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to master.
Bloodline Paragon
19th
You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add
two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your
repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can
use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike
other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as
you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let
you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities
that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline
Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.
Legendary Spellcaster
19th
You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your
proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for
spells of your bloodline’s tradition increase to legendary.
Bloodlines
Choose your bloodline, the source of your power. It has a
major influence on your abilities, determining your spell
list, the tradition of spells you cast, and two trained skills.
Bloodline Spells
Your bloodline grants you bloodline spells, special spells
unique to your lineage. Bloodline spells are a type of focus
spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start
with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool
during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus
Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity.
Unlike other characters, you don’t need to do anything
specific to Refocus, as the power of the blood flowing
through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.
THE BLESSED AND THE DAMNED
Many bloodlines are tied to certain types of creatures,
and the reputations of those creatures might color
how people see you. If you have the blood of demons,
people might fear you; conversely, people of good faiths
might assume your angelic blood puts you on their
side. These preconceptions aren’t necessarily true, and
you can certainly use demonic or infernal powers to do
good. Having a bloodline tied to creatures of a certain
alignment doesn’t have any effect on your own alignment
unless you want it to; your magic is disconnected from
its source. That said, many sorcerers seek out creatures
or organizations associated with their bloodlines, which
can expose them to these forces’ influences.
Core Rulebook
194

PAGE 196
================================================================================

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, nor
can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give
you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus
pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than
3 points. The full rules are on page 300.
Reading a Bloodline Entry
A bloodline entry contains the following information.
Spell List You use this magical tradition and spell list.
Bloodline Skills You become trained in the listed skills.
Granted Spells You automatically add the spells listed here
to your spell repertoire, in addition to those you gain through
sorcerer spellcasting. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a
1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as
you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.
Bloodline Spells You automatically gain the initial bloodline
spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced
Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.
Blood Magic Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus
Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot,
you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice,
make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs
after resolving any checks for the spell’s initial effects and,
against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or
the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must
designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the
spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references
to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.
Aberrant
Something speaks to you from beyond the stars
or below the earth. Ancient and unknowable,
this alien influence presses against your mind.

beasts are both fearsome in combat and skilled at magic.

(fire), bronze (electricity), copper (acid), gold (fire), and
silver (cold). The evil chromatic dragons and their damage
types are black (acid), blue (electricity), green (poison), red

Blood Magic Elemental energy surrounds you or a target. Either
you gain a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks for 1 round, or a
target takes 1 damage per spell level. The damage is bludgeoning
or fire, according to your elemental type (see below). If the spell
already deals that type of damage, combine it with the spell’s
initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances.
Elemental Type
At 1st level, choose the type of elemental that influenced
your bloodline: air, earth, fire, or water. If your element is
air, you buffet your foes with powerful winds; if it’s earth,
you toss huge chunks of rock; if it’s fire, you incinerate
your foes with flame; and if it’s water, you inundate your
foes with torrents of water. For fire, all marked spells deal
fire damage. For other elements, they deal bludgeoning
damage. You also add the trait of the element you chose.

Fey whimsy or a tryst in a moonlit grove put the bewitching

1ST LEVEL
COUNTERSPELL [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
SORCERER
Trigger A creature casts a spell that you have in your repertoire.
Requirements You have an unexpended spell slot you could
use to cast the triggering spell.
When a foe Casts a Spell you know and you can see its
manifestations, you can use your own magic to disrupt it.
You expend one of your spell slots to counter the triggering
creature’s casting of a spell that you have in your repertoire.
You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell.
You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell (page 458).
Special This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition
of spells you cast (arcane, divine, natural, or occult).
DANGEROUS SORCERY
FEAT 1
SORCERER
Your legacy grants you great destructive power. When you
Cast a Spell from your spell slots, if the spell deals damage and
doesn’t have a duration, you gain a status bonus to that spell’s
damage equal to the spell’s level.
FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
SORCERER
An animal serves you and assists your spellcasting. You gain a
familiar (rules for familiars are found on page 217).
REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you
use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range
by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell
normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
WIDEN SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst
with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length
of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and
add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
SORCERER
You better understand the basic power of your bloodline. Add
two additional cantrips from your spell list to your repertoire.
ENHANCED FAMILIAR
FEAT 2
SORCERER
Prerequisites a familiar
KEY TERMS
You’ll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.
Blood Magic Spiteful curses punish your foes. The first creature
that deals damage to you before the end of your next turn takes 2
mental damage per spell level and must attempt a basic Will save.
Imperial
One of your ancestors was a mortal who mastered magic.
Such magical blood can remain latent for generations,
but in you it manifested in full.
Spell List arcane (page 307)
Bloodline Skills Arcana, Society
Granted Spells cantrip: detect magic; 1st: magic missile; 2nd:
dispel magic; 3rd: haste; 4th: dimension door; 5th: prying
eye; 6th: disintegrate; 7th: prismatic spray; 8th: maze; 9th:
prismatic sphere
Bloodline Spells initial: ancestral memories; advanced: extend
spell; greater: arcane countermeasure
Blood Magic A surge of ancestral memories grants you or one
target a +1 status bonus to skill checks for 1 round.
Undead
The touch of undeath runs through your blood. Your
family tree might contain powerful undead, like a
vampire, or perhaps you died and returned a bit different.
Spell List divine (page 309)
Bloodline Skills Intimidation, Religion
Granted Spells cantrip: chill touch; 1st: harm; 2nd: false life; 3rd:
bind undead; 4th: talking corpse; 5th: cloudkill; 6th: vampiric
exsanguination; 7th: finger of death; 8th: horrid wilting; 9th:
wail of the banshee
Bloodline Spells initial: touch of undeath; advanced: drain life;
greater: grasping grave
Blood Magic Necromantic energy flows through you or one
target. Either you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the
spell’s level for 1 round, or a target takes 1 negative damage
per spell level (if the spell already deals initial negative
damage, combine this with the spell’s initial damage before
determining weaknesses and resistances).
Sorcerer Feats
At every level at which you gain a sorcerer feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.
Core Rulebook
198

PAGE 200
================================================================================

You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You can select four familiar or master
abilities each day, instead of two.
4TH LEVEL
ARCANE EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
ARCANE
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants arcane spells
Your arcane legacy grants you an exceptional aptitude for intellectual and academic
pursuits. You become trained in one skill of your choice. Additionally, you keep a book of
arcane spells similar to a wizard’s spellbook. You add all the spells in your spell repertoire
to this book for free, and you can add additional arcane spells to the book by paying the
appropriate cost and using your Arcana skill, similarly to how a wizard can Learn Spells to
add those spells to his spellbook.
During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of arcane spells.
If it isn’t in your spell repertoire, add it to your spell repertoire until the next time you
prepare. If it’s already in your spell repertoire, add it as an additional signature spell
for that day.
BESPELL WEAPON [free-action]
FEAT 4
SORCERER
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell.
You siphon the residual energy from the last spell you cast into one weapon you’re wielding.
Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of a type depending on
the school of the spell you just cast.
•	 Abjuration force damage
•	 Conjuration or Transmutation the same type as the weapon
•	 Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental damage
•	 Evocation a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the spell didn’t deal damage
•	 Necromancy negative damage
DIVINE EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
DIVINE
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants divine spells
The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you. You gain an additional
spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast your choice of heal or
harm. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if they aren’t in your
spell repertoire.
OCCULT EVOLUTION
FEAT 4

Prerequisites bloodline that grants occult spells
Glimpses of the obscure secrets of the universe loan you power. You become trained in one
skill of your choice. Additionally, once per day, you can spend 1 minute to choose one mental
occult spell you don’t know and add it to your spell repertoire. You lose this temporary spell
the next time you make your daily preparations (though you can use this ability to add it
again later).
PRIMAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 4
PRIMAL
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline that grants primal spells
You can call upon the creatures of the wild for aid. You gain an additional spell slot of
your highest level, which you can use only to cast summon animal or summon plants and
fungi. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if it they aren’t in your
spell repertoire.

SAMPLE SORCERER
6TH LEVEL
ADVANCED BLOODLINE
FEAT 6
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline spell
You have studied your bloodline to learn the secrets of its
magic. You gain the advanced bloodline spell associated with
your bloodline. Increase the number of Focus Points in your
focus pool by 1.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 
FEAT 6
SORCERER
You are confident in your spellcasting technique, and you
are more easily able to retain your concentration when you
Cast a Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting
action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action
isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE RESISTANCE
FEAT 8
SORCERER
Your magical blood makes you more resistant to magic. You
gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against spells and
magical effects.
CROSSBLOODED EVOLUTION
FEAT 8
SORCERER
Odd interactions in your bloodline provide you with
unexpected spells. You can have one spell in your spell
repertoire from a tradition other than the one that matches
your bloodline. You cast that spell as a spell from your
bloodline’s tradition. You can swap which spell you add and
from which tradition as you could any other sorcerer spell, but
you can’t have more than one spell from another tradition in
your spell repertoire at the same time using this feat.
10TH LEVEL
GREATER BLOODLINE
FEAT 10
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline spell
Further communion with the legacy of your bloodline has
uncovered greater secrets. You gain the greater bloodline spell
associated with your bloodline. Increase the number of Focus
Points in your focus pool by 1.
OVERWHELMING ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 10
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
You alter your spells to overcome resistances. If the next
action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount
of the target’s resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic
damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage the
spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused
by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the wall created by
wall of fire. A creature’s immunities are unaffected.
DEMONBLOOD
The grotesque and chaotic creatures of the Abyss left
their mark on your family’s bloodline. You have a
vicious streak and find wanton destruction thrilling.
ABILITY SCORES
Your Charisma is most important, and boosting Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution make you a better combatant.

================================================================================

QUICKENED CASTING [free-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Frequency once per day
In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a
spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a sorcerer
cantrip or a sorcerer spell that is at least 2 levels lower than
the highest level sorcerer spell you can cast, reduce the
number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
12TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE FOCUS
FEAT 12
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline spell
Your focus recovers faster. If you have spent at least 2 Focus
Points since the last time you Refocused, you recover 2 Focus
Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
MAGIC SENSE 
FEAT 12
DETECTION
DIVINATION
SORCERER
You have a literal sixth sense for magic. You can sense the
presence of magic auras as though you were always using a
1st-level detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of
vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level
detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal
benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a
free action at the start or the end of your turn.
14TH LEVEL
INTERWEAVE DISPEL [one-action]
FEAT 14
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Prerequisites dispel magic in your spell repertoire
You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects
at a foe. If your next action is to cast a single-target spell
against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell
attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast dispel
magic on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as
normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
REFLECT SPELL 
FEAT 14
SORCERER
Prerequisites Counterspell
When you successfully use Counterspell to counteract a
spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn
that spell’s effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell
affects only the original caster, even if it’s an area spell or it
would normally affect more than one creature. The original
caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the
reflected spell as normal.
16TH LEVEL
EFFORTLESS CONCENTRATION [reaction[free-action]
FEAT 16
SORCERER
Trigger Your turn begins.
You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately
gain the effects of the Sustain a Spell action, allowing you to
extend the duration of one of your active sorcerer spells.
GREATER MENTAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 16
ARCANE
SORCERER
Prerequisites Arcane Evolution or Occult Evolution
Your bloodline’s deep connection to mental essence greatly
enhances your spell repertoire. Add one spell to your spell
repertoire for each spell level you can cast.
GREATER VITAL EVOLUTION
FEAT 16
DIVINE
SORCERER
Prerequisites Divine Evolution or Primal Evolution
Vital power surges through you like a font of energy. Twice
per day, you can cast a spell after you’ve run out of spell slots
of the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this
feat must be of different spell levels.
18TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE WELLSPRING
FEAT 18
SORCERER
Prerequisites Bloodline Focus
Your blood’s power replenishes your focus. If you have spent
at least 3 Focus Points since the last time you Refocused, you
recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
GREATER CROSSBLOODED EVOLUTION
FEAT 18
SORCERER
Prerequisites Crossblooded Evolution
Your bloodline is extraordinarily complex. You can have up
to three spells from other traditions in your spell repertoire,
rather than just one. These spells must each be of a different
spell level, but they don’t need to be from the same tradition.
20TH LEVEL
BLOODLINE CONDUIT [one-action]
FEAT 20
METAMAGIC
SORCERER
Frequency once per minute
Your inborn magical nature lets you redirect ambient energies
to fuel your spells. If your next action is to Cast a Spell of
5th level or lower that has no duration, you don’t expend the
spell’s slot when you cast it.
BLOODLINE PERFECTION 
FEAT 20
SORCERER
Prerequisites bloodline paragon
You command the ultimate powers of your bloodline and
tradition. You gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
METAMAGIC MASTERY 
FEAT 20
SORCERER
Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them
normally. You can use metamagic single actions as free actions..

PAGE 204
================================================================================

Wizard
During combat Encounters...
You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You
save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips
when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight,
you answer with spells like glitterdust or earth bind, leveling the field for your allies.
During social encounters...
You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.
While exploring...
You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing
or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further
exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.
In downtime...
You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek
out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly
connections and establish a school or guild of your own.
You Might...
•	 Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world
around you works—magic in particular.
•	 Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you’re a specialist) or that
true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you’re a universalist).
•	 Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of
magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.
Others Probably...
•	 Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.
•	 Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you
avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your
spells is harmless or malevolent until it’s too late.
•	 Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor
crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.
You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your
mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells. You treat magic like a
science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes
to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and there’s no
way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining
deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader
approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth.
INITIAL PROFICIENCIES

KEY ABILITY
INTELLIGENCE
At 1st level, your class gives you
an ability boost to Intelligence.
HIT POINTS
6 plus your Constitution modifier
You increase your maximum number of
HP by this number at 1st level and every
level thereafter.

PAGE 205
================================================================================

Class Features
You gain these abilities as a wizard. Abilities gained at
higher levels list the levels next to their names.
Ancestry and Background
In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st
level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and
background, as described in Chapter 2.
Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that
represent your basic training. These proficiencies are
noted at the start of this class.
Arcane Spellcasting
Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness
arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells
using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply
material, somatic, and verbal components when casting
spells (see Casting Spells on page 302).
At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells
and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your
spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of
your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are
a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to
you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells
again. The number of spells you can prepare is called
your spell slots.
As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of
spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from
spell slots increase, shown in Table 3–19: Wizard Spells
per Day on page 205.
Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack
roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll
against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving
throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell
attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.
Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.
Heightening Spells
When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can
fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.
This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the
spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when
they are heightened to certain levels.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell
slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to
half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the
highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example,
as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and
as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.
Spellbook
Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded
in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp
or less (as detailed on page 291), which you receive for
free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The
spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and
five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the
common spells on the arcane spell list from this book
(page 307) or from other arcane spells you gain access to.
Your spellbook’s form and name are up to you. It might
be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin
metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be
esoteric, like The Crimson Libram, or something more
academic, like A Field Study in Practical Transmutation.
Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane
spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast.
You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that
you find in your adventures, as described on page 241.
Arcane School
Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school
of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to
be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize.

================================================================================

You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your
school. Arcane schools are described in detail on page 207.
If you don’t choose a school, you’re a universalist, a
wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of
magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all
eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks
the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater flexibility.
Universalist wizards are described on page 209.
Arcane Bond
You place some of your magical power in a bonded item.
Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate
a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically
an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring,
or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other
item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.

Requirements You haven’t acted yet on your turn.
You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your
turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today
and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still
Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.
Arcane Thesis
During your studies to become a full‑fledged wizard, you
produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a
variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on

the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics
presented in this book are below; your specific thesis
probably has a much longer and more technical title like
“On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis
of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.”
Improved Familiar Attunement
You’ve long held that fine-tuning the magic that bonds
wizard and familiar can improve the mystic connection,
compared to the safe yet generic bond most wizards
currently use. You’ve formed such a pact with your familiar,
gaining more advantages from it than most wizards. You
gain the Familiar wizard feat as a bonus feat. Your familiar
gains an extra ability, and it gains an additional extra
ability when you reach 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.
Your connection with your familiar alters your arcane
bond class feature so that you store your magical energy
in your familiar, rather than an item you own; you also
gain the Drain Familiar free action instead of Drain
Bonded Item. Drain Familiar can be used any time an
ability would allow you to use Drain Bonded Item and
functions identically, except that you draw magic from
your familiar instead of an item.
Metamagical Experimentation
You’ve realized that the practice known as metamagic is a
holdover from a time long ago, when wizards had to work
out their own spells and variations rather than rely on spells
recorded by others and passed down over the years. This
allows you efficient access to various metamagic effects.

================================================================================

You gain a 1st-level metamagic wizard feat as a bonus
feat. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations,
you can gain a metamagic wizard feat of your choice that
has a level requirement of no more than half your level,
which you can use until your next daily preparations.
Spell Blending
You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an
underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and
you’ve found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell
slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells.
When you make your daily preparations, you can trade
two spell slots of the same level for a bonus spell slot of
up to 2 levels higher than the traded spell slots. You can
exchange as many spell slots as you have available.
Bonus spell slots must be of a level you can normally
cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different
spell level. You can also trade any spell slot for two
additional cantrips, though you cannot trade more
than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in
this way.
Spell Substitution
You don’t accept the fact that once spells are prepared,
they can’t be changed until your next daily preparation,
and you have uncovered a shortcut allowing you to
substitute new spells for those you originally prepared.
You can spend 10 minutes to empty one of your
prepared spell slots and prepare a different spell from
your spellbook in its place. If you are interrupted during
such a swap, the original spell remains prepared and can
still be cast. You can try again to swap out the spell later,
but you must start the process over again.
Wizard Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you
gain a wizard class feat. These feats begin on page 209.
Skill Feats
2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain
a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and
have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the
corresponding skill to select a skill feat.
General Feats
3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a
general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.
Skill Increases
3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill
increase. You can use this increase either to increase your
proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained
in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in
which you’re already trained to expert.
At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase
your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re
SAMPLE SPELLBOOK
You can fill your spellbook with whichever spells you like,
but the list below covers a good selection of starter spells
for a 1st-level wizard. These are the exact spells found
in Structure and Interpretation of Arcane Magic, a basic
spellbook used by arcane academies and master wizards
to teach apprentices good habits in arcane research.
Cantrips: Acid splash, detect magic, electric arc, light,
mage hand, message, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shield,
and study aura.
1st Level: Burning hands, color spray, grease, mage
armor, and magic missile, plus one spell of your school if
you’re a specialist wizard.

already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to
increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in
which you’re already a master.
Ability Boosts
5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four
different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to
increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability
score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2
if it starts out below 18.
Ancestry Feats
5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain
an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.
The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in
your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.
Lightning Reflexes
5th
Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for
Reflex saves increases to expert.
Expert Spellcaster
7th
Extended practice of the arcane has improved your
capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell
attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.
Magical Fortitude
9th
Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your
proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.
Alertness 
11th
You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency
rank for Perception increases to expert.
Wizard Weapon Expertise
11th
Through a combination of magic and training, you’ve
learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively.
You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow,
dagger, heavy crossbow, and staff.
Defensive Robes
13th
The flow of magic and your training combine to help
you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored
defense increases to expert.
Weapon Specialization 
13th
You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the
weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an
expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and
4 if you’re legendary.
Master Spellcaster
15th
You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your
proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell
DCs increase to master.

 17th
You’ve steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency
rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a
success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
Archwizard’s Spellcraft
19TH
You command the most potent arcane magic and can
cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single
10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot
using arcane spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots,
you don’t gain more 10th-level spells as you level up,
though you can take the Archwizard’s Might feat to gain
a second slot.
Legendary Spellcaster
19th
You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive
understanding of both arcane theory and practical
spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack
rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.
Arcane Schools
If you specialize in an arcane school, rather than studying
each school equally (as universalists do), you gain an
extra spell slot for each level of spell you can cast. You can
prepare only spells of your chosen arcane school in these
extra slots. In addition, you can prepare an extra cantrip
of your chosen school. You also add another arcane spell
of your chosen school to your spellbook.
You learn a school spell, a special type of spell taught to
students of your arcane school. School spells are a type of
focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and
you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill
your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you
can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using
the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or perform
arcane research.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots,
nor can you cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can
give you more focus spells and increase the size of your
focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more
than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear
on page 300.
Abjuration
As an abjurer, you master the art of protection, strengthening
defenses, preventing attacks, and even turning magic
against itself. You understand that an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure. You add one 1st-level abjuration
spell (such as feather fall) to your spellbook. You learn the
protective ward school spell (page 407).
Conjuration
As a conjurer, you summon creatures and objects from
places beyond, and use magic to transport to distant locales.

SAMPLE WIZARD
You understand that the true key to victory is strength in
numbers. You add one 1st-level conjuration spell (such as
summon animal) to your spellbook. You learn the augment
summoning school spell (page 406).
Divination
As a diviner, you master remote viewing and prescience,
learning information that can transform investigations,
research, and battle strategies. You understand that
knowledge is power. You add one 1st-level divination
spell (such as true strike) to your spellbook. You learn the
diviner’s sight school spell (page 406).
Enchantment
As an enchanter, you use magic to manipulate
others’ minds. You might use your abilities
to subtly influence others or seize control
over them. You understand that the mind
surpasses matter. You add one 1st-level
enchantment spell (such as charm) to your
spellbook. You learn the charming words
school spell (page 406).
Evocation
As an evoker, you revel in the raw power of
magic, using it to create and destroy with ease.
You can call forth elements, forces, and energy to
devastate your foes or to assist you in other ways. You
understand that the most direct approach is the most
elegant. You add one 1st-level evocation spell (such as
shocking grasp) to your spellbook. You learn the force bolt
school spell (page 407).
Illusion
As an illusionist, you use magic to create images, figments,
and phantasms to baffle your enemies. You understand
that perception is reality. You add one 1st‑level illusion
spell (such as illusory object) to your spellbook. You learn
the warped terrain school spell (page 407).
Necromancy
As a necromancer, you call upon the powers of life
and death. While your school is often vilified for its
association with raising the undead, you understand that
control over life also means control over healing. You
add one 1st-level necromancy spell (such as grim tendrils)
to your spellbook. You learn the call of the grave school
spell (page 406).
Transmutation
As a transmuter, you alter the physical properties of things,
transforming creatures, objects, the natural world, and
even yourself at your whim. You understand that change
is inevitable. You add one 1st-level transmutation spell
(such as magic weapon) to your spellbook. You learn the
physical boost school spell (page 407).
CONJURER
Your magic summons creatures, transports you, and
creates useful items. You know about odd creatures

Universalist Wizards
Instead of specializing narrowly in an arcane school, you
can become a universalist wizard—by studying all the
schools equally, you devote yourself to understanding
the full breadth of the arcane arts. For each level of spell
you can cast, you can use Drain Bonded item once per
day to recall a spell of that level (instead of using it only
once per day in total). You gain an extra wizard class
feat, and you add one 1st-level spell of your choice to
your spellbook.
Wizard Feats
At each level that you gain a wizard feat, you can
select one of the following feats. You must satisfy any
prerequisites before taking the feat.
1ST LEVEL
COUNTERSPELL [reaction]
FEAT 1
ABJURATION
ARCANE
WIZARD
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared.
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations,
you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You expend a
prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of
that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the
triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering
spell (page 458).
ESCHEW MATERIALS
FEAT 1
WIZARD
You can use clever workarounds to replicate the arcane essence
of certain materials. When Casting a Spell that requires material
components, you can provide these material components without
a spell component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils
in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still
must have a hand completely free. This doesn’t remove the need
for any materials listed in the spell’s cost entry.
FAMILIAR
FEAT 1
WIZARD
You make a pact with creature that serves you and assists your
spellcasting. You gain a familiar (page 217).
HAND OF THE APPRENTICE
FEAT 1
WIZARD
Prerequisites universalist wizard
You can magically hurl your weapon at your foe. You gain the
hand of the apprentice universalist spell. Universalist spells
are a type of focus spell, much like school spells. You start
with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. See Arcane Schools on page
207 for more information about focus spells.

ENHANCED FAMILIAR
FEAT 2
WIZARD
Prerequisites a familiar
You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy. You
can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead
of two.
Special If your arcane thesis is improved familiar attunement,
your familiar’s base number of familiar abilities, before adding
any extra abilities from the arcane thesis, is four.
4TH LEVEL
BESPELL WEAPON [free-action]
FEAT 4
WIZARD
Frequency once per turn
Requirements Your most recent action was to cast a
non‑cantrip spell.
You siphon spell energy into one weapon you’re wielding. Until
the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage
of a type depending on the school of the spell you just cast.
•	 Abjuration force damage
•	 Conjuration or Transmutation the same type as the weapon
•	 Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion mental damage
•	 Evocation a type the spell dealt, or force damage if the
spell didn’t deal damage
•	 Necromancy negative damage
LINKED FOCUS
FEAT 4
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond, arcane school
Frequency once per day
You have linked your bonded item to the well of energy that
powers your school spells. When you Drain your Bonded Item to
cast a spell of your arcane school, you also regain 1 Focus Point.
SILENT SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 4
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Prerequisites Conceal Spell
You’ve learned how to cast many of your spells without
speaking the words of power you would normally need to
provide. If the next action you use is Casting a Spell that has
a verbal component and at least one other component, you can
remove the verbal component. This makes the spell quieter and
allows you to cast it in areas where sound can’t carry. However,
the spell still has visual manifestations, so this doesn’t make
the spell any less obvious to someone who sees you casting it.
When you use Silent Spell, you can choose to gain the benefits
of Conceal Spell, and you don’t need to attempt a Deception
check because the spell has no verbal components.
6TH LEVEL
SPELL PENETRATION 
FEAT 6
WIZARD
You’ve studied ways of overcoming the innate magical
resistance that dragons, otherworldly beings, and certain
KEY TERM
You’ll see the following key term in many wizard abilities.
Metamagic: Actions with the metamagic trait tweak
the properties of your spells. These actions usually come
from metamagic feats. You must use a metamagic action
directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you
use any action (including free actions and reactions) other
than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of
the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a
metamagic action are part of the spell’s effect, not of the
metamagic action itself.
REACH SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you
use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range
by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell
normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
WIDEN SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 1
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a
wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has
an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration,
increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a
burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst
with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length
of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and
add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
2ND LEVEL
CANTRIP EXPANSION
FEAT 2
WIZARD
Dedicated study allows you to prepare a wider range of simple
spells. You can prepare two additional cantrips each day.
CONCEAL SPELL [one-action]
FEAT 2
CONCENTRATE
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Hiding your gestures and incantations within other speech
and movement, you attempt to conceal the fact that you are
Casting a Spell. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell,
attempt a Stealth check against one or more observers’
Perception DCs; if the spell has verbal components, you
must also attempt a Deception check against the observers’
Perception DC. If you succeed at your check (or checks)
against an observer’s DC, that observer doesn’t notice you’re
casting a spell, even though material, somatic, and verbal
components are usually noticeable and spells normally have
sensory manifestations that would make spellcasting obvious
to those nearby.
This ability hides only the spell’s spellcasting actions and
manifestations, not its effects, so an observer might still see a
ray streak out from you or see you vanish into thin air.
Core Rulebook

other powerful creatures have. Any creature that has a status bonus to saving throws
against magic reduces that bonus by 1 against your spells.
STEADY SPELLCASTING 
FEAT 6
WIZARD
Confident in your technique, you don’t easily lose your concentration when you Cast a
Spell. If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you
succeed, your action isn’t disrupted.
8TH LEVEL
ADVANCED SCHOOL SPELL
FEAT 8
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane school
You gain access to a powerful new school spell depending on your arcane school. If you’re an
abjurer, you gain energy absorption; if you’re a conjurer, you gain dimensional steps; if you’re a
diviner, you gain vigilant eye; if you’re an enchanter, you gain dread aura; if you’re an evoker, you
gain elemental tempest; if you’re an illusionist, you gain invisibility cloak; if you’re a necromancer,
you gain life siphon; and if you’re a transmuter, you gain shifting form. The descriptions of these
spells are on pages 406–407. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
BOND CONSERVATION [one-action]
FEAT 8
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond
Requirements The last action you used was Drain Bonded Item.
By carefully manipulating the arcane energies stored in your bonded item as you drain it, you
can conserve just enough power to cast another, slightly weaker spell. If the next action you
use is to Cast a Spell using the energy from Drain Bonded Item, you gain an extra use of Drain
Bonded Item. You must use this extra use of Drain Bonded Item before the end of your next
turn or you lose it, and you can use this additional use only to cast a spell 2 or more levels
lower than the first spell cast with Drain Bonded Item.
UNIVERSAL VERSATILITY
FEAT 8
WIZARD
Prerequisites universalist wizard, Hand of the Apprentice
You can access the fundamental abilities of any school of magic. During your daily
preparations, choose one of the eight school spells gained by 1st-level specialist wizards.
You can use that school spell until your next daily preparations. When you Refocus, you can
choose a different school spell from among those eight school spells, replacing the previous
one. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
10TH LEVEL
OVERWHELMING ENERGY [one-action]
FEAT 10
MANIPULATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
With a complex gesture, you alter the energy of your spell to overcome resistances. If the
next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target’s resistance
to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage equal to your level. This applies to all damage
the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the
spell, such as the wall created by wall of fire. A creature’s immunities are unaffected.
QUICKENED CASTING [free-action]
FEAT 10
CONCENTRATE
METAMAGIC
WIZARD
Frequency once per day
In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If
your next action is to cast a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell that is at least 2 levels lower

than the highest-level wizard spell you can cast, reduce the
number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
SCROLL SAVANT
FEAT 10
WIZARD
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
During your daily preparations, you can create two temporary
scrolls containing arcane spells from your spellbook. These
scrolls follow the normal rules for scrolls (page 564), with some
additional restrictions. Each scroll must be of a different spell
level, and both spell levels must be 2 or more levels lower than
your highest-level spell. Any scrolls you create this way become
non‑magical the next time you make your daily preparations. A
temporary scroll has no value.
If you have master proficiency in arcane spell DCs, you can
create three temporary scrolls during your daily preparations,
and if you have legendary proficiency, you can create four
temporary scrolls.
12TH LEVEL
CLEVER COUNTERSPELL
FEAT 12
WIZARD
Prerequisites Counterspell, Quick Recognize
You creatively apply your prepared spells to Counterspell a
much wider variety of your opponents’ magic. Instead of being
able to counter a foe’s spell with Counterspell only if you have
that same spell prepared, you can use Counterspell as long as
you have the spell the foe is casting in your spellbook. When
you use Counterspell in this way, the prepared spell you expend
must share a trait other than its tradition with the triggering
spell. At the GM’s discretion, you can instead use a spell that
has an opposing trait or that otherwise logically would counter
the triggering spell (such as using a cold or water spell to
counter fireball or using remove fear to counter a fear spell).
Regardless of what spell you expend, you take a –2 penalty to
your counteract check, though the GM can waive this penalty if
the expended spell is especially appropriate.
MAGIC SENSE 
FEAT 12
ARCANE
DETECTION
DIVINATION
WIZARD
You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.
You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were
always using a 1st-level detect magic spell. This detects magic in
your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits
of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things you see (in addition
to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off
and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
14TH LEVEL
BONDED FOCUS
FEAT 14
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond
Your connection to your bonded item increases your focus pool.
If you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time
ILLUSIONIST
You cast illusory spells that fool the senses, and you
excel at bypassing threats without violence.

recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
REFLECT SPELL 
FEAT 14
WIZARD
Prerequisites Counterspell
When you successfully use Counterspell to counteract a spell
that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell’s
effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only
the original caster, even if it’s an area spell or it would normally
affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a
save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.
SUPERIOR BOND
FEAT 14
WIZARD
Prerequisites arcane bond
When you draw upon your bonded item, you can leave a bit of
energy within it for later use. You can use Drain Bonded Item
one additional time per day, but only to cast a spell 2 or more
levels lower than your highest-level spell.
16TH LEVEL
EFFORTLESS CONCENTRATION [free-action]
FEAT 16
WIZARD
Trigger Your turn begins.
You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately
gain the effects of the Sustain a Spell action, allowing you to
extend the duration of one of your active wizard spells.
SPELL TINKER [two-actions]
FEAT 16
CONCENTRATE
WIZARD
You’ve learned to alter choices you make when casting spells
on yourself. After casting a spell on only yourself that offers
several choices of effect (such as resist energy, spell immunity,
or a polymorph spell that offers several potential forms), you
can alter the choice you made when Casting the Spell (for
instance, choosing a different type of damage for resist energy).
However, your tinkering weakens the spell’s integrity, reducing
its remaining duration by half.
You can’t use this feat if the benefits of the spell have already
been used up or if the effects of the first choice would persist in
any way after switching (for instance, if one of the choices was
to create a consumable item you already used, or to heal you),
or if the feat would create an effect more powerful than that
offered by the base spell. The GM is the final arbiter of what
Spell Tinker can be applied to.
18TH LEVEL
INFINITE POSSIBILITIES 
FEAT 18
WIZARD
You’ve found a way to prepare a spell slot that exists in your
mind as many different possibilities at once. Once during your
daily preparations, you can use a spell slot to hold that infinite
potential, rather than using it to prepare a spell. You can use this
spell slot to cast any spell from your spellbook that’s at least
2 levels lower than the slot you designate; the spell acts in all
ways as a spell of 2 levels lower. You don’t have any particular
spell prepared in that slot until you cast it.
REPREPARE SPELL 
FEAT 18
WIZARD
You’ve discovered how to reuse some of your spell slots over
and over. You can spend 10 minutes to prepare a spell that
you already cast today, regaining access to that spell slot. The
spell must be of 4th level or lower and one that does not have
a duration. You can reprepare a spell in this way even if you’ve
already reprepared that spell previously in the same day.
If you have the spell substitution arcane thesis, you can
instead prepare a different spell in an expended slot, as long as
the new spell doesn’t have a duration. Once you’ve reprepared
a spell in that slot even once, you can use your arcane thesis
to substitute only spells without durations into that spell slot.
20TH LEVEL
ARCHWIZARD’S MIGHT 
FEAT 20
WIZARD
Prerequisites archwizard’s spellcraft
You have mastered the greatest secrets of arcane magic. You
gain an additional 10th-level spell slot.
METAMAGIC MASTERY 
FEAT 20
WIZARD
Altering your spells doesn’t take any longer than casting them
normally. You can use metamagic single actions as free actions.
SPELL COMBINATION 
FEAT 20
WIZARD
You can merge spells, producing multiple effects with a single
casting. One slot of each level of spell you can cast, except
2nd level and 1st level, becomes a spell combination slot (this
doesn’t apply to cantrips). When you prepare your spells, you
can fill a combination slot with a combination of two spells.
Each spell in the combination must be 2 or more spell levels
below the slot’s level, and both must target only one creature or
object or have the option to target only one creature or object.
Each spell in the combination must also have the same means of
determining whether it has an effect—both spells must require a
ranged spell attack roll, require the same type of saving throw,
or automatically affect the target.
When you cast a combined spell, it affects only one target,
even if the component spells normally affect more than one. If
any spell in the combination has further restrictions (such as
targeting only living creatures), you must abide by all restrictions.
The combined spell uses the shorter of the component spells’
ranges. Resolve a combined spell as if were a single spell, but
apply the effects of both component spells. For example, if the
spell’s target succeeded at the save against a combined spell, it
would apply the success effect of each spell, and if it critically
failed, it would apply the critical failure effect of both spells.

================================================================================

Animal Companions
An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows
your orders without you needing to use Handle an Animal
on it. Your animal companion has the minion trait, and it
gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command
an Animal action to command it; this is in place of the
usual effects of Command an Animal. If your companion
dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no
cost. You can have only one animal companion at a time.
Riding Animal Companions
You or an ally can ride your animal companion as long as
it is at least one size larger than the rider. If it is carrying a
rider, the animal companion can use only its land Speed, and
it can’t move and Support you on the same turn. However, if
your companion has the mount special ability, it’s especially
suited for riding and ignores both of these restrictions.
Young Animal Companions
The following are the base statistics for a young animal
companion, the first animal companion most characters
get. You make adjustments to these statistics depending
on the type of animal you choose. As you gain levels,
you might make further adjustments as your companion
becomes more powerful. Animal companions calculate
their modifiers and DCs just as you do with one difference:
the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to speed
and AC (their maximum item bonus to AC is +2).
Proficiencies
Your animal companion uses your level to determine its
proficiency bonuses. It’s trained in its unarmed attacks,
unarmored defense, barding, all saving throws, Perception,
Acrobatics, and Athletics. Animal companions can’t use
abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce
or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate
skill, unless they have a specialization that allows it.
Ability Modifiers
An animal companion begins with base ability modifiers
of Str +2, Dex +2, Con +1, Int –4, Wis +1, Cha +0. Each
type has its own strengths and increases two of these
modifiers by 1 each. These increases are already calculated
into the stat blocks in Companion Types below.
Hit Points
Your animal companion has ancestry Hit Points from
its type, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its
Constitution modifier for each level you have.
Mature Animal Companions
To advance a young animal companion to a mature animal
companion (usually a result of one of your class feat
choices), increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and
Wisdom modifiers by 1. Increase its unarmed attack damage
from one die to two dice (for instance 1d8 to 2d8), and its
proficiency rank for Perception and all saving throws to
expert. Increase its proficiency ranks in Intimidation, Stealth,
and Survival to trained, and if it was already trained in one
of those skills from its type, increase its proficiency rank in
that skill to expert. If your companion is Medium or smaller,
it grows by one size.
Nimble Animal Companions
To advance a mature animal companion to a nimble
animal companion, increase its Dexterity modifier by 2
and its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers
by 1. It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed
attacks. Increase its proficiency ranks in Acrobatics and
unarmored defense to expert. It also learns the advanced
maneuver for its type. Its attacks become magical for the
purpose of ignoring resistances.
Savage Animal Companions
To advance a mature animal companion to a savage animal
companion, increase its Strength modifier by 2 and its
Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals
3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase
its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns
the advanced maneuver for its type. If your companion is
Medium or smaller, it grows by one size. Its attacks become
magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.
Companion Types
The species of animal you choose is called your companion’s
type. Each companion type has its own statistics. The
Size entry indicates your companion’s starting size as a
young animal companion. Following the size entry are
the companion’s unarmed attacks, and then its ability
modifiers. The Hit Points entry indicates the companion’s
ancestry Hit Points. The Skill entry indicates an additional
trained skill your companion has. The Senses entry lists
your companion’s special senses. The Speed entry gives
your companion’s Speeds. The Special entry, if present, lists
any other special abilities your companion has, for example
whether it often serves as a mount and is particularly
appropriate for mounted classes, such as the champion.
The Support Benefit entry indicates a special benefit you
gain by Commanding the Animal to use the Support action
Animal Companions and Familiars
Some adventurers travel with loyal allies known as animal companions and familiars. The
former begin as young animals but acquire impressive physical abilities as you level up, while
the latter share a magical bond with you.

Requirements The animal companion’s last action was a

Specialized Animal Companions
Specialized animal companions are more intelligent and
engage in more complex behaviors. The first time an animal
gains a specialization, it gains the following: Its proficiency
rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert. Its proficiency
ranks for saving throws and Perception increase to master.
Increase its Dexterity modifier by 1 and its Intelligence

modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank for unarmored
defense increases to expert, or master if it’s nimble.

if it was already expert from its type), its Strength modifier
increases by 1, and its Charisma modifier increases by 3.

ignore half an object’s Hardness. Its Athletics proficiency
increases to master, and its Strength modifier increases
by 1.
Familiars
Familiars are mystically bonded creatures tied to your
magic. Most familiars were originally animals, though
the ritual of becoming a familiar makes them something
more. You can choose a Tiny animal you want as your
familiar, such as a bat, cat, raven, or snake. Some familiars
are different, usually described in the ability that granted
you a familiar; for example, a druid’s leshy familiar is a
Tiny plant instead of an animal, formed from a minor
nature spirit.
Familiars have the minion trait (page 634), so during
an encounter, they gain 2 actions in a round if you spend
an action to command them. If your familiar dies, you
can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost.
You can have only one familiar at a time.
Modifiers and AC
Your familiar’s save modifiers and AC are equal to
yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or
penalties. Its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers
are equal to your level plus your spellcasting ability
modifier (Charisma if you don’t have one, unless otherwise
specified). If it attempts an attack roll or other skill check, it
uses your level as its modifier. It doesn’t have or use its own
ability modifiers and can never benefit from item bonuses.
Hit Points
Your familiar has 5 Hit Points for each of your levels.

Size
Your familiar is Tiny.
Senses
Your familiar has low-light vision and can gain additional
senses from familiar abilities. It can communicate
empathically with you as long as it’s within 1 mile of you,
sharing emotions. It doesn’t understand or speak languages
normally, but it can gain speech from a familiar ability.
Movement
Your familiar has either a Speed of 25 feet or a swim
Speed of 25 feet (choose one upon gaining the familiar).
It can gain other movement types from familiar abilities.
Familiar and Master Abilities
Each day, you channel your magic into two abilities,
which can be either familiar or master abilities. If your
familiar is an animal that naturally has one of these
abilities (for instance, an owl has a fly Speed), you must
select that ability. Your familiar can’t be an animal that
naturally has more familiar abilities than your daily
maximum familiar abilities.
Familiar Abilities
Amphibious: It gains a swim Speed of 25 feet (or Speed of
25 feet if it already has a swim Speed).
Burrower: It gains a burrow Speed of 5 feet, allowing it
to dig Tiny holes.
Climber: It gains a climb Speed of 25 feet.
Damage Avoidance: Choose one type of save. It takes
no damage when it succeeds at that type of save; this
doesn’t prevent effects other than damage.
Darkvision: It gains darkvision.
Fast Movement: Increase one of the familiar’s Speeds
from 25 feet to 40 feet.
Flier: It gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.
Kinspeech: It can understand and speak with animals
of the same species. To select this, your familiar must be
an animal, it must have the speech ability, and you must
be at least 6th level.
Lab Assistant: It can use your Quick Alchemy action.
You must have Quick Alchemy, and your familiar must
be in your space. This has the same cost and requirement
as if you used it. It must have the manual dexterity
ability to select this.
Manual Dexterity: It can use up to two of its limbs as
if they were hands to use manipulate actions.
Scent: It gains scent (imprecise, 30 feet).
Speech: It understands and speaks a language
you know.
Master Abilities
Cantrip Connection: You can prepare an additional
cantrip, or if you have a repertoire, instead designate a
cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select
this ability; you can retrain it but can’t otherwise change
it. You must be able to prepare cantrips or add them to
your repertoire to select this.
Extra Reagents: Your familiar grows extra infused
reagents on or in its body. You gain an additional batch
of infused reagents. You must have the infused reagents
ability to select this ability.
Familiar Focus: Once per day, your familiar can use 2
actions with the concentrate trait to regain 1 Focus Point,
up to your usual maximum You must have a focus pool
to select this.
Lifelink: If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by
damage, as a reaction with the concentrate trait, you can
take the damage. If you do, you take all the damage and
your familiar takes none. However, if special effects when
a hit damages your familiar (such as snake venom) still
apply to your familiar.
Spell Battery: You gain one additional spell slot at least
3 levels lower than your highest-level spell slot; you
must be able to cast 4th-level spells using spell slots to
select this master ability.
Spell Delivery: If your familiar is in your space,
you can cast a spell with a range of touch, transfer
its power to your familiar, and command the
familiar to deliver the spell. If you do, the familiar
uses its 2 actions for the round to move to a target
of your choice and touch that target. If it doesn’t
reach the target to touch it this turn, the spell has
no effect.

PAGE 220
================================================================================

Applying an archetype requires you to select archetype feats
instead of class feats. Start by finding the archetype that
best fits your character concept, and select the archetype’s
dedication feat using one of your class feat choices. Once
you have the dedication feat, you can select any feat from
that archetype in place of a class feat as long as you meet its
prerequisites. The archetype feat you select is still subject
to any selection restrictions on the class feat it replaces. For
example, if you gained an ability at 6th level that granted
you a 4th-level class feat with the dwarf trait, you could
swap out that class feat only for an archetype feat of 4th
level or lower with the dwarf trait. Archetype feats you
gain in place of a class feat are called archetype class feats.
Occasionally, an archetype feat works like a skill
feat instead of a class feat. These archetype feats have
the skill trait, and you select them in place of a skill
feat, otherwise following the same rules above. These
are not archetype class feats (for instance, to determine
the number of Hit Points you gain from the Fighter
Resiliency archetype feat).
Each archetype’s dedication feat represents a certain
portion of your character’s time and focus, so once you
select a dedication feat for an archetype, you must satisfy
its requirements before you can gain another dedication
feat. Typically, you satisfy an archetype dedication feat
by gaining a certain number of feats from the archetype’s
list. You cannot retrain a dedication feat as long as you
have any other feats from that archetype.
Sometimes an archetype feat lets you gain another feat,
such as the alchemist’s basic concoction. You must always
meet the prerequisites of the feat you gain in this way.
Two special kinds of archetypes are designated by the
class and multiclass traits. The archetypes in this book
are all multiclass archetypes.
Multiclass Archetypes
Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying
your training into another class’s specialties. You can’t
select a multiclass archetype’s dedication feat if you are
a member of the class of the same name (for instance, a
fighter can’t select the Fighter Dedication feat).
Class Archetypes
Archetypes with the class trait represent a fundamental
divergence from your class’s specialties, but one that exists
within the context of your class. You can select a class
archetype only if you are a member of the class of the same
name. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a
class’s static class features, in addition to any new feats they
offer. It may be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level
if it alters or replaces some of the class’s initial class features.
In that case, you must take that archetype’s dedication feat
at 2nd level, and after that you proceed normally. You can
never have more than one class archetype.
Spellcasting Archetypes
Some archetypes grant you a substantial degree of
spellcasting, albeit delayed compared to a character
from a spellcasting class. In this book, the spellcasting
archetypes are bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and
wizard, the multiclass archetypes for the five main
spellcasting classes, but future books might introduce
spellcasting archetypes that aren’t multiclass archetypes.
A spellcasting archetype allows you to use scrolls,
staves, and wands in the same way that a member of a
spellcasting class can.
Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to
cast cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a
basic spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and
a master spellcasting feat. These feats share their name
with the archetype; for instance, the wizard’s master
spellcasting feat is called Master Wizard Spellcasting.
All spell slots you gain from spellcasting archetypes
have restrictions depending on the archetype; for
instance, the bard archetype grants you spell slots
you can use only to cast occult spells from your bard
repertoire, even if you are a sorcerer with occult spells
in your sorcerer repertoire.
Basic Spellcasting Feat: Available at 4th level, these feats
grant a 1st-level spell slot. At 6th level, they grant you a
2nd‑level spell slot. At 8th level, they grant you a 3rd-
level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“basic spellcasting benefits.”
Expert Spellcasting Feat: Taken at 12th level, these feats
make you an expert in spell attack rolls and DCs of the
appropriate magical tradition and grant you a 4th-level
spell slot. At 14th level, they grant you a 5th-level spell
slot, and at 16th level, they grant you a 6th-level spell
slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the “expert
spellcasting benefits.”
Master Spellcasting Feat: Upon reaching 18th level,
these feats make you a master in spell attack rolls and
DCs of the appropriate magical tradition and grant you
a 7th-level spell slot. At 20th level, they grant you an 8th-
level spell slot. Archetypes refer to these benefits as the
“master spellcasting benefits.”
Archetypes
There are infinite possible character concepts, but you might find that the feats and skill
choices from a single class aren’t sufficient to fully realize your character. Archetypes allow
you to expand the scope of your character’s class.

Alchemist
You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and
substances in your spare time, and your studies have
progressed beyond mere experimentation.
Multiclass alchemist characters
The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype
are extremely useful to characters of any class. The
following are just some of the possible combinations.
•
Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with
their rage to ferocious effect.
•	 Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical
items that boost defenses and heal others,
allowing their champion’s reaction
and lay on hands to go further.
•	 Fighter alchemists can use their
alchemy to gain additional options
in situations where their usual
tactics don’t work.
•	 Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy
and snares, getting extra use out of
their Crafting skill and supplying
bombs for the bomb snare.
• Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison
feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an
interesting way to sneak attack with various types
of energy damage.
• 	 Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical
items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared
spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can
brew up darksight elixirs to grant darkvision can
prepare another spell instead of darkvision.

Cleric
You are an ordained priest of your deity and have even
learned how to cast a few divine spells. Though your main
training lies elsewhere, your religious calling provides
you divine gifts.
Multiclass Cleric characters
The cleric archetype is a great way to create a character
of another class who’s a devotee of a particular deity.
The many domains available to clerics of different deities
present a variety of options for focus spells.
•	 Alchemist clerics work well with the chirurgeon
field, healing various ailments with either alchemy
or spells.
•	 Martial clerics are typically looking for a potent
domain spell or some healing to use in a pinch.
•	 Divine sorcerer clerics double down as the ultimate
divine spellcasters.
•	 Other spellcaster clerics diversify their options,
becoming theurgic characters who combine two
magical traditions.

Fighter
You have spent time learning the art of warfare, increasing
your skill with martial arms and at wearing armor. With
further training, you can become a true combat specialist.
Multiclass Fighter characters
The fighter archetype grants access to great feats
for characters focusing on any combat style, and it’s
particularly helpful for characters looking to diversify their
offensive abilities or focus on more powerful weapons.
•	 Barbarian fighters can combine their talents with
two-handed weapons with some of the fighter’s
two-handed feats to devastating effect.
•	 Champion fighters focus on a style of combat
exemplified by their deity. A shield-using champion
benefits from the best of both worlds in shield feats.
•	 Monk fighters are great at combining unusual
weapon styles. For instance, a monks
isn’t hindered by a restriction to
keep one hand free, because they
want to punch you with that
hand anyway.
•	 Ranger fighters can either specialize in archery
or use their fighter feats to pick up an unusual
combat style combination.
•	 Rogue fighters can make good use of fighter’s free
hand, two-weapon fighting, or archery feats.
•	 Spellcaster fighters benefit greatly from the additional
weapon proficiencies, and fighter is a solid choice for
any spellcaster of a particularly martial bent.

Monk
Monastic training has taught you martial arts and allowed

Multiclass MONK characters
The monk archetype is a strong choice for any character

and add mobility to the fighter’s toolkit.

Ranger
You have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness
survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set.
Multiclass Ranger characters
The ranger archetype has access to excellent options to
improve a character’s monster knowledge and survival
skills, but ranger is of particular interest to any character
wanting to become a dedicated archer.
•	 Alchemist rangers can add snares to their daily
free items, benefiting from a strong Crafting
modifier, and their Intelligence makes them
exceptional with monster knowledge feats. The
ranger archetype is also useful to bombers who
want to alternate with in bow attacks.
•	 Champion rangers are particularly fitting for
deities who connect thematically to nature or have
a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of
Erastil, both!)
•	 Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome
archers, combining the best archery feats from
both classes to create a fighting style unique to
each fighter ranger.
•	 Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged
skirmishers, and snares let them be on the other
side of traps for a change.
•	 Spellcaster rangers benefit greatly from ranger’s
feat support, backing up their spells with ranged
weapon attacks. Druids have the most thematic
overlap with rangers among the spellcasters,
allowing you to create a true master of
the wilderness.

Rogue
You’ve learned to sneak, steal, and disable traps. With time
and luck, you’ll become capable of moving through the
shadows, striking unseen, and escaping without notice.
Multiclass Rogue characters
Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills
and tricks the rogue archetype grants.
•	 Alchemist rogues can use the rogue’s Poison
Weapon to great effect with their daily poisons,
and sneak attack is a nice boost to bomb damage.
•	 Barbarian rogues can become masters in every
save and diversify their skills.
•	 Champion rogues add damage from sneak attack
while protecting their flanking partners from harm.
•	 Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with
extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or
finesse fighters.
•	 Monk rogues have great synergy, since many stances
grant powerful Strikes that work with sneak attack.
•	 Ranger rogues benefit from the shared focus on
trailing foes and catching them flat-footed. The
flurry edge can get you many sneak attacks, and the
precision edge doubles down on precision damage.
•	 Spellcaster rogues use the rogue multiclass to shore
up skills or to pick up tricky rogue feats
like Mobility to help keep them safe.

================================================================================

Chapter 4: Skills
While your character’s ability scores represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent
their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your
character’s ability scores and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise
in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class. In this chapter,
you’ll learn about skills, their scope, and the actions they can be used for.
A character’s acumen in skills can come from all sorts of training, from practicing
acrobatic tricks to studying academic topics to rehearsing a performing art. When
you create your character and as they advance in level, you have flexibility as to
which skills they become better at and when. Some classes depend heavily on
certain skills—such as the alchemist’s reliance on Crafting—but for most classes,
you can choose whichever skills make the most sense for your character’s theme and
backstory at 1st level, then use their adventure and downtime experiences to inform
how their skills should improve as your character levels up.
A character gains training in certain skills at 1st level: typically two skills from
their background, a small number of predetermined skills from their class, and
several skills of your choice granted by your class. This training increases your
proficiency ranks for those skills to trained instead of untrained and lets you use
more of the skills’ actions. Sometimes you might gain training in a specific skill from
multiple sources, such as if your background granted training in Crafting and you
took the alchemist class, which also grants training in Crafting. Each time after the
first that you would gain the trained proficiency rank in a given skill, you instead
allocate the trained proficiency to any other skill of your choice.
Key Ability
Each skill is tied to a key ability. You add your modifier for this ability to checks
and DCs when using that skill. For example, skulking about the shadows of a city at
night with Stealth uses your Dexterity modifier, navigating the myriad personalities
and power plays of court politics with Society uses your Intelligence modifier, and
so on. The key ability for each skill is listed on Table 4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and
Actions on page 235 and also appears in parentheses following the skill’s name
in the descriptions on the following pages. If the GM deems it appropriate for a
certain situation, however, they might have you use a different ability modifier for
a skill check or when determining your skill DC.
Skill Actions
The actions you can perform with a given skill are sorted into those you can use
untrained and those that require you to be trained in the skill, as shown on Table
4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and Actions (page 235). The untrained and trained actions
of each skill appear in separate sections within the skill’s description.
Anyone can use a skill’s untrained actions, but you can use trained actions only
if you have a proficiency rank of trained or better in that skill. A circumstance,
condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your proficiency
rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a
higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table. For instance, even though
a barbarian untrained in Arcana could identify a construct with a lucky roll using
Arcana to Recall Knowledge, the GM might decide that Recalling Knowledge
to determine the spells used to create such a construct is beyond the scope of
the barbarian’s anecdotal knowledge. The GM decides whether a task requires a
particular proficiency rank.
IMPROVING SKILLS
As your character advances
in level, there are two main
ways their skills improve: skill
increases and skill feats. Your
class lists the levels at which you
gain each of these improvements.
SKILL INCREASES
Skill increases improve your
proficiency in skills of your
choice. You can use these
increases to become trained
in new skills or increase your
proficiency rank in skills you’re
trained in (from trained to
expert at any level, expert to
master at 7th level or higher,
and master to legendary at 15th
level or higher). Unlike when
you first become trained at a
skill, if two different abilities
would make you an expert,
master, or legendary in a skill,
you don’t get to choose a second
skill to become expert in—the
redundant benefit simply has
no effect.
SKILL FEATS
Skill feats are a type of general
feat that often grant you a
new way to use a skill or make
you better at using a skill in a
particular way. Skill feats always
have the skill trait. These feats
appear in Chapter 5.
