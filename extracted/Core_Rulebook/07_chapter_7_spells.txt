Chapter 7: Spells
Whether it comes in the form of mystic artifacts, mysterious creatures, or wizards weaving
strange spells, magic brings fantasy and wonder to Pathfinder. This chapter explains how spells
work and how spellcasters prepare and cast their spells.
SPELLBOOKS
Carefully maintained and
jealously guarded, there are
few things more valuable to a
wizard than a spellbook. These
repositories of magical lore are
often trapped and warded to
ensure that no one meddles
with the secrets inside.
Although spellbooks play
a central role in a wizard’s
daily routine, other prepared
spellcasting classes have been
known to use spellbooks to
record uncommon or even rare
spells. Such a resource allows
a caster to treat the spell like
any other common spell, so long
as they can reference the book
during their daily preparations.

================================================================================

Evocation
Evocations capture magical energy and then shape it to
harm your foes or protect your allies. Evocation spells
often have a trait that comes from the type of damage
they deal, such as acid, cold, fire, force, or sonic.
Illusion
Illusions create the semblance of something real, fooling
the eyes, ears, and other senses. They almost always have
the mental trait, and depending on how the illusion is
perceived, they might also have the auditory or visual trait.
Necromancy
Necromancy spells harness the power of life and death.
They can sap life essence or sustain creatures with
life-saving  healing. Necromancy spells often have the
curse, death, healing, negative, or positive traits.
Transmutation
Transmutation spells make alterations to or transform
the physical form of a creature or object. The morph and
polymorph traits appear primarily in transmutation spells.
Spell Slots
Characters of spellcasting classes can cast a certain
number of spells each day; the spells you can cast in a
day are referred to as spell slots. At 1st level, a character
has only a small number of 1st-level spell slots per day,
but as you advance in level, you gain more spell slots and
new slots for higher-level spells. A spell’s level indicates its
overall power, from 1 to 10.
Prepared Spells
If you’re a prepared spellcaster—such as a cleric, druid, or
wizard—you must spend time each day preparing spells for
that day. At the start of your daily preparations, you select
a number of spells of different spell levels determined by
your character level and class. Your spells remain prepared
until you cast them or until you prepare spells again.
Each prepared spell is expended after a single casting,
so if you want to cast a particular spell more than once in
a day, you need to prepare that spell multiple times. The
exceptions to this rule are spells with the cantrip trait;
once you prepare a cantrip, you can cast it as many times
as you want until the next time you prepare spells. See
page 300 for more information on cantrips.
You might gain an ability that allows you to swap
prepared spells or perform other aspects of preparing
spells at different times throughout the day, but only your
daily preparation counts for the purpose of effects that
last until the next time you prepare spells.
Spontaneous Spells
If you’re a spontaneous spellcaster—such as a bard or
a sorcerer—you choose which spell you’re using a spell
SPELL ATTACK ROLL AND SPELL DC
Many spells allow creatures to defend themselves using
either their AC or a saving throw. Two statistics govern
how potent your spells are against these defenses: your
spell attack roll and your spell DC. When recording these
on your character sheet, add together only the numbers
that always apply—usually just your ability modifier and
proficiency bonus.
Spell attack roll = your spellcasting ability modifier +
proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
Spell DC = 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier +
proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
A spell attack roll is like other attack rolls, so any bonuses
or penalties that apply to all your attack rolls should be
included in your calculation. For instance, the +1 status
bonus from the bless spell would benefit your spell ray just
like it could an arrow. However, note that the spell attack roll
doesn’t gain any bonuses or penalties that apply specifically
to weapon attacks or unarmed attacks. The multiple attack
penalty applies to spell attacks, so it’s usually a bad idea to
cast a spell that has a spell attack roll if you’ve already made
an attack that turn.
As with other checks and DCs, bonuses can increase the
result of your spell attack roll or your spell DC, and penalties
can decrease the result of your spell attack roll or your spell
DC. See pages 444–445 in Chapter 9: Playing the Game for
more information about modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.
DISBELIEVING ILLUSIONS
Sometimes illusions allow an affected creature a chance
to disbelieve the spell, which lets the creature effectively
ignore the spell if it succeeds at doing so. This usually
happens when a creature Seeks or otherwise spends
actions to engage with the illusion, comparing the result
of its Perception check (or another check or saving throw,
at the GM’s discretion) to the caster’s spell DC. Mental
illusions typically provide rules in the spell’s description
for disbelieving the effect (often allowing the affected
creature to attempt a Will save).
If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with
the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what
it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is
present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without
successfully disbelieving it. For instance, if a character
is pushed through the illusion of a door, they will know
that the door is an illusion, but they still can’t see
through it. Disbelieving an illusion makes it and those
things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, so even in the
case where a visual illusion is disbelieved, it may, at the
GM’s discretion, block vision enough to make those on
the other side concealed..

================================================================================

Spellcasters cast spells from one of four different spell
lists, each representing a different  magical tradition:
arcane, divine, occult, and primal.
Your class determines which tradition of magic your
spells use. In some cases, such as when a cleric gains
spells from their deity or when a sorcerer gets spells
from their bloodline, you might be able to cast spells
Arcane
Arcane spellcasters use logic
and rationality to categorize
the magic inherent in the
world around them. Because
of its far-reaching approach,
the arcane tradition has
the broadest spell list,
though it’s generally poor
at affecting the spirit or the
soul. Wizards are the most
iconic arcane spellcasters,
poring over tomes and
grimoires, though arcane
sorcerers study the secrets
of their blood to unlock the
power within themselves.
Occult
The practitioners of
occult traditions seek
to understand the
unexplainable, categorize
the bizarre, and otherwise
access the ephemeral in
a systematic way. Bards
are the most iconic occult
spellcasters, collecting
strange esoterica and
using their performances
to influence the mind
or elevate the soul, and
occult sorcerers strive to
understand the mysterious
power in their blood.
Divine
The power of the divine is
steeped in faith, the unseen,
and belief in a power source
from beyond the Material
Plane. Clerics are the most
iconic divine spellcasters,
beseeching the gods to
grant them their magic.
Divine sorcerers can use
the blood of their celestial
or fiendish ancestors
as a divine conduit, and
champions call upon
their gods to grant them
martial prowess through
divine guidance.
Primal
An instinctual connection
to and faith in the world,
the cycle of day and night,
the turning of the seasons,
and the natural selection
of predator and prey drive
the primal tradition. Druids
are the most iconic primal
spellcasters, calling upon
the magic of nature through
deep faith and a connection
to the plants and animals
around them, and primal
sorcerers call upon their fey
or beast blood to harness
the same natural energies.
from a different spell list. In these cases, the spell uses
your magic tradition, not the list the spell normally
comes from. When you cast a spell, add your tradition’s
trait to the spell.
Some types of magic, such as that of most magic
items, don’t belong to any single tradition. These have
the magical trait instead of a tradition trait.
MAGICAL TRADITIONS
slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This provides
you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but you
have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined
by your character level and class. When you make your
daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but
you don’t get to change the spells in your repertoire.
Heightened Spells
Both prepared and spontaneous spellcasters can cast a
spell at a higher spell level than that listed for the spell.
This is called heightening the spell. A prepared spellcaster
can heighten a spell by preparing it in a higher-level slot
than its normal spell level, while a spontaneous spellcaster
can heighten a spell by casting it using a higher-level
spell slot, so long as they know the spell at that level
(see Heightened Spontaneous Spells below). When you
heighten your spell, the spell’s level increases to match
the higher level of the spell slot you’ve prepared it in or
used to cast it. This is useful for any spell, because some
effects, such as counteracting, depend on the spell’s level.
In addition, many spells have additional specific
benefits when they are heightened, such as increased
damage. These extra benefits are described at the end
of the spell’s stat block. Some heightened entries specify
one or more levels at which the spell must be prepared
or cast to gain these extra advantages. Each of these
heightened entries states specifically which aspects of
the spell change at the given level. Read the heightened
entry only for the spell level you’re using or preparing;
if its benefits are meant to include any of the effects of
a lower-level heightened entry, those benefits will be
included in the entry.
Other heightened entries give a number after a plus
sign, indicating that heightening grants extra advantages
over multiple levels. The listed effect applies for every
increment of levels by which the spell is heightened above
its lowest spell level, and the benefit is cumulative. For
example, fireball says “Heightened (+1) The damage
increases by 2d6.” Because fireball deals 6d6 fire damage
at 3rd level, a 4th-level fireball would deal 8d6 fire
damage, a 5th-level spell would deal 10d6 fire damage,
and so on.
Heightened Spontaneous Spells
If you’re a spontaneous spellcaster, you must know a spell
at the specific level that you want to cast it in order to
heighten it. You can add a spell to your spell repertoire
at more than a single level so that you have more options
when casting it. For example, if you added fireball to your
repertoire as a 3rd-level spell and again as a 5th-level
spell, you could cast it as a 3rd-level or a 5th-level spell;
however, you couldn’t cast it as a 4th-level spell.
Many spontaneous spellcasting classes provide abilities
like the signature spells class feature, which allows you
to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions
even if you know the spell at only a single level.

================================================================================

Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that’s weaker than other
spells but can be used with greater freedom and flexibility.
The title of a cantrip’s stat block says “Cantrip” instead
of “Spell.” Casting a cantrip doesn’t use up your spell
slots; you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. If you’re a prepared caster, you have a number of
cantrip spell slots that you use to prepare your cantrips.
You can’t prepare a cantrip in any other slot.
A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half
your level, rounded up. For a typical spellcaster, this means
its level is equal to the highest level of spell slot you have.
Focus Spells
Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from
a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific
source. You can learn focus spells only through special class
features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list.
Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of
Focus Points—you can’t prepare a focus spell in a spell slot
or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can’t
spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren’t focus spells.
Even some classes that don’t normally grant spellcasting,
such as the champion and monk, can grant focus spells.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can’t cast a
focus spell if its minimum level is greater than half your
level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.
Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point.
You automatically gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point the
first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell.
You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during
your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus
activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune
yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain a
Focus Point.
Some abilities allow you to increase the Focus Points
in your pool beyond 1. Typically, these are feats that give
you a new focus spell and increase the number of points
in your pool by 1. Your focus pool can’t have a capacity
beyond 3 Focus Points, even if feats that increase your pool
would cause it to exceed this number.
REFOCUS
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
Requirements You have a focus pool, and you have spent at
least 1 Focus Point since you last regained any Focus Points.
You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your
magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus
pool. The deeds you need to perform are specified in the
class or ability that gives you your focus spells. These deeds
can usually overlap with other tasks that relate to the source
of your focus spells. For instance, a cleric with focus spells
from a good deity can usually Refocus while tending the
wounds of their allies, and a wizard of the illusionist school
might be able to Refocus while attempting to Identify Magic
of the illusion school.
Spells that affect certain physical or metaphysical forces
tend to be grouped into particular magical traditions.
Scholars of magic widely agree that all of existence is
composed of some combination of four essences, though
they disagree on the names and particular qualities of
each essence.
Matter
Also called body, material
essence, or physical
essence, matter is the
fundamental building
block that makes up all
physical things in the
universe. The arcane
and primal traditions
are especially attuned
toward manipulating and
shaping matter. Spells
that are used to create
or alter matter most
often come from the
conjuration, evocation, or
transmutation schools.
Mind
Also called thought or
astral essence, the mind
essence allows thinking
creatures to have rational
thoughts, ideas, plans,
logic, and memories. Mind
touches even nonsapient
creatures like animals,
though in a more limited
capacity. Arcane and
occult casters usually
excel at mind spells. Spells
that use mind essence
are usually found in the
divination, enchantment,
and illusion schools.
Spirit
Also called soul, ethereal
essence, or spiritual
essence, spirit is an
otherworldly building block
that makes up a being’s
immaterial and immortal
self. The spirit travels
through the Ethereal Plane
and into the Great Beyond
after the death of the
physical body. The spirit
is most easily affected by
divine and occult spells.
Spirit spells are usually
of the divination or
necromancy schools.
Life
Also called heart, faith,
instinct, or vital essence,
life represents the
animating universal force
within all things. Whereas
matter provides the base
materials for a body, life
keeps it alive and well. This
essence is responsible for
unconscious responses and
belief, such as ancestral
instincts and divine
guidance. The divine and
primal traditions hold
power over life. Life spells
are usually necromancy.
The following entries discuss each essence and the
traditions and spell schools relevant to it; for instance,
evocation spells tend to manipulate matter. The abjuration
school is an unusual case, as abjuration spells draw upon
different essences depending on who they are warding
and what they are protecting against.
THE FOUR ESSENCES

================================================================================

Some spells and effects have traits such as “mental” or
“good.” These tell you more about the spell and how it works,
and other rules might reference them. A creature might, for
example, have a –2 circumstance penalty to saving throws
against mental effects. Below is a glossary of a few traits
you might see with important rules.
Auditory
Auditory spells rely on sound. A spell with the auditory trait
has its effect only if the target can hear it. This is different
from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can’t hear
it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect makes sound.
Darkness and Light
Effects with the darkness and light traits interact in specific
ways. Non-magical light always shines in non-magical
darkness and always fails to shine in magical darkness.
Magical light always shines in non-magical darkness but
shines in magical darkness only if the light spell has a higher
level than that of the darkness effect. Spells with the darkness
trait or the light trait can always counteract one another, but
bringing light and darkness into contact doesn’t automatically
do so. You must usually cast a light spell on a darkness effect
directly to counteract it (and vice versa), but some spells
automatically attempt to counteract opposing effects.
Incapacitation
An ability with this trait can take a character completely out
of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more
powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any
creature of more than twice the spell’s level treats the result
of their check to prevent being incapacitated as one degree of
success better or the result of any check the spellcaster made
to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any
other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher
level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect
gains the same benefits.
Minion
Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature.
A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn
and can’t use reactions. Your minion acts on your turn in
combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue
it commands. For an animal companion, you Command
an Animal; for a minion that’s a spell or magic item effect
like a summoned minion you Sustain a Spell or Sustain
an Activation; and if not otherwise specified, you issue a
verbal command, which is a single action with the auditory
and concentrate traits. If given no commands, by default
minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to
escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough,
typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act,
animals often indulge their creature comforts, and sapient
minions act how they please.
Morph
Spells that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph
trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are
magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once,
but if you morph the same body part more than once, the
second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the
same manner as two polymorph effects, described below).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed
and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph
effect. For instance, a morph that gave you wings would be
dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that had wings of
its own (though if your new form lacked wings, you’d keep
the wings from your morph). The GM determines which
morph effects can be used together and which can’t.
Polymorph
These effects transform the target into a new form. A target
can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect
at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph
effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract
the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the
spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically
granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise
stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to take on the
appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a
generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the
special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses,
status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the
battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and
using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there’s
doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.)
Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your
gear still function, but you can’t activate any items.
Summoned
A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the
summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other
creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a
cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal
or higher level than the spell that summoned it, the spell fails
and the summon spell ends. Otherwise, it uses the standard
abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your
enemies to the best of its abilities. If you can communicate
with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM
determines the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the
summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn.
Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells
and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0
Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.
Visual
A visual spell can affect only creatures that can see it.

================================================================================

Spellcasters with Focus Spells
If you are a spellcaster, your focus spells are the same
tradition of spell as the class that gave you the focus
spell. A bard’s are occult, a cleric’s are divine, a druid’s
are primal, a wizard’s are arcane, and a sorcerer’s are
determined by their bloodline.
Non-Spellcasters with Focus Spells
If you get focus spells from a class or other source that
doesn’t grant spellcasting ability (for example, if you’re
a monk with the Ki Strike feat), the ability that gives you
focus spells also provides your proficiency rank for spell
attack rolls and spell DCs, as well as the magical tradition of
your focus spells. You gain the ability to Cast a Spell and use
any spellcasting actions necessary to cast your focus spells
(see below). However, you don’t qualify for feats and other
rules that require you to be a spellcaster.
Innate Spells
Certain spells are natural to your character, typically
coming from your ancestry or a magic item rather than
your class. You can cast your innate spells even if you
aren’t a member of a spellcasting class. The ability that
gives you an innate spell tells you how often you can cast
it—usually once per day—and its magical tradition. Innate
spells are refreshed during your daily preparations. Innate
cantrips are cast at will and automatically heightened as
normal for cantrips (see Cantrips on page  300) unless
otherwise specified.
You’re always trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs
for your innate spells, even if you aren’t otherwise trained
in spell attack rolls or spell DCs. If your proficiency in
spell attack rolls or spell DCs is expert or better, apply
that proficiency to your innate spells, too. You use your
Charisma modifier as your spellcasting ability modifier
for innate spells unless otherwise specified.
If you have an innate spell, you can cast it, even if
it’s not of a spell level you can normally cast. This is
especially common for monsters, which might be able to
cast innate spells far beyond what a character of the
same level could use.
You can’t use your spell slots to cast your innate
spells, but you might have an innate spell and
also be able to prepare or cast the same spell
through your class. You also can’t heighten
innate spells, but some abilities that
grant innate spells might give you the
spell at a higher level than its base level or
change the level at which you cast the spell.
Casting Spells
The casting of a spell can range from a simple word of
magical might that creates a fleeting effect to a complex
process taking minutes or hours to cast and producing
a long-term impact. Casting a Spell is a special activity
that takes a number of actions defined by the spell. When
you Cast a Spell, your spellcasting creates obvious visual
manifestations of the gathering magic, although feats such
as Conceal Spell (page 210) and Melodious Spell (page 101)
can help hide such manifestations or otherwise prevent
observers from noticing that you are casting.
CAST A SPELL
You cast a spell you have prepared or in your repertoire. Casting
a Spell is a special activity that takes a variable number of actions
depending on the spell, as listed in each spell’s stat block. As soon
as the spellcasting actions are complete, the spell effect occurs.
Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those
cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as
appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted
in the spell’s stat block—for example, “[reaction] verbal.”
Long Casting Times Some spells take minutes or hours to
cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix
of the listed spell components, but it’s not necessary to break
down which one you’re providing at a given time. You can’t use
other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at
the GM’s discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences.
As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have
the exploration trait, and you can’t cast them in an encounter.
If combat breaks out while you’re casting one, your spell is
disrupted (see Disrupted and Lost Spells on page 303).
FOCUS POINTS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
It’s possible, especially through archetypes, to gain focus
spells and Focus Points from more than one source. If this
happens, you have just one focus pool, adding all the Focus
Points together to determine the total size of your pool.
(Remember that the maximum number of Focus Points a
pool can have is 3.) If you have multiple abilities that give
you a focus pool, each one adds 1 Focus Point to your pool.
For instance, if you were a cleric with the Domain Initiate
feat, you would have a pool with 1 Focus Point. Let’s say
you then took the champion multiclass archetype and the
Healing Touch feat. Normally, this feat would give you a
focus pool. Since you already have one, it instead increases
your existing pool’s capacity by 1.
Focus Points are not differentiated by source; you
can spend any of your Focus Points on any of your
focus spells. Likewise, when you Refocus, you get
back a point as long as you follow the guidelines
of any abilities that granted you focus
spells. Having Focus Points from multiple
sources doesn’t change the tradition of
your spells; if you had both cleric domain
spells and druid order spells, your domain spells
would remain divine and the order spells primal. This
could mean that you need to keep track of a different
proficiency and ability modifier with the spell DC and spell
attack roll of different focus spells.
Core Rulebook

PAGE 304
================================================================================

Spell Components Each spell lists the spell components
required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as “[three-actions]
material, somatic, verbal." The spell components, described in
detail below, add traits and requirements to the Cast a Spell
activity. If you can’t provide the components, you fail to Cast
the Spell.
•	 Material (manipulate)
•	 Somatic (manipulate)
•	 Verbal (concentrate)
•	 Focus (manipulate)
Disrupted and Lost Spells Some abilities and spells can
disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When
you lose a spell, you’ve already expended the spell slot, spent
the spell’s costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity.
If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain a Spell action, the spell
immediately ends. The full rules for disrupting actions appear
on page 462.
Spell Components
A spell description lists the components required to Cast
the Spell. For most spells, the number of components is
equal to the number of actions you must spend to Cast
the Spell. Each component adds certain traits to the
Cast a Spell activity, and some components have special
requirements. The components that appear in this book
are listed below.
Material
A material component is a bit of physical matter
consumed in the casting of the spell. The spell gains the
manipulate trait and requires you to have a free hand
to retrieve and manipulate a material component. That
component is expended in the casting (even if the spell
is disrupted).
Except in extreme circumstances, you can assume
all common components are included in a material
component pouch (page 290).
Somatic
A somatic component is a specific hand movement or
gesture that generates a magical nexus. The spell gains the
manipulate trait and requires you to make gestures. You
can use this component while holding something in
your hand, but not if you are restrained or otherwise
unable to gesture freely.
Spells that require you to touch the target require
a somatic component. You can do so while holding
something as long as part of your hand is able to touch
the target (even if it’s through a glove or gauntlet).
Verbal
A verbal component is a vocalization of words of power.
You must speak them in a strong voice, so it’s hard to
conceal that you’re Casting a Spell. The spell gains
the concentrate trait. You must be able to speak to
provide this component.
COMPONENT SUBSTITUTIONS
Some classes can substitute one component for another
or alter how a component works.
If you’re a bard Casting a Spell from the occult tradition
while holding a musical instrument, you can play that
instrument to replace any material, somatic, or verbal
components the spell requires by using the instrument as
a focus component instead. Cast a Spell gains the auditory
trait if you make this substitution. Unlike the normal rules
for a focus component, you can’t retrieve or stow the
instrument when making this substitution.
If you’re a cleric Casting a Spell from the divine tradition
while holding a divine focus (such as a religious symbol or
text), you can replace any material component the spell
requires by using the divine focus as a focus component
instead. Unlike the normal rules for a focus component,
you can’t retrieve or stow the focus when making
this substitution.
If you’re a druid Casting a Spell from the primal tradition
while holding a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe),
you can replace any material component the spell requires
by using the primal focus as a focus component instead.
Unlike the normal rules for a focus component, you can’t
retrieve or stow the focus when making this substitution.
If you’re a sorcerer Casting a Spell from the magical
tradition that matches your bloodline, you can draw
on the magic within your blood to replace any material
component with a somatic component.
Focus
A focus is an object that funnels the magical energy of
the spell. The spell gains the manipulate trait and requires
you to either have a free hand to retrieve the focus listed
in the spell or already be holding the focus in your hand.
As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the focus (if
necessary), manipulate it, and can stow it again if you
so choose.
Foci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them
in advance to Cast the Spell.

================================================================================

Ranges, Areas, and Targets
Spells with a range can affect targets, create areas, or
make things appear only within that range. Most spell
ranges are measured in feet, though some can stretch over
miles, reach anywhere on the planet, or go even farther!
Touch Range
A spell with a range of touch requires you to physically
touch the target. You use your unarmed reach to
determine whether you can touch the creature. You can
usually touch the target automatically, though the spell
might specify that the target can attempt a saving throw
or that you must attempt a spell attack roll. If an ability
increases the range of a touch spell, start at 0 feet and
increase from there.
Areas
Sometimes a spell has an area, which can be a burst,
cone, emanation, or line. The method of measuring these
areas can be found on page 456. If the spell originates
from your position, the spell has only an area; if you can
cause the spell’s area to appear farther away from you,
the spell has both a range and an area.
Targets
Some spells allow you to directly target a creature, an
object, or something that fits a more specific category. The
target must be within the spell’s range, and you must be
able to see it (or otherwise perceive it with a precise sense)
to target it normally. At the GM’s discretion, you can
attempt to target a creature you can’t see, as described
in Detecting Creatures on pages 465–467. If you fail to
target a particular creature, this doesn’t change how the
spell affects any other targets the spell might have.
If you choose a target that isn’t valid, such as if you
thought a vampire was a living creature and targeted it
with a spell that can target only living creatures, your
spell fails to target that creature. If a creature starts out
as a valid target but ceases to be one during a spell’s
duration, the spell typically ends, but the GM might
decide otherwise in certain situations.
Spells that affect multiple creatures in an area can have
both an Area entry and a Targets entry. A spell that has
an area but no targets listed usually affects all creatures
in the area indiscriminately.
Some spells restrict you to willing targets. A player
can declare their character a willing or unwilling target
at any time, regardless of turn order or their character’s
condition (such as when a character is paralyzed,
unconscious, or even dead).
Line of Effect
You usually need an unobstructed path to the target of a
spell, the origin point of an area, or the place where you
create something with a spell. More information on line
of effect can be found on page 457.
Durations
The duration of a spell is how long the spell effect lasts.
Spells that last for more than an instant have a Duration
entry. A spell might last until the start or end of a turn, for
some number of rounds, for minutes, or even longer. If a
spell’s duration is given in rounds, the number of rounds
remaining decreases by 1 at the start of each of the
spellcaster’s turns, ending when the duration reaches 0.
Some spells have effects that remain even after the
spell’s magic is gone. Any ongoing effect that isn’t part
of the spell’s duration entry isn’t considered magical.
For instance, a spell that creates a loud sound and has
no duration might deafen someone for a time, even
permanently. This deafness couldn’t be counteracted
because it is not itself magical (though it might be cured
by other magic, such as restore senses).
If a spell’s caster dies or is incapacitated during the spell’s
duration, the spell remains in effect till its duration ends.
You might need to keep track of the caster’s initiative after
they stopped being able to act to monitor spell durations.
Sustaining Spells
If the spell’s duration is “sustained,” it lasts until the end
of your next turn unless you use a Sustain a Spell action
on that turn to extend the duration of that spell.
SUSTAIN A SPELL [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
Requirements You have at least one spell active with a
sustained duration, and you are not fatigued.
Choose one spell with a sustained duration you have in effect.
The duration of that spell continues until the end of your next
turn. Some spells might have slightly different or expanded
effects if you sustain them. Sustaining a Spell for more than 10
minutes (100 rounds) ends the spell and makes you fatigued
unless the spell lists a different maximum duration (such as
“sustained up to 1 minute” or “sustained up to 1 hour”).
If your Sustain a Spell action is disrupted, the spell
immediately ends.
METAMAGIC
Many spellcasters can gain access to metamagic
actions, typically by selecting metamagic feats. Actions
with the metamagic trait tweak the properties of your
spells, changing their range, damage, or any number
of other properties. You must use a metamagic action
directly before the spell you want to alter. If you use any
action (including free actions, reactions, and additional
metamagic actions) other than Cast a Spell directly after,
you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any
additional effects added by a metamagic action are part
of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself.
Core Rulebook

PAGE 306
================================================================================

Long Durations
If a spell’s duration says it lasts until your next daily
preparations, on the next day you can refrain from
preparing a new spell in that spell’s slot. (If you are
a spontaneous caster, you can instead expend a spell
slot during your preparations.) Doing so extends the
spell’s duration until your next daily preparations. This
effectively Sustains the Spell over a long period of time.
If you prepare a new spell in the slot (or don’t expend
a spell slot), the spell ends. You can’t do this if the spell
didn’t come from one of your spell slots. If you are dead
or otherwise incapacitated at the 24-hour mark after the
time you Cast the Spell or the last time you extended
its duration, the spell ends. Spells with an unlimited
duration last until counteracted or Dismissed. You
don’t need to keep a spell slot open for these spells.
Dismissing
Some spells can be dismissed, ending the duration early.
This requires the caster or target to use the Dismiss action.
DISMISS [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
You end one spell effect or magic item effect. This must be an
effect you are allowed to dismiss, as defined by the spell or
item. Dismissal might end the effect entirely or might end it just
for a certain target or targets, depending on the spell or item.
Saving Throws
Spells that require a target to attempt a save to resist some
or all of the spell’s effects have a Saving Throw entry. This
entry presents the type of save for quick reference, and
specific details appear in the spell description. Whenever
a spell allows a saving throw, it uses the caster’s spell DC.
Basic Saving Throws
If a spell’s Saving Throw entry specifies a “basic” saving
throw, the spell’s potential effects all relate to the damage
listed in the spell’s description. The target takes no damage
on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on
a failure, or double damage on a critical failure. The rules
for basic saving throws are found on page 449.
Spell Attacks
Some spells require you to succeed at a spell attack roll
to affect the target. This is usually because they require
you to precisely aim a ray or otherwise make an accurate
attack. A spell attack roll is compared to the target’s AC.
Spell attack rolls benefit from any bonuses or penalties to
attack rolls, including your multiple attack penalty, but not
any special benefits or penalties that apply only to weapon
or unarmed attacks. Spell attacks don’t deal any damage
beyond what’s listed in the spell description.
In rare cases, a spell might have you make some other
type of attack, such as a weapon Strike. Such attacks use
the normal rules and attack bonus for that type of attack.
Identifying Spells
Sometimes you need to identify a spell, especially if its
effects are not obvious right away. If you notice a spell
being cast, and you have prepared that spell or have it
in your repertoire, you automatically know what the
spell is, including the level to which it is heightened.
If you want to identify a spell but don’t have it
prepared or in your repertoire, you must spend an
action on your turn to attempt to identify it using
Recall Knowledge. You typically notice a spell being
cast by seeing its visual manifestations or hearing its
verbal casting components. Identifying long-lasting
spells that are already in place requires using Identify
Magic instead of Recall Knowledge because you don’t
have the advantage of watching the spell being cast.
Counteracting
Some spells, such as dispel magic, can be used to eliminate
the effects of other spells. At least one creature, object, or
manifestation of the spell you are trying to counteract must
be within range of the spell that you are using. You attempt
a counteract check (page 458) using your spellcasting ability
modifier and your proficiency bonus for spell attack rolls.
Hostile Actions
Sometimes spell effects prevent a target from using
hostile actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any
hostile actions. A hostile action is one that can harm or
damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly,
but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm.
For instance, lobbing a fireball into a crowd would be
a hostile action, but opening a door and accidentally
freeing a horrible monster would not be. The GM is the
final arbitrator of what constitutes a hostile action.
Setting Triggers
If a spell is meant to respond only to certain events or
under certain conditions—such as magic mouth—it might
require you to set a trigger. This is a simple sensory cue
that causes the spell to activate. The spell activates as a
reaction when the spell’s sensor observes something that
fits its trigger. Depending on the spell, the trigger might
be the presence of a type of creature, such as “red-haired
dwarven women,” or it could be an observed action, such
as “whenever someone enters the spell’s area.”
Disguises and illusions fool the spell as long as they
appear to match its parameters. For a spell to detect
something visually, the spell’s origin point must have line
of sight. Darkness doesn’t prevent this, but invisibility

does, as does a successful Stealth check to Hide (against
the spell’s DC). For auditory detection, line of sight isn’t
necessary, though the sound must be audible at the spell’s
origin point. A Stealth check to Sneak can fool the sensor.
Walls
Spells that create walls list the depth, length, and height of
the wall, also specifying how it can be positioned. Some
walls can be shaped; you can manipulate the wall into a
form other than a straight line, choosing its contiguous path
square by square. The path of a shaped wall can’t enter the
same space more than once, but it can double back so one
section is adjacent to another section of the wall.
Reading Spells
Each spell uses the following format. Entries appear only
when applicable, so not all spells will have every entry
described here. The spell’s name line also lists the type of
spell if it’s a cantrip or focus spell, as well as the level.
SPELL NAME
SPELL (LEVEL)
TRAITS
Tradition This entry lists the magical traditions the spell
belongs to. Some feats or other abilities might add a spell to
your spell list even if you don’t follow the listed traditions.
Cast The number of actions required to Cast the Spell are listed
here. Spells that can be cast during a single turn have the
appropriate icon, as do those that can be cast as a free action
or a reaction. Spells that take longer to cast list the time
required, such as “1 minute.” After this, the spell’s components
are listed. If Casting the Spell has a cost, requirements, or a
trigger, that information is also listed in this section. A cost
includes any money, valuable materials, or other resources
that must be expended to cast the spell.
Range, Area, and Targets This entry lists the range of the spell,
the area it affects, and the targets it can affect, if any. If none
of these entries are present, the spell affects only the caster.
Saving Throw and Duration If a spell allows the target to attempt
a saving throw, the type of save appears here. Any details on
the particular results and timing of the save appear in the text
unless the entry specifies a basic saving throw, which follows
the rules found on page 449. If the spell requires a save only
under certain circumstances or at a certain time, this entry
is omitted, since the text needs to explain it in more detail. A
spell that doesn’t list a duration takes place instantaneously,
and anything created by it persists after the spell.
A horizontal line follows saving throws and duration, and the
effects of the spell are described after this line. This section
might also detail the possible results of a saving throw: critical
success, success, failure, and critical failure.
Heightened (level) If the spell can be heightened, the effects
of heightening it appear at the end of the stat block.

You harness your mastery of primal forces to reshape your
body into a Medium flying animal battle form. When you cast
this spell, choose bat, bird, pterosaur, or wasp. You can decide
the specific type of animal (such as an owl or eagle for bird), but

form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.

•	 AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
•	 5 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Low-light vision.
•	 One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the
battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you
can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier
is +16, and your damage bonus is +5. These attacks are
Dexterity based (for the purpose of the clumsy condition,
for example). If your attack modifier for Dexterity-based
unarmed attacks is higher, you can use it instead.
•	 Acrobatics modifier of +16, unless your own modifier
is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
•	 Bat Speed 20 feet, fly Speed 30 feet; precise echolocation
40 feet; Melee [one-action] fangs, Damage 2d8 piercing; Melee [one-action]

temporary HP, attack modifier +18, damage bonus +8, and
Acrobatics +20.
Heightened (6th) Your battle form is Huge, your fly Speed
gains a +15-foot status bonus, and your attacks have 10-foot
reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell
is lost. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary
HP, attack modifier +21, damage bonus +4 and double damage
dice (including persistent damage), and Acrobatics +23.

environment where it can’t breathe.
Range 60 feet; Targets the triggering creature
Duration 1 minute
Core Rulebook

AIR WALK
SPELL 4
AIR
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions divine, primal

SPELL 1
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal); Requirements 3
gp silver bell focus
Range touch; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 8 hours
You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your
permission. When you cast alarm, select a password. Whenever
a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the spell’s area without
speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental
alert (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible
alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case
the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically
awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to
attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware
of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell’s
DC or trigger the spell when moving into the area.
Heightened (3rd) You can specify criteria for which creatures
sound the alarm spell—for instance, orcs or masked people.
ALTER REALITY

occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th

At the GM’s discretion, you can try to produce greater effects,
but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.
ANATHEMATIC REPRISAL
SPELL 4
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions divine
Cast [reaction] somatic, verbal; Trigger A creature performs an act
anathema to your deity.
Range 30 feet; Targets the triggering creature
Saving Throw Will
You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity,
drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your
deity’s anathema committed.
You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits
a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead
were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic
reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in
front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing.
You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will
save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also stupefied 1 for
1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
ANIMAL FORM
SPELL 2

but this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in
this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
•	 AC = 16 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty

are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled
condition, for example). If your unarmed attack bonus
is higher, you can use it instead.
•	 Athletics modifier of +9, unless your own modifier
is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the type of animal
you choose:
•	 Ape Speed 25 feet, climb Speed 20 feet; Melee [one-action] fist,
Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.
•	 Bear Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action] jaws, Damage 2d8 piercing;

known to you within the animal. Optionally, you can attach

You tap into the target’s senses, allowing you to see, hear, and
otherwise sense whatever it senses for the spell’s duration. If
the target wishes to prevent you from doing so, it can attempt
a Will save, negating the spell on a success, but most animals
don’t bother to do so. While tapping into the target’s senses,
you can’t use your own body’s senses, but you can change
back and forth from your body’s senses to the target’s senses
using a single action, which has the concentrate trait.
ANT HAUL
SPELL 1
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 8 hours
You reinforce the target’s musculoskeletal system to bear more
weight. The target can carry 3 more Bulk than normal before
becoming encumbered and up to a maximum of 6 more Bulk.
ANTIMAGIC FIELD
SPELL 8
RARE
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Area 10-foot emanation
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You repel all magic from the target area, preventing spells
and other magic from functioning. Spells can’t penetrate the
area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one
inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—
such as dispel magic—can’t affect the field itself unless they
are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they
pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side
of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long
as caster and target are both outside the field). A summoned
creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field
moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but
they remain invested and resume functioning when they exit
the field; the ability boost from an apex item isn’t suppressed
within the field. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic
field overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature
within the field.
The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still
functions as a longsword. Magically created creatures (such
as golems) function normally within an antimagic field.
AUGURY
SPELL 2
DIVINATION
PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of
this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action.
The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future
and reveals the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:
•	 Weal The results will be good.
•	 Woe The results will be bad.
•	 Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad.
•	 Nothing There won’t be particularly good or bad results.
The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result
is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a
“nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic
as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM
uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances
change, though, it’s possible to get a different result.
AVATAR
SPELL 10
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a Huge
battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost.

actions. You can Dismiss this spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which deity’s battle form you assume:

POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration varies
You transform the target creature into a harmless animal
appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor features of the harmless
animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing
it to be sickened 1. When it recovers from the sickened
condition, its features revert to normal.
Failure The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If
it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original
form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.
Critical Failure The target is transformed into the chosen
harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
BANE
SPELL 1
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 5-foot emanation; Targets enemies in the area
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You fill the minds of your enemies with doubt. Targets that
fail their Will saves take a –1 status penalty to attack rolls as
long as they are in the area. Once per turn, starting the turn
after you cast bane, you can use a single action, which has
the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5
feet and force enemies in the area that weren’t yet affected
to attempt another saving throw. Bane can counteract bless.
BANISHMENT
SPELL 5
ABJURATION
INCAPACITATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature that isn’t on its home plane
Saving Throw Will
You send the target back to its home plane. The target must
attempt a Will save. You can spend an extra action while Casting
this Spell and add a material component to give the creature a
–2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a
specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, and
not from a spell component pouch. This spell fails if you aren’t
on your home plane when you cast it.
Critical Success The target resists being banished and you are
stunned 1.
Success The target resists being banished.
Failure The target is banished.
Critical Failure The target is banished and can’t return by any
means to the plane it’s banished from for 1 week.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra
material component affects targets to which it is anathema.
BARKSKIN
SPELL 2
ABJURATION
PLANT
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 10 minutes
The target’s skin becomes covered in bark. The target gains
resistance 2 to bludgeoning and piercing damage and weakness
3 to fire. After the target takes fire damage, it can Dismiss the
spell as a free action triggered by taking the damage; doing so
doesn’t reduce the fire damage the target was dealt.
Heightened (+2) The resistances increase by 2, and the
weakness increases by 3.
BIND SOUL

Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements black sapphire with a
gp value of at least the target’s level × 100
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature that died within the
last minute
Duration unlimited
You wrench the target’s soul away before it can pass on to the
afterlife and imprison it in a black sapphire.
While the soul is in the gem, the target can’t be returned to
life through any means, even powerful magic such as wish. If
the gem is destroyed or bind soul is counteracted on the gem,
the soul is freed. The gem has AC 16 and Hardness 10. A gem
can’t hold more than one soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.
BIND UNDEAD
SPELL 3
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 mindless undead creature with a level
no greater than bind undead’s spell level
Duration 1 day
With a word of necromantic power, you seize control of the
target. It gains the minion trait. If you or an ally uses any
hostile actions against the target, the spell ends.
BLACK TENTACLES
SPELL 5
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst adjacent to a flat surface
Duration 1 minute
Oily black tentacles rise up and attempt to Grapple each creature
in the area. Make spell attack rolls against the Fortitude DC of
each creature. Any creature you succeed against is grabbed
and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. Whenever a creature ends
its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to grab that creature
if they haven’t already, and they deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage
to any creature already grabbed.
The tentacles’ Escape DC is equal to your spell DC. A creature
can attack a tentacle in an attempt to release its grip. Its AC
is equal to your spell DC, and it is destroyed if it takes 12 or
more damage. Even if destroyed, additional tentacles continue
to grow in the area until the duration ends. You can Dismiss
the spell.
BLADE BARRIER
SPELL 6
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions divine
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
Blades of force form a churning wall. The wall is a straight
line 20 feet high, 120 feet long, and 2 inches thick, and it
provides cover. The wall deals 7d8 force damage to each
creature that’s in the wall’s space when it is created, that
attempts to pass through the wall, or that ends its turn
inside the wall. A basic Reflex save reduces the damage.
A  creature that succeeds at this save when the wall is
created is pushed to the nearest space on the side of its
choice. Creatures trying to move through the wall fail to
do so if they critically fail the save, ending their movement
adjacent to the wall.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.
BLESS
SPELL 1
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 5-foot emanation; Targets you and allies in the area
Duration 1 minute
Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true.
You and your allies in the area gain a +1 status bonus to
attack rolls. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast
bless, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate
trait, to increase the emanation’s radius by 5 feet. Bless can
counteract bane.
BLINDNESS
SPELL 3
INCAPACITATION
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude
You blind the target. The effect is determined by the target’s
Fortitude save. The target then becomes temporarily immune
for 1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is blinded until its next turn begins.
Failure The target is blinded for 1 minute.
Critical Failure The target is blinded permanently.
BLINK
SPELL 4
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal
Plane. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). You
can Sustain the Spell to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in
a random direction determined by the GM; the movement
doesn’t trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish
and reappear as above.
Heightened (+2) The resistance increases by 3.
BLUR
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
The target’s form appears blurry. It becomes concealed. As the
nature of this effect still leaves the target’s location obvious,
the target can’t use this concealment to Hide or Sneak.

Saving Throw basic Reflex
You call upon the unimaginable power of world-ending
cataclysms, ripping a small piece of each cataclysm and
combining them together into one horrifically powerful attack.
The following effects come down upon all creatures in the
area. Treat the resistances of creatures in the area as if they
were 10 lower for the purpose of determining the cataclysm’s
damage. Each creature attempts one basic Reflex save that
applies to all six types of damage.
•	 Flesh-dissolving acid rain deals 3d10 acid damage.
•	 A roaring earthquake shakes and bludgeons creatures
on the ground, dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage.
•	 A blast of freezing wind deals 3d10 cold damage.
•	 Incredible lightning lashes the area, dealing 3d10
electricity damage.
•	 Beating winds churn across the sky, dealing 3d10
bludgeoning damage to creatures flying in the area.
•	 An instant tsunami sweeps over creatures in the area,
dealing 3d10 bludgeoning damage with the water trait
(doubled for creatures swimming in the area).
•	 A massive wildfire burns in a sudden inferno, dealing
3d10 fire damage.
CHAIN LIGHTNING
SPELL 6
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Targets 1 creature, plus any number of

Saving Throw Reflex
You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing
8d12 electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic
Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30
feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30
feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any
point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and
you must have line of effect to all targets. Roll the damage
only once, and apply it to each target (halving or doubling as
appropriate for its saving throw outcome). The chain ends if
any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d12.

SPELL 1
EMOTION
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult, primal

To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems
bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4
circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it
or used hostile actions against it.
You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against
the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target
doesn’t necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship
with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with
its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the
target to continue being your friend via mundane means.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and aware you tried
to charm it.
Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies
the spell (usually with Identify Magic).
Failure The target’s attitude becomes friendly toward you. If it
was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can’t use hostile actions
against you.
Critical Failure The target’s attitude becomes helpful toward
you, and it can’t use hostile actions against you.

Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a
pale darkness. Your touch weakens the living and disorients
undead, possibly even causing them to flee. The effect depends
on whether the target is living or undead.
•	 Living Creature The spell deals negative damage equal
to 1d4 plus your spellcasting modifier. The target
attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also enfeebled 1
for 1 round on a critical failure.
•	 Undead Creature The target is flat-footed for 1 round
on a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the
target is also fleeing for 1 round unless it succeeds at a
Will save.

Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy
energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You
deal 5d6 cold damage, plus 5d6 evil damage if the target is
a celestial.
If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets
a creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts
to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether
the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between
yourself and the spell’s target.
Critical Success The target takes double damage.
Success The target takes full damage.
Heightened (+1) The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the
evil damage against celestials increases by 2d6.
CHROMATIC WALL
SPELL 5
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 10 minutes
You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color.
The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and
30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the
spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each
side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the
wall’s effects.
Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a
particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to
pass through. Chromatic wall can’t be counteracted normally;
rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted
by a specific spell, even if that spell’s level is lower than that
of chromatic wall.
1.	 Red The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition
(such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass
through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone
passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Cone of
cold can counteract a red chromatic wall.
2.	Orange The wall destroys thrown weapons that would
pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone
passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Gust of wind
can counteract an orange chromatic wall.
3.	Yellow The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force,
negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing
through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone
passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Disintegrate
can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.
4.	Green The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath
weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison
damage to anyone passing through and makes
them enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude
save reduces the damage and negates the enfeebled
condition on a success. Passwall can counteract a
green chromatic wall.
MAGIC AND MORALITY
While magic allows you to perform wondrous acts in
the game, it can be used for terrible purposes. While
some spells are obviously vile or have the evil trait and a
direct connection to the profane, other spells can be used
for good or ill. Using magic does not free you from the
morality of the outcome.
Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to
enchantment spells, especially those used to compel a
character to do something. These spells can remove the
power of choice from a character and can very easily
be used in ways that are evil. Dominating an ogre and
forcing him to abandon his guard post is not necessarily
evil, but using that same spell to force a merchant to give
you all of his wares certainly is. Using a spell for an evil
purpose can cause a player character’s alignment to shift
to evil, with the ultimate judgment of whether a player is
using a spell for an evil purpose left up to the GM.
Regardless of in-game effects, all players should take
care when using such spells. These effects can negatively
affect people at the table, as they might create situations
that echo truly awful experiences players might have
had, creating uncomfortable or hostile environments.
Players and GMs should work to prevent these situations
so everyone can focus on having fun at the table.

Heightened (7th) The spell’s duration increases to 1 hour. Roll
1d8 to determine the wall’s color; the results for 5–8 are below.
A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.
5.	Blue The wall stops auditory, petrification, and visual
effects from passing through, and creatures passing
through are subject to the effects of flesh to stone.
Magic missile can counteract a blue chromatic wall.
6.	Indigo The wall stops divination and mental effects
from passing through, and those passing through are
subject to the effects of warp mind. Searing light can
counteract an indigo chromatic wall.
7.	 Violet The wall prevents spells from targeting the other
side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing
through must succeed at a Will save or they are slowed
1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead
sent to another plane, with the effect of plane shift. Dispel
magic can counteract a violet chromatic wall.
8.	Reroll, and creatures that pass through the wall take a

You prepare a spell that will trigger later. While casting
contingency, you also cast another spell of 4th level or lower
with a casting time of no more than 3 actions. This companion
spell must be one that can affect you. You must make any
decisions for the spell when you cast contingency, such as
choosing a damage type for resist energy. During the casting,
choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the
same restrictions as for the trigger of a Ready action. Once
contingency is cast, you can cause the companion spell to
come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects
only you, even if it would affect more creatures. If you define
complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger
might fail. If you cast contingency again, the newer casting

slay a creature, war with a group, or be entirely peaceful.

that it pursues the cause to the death (unless you
say otherwise).

penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter
the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch
or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area,
even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness.
This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell’s

You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the
magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.
You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower
level than the level of your detect magic spell. However, items
that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance
(such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.
Heightened (4th) As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source

undetected, not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target
to count as invisible no matter what precise and imprecise senses
an observer might have. It’s still possible for a creature to find

You can target a creature only if you’ve seen it in person,
have one of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its

Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one
degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine
powder; its gear remains.
An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of
Hardness, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy.

lawful). You can’t cast this spell if you don’t have a deity or your
deity is true neutral. This spell gains the trait of the alignment
you chose. The bonuses granted by the spell increase to +2
against attacks by—and effects created by—creatures with an
alignment opposite to the spell (lawful if you chose chaotic,

effects created by such creatures that attempt to impose the
controlled condition on a target of your divine aura, as well
as against attacks made by creatures summoned by anything
opposite in alignment to your divine aura.
When a creature of opposite alignment hits a target with a
melee attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save or be
blinded for 1 minute. It’s then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can’t
cast this spell if you don’t have a deity or your deity is true

You deal 7d10 damage to creatures in the area; each creature

When you Cast this Spell, any targets—including you—can choose
to immediately fall asleep. The spell ends for any creatures that
don’t choose to fall asleep. Sleepers join a shared dream, where
they can communicate with one another as though they were in
the same room. Individual targets leave this shared dream upon

one-way, up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words). If
the target is asleep, they receive the message instantly. If

a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a
dead body. If the target’s death seems absurd—for instance, a
barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the
GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to
disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the
spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse
disappears too.
Heightened (7th) The spell doesn’t end if the target uses

DUPLICATE FOE
SPELL 7
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 enemy of level 15 or lower
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You try to create a temporary duplicate of an enemy to fight
on your behalf. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to
disrupt the spell. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space
adjacent to the target and has the target’s attack modifier, AC,
saving throw modifiers, Perception, and skill modifiers, but it
has only 70 Hit Points and lacks the target’s special abilities,
including immunities, resistances, and weaknesses. It has no
magic items except weapon potency runes.
The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride
and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target’s normal damage but don’t
apply added effects, since it doesn’t have special abilities. The
spell automatically ends if the duplicate’s Hit Points drop to 0.
The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its
abilities. You can also try to give it additional instructions;
when you Sustain the Spell, you can also Command a Minion
as part of your action, but the GM determines whether the
duplicate follows your command.
The duplicate is unstable, so each turn after it takes its
actions, it loses 4d6 Hit Points. It’s not a living creature, and it
can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.
Critical Success You fail to create a duplicate.
Success The duplicate deals half damage with its Strikes and
the duration is reduced to a maximum of 2 rounds.
Failure The duplicate works as described.
Heightened (+1) The level of creature you can target increases
by 2. The duplicate has 10 more HP.

ground safely, it doesn’t take falling damage.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

Failure The target falls safely up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground,
it can’t Fly, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target falls safely up to 120 feet. If it hits
the ground, it can’t Fly, levitate, or otherwise leave the

EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Area 60-foot burst
Duration 1 round
You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and
collapse structures.
The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs
might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might
drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass
of quicksand.
•	 Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain, and
creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to
attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
•	 Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a
Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing
and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open
beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides
require DC 15 Athletics to Climb.
•	 Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The
GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy
structure, DC 14 for an average structure and most
natural formations, DC 9 for a shoddy structure,
all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A
collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage; each
creature caught in a collapse must attempt a Reflex
save to avoid it.
Critical Success The creature takes half the collapse damage.
Success The creature takes half the collapse damage and
falls prone.
Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage and
falls prone.
Critical Failure The creature takes the full collapse damage
and falls into a fissure.
Heightened (10th) You create a massive earthquake that can
devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and
the area to a quarter-mile burst.

Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without
interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets
who notice your speech or song might give their undivided
attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might
grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target
is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is
otherwise unlikely to agree with what you’re saying.
Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a
save when you Sustain the Spell. If you’re speaking, enthrall
gains the linguistic trait.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and notices that you
tried to use magic.
Success The target needn’t pay attention but doesn’t notice
you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).
Failure The target is fascinated with you. It can attempt another
Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it
disagrees. If it succeeds, it’s no longer fascinated and is
temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is subject to a
hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a Diplomacy or
Intimidation check against it, the fascination ends immediately.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target can’t attempt a save
to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.
ETHEREAL JAUNT
SPELL 7
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You travel to the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material
Plane. Material Plane creatures can’t see you, and you can
move through things on the Material Plane. You move at half
your normal Speeds, but can move in any direction (including
up and down).
You can see onto the Material Plane within a radius of 60
feet; it is gray, hazy, and concealed from you. You can’t affect
the Material Plane, and you can’t be affected by the Material
Plane except by force effects and abjurations originating there.
When the spell ends, you return to the Material Plane. If
you’re in the air, you fall (unless you can fly), and if you’re
inside an object, you’re pushed into the nearest open space
and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet you were pushed.
If you cast this spell when not on the Material Plane, it is lost.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to five additional willing
creatures at a range of 30 feet. The duration is up to 10 minutes.
FABRICATED TRUTH
SPELL 10
ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
MENTAL
Traditions occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 100 feet; Targets up to 5 creatures
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
Choose a single statement you want the targets to believe. The
fact could be narrow, such as “a dragon is circling overhead
and wants to kill me”; wide-reaching, such as “all humanoids
are disguised abominations”; or conceptual, such as “if I don’t
live a kinder life, I’ll be punished in the afterlife.” The targets’
experiences color how they react to this “truth” and how
their behavior changes. If the statement changes what they
perceive, they treat the change as a sudden revelation.
The effect of the spell depends on the targets’ Will saves. If
a target is already subject to fabricated truth, your spell tries
to counteract it. If the counteract check fails, the outcome of
the target’s saving throw can’t be worse than a success.
Critical Success The target doesn’t believe the statement, and
it knows you tried to trick it.
Success The target doesn’t believe the statement or realize
you tried to trick it.
Failure The target believes the statement for a duration of 1 week.
Critical Failure The target believes the statement with
unlimited duration.

All creatures in the area when you cast the spell are limned
in colorful, heatless fire of a color of your choice for the

You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on
an area. Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise
detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what
is actually in the area. You can Sustain the Spell each round
to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a
complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher level than
false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to
disbelieve the illusion, though even if they’re successful,
they can’t learn what’s truly going on in the area.

You become living flame, giving you fire immunity,
resistance 10 to precision damage, and weakness 5 to cold
and to water. Any creature that touches you or damages
you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon
takes 3d6 fire damage.
Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 additional fire damage, and
your fire spells deal one additional die of fire damage (of the
same damage die the spell uses). You can cast produce flame
as an innate spell; the casting is reduced from 2 actions to 1.

Four acorns grow in your hand, their shells streaked with
pulsing red and orange patterns. You or anyone else who has
one of the acorns can toss it up to 30 feet with an Interact
action. It explodes in a 5-foot burst, dealing 4d6 fire damage.
The save uses your spell DC, even if someone else throws
the acorn.
Flames continue to burn on the ground in the burst for
1  minute, dealing 2d6 fire damage to any creature that
enters the flames or ends its turn within them. A creature
can take damage from the continuing flames only once per
round, even if it’s in overlapping areas of fire created by
different acorns.
When the spell ends, any remaining acorns rot and turn to
ordinary soil.

You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above,
dealing 8d6 fire damage. Because the flame is infused with
divine energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual
fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to fire, instead of
gaining the usual benefit of immunity, treat the results of their
saving throws as one degree of success better.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.

attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude
save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has
the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed condition
increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save
reduces the slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable
to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the
creature is petrified permanently. The spell ends if the

PREDICTION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour
You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might
befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other
than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through
which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental
effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires
you to process, you can’t have more than one foresight spell
in effect at a time. Casting foresight again ends the previous
foresight. While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2
status bonus to initiative rolls and isn’t flat-footed against
undetected creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain
the following reaction.
Foresight [reaction] Trigger The target of foresight defends against
a hostile creature or other danger. Effect If the hostile
creature or danger forces the target to roll dice (a saving
throw, for example), the target rolls twice and uses the
higher result, and this spell gains the fortune trait. But if the
hostile creature or danger is rolling against the target (an
attack roll or skill check, for example), that hostile creature
or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this
spell gains the misfortune trait.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
SPELL 4
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature touched
Duration 10 minutes
You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its
movement. While under this spell’s effect, the target ignores
effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to
Speed. When they attempt to Escape an effect that has them
immobilized, grabbed, or restrained, they automatically
succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level
than the freedom of movement spell.

You tear open a rift to another plane, creating a portal that
creatures can travel through in either direction. This portal
is vertical and circular, with a radius of 40 feet. The portal
appears at a location of your choice on the destination plane,
assuming you have a clear idea of both the destination’s
location on the plane and what the destination looks like. If
you attempt to create a gate into or out of the realm of a deity
or another powerful being, that being can prevent the gate
from forming.
GENTLE REPOSE
SPELL 2
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

The targeted corpse doesn’t decay, nor can it be transformed
into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires
the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for
example, raise dead), do not count the duration of gentle
repose against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary
bugs and pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.
Heightened (5th) The spell’s duration is unlimited, but the
spell takes one more action to cast and requires a material
component and a cost (embalming fluid worth 6 gp).

Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each
creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its
invisibility negated by this spell, it is concealed instead of
invisible. This applies both if the creature was already invisible
and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of
the invisibility negation effect from this spell.

SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space
Duration 10 minutes
You create an immobile globe around yourself that attempts
to counteract any spell from outside the globe whose area
or targets enter into the globe, as if the globe were a dispel
magic spell 1 level lower than its actual spell level. If the
counteract attempt succeeds, it prevents only the portion
of the spell that would have entered the globe (so if the
spell also has targets outside the globe, or part of its area
is beyond the globe, those targets or that area is affected
normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken open
space, so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or
objects, or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the
globe after the spell is cast).
GLYPH OF WARDING
SPELL 3
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 container or a 10-foot-by-10-foot area
Duration unlimited
You craft a trap by binding a hostile spell into a symbol. While
Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level
to store in the glyph. The stored spell must take 3 actions or
fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature
or have an area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both
for the glyph. Any creature that moves, opens, or touches the
target container or enters the target area that doesn’t speak
the password or that matches the trigger activates the glyph,
releasing the harmful spell within.
Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the
traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more
creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph. If it
has an area, that area is centered on the creature that set off
the glyph. Glyph of warding’s duration ends when the glyph
is triggered. The glyph counts as a magical trap, using your
spell DC for both the Perception check to notice it and the
Thievery check to disable it; both checks require the creature
attempting them to be trained in order to succeed.
You can Dismiss glyph of warding. The maximum number
of glyphs of warding you can have active at a time is equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.

Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 4 contiguous 5-foot squares or
Targets 1 object of 1 Bulk or less
Duration 1 minute
You conjure grease, with effects based on choosing area or target.
•	 Area All solid ground in the area is covered with
grease. Each creature standing on the greasy surface
must succeed at a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check
against your spell DC or fall prone. Creatures using
an action to move onto the greasy surface during the
spell’s duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an
Acrobatics check to Balance. A creature that Steps or
Crawls doesn’t have to attempt a check or save.
•	 Target If you cast the spell on an unattended object,
anyone trying to pick up the object must succeed
at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save against your
spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object,
the creature that has the object must attempt an
Acrobatics check or Reflex save. On a failure, the
holder or wielder takes a –2 circumstance penalty to
all checks that involve using the object; on a critical
failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The
object lands in an adjacent square of the GM’s choice.

You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status
bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or

If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour
The target consistently detects one thing as another, can’t
detect something that’s there, or detects something that’s not
there, though it doesn’t alter their beliefs. You choose which
of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics of the
hallucination. For example, you could make the target see all elves
as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their brother, see
their beloved pocket watch on their person even when it isn’t, or
see a tower in the center of town.
The target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below.
They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every
time they Seek or directly interact with the hallucination. For
example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the hallucination
each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into their brother
accidentally, tried to check their pocket watch, or studied
the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large
circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such as
if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.

GOOD
POSITIVE
WATER
Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Cost one vial of holy water (page 571)
Range 500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw basic Reflex
You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water,
tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous
burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the
area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional
6d6 positive damage to undead and 6d6 good damage to fiends.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and
the additional positive and good damage each increase by 2d6.

NEGATIVE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Targets any number of living creatures
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
You pull the moisture from the targets’ bodies, dealing
10d10 negative damage. Creatures made of water (such as
water elementals) and plant creatures use the outcome for
one degree of success worse than the result of their saving
throw. Creatures whose bodies contain no significant moisture
(such as earth elementals) are immune to horrid wilting.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10.
HUMANOID FORM
SPELL 2
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You transform your appearance to that of a Small or Medium
humanoid, such as a dwarf, elf, goblin, halfling, human, orc,
or lizardfolk. You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your
other traits while in this form, as well as any trait related to the
creature’s kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation
reduces your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (as the
shrink spell). This transformation doesn’t change your statistics
in any way, and you don’t gain any special abilities of the
humanoid form you assume. You can still wear and use your
gear, which changes size (if necessary) to match your new form.
If items leave your person, they return to their usual size.
Humanoid form grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception
checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and
you add your level even if you’re untrained, but you can’t make
yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate
an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM
won’t factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the
DC of your Deception check. You can Dismiss this spell.
Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the
form you assume has that ability.
Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large
humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of
the enlarge spell.

A swirling torrent of water manifests along a straight line,
battering those that are its path and possibly pushing them

Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Fortitude save.
Creatures that fail the save are also knocked back 5 feet (10
feet on a critical failure).
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HYPERCOGNITION
SPELL 3

You rapidly catalog and collate information relevant to

actions, you can’t use any special abilities, reactions, or free
actions that trigger when you Recall Knowledge.

You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air
in a geometric cloud. Creatures are dazzled while inside the
pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving
throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it
enters the pattern, when it ends its turn within the pattern,
or if it uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A
creature currently fascinated by the pattern doesn’t attempt
new saves.
Success The target is unaffected.

Critical Failure The target is fascinated by the pattern. While
it remains fascinated, it can’t use reactions.

ILLUSORY CREATURE
SPELL 2
AUDITORY
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet
Duration sustained
You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It
generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable
to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500
feet apart, the spell ends.
The image can’t speak, but you can use your actions to
speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your
voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception
or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined
by the GM. This is especially likely if you’re trying to imitate a
specific person and engage with someone that person knows.
In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it
uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll
for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw
modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial
enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by
an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.
The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe
the illusion’s attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly
affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with
a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus
your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect.
The illusion’s Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn’t
correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an
illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might
allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve
the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and
weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged
by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer
and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the
creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory
damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other
effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should
track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek
action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half
the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn’t take any
further damage from it.
Heightened (+1) The damage of the image’s Strikes increases
by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create
increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).
ILLUSORY DISGUISE
SPELL 1
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another
creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height
(within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself.
The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity,
but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t
change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the
appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making
your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any
worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.
Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for
the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance
penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar
creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to
prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and you add
your level even if you’re untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.
Heightened (2nd) The spell also disguises your voice and
scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
Heightened (3rd) You can appear as any creature of the
same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an
individual to take on their appearance. The spell also disguises
your voice and scent, and it gains the auditory trait.
ILLUSORY OBJECT
SPELL 1
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 10 minutes
You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object.
The entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object
appears to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or
generate smells. For example, water would appear to pour
down an illusory waterfall, but it would be silent.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action
to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
Heightened (2nd) Your image makes appropriate sounds,
generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell
gains the auditory trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.
Heightened (5th) As the 2nd-level version, but the duration
is unlimited.
ILLUSORY SCENE
SPELL 5
AUDITORY
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (somatic, verbal)
Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Duration 1 hour
You form an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete
creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be
within the spell’s area. These elements generate appropriate
sounds and smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements
of an illusory scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the
illusory creature spell, creatures in your scene lack combat
abilities and statistics. Your scene doesn’t include changes to
the environment around it, though you can place your scene
within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell.
When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be
static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it
includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on

an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to
1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could
create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would
go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two
fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at
the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it’s hard to tell
when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for
more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You’re
unable to alter the program after you create the illusion.
Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses
the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your
illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they
disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene
only on a critical success.
Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.
You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating
your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor.
Heightened (8th) As the 6th-level version, and the duration
is unlimited.
IMPLOSION
SPELL 9
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Saving Throw basic Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You crush the target by causing it to collapse in on itself, dealing
75 damage. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you must choose a
new target to be subject to the same effect; the same creature
can never be targeted more than once with a single casting of
this spell. You also can’t affect more than one creature per turn
with implosion. You can’t target a creature that’s incorporeal,
gaseous, or liquid, or one that otherwise lacks a solid form.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 10.
INSECT FORM
SPELL 3
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal
battle form. When you cast this spell, choose ant, beetle,
centipede, mantis, scorpion, or spider. You can decide the specific
type of animal (such as such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle),
but this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in
this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss this spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
•	 AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
•	 10 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Low-light vision.
Core Rulebook
346

PAGE 348
================================================================================

•	 One or more attacks specific to the battle form you
choose, which are the only attacks you can use. You’re
trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and your
damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength based
(for the purpose of the enfeebled condition). If your
unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
•	 Athletics modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
•	 Ant Speed 30 feet, climb Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action]
mandibles, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.
•	 Beetle Speed 25 feet; Melee [one-action] mandibles, Damage
2d10 bludgeoning.

darkvision; Melee [one-action] mandibles, Damage 1d8 piercing
plus 1d4 persistent poison.
•	 Mantis Speed 40 feet; imprecise scent 30 feet; Melee
[one-action] foreleg, Damage 2d8 bludgeoning.
•	 Scorpion Speed 40 feet; darkvision, imprecise
tremorsense 60 feet; Melee [one-action] stinger, Damage 1d8
piercing plus 1d4 persistent poison; Melee [one-action] pincer

Damage entangles the target for 1 round.
Heightened (4th) Your battle form is Large, and your attacks
have 10-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand
into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 15 temporary HP,
attack modifier +16, damage bonus +6, and Athletics +16.
Heightened (5th) Your battle form is Huge, and your attacks
have 15-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand
into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 20 temporary HP,

dice (including persistent damage), and Athletics +20.
INVISIBILITY
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it
undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt
to find the target, making it hidden to them instead (page
466). If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after
that hostile action is completed.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if
the target uses a hostile action.
INVISIBILITY SPHERE
SPELL 3
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Area 10-foot emanation; Targets you and any number of

Duration 10 minutes
You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as
you remain within the spell’s area. If a creature made invisible
by this spell leaves the spell’s area, it becomes visible and
remains so even if it returns to the spell’s area. If any creature
made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends
after the hostile action is completed.
While exploring, it’s easy to move together slowly and
remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once
an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most
the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.
Heightened (5th) The duration increases to 1 hour.
ITEM FACADE
SPELL 1
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 object no more than 10 feet by 10 feet
by 10 feet
Duration 1 hour
You make the target object look and feel as though it were
in much better or worse physical condition. When you cast
this spell, decide whether you want to make the object look
decrepit or perfect. An item made to look decrepit appears
broken and shoddy. An intact item made to look better
appears as though it’s brand new and highly polished or well
maintained. A broken item appears to be intact and functional.
Destroyed items can’t be affected by this spell. A creature that
Interacts with the item can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.
Heightened (2nd) The duration is 24 hours.
Heightened (3rd) The duration is unlimited.
JUMP

MOVE
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal

Your legs surge with strength, ready to leap high and far. You
jump 30 feet in any direction without touching the ground. You
must land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of you, or
else you fall after using your next action.
Heightened (3rd) The range becomes touch, the target
changes to one touched creature, and the duration becomes
1 minute, allowing the target to jump as described whenever
it takes the Leap action.
KNOCK
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 door, lock, or container
Duration 1 minute
You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status
bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock, or
container with an Athletics or a Thievery check. You can attempt
a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting knock, and
you add your level even if you’re untrained.
Knock counteracts lock.

SPELL 3
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult

Duration 5 minutes
You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.
For the duration of the spell, you can move the target up or
down 10 feet with a single action, which has the concentrate
trait. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can
spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this
penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to
a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across
the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like a wall) or
crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a ceiling). The GM
determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)

Duration sustained
You learn the direction to the target (if you picked a specific
object, such as “my mother’s sword”) or the nearest target (if
you picked a type of object, such as “swords”). If the target is
a specific object, you must have observed it directly with your
own senses. If it’s a type of object, you still need to have an
accurate mental image of the type of object. If there’s lead or
running water between you and the target, this spell can’t
locate the object. This means you might find a type of object
farther away if the nearest one is behind lead or running water.
Heightened (5th) You can target a specific creature or ancestry
instead of an object, but you must have met or seen up close
the creature or ancestry you want to target.
LOCK
SPELL 1
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 lock, or a door or container with a latch
Duration 1 day
The target’s latch mechanism clinks shut, held fast by unseen
magical restraints. When you magically lock a target, you set
an Athletics and Thievery DC to open it equal to your spell DC
or the base lock DC with a +4 status bonus, whichever is higher.
Any key or combination that once opened a lock affected by
this spell does not do so for the duration of the spell, though
the key or combination does grant a +4 circumstance bonus to
checks to open the door.
If the target is opened, the spell ends. Assuming the target
is not barred or locked in some additional way, you can unlock
and open it with an Interact action during which you touch the
target. This does not end the spell. You can Dismiss this spell
at any time and from any distance.
Heightened (2nd) The duration increases to unlimited, but you
must expend 6 gp worth of gold dust as an additional cost.

MAGE HAND
CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 unattended object of light Bulk or less
Duration sustained
You create a single magical hand, either invisible or ghostlike,
that grasps the target object and moves it slowly up to 20
feet. Because you’re levitating the object, you can move it in
any direction. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the
object an additional 20 feet. If the object is in the air when the
spell ends, the object falls.
Heightened (3rd) You can target an unattended object with a
Bulk of 1 or less.

MAGIC AURA
SPELL 1
UNCOMMON
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 object of 3 bulk or less
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You alter the appearance of an item’s magic aura. You can
choose to have the target’s aura appear as that of common
magic item of twice magic aura’s level or lower, or to have it
register as being under the effects of a spell of your choice
of magic aura’s level or lower. If the target is magical, you
can instead choose to have it appear as entirely non-magical.
A caster using detect magic or study aura of an equal or
higher spell level can attempt to disbelieve the illusion from
magic aura. Magic aura doesn’t mask the aura of spells that
are 9th level or higher or of items that are 19th level or higher.
Heightened (3rd) You can target a creature instead of an
object. When you do, you can either conceal the auras of all
magic items it has or have that creature’s aura appear as if it
were under the effect of a spell you know.
MAGIC FANG

You send a dart of force streaking toward a creature that
you can see. It automatically hits and deals 1d4+1 force
damage. For each additional action you use when Casting
the Spell, increase the number of missiles you shoot by one,
to a maximum of three missiles for 3 actions. You choose
the target for each missile individually. If you shoot more

You specify a trigger (described on page 305) and a message

spell ends.

vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate
who can enter when you cast the spell. Once inside, you can
shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and the creatures
you designated can reopen the door at will, just like opening
a physical door.

Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion featuring
a magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The
mansion can have any floor plan you imagine as you Cast
the Spell, provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet
deep, and 30 feet tall. While the entrance to the mansion is
closed, effects from outside the mansion fail to penetrate it,
and vice versa, except for plane shift, which can be used to
enter the mansion. You can use scrying magic and similar
effects to observe the outside only if they’re capable of
crossing planes.
A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the
mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen
servant spell, though they’re visible, with an appearance
you determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with
enough food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.
MARINER’S CURSE
SPELL 5
ATTACK
CURSE
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will
You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving
sea. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened
condition to 0 ends the curse.
Failure The target becomes sickened 1 and can’t reduce
its sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains.
The curse can be lifted by remove curse or similar magic.
Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at least a
mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2.
MASK OF TERROR
SPELL 7
EMOTION
FEAR
ILLUSION
MENTAL
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature.
The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the
target might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon
observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage.
When any creature attempts a hostile action against the
target, the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then
temporarily immune until the end of its next turn.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature becomes frightened 2 before using
its action.
Critical Failure The creature becomes frightened 2, and its
action fails and is wasted.
Heightened (8th) You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature
uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets
simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against
mask of terror.
MASSACRE
SPELL 9
DEATH
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 60-foot line
Saving Throw Fortitude
You unleash a wave of necromantic energy to snuff out the
life force of those in its path. Each creature of 17th level
or lower in the line must attempt a Fortitude save. If the
damage from massacre reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points,
that creature dies instantly. If massacre doesn’t kill even a
single creature, the negative energy violently explodes back
toward you, dealing an additional 30 negative damage to
every creature in the line (even those above 17th level) and
30 negative damage to you.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 9d6 negative damage.
Failure The creature takes 100 negative damage.
Critical Failure The creature dies.
Heightened (10th) The spell can affect creatures up to 19th
level. Increase the damage to 10d6 on a success, and to 115
on a failure.
MAZE
SPELL 8
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained
You transport the target into an extradimensional maze of
eldritch origin and trap it there. Once each turn, the target
can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check or Perception
check against your spell DC to escape the maze. The possible
outcomes are as follows.
Critical Success The target escapes and the spell ends.
Success The target is on the right path to the exit. If the target
was already on the right path, it escapes the maze and the
spell ends.
Failure The target makes no progress toward escape.
Critical Failure The target makes no progress toward escape,
and if it was on the right path, it no longer is.
Teleportation magic doesn’t help the creature escape unless
the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift.
When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the
duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied
when it was banished, or to the nearest space if the original
is now filled.
MELD INTO STONE

but not see, what’s going on outside the stone, and you can
cast spells while in the stone as long as they don’t require line
of effect beyond the stone.
Significant physical damage to the stone while you are
inside it expels you and deals 10d6 damage to you. Passwall
expels you without dealing damage and ends meld into stone.
You can Dismiss this spell.

repairs it past the item’s Broken Threshold. You can’t replace lost
pieces or repair an object that’s been completely destroyed.
Heightened (2nd) You can target a non-magical object of 1
Bulk or less.
Heightened (3rd) You can target a non-magical object of 2

CANTRIP 1
AUDITORY
CANTRIP
ILLUSION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [one-action] verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration see below
You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your
mouth, they’re transferred directly to the ears of the target.
While others can’t hear your words any better than if you
normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as
if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief
response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn
if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within
range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered
directly to your ear, just like the original message.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range increases to 500 feet.
METEOR SWARM
SPELL 9
EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 500 feet; Area 4 40-foot bursts
Saving Throw basic Reflex
You call down four meteors that explode in a fiery blast. Each
meteor deals 6d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in
the 10-foot burst at the center of its area of effect before
exploding, dealing 14d6 fire damage to any creatures in
its 40-foot burst. The meteors’ central 10-foot bursts can’t
overlap, and a creature takes the same amount of fire
damage no matter how many overlapping explosions it’s
caught in. The saving throw applies to both the bludgeoning
and the fire damage.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10,
and the fire damage increases by 2d6.
MIND BLANK
SPELL 8
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
Powerful wards hide a creature from divination magic. The
target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects.
Mind blank attempts to counteract any detection, revelation,
and scrying effects as if its spell level were 1 higher than its
actual level. On a success, the divination effect functions
normally except that it detects nothing about the target and
its possessions. For instance, detect magic would still detect
other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
MIND PROBE
SPELL 5
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You cast your thoughts through a creature’s mind, sifting for
information. You access the target’s memories and knowledge
unless it fends you off with a Will save.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure Each round of the spell’s duration, you can Sustain the
Spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover
the answer. For each question, the target can attempt
a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target
succeeds, you don’t learn the answer, and on a critical
success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe
is truthful Once you’ve asked the target a given question,
asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe,
produces the same result.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target takes a –4 circumstance
penalty to Deception checks against your questions.
MIND READING
SPELL 3
UNCOMMON
DETECTION
DIVINATION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 round or sustained up to 1 minute
With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target’s
mind. It must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes
temporarily immune to your mind reading for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target perceives vague surface thoughts
from you when you Cast the Spell.
Success You find out whether the target’s Intelligence modifier
is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
Failure You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when
you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence
modifier is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
Critical Failure As failure, and for the duration of the spell, you
can Sustain the Spell to detect the target’s surface thoughts
again. The target doesn’t receive any additional saves.

Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

You link your mind to the target’s mind and mentally impart to
that target an amount of information in an instant that could
otherwise be communicated in 10 minutes.
MIRACLE
SPELL 10
DIVINATION
Traditions divine
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
You request aid directly from your divine source. Your divine
source always refuses a request out of line with its nature, and
it might grant a different request (potentially more powerful or
better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A casting
of miracle can do any of the following things.
•	 Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower.
•	 Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower.
•	 Produce any effect whose power level is in line with
the above effects.
•	 Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell.
The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce
greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or
the spell may have only a partial effect.
MIRROR IMAGE
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially
causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead
of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of
hitting one of your images instead of you. If all three images
remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With
two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2
on 1d6). With only one image, the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on 1d6).
Once an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails
to hit your AC but doesn’t critically fail, it destroys an image
but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally
have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical
success and would hit one of the images, one of the images is
destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you.
Once all the images are destroyed, the spell ends.
MISDIRECTION
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Range 30 feet; Targets 2 creatures or objects
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You reshape the magic aura of one creature or object to
resemble that of another. You designate one target as
the primary target and the other as the secondary target.
Effects that would detect auras on the primary target instead
detect the same types of auras from the secondary target.
A creature reading the aura can attempt to disbelieve the
illusion. You can Dismiss the spell from up to a mile away.
MISLEAD
SPELL 6
ILLUSION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two‑acactions] somatic, verbal
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of
yourself. When you Sustain the Spell, you can mentally dictate
a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your
duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions,
though it can’t actually affect anything in the environment.
Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell’s
duration. Performing a hostile action doesn’t end mislead’s
invisibility, just like a 4th-level invisibility spell. A creature
that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn’t necessarily
know you’re invisible, and one that can see your invisible form
doesn’t necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion.
If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with
another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt
a Deception check against observers’ Perception DCs to
convince them your duplicate used that action. This doesn’t
fool anyone who’s aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does
it work if the attack obviously couldn’t have come from the
duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it
look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate
was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword
and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your
Deception check would automatically fail.
MODIFY MEMORY
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
MENTAL
Traditions occult
Cast [two‑acactions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration unlimited
You alter the target’s memories, either erasing a memory,
enhancing a memory’s clarity, altering a memory, or adding
a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist
the spell.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and realizes you tried
to alter its memory.
Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it
identifies the spell.
Failure During the first 5 minutes of the spell’s duration,
you can Sustain the Spell to modify a memory once each
round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of
memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes
of memory.
Any memories you’ve altered remain changed as long as the
spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5
minutes is up, you can’t alter any further memories.

words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches these
omissions with an indistinct haze.

The targets experience a day’s worth of recovery in an instant.
Any detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours
end, though this doesn’t shorten the duration of any active
spells affecting the targets. The targets regain Hit Points and
recover from conditions as if they had taken 24 hours of rest,
but they do not make their daily preparations again or gain
any benefits of rest other than healing. The targets are then
temporarily immune for 1 day.

POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, primal

to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell,
choose phoenix, purple worm, or sea serpent. While in this
form, you gain the beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait
(for purple worm or sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of

•	 AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
•	 20 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Darkvision.
•	 One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the
battle form you choose, which are the only attacks
you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack
modifier is +28, and you use the listed damage. These
attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the
enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed
attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
•	 Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier
is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster
you choose:
•	 Phoenix Speed 30 feet, fly Speed 90 feet; Melee [one‑acaction]
beak (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d6+12 piercing plus
2d4 fire and 2d4 persistent fire; Melee [one‑acaction] talon (agile,
reach 15 feet), Damage 2d8+12 slashing; Shroud of
Flame (aura, evocation, fire, primal) 20 feet. You gain
an aura of fire that extends out from you. A creature
that enters or ends its turn within the aura takes 2d6
fire damage. A creature can take this damage only
once per turn. You can use a single action, which
has the concentrate trait, to activate or deactivate
this aura.
•	 Purple Worm Speed 40 feet, burrow Speed 30 feet,
swim Speed 20 feet; Melee [one‑acaction] jaws (reach 10 feet),

difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.
•	 Sea Serpent Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 90 feet; Melee
[one‑acaction] jaws (reach 15 feet), Damage 2d12+20 piercing;
Melee [one‑acaction] tail (reach 25 feet), Damage 2d8+20
bludgeoning; Spine Rake [two‑acactions] (move) You extend
your spines and Swim or Stride. Each creature you’re
adjacent to at any point during your movement takes
4d8+10 slashing damage (basic Reflex against your
spell DC).
Heightened (9th) You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25

MOON FRENZY
SPELL 5
MORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two‑acactions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 5 willing creatures
Duration 1 minute
A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and
savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status
bonus to their Speeds, and weakness 5 to silver. They also
grow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. The
fangs deal 2d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 2d6 slashing
damage and have the agile and finesse traits. The targets
use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency
with these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization
or greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as
well. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the
creature struck takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.
The targets can’t use concentrate actions unless those
actions also have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek. A
creature can attempt to end the spell’s effect on itself by using
a single action, which has the rage trait, to attempt a Will save
against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the spell’s effect
on itself.
If a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one
size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a
Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.
Heightened (6th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the
silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks to
three dice.
Heightened (10th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 20,
the silver weakness to 20, and the damage dealt by the

any time it’s adjacent to the plants.
•	 Aggressive animals attack unpredictably. At the start
of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a
failure, it’s attacked by swarming creatures that deal
2d10 slashing damage. The target attempts a basic
Reflex save, and it is flat-footed for 1 round on any
outcome other than a critical success.
•	 The target loses any connection to nature or natural
creatures. The target has to succeed at a DC 5 flat
check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails.
Furthermore, animal or plant creatures become hostile
to it, even one with a strong bond to the target, such
as an animal companion.
The GM might decide that you can’t subject some creatures,
such as an emissary of a nature deity, to the ire of nature.
NEGATE AROMA
SPELL 1
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 hour
The target loses its odor, preventing creatures from passively
noticing its presence via smell alone, even if the creatures have
precise or imprecise scent. A creature attempting a Perception
check to Seek with scent and other senses might notice the
lack of natural scent. If the target has any abilities that result
from its smell, such as an overpowering scent, those abilities
are also negated.
Heightened (5th) The range increases to 30 feet, and you can
target up to 10 creatures.

You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to
detect via magic. Nondetection attempts to counteract all
detection, revelation, and scrying divinations made against the
target or the target’s gear throughout the duration, counting
cantrips as 1st-level spells for this purpose. Successfully
counteracting a divination that targets an area or multiple
targets negates the effects only for nondetection’s target.

use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception,
Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and
creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward

ENCHANTMENT
INCAPACITATION
MENTAL

Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Area 40-foot burst; Targets any number of creatures
Saving Throw Will; Duration until full tribute is paid
You surround yourself with supernatural splendor, appearing
to be a god or similarly majestic being. You choose the aspects
of your new majestic appearance. This causes the targets to
pay tribute to you by bowing or using some other action in
keeping with your appearance. The number of times a target
must do this depends on the result of their Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target must pay tribute twice.
Failure The target must pay tribute six times.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target must spend all its
actions paying tribute if possible.
Paying tribute is a manipulate action or move action, as chosen
by the creature paying tribute. A creature under this effect
must pay tribute to you at least once on each of its turns if
possible. While affected by this spell, a creature is fascinated
by you and can’t use hostile actions against you. The target is
then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

on a critical success.
Heightened (7th) You can target up to 10 creatures.
PARANOIA
SPELL 2
ILLUSION
MENTAL
Traditions occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You cause the target to see all other creatures as dire threats.
The target is stricken by intense paranoia toward all creatures
around it and must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target believes everyone it sees is a potential
threat. It becomes unfriendly to all creatures to which it
wasn’t already hostile, even those that were previously
allies. It treats no one as an ally. The spell ends after 1 round.
Failure As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, except the target believes that
everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions
and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether
they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM. It
otherwise acts as rationally as it normally does and likely
prefers to attack creatures that are actively attacking or
hindering it over those leaving it alone.
Heightened (6th) You can target up to 5 creatures.
PASS WITHOUT TRACE
SPELL 1
ABJURATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
You obscure the tracks you leave behind and make it harder
for others to find you. The DC of checks to Track you gains a

in a higher DC. You can benefit from only one pass without
trace spell at a time.
Heightened (2nd) The duration increases to 8 hours.
Heightened (4th) The duration increases to 8 hours. The spell
has a range of 20 feet and an area of a 20-foot-emanation,
affecting up to 10 creatures of your choice within that area.

EARTH
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Area 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 10-foot-deep
section of wooden, plaster, or stone wall
Duration 1 hour
You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area,
replacing the area with empty space. If the wall is thicker than
10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal
in the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell
doesn’t reduce the integrity of the structure. When the spell
ends, anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.
Heightened (7th) The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The
areas of the wall that contain your tunnel’s entrance appear
completely normal (unless viewed with true seeing or a similar
effect), despite the tunnel’s existence. The tunnel’s entrance
functions as a solid wall, but you can specify a password or a
trigger (page 305), allowing creatures to enter the tunnel freely.

animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities:

PHANTASMAL CALAMITY
SPELL 6
ILLUSION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Saving Throw Will; Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each
creature in the area. The vision deals 11d6 mental damage (basic
Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed
at a Reflex save or believe it’s trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift
at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails
the second save, it’s also stunned for 1 minute. It can attempt a
new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it
disbelieves the illusion and recovers from the stunned condition.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.

killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as
it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the
outcome of the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes 4d6 mental damage and is
frightened 1.
Failure The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is
frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target is so afraid it might die. It must
attempt a Fortitude save; if the target fails, it dies. On a
successful Fortitude save, the target takes 12d6 mental
damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is
frightened 4. This effect has the incapacitation trait.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6 on a failure and
by 3d6 on a critical failure.

a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes full initial damage but no persistent
damage, and the spell ends immediately.
Failure The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and
the target is sickened 1. If the target recovers from being
sickened, the persistent damage ends and the spell ends.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is sickened 2.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d4 and the
persistent damage by 1d4.
PHANTOM STEED
SPELL 2
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes (somatic, verbal)

You conjure a Large, magical, equine creature that only you
(or another Medium or Small creature you choose) can ride.
The horse is clearly phantasmal in nature, has 20 AC and 10
Hit Points, and automatically fails all saves. If it’s reduced to
0 Hit Points, it disappears and the spell ends. The steed has
a Speed of 40 feet and can hold its rider’s body weight, plus
20 Bulk.
Heightened (4th) The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk
on water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain.
Heightened (5th) The steed has a Speed of 60 feet, can walk
on water, and ignores areas of natural difficult terrain. It can
also air walk but must end its turn on solid ground or fall.
Heightened (6th) The steed can walk or fly at a Speed of 80
feet, can walk on water, and ignores natural difficult terrain.
PLANE SHIFT
SPELL 7
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes (focus, material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature, or up to 8 willing
creatures joining hands
You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of
existence. The targets move to another plane, such as the
Plane of Fire, the Shadow Plane, or the Abyss. You must have
specific knowledge of the destination plane and use a magic
tuning fork created from material from that plane as a focus
for the spell. While the tuning forks for most prominent planes
are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure
planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks.
The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles
from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was
located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it’s
the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you
appear at a random location on the plane. Plane shift doesn’t
provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift
again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there
are extenuating circumstances.

PLANT FORM
SPELL 5
PLANT
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into
a Large plant battle form. You must have space to expand into
or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose arboreal,
flytrap, or shambler. You can substitute a similar specific plant
to turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but
this has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this
form, you gain the plant trait. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
•	 AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
•	 12 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Resistance 10 to poison.
•	 Low-light vision.
•	 One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the
battle form you choose, which are the only attacks
you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack
modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These
attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the
enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed
attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
•	 Athletics modifier of +19, unless your own modifier
is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the type of plant
you choose:
•	 Arboreal Speed 30 feet; Melee [one‑action] branch (reach 15
feet), Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Melee [one‑action] foot,
Damage 2d8 bludgeoning; you can speak in this
form, but you still can’t Cast a Spell or supply verbal
components.
•	 Flytrap Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; Melee [one‑action]
leaf (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing, and you can
spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
•	 Shambler Speed 20 feet, swim Speed 20 feet;
resistance 10 to electricity; Melee [one‑action] vine (reach 15
feet), Damage 2d8 slashing.
Heightened (6th) Your battle form is Huge, and the reach
of your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain
AC = 22 + your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21,
damage bonus +16, and Athletics +22.
POLAR RAY
SPELL 8

EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal

You fire a blue-white ray of freezing air and swirling sleet from
your finger that can chill your target to the bones. You must
succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target, which then
takes 10d8 cold damage and is drained 2.

Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
You send your mind and soul into the target’s body, attempting
to take control. The target must attempt a Will save. You can
choose to use the effects of a degree of success more favorable
to the target if you prefer.
While you’re possessing a target, your own body is
unconscious and can’t wake up normally. You can sense
everything the possessed target does. You can Dismiss this
spell. If the possessed body dies, the spell ends and you
must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or
be paralyzed for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If
the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the
possessed creature’s initiative count.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success You possess the target but can’t control it. You ride
along in the body while the spell lasts.
Failure You possess the target and take partial control of it.
You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might
control the target. At the start of each of the target’s turns,
it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it’s controlled by you
on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions; and
if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell ends.
Critical Failure You possess the target fully, and it can only
watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is
controlled by you.
Heightened (9th) The duration is 10 minutes, and you can
physically enter the creature’s body, protecting your physical

you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of four options.
•	 Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
•	 Lift Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or
less 1 foot off the ground.
•	 Make Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk,
made of congealed magical substance. The object
looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it
can’t be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
•	 Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less.
You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of
concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
Prestidigitation can’t deal damage or cause adverse

PRIMAL HERD
SPELL 10
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets you and up to 5 willing targets
Duration 1 minute
Summoning the power of the natural world, you transform
the targets into a herd of mammoths, and they each assume
a Huge battle form. Each target must have enough space to
expand into or the spell fails for that target. Each target gains
the animal trait. Each target can Dismiss the spell’s effects on
themself. Each target gains the following while transformed:
•	 AC = 22 + the target’s level. Ignore any armor check
penalty and Speed reduction.
•	 20 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Speed 40 feet.
•	 Low-light vision.
•	 The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the
only attacks the target can use. They’re trained with
them. When attacking with these attacks, the target
uses their attack modifier with the proficiency and
item bonuses of their most favorable weapon or
unarmed Strike, and the damage is listed for each
attack. These attacks are Strength based (for the
purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If the
target’s unarmed attack modifier is higher, they can
use it instead. Melee [one‑action] tusk (reach 15 feet), Damage
4d8+19 piercing; Melee [one‑action] trunk (agile, reach 15 feet),
Damage 4d6+16 bludgeoning; Melee [one‑action] foot (agile,
reach 15 feet), Damage 4d6+13 bludgeoning.
•	 Athletics modifier of +30, unless the target’s own
modifier is higher.
•	 Trample [three‑actions] You move up to twice your Speed and
move through the space of Large or smaller creatures,
trampling each creature whose space you enter. A
trampled creature takes damage from its foot Strike
based on a basic Reflex save (DC = 19 + the target’s level).
PRIMAL PHENOMENON
SPELL 10
DIVINATION
Traditions primal
Cast [three‑actions] material, somatic, verbal
You request a direct intercession from the natural world.
Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might grant a
different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its
character) than the one you asked for. A primal phenomenon
spell can do any of the following things.
•	 Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level or lower.
•	 Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower.
•	 Produce any effect whose power level is in line with
the above effects.
•	 Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell.
At the GM’s discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon
to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be
dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.

PRISMATIC WALL
SPELL 8
ABJURATION
LIGHT
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three‑actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 hour
You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light.
The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30
feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space
so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the
spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects.
The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and
dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that
come into the wall’s light must attempt a Will save; they’re
dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a
failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure. They are
then temporarily immune to the blinding effect for 1 hour.
A prismatic wall has seven different layers, each a different
color. Red, orange, yellow, and green have the effect of a
5th-level chromatic wall (page 323) spell of that color, and
the others have the effect of a 7th-level chromatic wall spell
of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall
must attempt a saving throw against each component wall.
The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned
to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the
indigo and violet walls.
The wall as a whole is immune to counteracting effects of
the wall’s level or lower; each color must be counteracted by
its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be
done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then
violet). A given color can’t be affected until the previous color
is counteracted. Counteracting a color wall removes that
color’s effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends
prismatic wall. You can Dismiss the spell.

Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Area 100-foot burst
Duration 24 hours
From outside, the area looks like a bank of impenetrable black
fog. Sensory stimuli (such as sounds, smells, and light) don’t
pass from inside the area to outside the area. Scrying spells
can’t perceive any stimuli from the area, and mind-reading
effects don’t work in the area.

EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and
you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a
spell attack roll against your target’s AC. This is normally a
ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against
a creature in your unarmed reach. On a success, you deal
1d4 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On
a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4
persistent fire damage.
Heightened (+1) Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent
damage on a critical hit by 1d4.
PROJECT IMAGE
SPELL 7
ILLUSION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal

Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within
range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image,
the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than one
whose area is an emanation, you can cause the spell effect

to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the
image is an illusion, it can’t benefit from spells, though visual
manifestations of the spell appear. The image has the same AC
and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the
spell ends.
Heightened (+2) The maximum duration you can Sustain the
Spell increases to 10 minutes.
PROTECTION
SPELL 1
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
You ward a creature against a specified alignment. Choose
chaotic, evil, good, or lawful when you cast this spell.
The target gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and
saving throws against creatures and effects of the chosen
alignment. This bonus increases to +3 against effects
from such creatures that would directly control the target
and against attacks made by summoned creatures of the
chosen alignment.
This spell gains the trait that opposes the alignment you
chose—if you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait,
and vice versa; if you choose evil, this spell gains the good
trait, and vice versa.
PRYING EYE
SPELL 5
DIVINATION
SCRYING
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range see text
Duration sustained
You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a
location you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions
with your normal visual senses and continuously transmits
what it sees to you.
The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can
either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front
of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all
directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the
eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the
eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can
attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt
Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye
destroys it and ends the spell.

Violent winds and a powerful downdraft fill the area, forming
a cyclone. All flying creatures in the area descend 40 feet. The
entire area is greater difficult terrain for Flying creatures, and
difficult terrain for creatures on the ground or Climbing. Any
creature that ends its turn Flying within the area descends 20
feet. Any creature pushed into a surface by this spell’s winds
takes bludgeoning damage as though it had fallen.
The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder
prevent creatures from leaving. These squares are greater
difficult terrain, and a creature attempting to push through
must succeed at an Athletics check or Acrobatics check to
Maneuver in Flight against your spell DC to get through. A
creature that fails ends its current action but can try again.
PURIFY FOOD AND DRINK
SPELL 1
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal

You remove toxins and contaminations from food and drink,

future contamination, natural decay, or spoilage. One cubic
foot of liquid is roughly 8 gallons.

UNCOMMON
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal); Cost diamonds
worth a total value of the target’s level (minimum 1) × 200 gp
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of 13th level or lower
You attempt to call forth the dead creature’s soul, requiring the
creature’s body to be present and relatively intact. The creature
must have died within the past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided
that the creature’s time has come (at the GM’s discretion), or if
the creature doesn’t wish to return to life, this spell automatically
fails, but the diamonds aren’t consumed in the casting.
If the spell is successful, the creature returns to life with 1 Hit
Point, no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any
pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term
debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the Boneyard
leaves the target temporarily debilitated, making it clumsy 2,
drained 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can’t be
removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed.
The creature is also permanently changed by its time in the
afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a streak of white in
the hair, or a strange new birthmark.
Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to
15. The cost increases to the target’s level (minimum 1) × 400 gp.

RAY OF ENFEEBLEMENT
SPELL 1
ATTACK
NECROMANCY
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two‑actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Fortitude; Duration 1 minute
A ray with the power to sap a foe’s strength flashes from your
hand. Attempt a ranged spell attack against the target. If you
succeed, that creature attempts a Fortitude save in order to
determine the spell’s effect. If you critically succeed on your
attack roll, use the outcome for one degree of success worse
than the result of its save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

magical auras. When the casting is complete, you know
whether that item is magical, and if it is, you learn the school
of magic (pages 297–298).
If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect’s
level is lower than the level of your read aura spell.
Heightened (3rd) You can target up to 10 objects.
Heightened (6th) You can target any number of objects.

SPELL 4

DIVINATION
PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
You peek into the future. Choose a particular goal, event, or

or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, often
in the form of a rhyme or omen.
REGENERATE
SPELL 7
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing living creature
Duration 1 minute
An infusion of positive energy grants a creature continuous
healing. The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which
restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns.
While it has regeneration, the target can’t die from damage
and its dying value can’t exceed 3, though if its wounded value
becomes 4 or higher, it stays unconscious until its wounds are
treated. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration
deactivates until after the end of its next turn.
Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration,
it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During
the spell’s duration, the creature can also reattach severed
body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body
part to the area it was severed from.
Heightened (9th) The regeneration increases to 20.
REMAKE
SPELL 10
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 1 hour (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 5 feet
You fully re-create an object from nothing, even if the object
was destroyed. To do so, you must be able to picture the
object in your mind. Additionally, the material component
must be a remnant of the item, no matter how small or
insignificant (even a speck of dust that remains from
disintegrate is enough). The spell fails if your imagination
relied on too much guesswork; if the object would be too
large to fit in a 5-foot cube; if the object still exists and you
were simply not aware of it; or if the object is an artifact, has
a level over 20, or has similar vast magical power.
The item reassembles in perfect condition. Even if your
mental image was of a damaged or weathered object, the
new one is in this perfected form. If the object was magical,
this spell typically restores its constant magical properties,
but not any temporary ones, such as charges or one-time
uses. An item with charges or uses per day has all of its
uses expended when remade, but it replenishes them
normally thereafter.
REMOVE CURSE
SPELL 4
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Your touch grants a reprieve to a cursed creature. You attempt
to counteract one curse afflicting the target. If the curse
comes from a cursed item or other external source, a success
indicates that the target creature can rid itself of the cursed
item, but it doesn’t remove the curse from the item.
REMOVE DISEASE
SPELL 3
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, primal
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)

Healing magic purges disease from a creature’s body. You
attempt to counteract one disease afflicting the target.
REMOVE FEAR
SPELL 2
ENCHANTMENT
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
With a touch, you ease a creature’s fears. You can attempt
to counteract a single fear effect that the target suffers from.
This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the
fear effect.
Heightened (6th) The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, and
you can target up to 10 creatures.
REMOVE PARALYSIS
SPELL 2
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
A surge of energy frees a paralyzed creature. You can attempt
to counteract a single effect imposing the paralyzed condition
on the target. This does not cure someone who is paralyzed
from some natural state or effect, such as paralysis caused by
non-magical wounds or toxins.
Heightened (6th) The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, and
you can target up to 10 creatures.

================================================================================

You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching
you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius
you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save
if it’s within the area when you cast the spell or as soon as it
enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has
attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting
of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature’s movement apply
only if it voluntarily moves toward you. For example, if you
move closer to a creature, it doesn’t then need to move away.
Critical Success The creature’s movement is not restricted.
Success The creature treats each square in the area as difficult
terrain when moving closer to you.
Failure The creature can’t move closer to you within the area.
RESILIENT SPHERE
SPELL 4
ABJURATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 Large or smaller creature
Duration 1 minute
You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect
the target, blocking anything that would pass through the
sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points.
It’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate
destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the
effects of the sphere depend on the target’s Reflex save.
Critical Success The target disrupts the sphere’s integrity,
causing it to collapse entirely.
Success The sphere functions normally but has only 10 Hit
Points instead of 40.
Failure The sphere has its normal effect.
RESIST ENERGY
SPELL 2
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
A shield of elemental energy protects a creature against one
type of energy damage. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic damage. The target and its gear gain resistance 5 against
the damage type you chose.
Heightened (4th) The resistance increases to 10, and you can
target up to two creatures.
Heightened (7th) The resistance increases to 15, and you can
target up to five creatures.
RESPLENDENT MANSION
SPELL 9
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 500 feet
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
You conjure a towering mansion up to four stories tall and
up to 300 feet on a side. While Casting the Spell, you hold
an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in
your mind. The mansion can contain as many or as few rooms
as you desire, and it is decorated as you imagine it. You can
imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper
accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane
fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but
they cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created
with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices
brought into the mansion function normally.
Your mansion contains the same types and quantities
of foodstuffs and servants as created by the magnificent
mansion spell.
Each of the mansion’s exterior doorways and windows
are protected by alarm spells. You choose whether each
alarm is audible or mental as you Cast the Spell, and each
has a different sound (for an audible alarm) or sensation (for
a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which
portal has been used.
RESTORATION
SPELL 2
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast 1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions
that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you
cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the
effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration
spell each day, and it can’t benefit from restoration more than
once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.
•	 Reduce a Condition Reduce the value of the target’s
clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition by 2. You can
instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.
•	 Lessen a Toxin Reduce the stage of one toxin the
target suffers from by one stage. This can’t reduce the
stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.
Heightened (4th) Add drained to the list of conditions you can
reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You
also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target’s
doomed value by 1. You can’t use this to reduce a permanent
doomed condition.
Heightened (6th) As the 4th-level restoration, but you can
reduce a permanent doomed condition if you add a spellcasting
action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during
which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
RESTORE SENSES
SPELL 2
HEALING
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
You attempt to counteract a single effect imposing the blinded
or deafened conditions on the target, restoring its vision
or hearing. This can counteract both temporary magic and
permanent consequences of magic, but it doesn’t cure someone
who does not have the sense due to some natural state or
effect, such as from birth or from a non-magical wound or toxin.
Core Rulebook
364

================================================================================

Heightened (6th) The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, and
you can target up to 10 creatures. You can choose the effect to
counteract separately for each selected creature.
RETROCOGNITION
SPELL 7
DIVINATION
Traditions occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Duration sustained
Opening your mind to occult echoes, you gain impressions
from past events that occurred in your current location.
Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that
occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first
minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next
day back the next minute, and so on. These echoes don’t play
out like a vision but instead reveal impressions of emotions
and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of the
past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through
an impression, the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will
save with a DC of at least 30 and possibly as much as 50,
depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines
whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.
Heightened (8th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead
of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder
to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.
Heightened (9th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous century for each minute you concentrate,
instead of the previous day, though the details diminish,
making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from
all but the most major events.
REVERSE GRAVITY
SPELL 7
UNCOMMON
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder
Duration 1 minute
You reverse gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that
aren’t secured to the ground immediately fall upward to the
top of the area. A creature might be able to Grab an Edge
to arrest its fall if it falls past an appropriate surface. If a
creature falls against a solid object (such as a ceiling), it takes
the appropriate amount of falling damage and lands on the
surface. Once an object or creature reaches the top of the area,
it floats, caught between the normal and reversed gravity. The
creature can move along the plane where the two forms of
gravity meet. Creatures that can levitate or fly can use those
abilities to mitigate the effects of reverse gravity.
When reverse gravity ends, all creatures and objects caught
in the area fall back down. Likewise, anything that moves
beyond the spell’s area is subjected to normal gravity again.

SPELL 10
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets dead creatures and living creatures of
your choice within range
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A burst of healing energy soothes living creatures and
temporarily rouses those recently slain. All living targets regain
10d8+40 Hit Points. In addition, you return any number of dead
targets to life temporarily, with the same effects and limitations
as raise dead (page 362). The raised creatures have a number
of temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points you gave living
creatures, but no normal Hit Points. The raised creatures can’t
regain Hit Points or gain temporary Hit Points in other ways, and
once revival’s duration ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points
and die. Revival can’t resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate
or a death effect. It has no effect on undead.
RIGHTEOUS MIGHT
SPELL 6
POLYMORPH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements You have a deity.
Duration 1 minute
You focus all your divine energy and transform yourself
into a Medium battle form, similar to your normal form but
armed with powerful divine armaments granted by your
deity. While in this form, you gain the statistics and abilities
listed below. You have hands in this battle form and can use
manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities:
•	 AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check
penalty and Speed reduction.
•	 10 temporary Hit Points.
•	 Speed 40 feet.
•	 Resistance 3 against physical damage.
•	 Darkvision.
•	 A special attack with a righteous armament version
of your favored weapon, which is the only attack
you can use. Your attack modifier with the special
weapon is +21, and your damage bonus is +8 (or +6
for a ranged attack). If your attack modifier with
your deity’s favored weapon is higher, you can use
it instead. You deal three of your weapon’s normal
damage dice, or three damage dice of one size
larger if your weapon is a simple weapon with a
d4 or d6 damage die. The weapon has one of the
following properties that matches your deity’s
alignment: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, unholy. If your
deity is true neutral, you instead deal an extra 1d6
precision damage.
•	 Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own modifier
is higher.
Heightened (8th) Your battle form is Large, and your attacks have
10-foot reach, or 15-foot reach if your deity’s favored weapon
has reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the
spell is lost. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary
HP, resistance 4 against physical damage, attack modifier +28,
damage bonus +15 (+12 for a ranged attack), and Athletics +29.
ROPE TRICK
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
EXTRADIMENSIONAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 touched piece of rope from 5 to 30
feet long
Duration 8 hours
You cause the target rope to rise vertically into the air. Where it
ends, an extradimensional space opens, connected to the top of
the rope. This space can be reached only by climbing the rope.
The entrance to the space can’t be seen, and it can be
pinpointed only by the presence of the rope. The rope can’t
be removed or hidden, though it can be detached from the
extradimensional space by pulling it with 16,000 pounds of
weight, critically succeeding at an Athletics check against the
spell’s DC, or destroying the rope. The space holds up to eight
Medium creatures and their gear. A Large creature counts as
two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium
creatures, and a Gargantuan creature fills the space on its own.
If the rope is detached or destroyed, or if a creature attempts
to enter the space that would put it over its capacity, the space
begins to unravel. It disappears in 1d4 rounds, depositing the
creatures within safely on the ground below.
SANCTIFIED GROUND
SPELL 3
ABJURATION
CONSECRATION

Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal); Cost 1 vial of holy water
Area 30-foot burst centered on you

You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with holy water and warding
it against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons,
fiends, monitors, or undead. All creatures in the area gain a
+1 status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving
throws against the chosen creatures.
SANCTUARY
SPELL 1
ABJURATION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal

attempt a Will save each time. If the target uses a hostile
action, the spell ends.
Critical Success Sanctuary ends.
Success The creature can attempt its attack and any other

SPELL 8
ILLUSION
INCAPACITATION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern, as are those
within 20 feet of the pattern’s area. A creature must attempt
a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters
the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or
Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by
the pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saves.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is confused for 1d4 rounds.
Critical Failure The creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After
the stunned condition ends, the creature is confused for the

SPELL 6
UNCOMMON
DIVINATION
SCRYING
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 10 minutes
You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying works
like clairvoyance (page 324), except that the image you receive
is less precise, insufficient for teleport and similar spells.
Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you
instead create an eye that manifests just above the target. You
can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its
possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven’t met the target
in person, scrying’s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of
the target’s identity (perhaps because you found an unknown
creature’s fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower.
The effect of scrying depends on the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily
immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you
and learns its rough distance and direction from you.
Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune
for 1 day.
Failure The spell succeeds.
Critical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the

Cast [reaction] verbal; Trigger A spell or magical effect deals damage.
Range 60 feet; Targets the triggering spell
Exchanging material energy with that of the Shadow Plane,
you transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory
version of itself. Attempt to counteract the target spell. If the
attempt is successful, any creatures that would be damaged
by the spell instead take only half as much damage. but
the spell otherwise works as normal. Treat shadow siphon’s

CONJURATION
SHADOW
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets you and up to 9 willing creatures touched
Duration 8 hours
You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to
spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow
Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can’t see
the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although
elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection
of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the
targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane’s
denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes
bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the
Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this
border, they move as far as they would through the Material
Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell’s
effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow
bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets
appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the
Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and
Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow
appear together).

Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to
AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t require a
hand to use.
While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block
reaction with your magic shield (see the sidebar). The shield
has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends
and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal
Shield Block, you can use the spell’s reaction against the magic
missile spell.
Heightening the spell increases the shield’s Hardness.
Heightened (3rd) The shield has Hardness 10.
Heightened (5th) The shield has Hardness 15.
Heightened (7th) The shield has Hardness 20.
Heightened (9th) The shield has Hardness 25.

gives you the ability to use the Shield Block reaction.
SHIELD BLOCK [reaction]
Trigger While you have your shield raised, you take
damage from a physical attack.

you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s

and your own. The target takes half damage from all effects
that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the remainder of the
damage. When you take damage through this link, you don’t
apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities you have
to that damage; you simply take that amount of damage. The
spell ends if the target is ever more than 30 feet away from
you. If either you or the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, any
damage from this spell is resolved and then the spell ends.

ends if you toss the object onto a solid surface. The object
can’t be used to attack or cause damage during the process of

You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about
1 square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. The
mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from
one state to another by using an Interact action to touch

creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10-
foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects
in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are
subject to the same effects as the target. Depending upon

INCAPACITATION
MENTAL
SLEEP
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Saving Throw Will
Each creature in the area becomes drowsy and might fall
asleep. A creature that falls unconscious from this spell
doesn’t fall prone or release what it’s holding. This spell
doesn’t prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful
Perception check, limiting its utility in combat.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception
checks for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious
after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.

SPEAK WITH ANIMALS
SPELL 2
DIVINATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the

friendly than normal. Cunning animals are likely to be terse and
evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
SPEAK WITH PLANTS
SPELL 4
DIVINATION
PLANT
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants, but
the spell doesn’t make them more friendly or intelligent than
normal. Most normal plants have a distinctive view of the world
around them, so they don’t recognize details about creatures or
know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity.
Cunning plant monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while
less intelligent ones often make inane comments.

================================================================================

You create a semicorporeal hand out of your essence that
delivers touch spells for you. Whenever you Cast a Spell with a
range of touch, you can have the hand crawl to a target within
range along the ground, touch it, and then crawl back to you.
When making a melee spell attack with the hand, you use your
normal bonuses. The hand can move as far as it needs to within
range. The hand has your AC and saves, but any damage to the
hand destroys it and causes you to take 1d6 damage.
SPELL IMMUNITY
SPELL 4
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 24 hours
You ward a creature against the effects of a single spell. Choose
a spell and name it aloud as part of the verbal component. Spell
immunity attempts to counteract that spell whenever spell
immunity’s target is the target of the named spell or in that
spell’s area. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets
an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates the
effects only for the target affected by spell immunity.
SPELL TURNING
SPELL 7
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION
Traditions arcane
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 hour
This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster.
When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to attempt
to reflect it. This uses the rules for counteracting the spell, but
if the spell is successfully counteracted, the effect is turned
back on the caster. Whether or not the counteract attempt is
successful, spell turning then ends. Spell turning can’t affect
spells that aren’t targeted (such as area spells).
If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who is also
under the effect of spell turning, their spell turning can attempt
to reflect their own spell back at you again; if they do so, their
counteract attempt automatically succeeds.
SPELLWRACK
SPELL 6
ABJURATION
CURSE
FORCE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will
You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy
in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with
a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage.
Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack,
it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1
round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell
DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage;
the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.
Failure As success, but the curse and persistent damage do
not end on their own.
Critical Failure As failure, but the persistent force damage
is 4d12.

Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature’s
spirit, dealing 16d6 force damage. Because spirit blast affects
the creature’s spirit, it can damage a target projecting its
consciousness (such as via project image) or possessing
another creature even if the target’s body is elsewhere. The
possessed creature isn’t harmed by the blast. The blast doesn’t
harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.

to take in its pain. When you Cast this Spell and at the start of
each of your turns, if the target is below maximum Hit Points,
it regains 2 Hit Points (or the difference between its current
and maximum Hit Points, if that’s lower). You lose as many Hit
Points as the target regained.
This is a spiritual transfer, so no effects apply that would
increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit
Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit
Points you or the target have. Since this effect doesn’t involve
positive or negative energy, spirit link works even if you or the
target is undead. While the duration persists, you gain no benefit
from regeneration or fast healing. You can Dismiss this spell,
and if you’re ever at 0 Hit Points, spirit link ends automatically.
Heightened (+1) The number of Hit Points transferred each
time increases by 2.
SPIRIT SONG
SPELL 8
FORCE
NECROMANCY
Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 60-foot cone
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
Your eldritch song sends pulsing waves of ethereal energy
to attack creatures’ spirits in the area, dealing 18d6 force
damage. Because spirit song affects creatures’ spirits, it can
damage a target projecting its consciousness (such as via
project image) or possessing another creature even if the
target’s body is elsewhere. The vibrating waves of spiritual
song penetrate into, but not through, solid barriers, damaging
incorporeal creatures hiding in solid objects in the area but
not passing onward to damage creatures in other rooms.
Possessed creatures aren’t harmed by the song. The song
doesn’t harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.

You curse the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious

creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while
it’s affected is targeted by spiritual epidemic and must also
attempt a Will save. The curse continues to spread in this way.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

SPIRITUAL GUARDIAN
SPELL 5
ATTACK
ABJURATION
FORCE
Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements You have a deity.
Range 120 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A Medium guardian made of magical force appears and
attacks foes you designate within range. The spiritual
guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity’s
favored weapon.
When you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in
an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range
and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the
Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied
space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make
a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your
multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the
Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally
and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take
damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of
your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian
to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the
guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can’t recover
Hit Points by any means). The guardian can’t usually take
damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate
automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian’s AC
of 25.
The guardian’s Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless
of the appearance of the guardian’s weapon, the guardian
deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt
by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits
or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon
attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack,
the spiritual guardian’s weapon is a weapon for the purposes
of triggers, resistances, and so forth.
The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when
flanking, but it doesn’t have any other attributes a creature
would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures
can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian
can’t make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or
spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to
the guardian.
Heightened (+2) The guardian’s damage increases by 1d8, and
its Hit Points increase by 20.

A weapon made of pure magical force materializes and

has a ghostly appearance and manifests as your deity’s
favored weapon.
When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe
you choose within range and makes a Strike against it. Each
time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the weapon to a new
target within range (if needed) and Strike with it. The spiritual
weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.
The weapon’s Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless
of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to
1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can deal
damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead
of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a
versatile weapon). No other statistics or traits of the weapon
apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures
only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual weapon is
a weapon for purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.
The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have
any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make
any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect
weapons do not apply to it.

STONE TELL
SPELL 6
UNCOMMON
EVOCATION
EARTH
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or
worked stone. While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the
natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by
the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is
part of, for worked stone. A stone’s perspective, perception, and
knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human’s
that it doesn’t consider the same details important. Stones can
mostly answer questions about creatures that touched them in
the past and what is concealed beneath or behind them.
STONE TO FLESH
SPELL 6
EARTH
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets petrified creature or human-size stone object

flesh (without stone’s Hardness) in roughly the same shape.

EARTH
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 20 minutes

SPELL 9
AIR
ELECTRICITY
EVOCATION
Traditions primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 800 feet; Area 360-foot burst
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A massive storm cloud forms in the air in a 360-foot burst.
Beneath it, rain begins to fall, and gales impose a –4 circumstance
penalty to physical ranged attacks and weapon ranged attacks,
and the air in the area becomes greater difficult terrain for flying
creatures. When you Cast this Spell and the first time each round
you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of the following storm
effects. You can’t choose the same effect twice in a row.
•	 Acid Rain Each creature in the storm takes 4d8 acid
damage with no saving throw.
•	 Hail The storm deals 4d10 bludgeoning damage to
creatures beneath it (basic Fortitude save).
•	 Lightning Up to 10 bolts of lightning strike down,
targeting creatures of your choice in the storm. No
more than one bolt can target any one creature. Each
bolt deals 7d6 electricity damage (basic Reflex save).
•	 Rain and Wind Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce
visibility and mobility, making the area under the
storm cloud difficult terrain and making everything
seen within or through the area concealed.
•	 Thunderclap Each creature in the storm must succeed
at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 10 minutes.
A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to
thunderclaps from storm of vengeance for 1 hour.
Heightened (10th) The range increases to 2,200 feet, and the
cloud is a 1,000-foot burst.

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration varies
You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the target’s
mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify occurs (as
described on page 305). You suggest a course of action to the
target. Your directive must be phrased in such a way as to seem
like a logical course of action to the target, and it can’t be self-
destructive or obviously against the target’s self-interest. The
target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried
to control it.
Success The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking
to them normally, not casting a spell on them.
Failure The suggestion remains in the target’s subconscious
until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs before
then, the target immediately follows your suggestion. The
effect has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has
completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes
self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.

Traditions occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
The target’s senses are suddenly rewired in unexpected ways,
causing them to process noises as bursts of color, smells as
sounds, and so on. This has three effects, and the target must
attempt a Will save.
•	 Due to the distraction, the target must succeed at a DC
5 flat check each time it uses a concentrate action, or
the action fails and is wasted.
•	 The target’s difficulty processing visual input makes all
creatures and objects concealed from it.
•	 The creature has trouble moving, making it clumsy 3 and
giving it a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.

TALKING CORPSE
SPELL 4
UNCOMMON
NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 corpse
Saving Throw Will; Duration 10 minutes
You grant the target corpse a semblance of life, which it uses
to speak the answers to three questions posed to it. This
spell calls on the physical body’s latent memories rather than
summoning back the deceased’s spirit, so the corpse must
be mostly intact for the spell to function. The more damage
the corpse has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its
answers are, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak
at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse
in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can
attempt a Will save to resist answering the questions using
the statistics of the original creature at its time of death,
with the following effects.
Critical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer your
questions, and the target’s spirit haunts you for 24 hours,
bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest
for that time.
Success The target can provide false information or refuse
to answer your questions.
Failure The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can
be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or
attempt to stall so that the spell’s duration runs out before
you can ask all your questions.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target’s answers are
more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It
takes a –2 status penalty to Deception checks to deceive
or mislead you.

Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill
any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the
land, or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a –10-
foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once
per round, you can make a vine lash out from any square within
the expanse of creepers by using a single action, which has the
concentrate trait. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a
melee unarmed attack using your spell attack modifier. If the
attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and
makes it immobilized for 1 round or until the creature Escapes

You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it
can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words
or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of
suggestion (page 374), with the message substituting for
the spoken suggestion. On a successful save, the target is
temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the
target is temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a
creature only if you have previously been in telepathic contact
with it before, such as via the telepathy spell.

CONJURATION
TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range 100 miles; Targets you and up to 4 targets touched, either
willing creatures or objects roughly the size of a creature.
You and the targets are instantly transported to any location
within range, as long as you can identify the location precisely
both by its position relative to your starting position and
by its appearance (or other identifying features). Incorrect
knowledge of the location’s appearance usually causes the
spell to fail, but it could instead lead to teleporting to an
unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined
by the GM. Teleport is not precise over great distances. The
targets appear at a distance from the intended destination
equal to roughly 1 percent of the total distance traveled, in a
direction determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack
of precision is irrelevant, but for long distances this could be
up to 1 mile.
Heightened (7th) You and the other targets can travel to any
location within 1,000 miles.
Heightened (8th) You and the other targets can travel to any
location on the same planet. If you travel more than 1,000

location on another planet within the same solar system.
Assuming you have accurate knowledge of the location’s

SPELL 10
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, occult

You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing
you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no
time at all. Immediately after casting time stop, you can use up
to 9 actions in 3 sets of up to 3 actions each. After each set
of actions, 1 round passes, but only for you, effects specifically
targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the
stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to
your attacks, and you can’t target or affect them with anything.
Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again
for the rest of the world. If you created an effect with a duration
that extends beyond the time stop’s duration, such as wall of
fire, it immediately affects others again, but it doesn’t have any
of the effects that happen only when you first cast the spell.

tree that is strangely new to the area. While in tree form, you
can observe everything around you, but you can’t act other
than to end the spell, and your turn, by using a single action,
which has the concentrate trait. As a tree, your AC is 20, and
only status bonuses, status penalties, circumstance bonuses,
and circumstance penalties affect you. Any successes and
critical successes you roll on Reflex saves are failures.

a secret counteract check against any illusion or transmutation

position of one creature or object. Choose one target creature
or object in the area to be tracked. It becomes the sensor for
the spell. Up to five willing creatures of your choice in the
area can see a ghostly image of this creature or object when
it’s out of their sight. They can perceive the creature or object
perfectly, allowing them to ignore the concealed or invisible
condition, though physical barriers still provide cover.
The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or
object through all barriers other than lead or running water,
which block their vision. Distance doesn’t matter, though the
creature or object might move so far away it becomes too
small to perceive. The tracking creatures don’t see any of the
environment around the target, though they do see any gear a
creature is wearing or holding, and they can tell if it removes
objects from its person.
If the target to be tracked is willing, the duration is 1 hour. If
you try to track an unwilling creature, the target must attempt
a Will save.
Critical Success The creature or object is unaffected.
Success As described, and the duration is 1 minute.
Failure As described, and the duration is 1 hour.

DEATH
NECROMANCY
NEGATIVE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot cone
Saving Throw basic Fortitude
You draw in the blood and life force of other creatures through
your outstretched arms. You deal 12d6 negative damage to
living creatures in the area.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage
a single creature takes from this spell; calculate these
temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most
damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after
1 minute.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.

Saving Throw basic Fortitude
Your touch leeches the lifeblood out of a target to empower
yourself. You deal 6d6 negative damage to the target. You gain
temporary Hit Points equal to half the negative damage the
target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose
any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
VEIL
SPELL 4
ILLUSION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 10 creatures
Duration 1 hour
You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same
body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and
weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets’
identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but
it’s not precise enough to impersonate specific individuals. The
spell doesn’t change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose
the disguise for each target; for example, you could make one
target appear to be a dwarf and another an elf.
Casting veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose
of the Impersonate action. It allows the target to ignore any
circumstance penalties they might take for being disguised as
dissimilar creatures, and it gives the targets a +4 status bonus
to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through
their disguises, and add their level even if untrained. You can
Dismiss any or all of these disguises.
Heightened (5th) The spell also disguises the targets’ voices
and scents; it gains the auditory trait.
Heightened (7th) The targets can appear as any creature of the
same size, even specific individuals. You must have seen an
individual to reproduce their appearance. The spell also disguises
the targets’ voices and scents; it gains the auditory trait.

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 10 minutes
Whenever you speak or make any other sound vocally, you
can make your vocalization seem to originate from somewhere
else within 60 feet, and you can change that apparent location
freely as you vocalize. Any creature that hears the sound can
attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
Heightened (2nd) The spell’s duration increases to 1 hour,
and you can also change the tone, quality, and other aspects
of your  voice. Before a creature can attempt to disbelieve
your illusion, it must actively attempt a Perception check or
otherwise use actions to interact with the sound.

ILLUSION
INCAPACITATION
VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] material, somatic
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern.
In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw
if it’s inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern,
ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact
action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the
pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saving throws.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is blinded by the pattern. If it exits
the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from
the blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a
maximum duration of 1 minute.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 minute.

Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 minute
An illusion of horrific creatures fills the spell’s area. The
creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters with a specific
appearance of your choice, such as Hellish flies or animated
saw blades. The burst deals 8d8 mental damage to each
creature that’s inside the burst when it’s created, enters
the burst, or starts its turn inside the burst. A creature that
critically succeeds at its will save can immediately attempt to
disbelieve the illusion. A creature that tries to Interact with
the monsters or observes one with a Seek action can attempt
to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion
take no damage from the illusion thereafter.
Heightened (+1) The mental damage increases by 1d8.

VITAL BEACON
SPELL 4
HEALING
NECROMANCY
POSITIVE
Traditions divine, primal
Cast 1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Duration until your next daily preparations
Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to
supplicate and receive healing. Once per round, either you
or an ally can use an Interact action to supplicate and lay
hands upon you to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon
heals someone, it decreases in strength. It restores 4d10 Hit
Points to the first creature, 4d8 Hit Points to the second, 4d6
Hit Points to the third, and 4d4 Hit Points to the fourth, after
which the spell ends. You can have only one vital beacon
active at a time.
Heightened (+1) The beacon restores one additional die of Hit
Points each time it heals, using the same die size as the others
for that step.
VOLCANIC ERUPTION
SPELL 7
EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Area 5-foot radius, 80-foot-tall cylinder
Saving Throw Reflex
The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the
air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures
in the area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in
the area. A creature encased in rock is clumsy 1 and takes
a –10‑foot status penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain
is difficult terrain to a flying creature, and such creatures
immediately descend 20 feet the moment they’re encased,
but they don’t take damage from this fall. A creature encased
in rock can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to end the
effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes
a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.
Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of
the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the
intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is encased.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is
encased.
Heightened (+1) The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and
the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6.

must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes full damage.
Failure The target takes full damage and is drained 1d4.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is drained 4.
WALL OF FIRE
SPELL 4
EVOCATION
FIRE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You raise a blazing wall that burns creatures passing through
it. You create either a 5-foot-thick wall of flame in a straight
line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick,
10-foot-radius ring of flame with the same height. The wall
stands vertically in either form; if you wish, the wall can be of
a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall
is concealed from creatures on the opposite side. Any creature
that crosses the wall or is occupying the wall’s area at the
start of its turn takes 4d6 fire damage.
Heightened (+1) The fire damage increases by 1d6.
WALL OF FORCE
SPELL 6
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet
Duration 1 minute
You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50
feet long and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible
thickness. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space
so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or
the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit
Points, and it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage.
The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and
because it’s made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal
creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the
barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible).
Wall of force is immune to counteracting effects of its
level or lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by
a disintegrate spell of any level or by contact with a rod of
cancellation or sphere of annihilation.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of the wall increases by 20.
WALL OF ICE
SPELL 5
COLD
EVOCATION
WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You sculpt a barrier of ice that blocks sight and, once shattered,
freezes foes. You create either a 1-foot-thick wall of ice in a
straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high (the wall doesn’t
have to be vertical, but it must be anchored on both sides to a
solid surface) or a 1-foot-thick, 10-foot radius hemisphere of ice.
The ice that makes up the wall is opaque. If you wish, the wall
can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must create the
Core Rulebook
382

PAGE 384
================================================================================

wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through
any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10,
Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it’s immune to critical
hits, cold damage, and precision damage. A section also has
weakness to fire 15; a section of the wall destroyed by fire
melts, evaporating into water and steam. A section destroyed
by means other than fire leaves behind a chilling mass of ice
that is difficult terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to any
creature passing through it.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 10, and the cold damage dealt to creatures
crossing a destroyed section increases by 1d6.
WALL OF STONE
SPELL 5
CONJURATION
EARTH
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall
of stone up to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape
the wall’s path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border
between squares. The wall doesn’t need to stand vertically, so
you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You
must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges
don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness
14, and 50 Hit Points, and it’s immune to critical hits and
precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved
through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 15.
WALL OF THORNS
SPELL 3
CONJURATION
PLANT
Traditions primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet
Duration 1 minute
Over the course of a minute, you cause a thick wall of thorny
brambles to grow from the ground. You create a 5-foot-
thick wall of brambles and thorns in a straight line up to
60 feet long and 10 feet high. You must create the wall in
an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through
any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall stands
vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or
height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from
creatures on the opposite side, and the wall’s spaces are
difficult terrain. For every move action a creature uses to
enter at least one of the wall’s spaces, that creature takes
3d4 piercing damage.
Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness
10, and 20 Hit Points. It’s immune to critical hits and precision
damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely.
Heightened (+1) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 5, and the piercing damage increases by 1d4.
WALL OF WIND
SPELL 3
AIR
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You create a barrier of gusting winds that hinders anything
moving through it. The wall of swirling winds is 5 feet
thick, 60 feet long, and 30 feet high. The wall stands
vertically, but you can shape its path. Though the wall of
wind distorts the air, it does not hamper sight. The wall has
the following effects.
•	 Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such
as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of
similar size—can’t pass through the wall. Attacks with
bigger ranged weapons, such as javelins, take a –2
circumstance penalty to their attack rolls if their paths
pass through the wall. Massive ranged weapons and
spell effects that don’t create physical objects pass
through the wall with no penalty.
•	 The wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to
move overland through it. Gases, including creatures
in gaseous form, can’t pass through the wall.
•	 A creature that attempts to fly through the wall using a
move action must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature can move through the wall
normally this turn.
Success The flying creature can move through the wall this
turn, but the wall is difficult terrain.
Failure The wall stops the movement of the flying creature, and
any remaining movement from its current action is wasted.
Critical Failure As failure, and the creature is pushed 10 feet
away from the wall.
WANDERER’S GUIDE
SPELL 3
DIVINATION
Tradition divine, occult
Cast 1 minute (material, somatic, verbal)
Duration until your next daily preparations
You call upon the beyond to guide your route. When you
Cast this Spell, choose a destination; you receive an inspired
route to that destination, allowing you and allies who travel
overland with you to reduce the movement penalty from
difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don’t
deviate from the inspired route. This doesn’t have any effect
on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again
before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by
that of the new route.

================================================================================

The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of
the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune
for 10 minutes. Warp mind’s effects happen instantly, so dispel
magic and other effects that counteract spells can’t counteract
them. However, alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon,
restoration, or wish can still counteract the effects.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target spends the first action on its next turn
with the confused condition.
Failure The target is confused for 1 minute.
Critical Failure The target is confused permanently.
WATER BREATHING
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Cast 1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 5 creatures
Duration 1 hour
The targets can breathe underwater.
Heightened (3rd) The duration increases to 8 hours.
Heightened (4th) The duration increases to until your next
daily preparations.
WATER WALK
SPELL 2
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
The target can walk on the surface of water and other liquids
without falling through. It can go underwater if it wishes, but
in that case it must Swim normally. This spell doesn’t grant the
ability to breathe underwater.
Heightened (4th) The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, the
duration increases to 1 hour, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
WEAPON OF JUDGMENT
SPELL 9
EVOCATION
FORCE
Traditions divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal; Requirements You have a deity.
Range 100 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above
the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of
your deity’s favored weapon. Name war or peace when you
cast this spell.
If you name “war,” mentally choose one creature. This must
be a creature both you and the target can see. The target
instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each
of the target’s turns, if the target did not use a hostile action
against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon
Strikes the target.
If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The
target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon
Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action
against you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only
once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such
as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).
Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they
use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance,
the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your
spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple
attack penalty, which increases throughout the target’s turn,
but its penalty is separate from yours.
When the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the
normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage
(or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon).
No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even
a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of
judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances,
and so forth.
The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have
any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make
any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect
weapons do not apply to this weapon.
Heightened (10th) The force damage increases by 1d10.
WEAPON STORM
SPELL 4
EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot cone or 10-foot emanation
Saving Throw Reflex
You swing a weapon you’re holding, and the weapon magically
multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all creatures in either
a cone or an emanation. This flurry deals four dice of damage
to creatures in the area. This damage has the same type as
the weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die size
as if you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if you
were wielding a two-hand weapon in both hands, you’d use its
two-hand damage die.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target takes full damage.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is subject
to the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
Heightened (+1) Add another damage die.
WEB
SPELL 2
CONJURATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures’
movement each time they try to move through it. Squares
filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each square can be
cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at
least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5,
and it automatically fails its saving throws.
Each time a creature in the web begins to use a move action
or enters the web during a move action, it must attempt an
Core Rulebook
384

PAGE 386
================================================================================

Athletics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid
taking a circumstance penalty to its Speeds or becoming
immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to
take a circumstance penalty to its Speed from the web.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected, and it doesn’t
need to attempt further Athletics checks or saving throws
against the web this turn. If it used an Athletics check, it
clears the web from every square it leaves after leaving
the square.
Success The creature is unaffected during its action. If it used
an Athletics check, it clears the web from every square it
leaves after leaving the square.
Failure The creature takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to
its Speeds until the start of its next turn.
Critical Failure The creature is immobilized until the start of
its next turn, after which it takes a –10-foot circumstance
penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape
to remove its immobilized condition.
Heightened (4th) The spell’s area increases to a 20-foot burst,
and its range increases to 60 feet.
WEIRD
SPELL 9
DEATH
EMOTION
FEAR
ILLUSION
MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets any number of creatures
Saving Throw Will
You fill the targets’ minds with terrifying images of fearsome
creatures, each drawn from the targets’ worst fears. Only the
targets can see their assailants. Each target takes 16d6 mental
damage and must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage and is frightened 1.
Failure The target takes full damage and is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target is so afraid, it might instantly die.
It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If the target
succeeds, it takes double damage and is frightened 2,
and it’s also fleeing until the end of its next turn unless it
critically succeeded. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points
and dies.
WIND WALK
SPELL 8
AIR
TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast 10 minutes (material, somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets you and up to five creatures touched
Duration 8 hours
When you cast this spell, each target transforms into a
vaguely cloud-like form and is picked up by a wind moving
in the direction of your choice. You can change the wind’s
direction by using a single action, which has the concentrate
trait. The wind carries the targets at a Speed of 20 miles per
hour, but if any of the targets make an attack, Cast a Spell,
come under attack, or otherwise enter encounter mode, the
spell ends for all targets just after they roll initiative, and they
drift gently to the ground.
WISH
SPELL 10
DIVINATION
Traditions arcane
Cast [three-actions] material, somatic, verbal
You state a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A
wish spell can produce any one of the following effects.
•	 Duplicate any arcane spell of 9th level or lower.
•	 Duplicate any non-arcane spell of 7th level or lower.
•	 Produce any effect whose power level is in line with
the above effects.
•	 Reverse certain effects that refer to the wish spell.
The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce
greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous
or the spell might have only a partial effect.
ZEALOUS CONVICTION
SPELL 6
ENCHANTMENT
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 10 willing creatures
Duration 10 minutes
You bypass your targets’ rational minds, instilling them with
unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12
temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves
against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from
their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something,
it must comply with your request, though if it would normally
find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end
of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a
success, it ends the spell’s effects on itself entirely.
Heightened (9th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and
the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.
ZONE OF TRUTH
SPELL 3
UNCOMMON
ENCHANTMENT
MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Saving Throw Will; Duration 10 minutes
You designate an area in which creatures are compelled
to speak only truth. Creatures within or entering the area
have difficulty lying. Each potentially affected creature
must attempt a Will save when the spell is cast or when the
creature first enters the area. It uses the results of this initial
save if it leaves and reenters the area. Affected creatures
are aware of this enchantment; therefore, they can avoid
answering questions to which they would normally respond
with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within
the boundaries of the truth.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes a –2 status penalty to Deception checks.
Failure The target can’t speak any deliberate and intentional
lies, and it takes a –2 status penalty to Deception checks.
Critical Failure The target can’t speak any deliberate
and intentional lies and takes a –4 status penalty to
Deception checks.

This counts as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to
Aid your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the

You form a link with an ally, allowing you to take harm in
their stead. All the effects of the hit or failed save are applied
to you instead of the ally. For example, if the target critically
fails a saving throw against a fireball, you would take double
damage. These effects ignore any resistances, immunities, or
other abilities you have that might mitigate them in any way,
although those of the target apply before you take the effect.

Area 30-foot emanation
Duration 1 round
Divine insight lets you see things as they truly are. The GM
attempts a secret counteract check against each illusion that is
at least partially within the area. Instead of counteracting the
illusion, you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds
against an illusory disguise spell, you see the creature’s true
form but illusory disguise doesn’t end).
The area moves with you for the duration of the spell, and
the GM attempts a secret counteract check each time a new
illusion is within the area.
Heightened (7th) You can allow everyone to see through
illusions you succeed against, not just yourself.

Duration 1 minute
Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious
materials. The target item transforms from its normal metal into
cold iron, copper, gold, iron, silver, or steel (the details for these
metals are found on pages 577–579). An item transmuted in this
way deals damage according to its new material. For example,
a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional
damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron.
This change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item’s
monetary value doesn’t change; you couldn’t transmute copper
coins to gold and use those coins to purchase something or as
a cost for a spell.

You tap into the zeitgeist of the nearest settlement in range (if

special word to learn a brief summary of one significant event
happening in the settlement. Choose one of the following
words, which indicates the type of people involved and type
of event you learn about.
•	 Wardens city guards, barristers, and judges (criminal
reports, busts, changes in routines, legal trials)
•	 Titles nobles and politicians (high society weddings,
elite soirees, political rallies)
•	 Masses common folk and merchants (gathering mobs,
major sales)
When uttering your word, you can exclude events you already
know about, whether you know about them from this spell
or from other experiences. If you cast pulse of the city again
within 24 hours, you can say “echo” instead of another word
to get an update on the event you learned about the last time
you Cast the Spell.
Pulse of the city reveals only publicly available or
observable information. You never learn clandestine
movements or other details people are specifically trying to
hide. The spell is also notoriously bad at overcoming magic
meant to avoid detection; it automatically fails to reveal
information about events involving creatures, places, or
objects affected by spells that could prevent or counteract
pulse of the city (such as nondetection).

You learn a single enigmatic word connected to the creature’s

word isn’t necessarily meant to be taken at face value, so the

You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice:

================================================================================

Casting Rituals
When you take charge of a ritual, you are its primary
caster, and others assisting you are secondary casters. You
can be a primary caster for a ritual even if you can’t cast
spells. You must know the ritual, and the ritual’s spell
level can be no higher than half your level rounded up.
You must also have the required proficiency rank in
the skill used for the ritual’s primary check (see Checks
below), and as the primary caster, you must attempt this
skill check to determine the ritual’s effects. The primary
skill check determines the tradition.
Rituals do not require spell slots to cast. You can
heighten a ritual up to half your level rounded up, decided
when the ritual is initiated. A ritual always takes at least
1 hour to perform, and often longer. While a ritual is a
downtime activity, it’s possible—albeit risky—to perform
a ritual during exploration with enough uninterrupted
time. A ritual’s casting time is usually listed in days. Each
day of casting requires 8 hours of participation in the
ritual from all casters, with breaks during multiday rituals
to allow rest. One caster can continue a multiday ritual,
usually with some light chanting or meditation, while the
other casters rest. All rituals require material, somatic,
and verbal components throughout their casting time.
Learning Rituals
Learning a ritual does not count against any limits on
spells in your spell repertoire or on any other normal
spellcasting ability. Rituals are never common, though if
you look hard, you can probably find someone who can
perform an uncommon ritual for you. They may still be
unwilling to teach it to you.
Cost
A ritual’s Cost entry lists valuable components required to
cast the ritual. If a ritual doesn’t have any such components,
it won’t have a Cost entry. The cost is consumed when you
attempt the primary skill check. Costs are often presented
as a base cost multiplied by the target’s level and sometimes
the spell’s level. If the target’s level is lower than 1, multiply
the cost by 1 instead. Heightened versions that increase
the base cost multiply it by the target’s level or another
value as appropriate. Most rituals that create permanent
creatures, such as create undead, use costs based on the
level of the spell, as presented on Table 7–1.
Secondary Casters
Many rituals need additional secondary casters, who also
don’t need to be able to cast spells. Unlike a primary caster,
a secondary caster doesn’t need a minimum level or skill
proficiency. The Secondary Casters entry, if present, indicates
the minimum number of secondary casters required.
Checks
At the ritual’s culmination, you must attempt the skill
check listed in the Primary Check entry to determine the
ritual’s outcome. Primary checks usually have a very hard
DC for a level that’s twice the ritual’s spell level. As with
other downtime activities, fortune and misfortune effects
can’t modify your checks for the ritual, nor can bonuses
or penalties that aren’t active throughout the process.
The GM can adjust the DCs of rituals, add or change
primary or secondary checks, or even waive requirements
to fit specific circumstances. For example, performing a
ritual in a location where ley lines converge on the night
of a new moon might make a normally difficult ritual
drastically easier.
Secondary Checks
Often, a ritual requires secondary checks to represent aspects
of its casting, usually with a standard DC for a level twice
the ritual’s spell level. A different secondary caster must
attempt each secondary check. If there are more secondary
casters than checks, the others don’t attempt any.
Secondary casters attempt their checks before you
attempt the primary check; no matter their results, the
ritual proceeds to the primary check. Secondary checks
Rituals
A ritual is an esoteric and complex spell that anyone can cast. It takes much longer to cast
a ritual than a normal spell, but rituals can have more powerful effects.

Success No bonus or penalty.
Failure You take a –4 circumstance penalty to the primary

Effect

ability modifier, if you don’t have a spell DC).

RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON
TRANSMUTATION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, see Table 7–1; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert); Secondary Checks Crafting
Range 10 feet; Target 1 object
You transform the target into an animated object with a level
up to that allowed by Table 7–1 and of a type corresponding
to the object (so a broom would become an animated broom).
Critical Success The target becomes an animated object of the
appropriate type. If it’s at least 4 levels lower than you, you
can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning
it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding
it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate
traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your
control. If it doesn’t become a minion, you can give it one
simple command. It pursues that goal single‑mindedly,
ignoring any of your subsequent commands.
Success As critical success, except an animated object that
doesn’t become your minion stays in place and attacks
anyone that attacks it or tries to steal or move it, rather
than following your command.
Failure You fail to create the animated object.
Critical Failure You create the animated object, but it goes
berserk and attempts to destroy you.

Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Nature or Religion (whichever is used for the primary check)
Range 10 feet; Targets another creature of up to 8th level who
is a worshipper of the same deity or philosophy as you
You attempt to help a truly penitent creature atone for its
misdeeds, typically actions contrary to your deity’s alignment
or anathema to your deity. If the creature isn’t truly penitent,
the outcome is always a critical failure. This ritual uses Nature
if the target is a druid, and Religion in all other cases.
Critical Success The creature receives absolution for its
misdeeds, allowing it to regain standing with your deity. It
returns to its previous alignment (if its alignment shifted)
and regains any abilities it lost. Before the atonement is
complete, the creature must perform a special quest or
other task chosen by your deity, as befits its misdeeds. If
completed during downtime, this task should take no less
than 1 month. For 1 month, the target receives divine insight
just before performing an act that would be anathema to
your deity or contrary to your deity’s alignment.
Success As critical success, but the creature gains no special
insight regarding its subsequent actions.
Failure The creature does not receive absolution and must
continue to meditate and redress its misdeeds. Any future
atone rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as much and gain
a +4 circumstance bonus to primary and secondary checks.
Critical Failure The creature offends your deity and is
permanently cast out from the faith. The creature can’t
rejoin your religion without a more direct intervention.

Area 1/2-mile-radius circle centered on you
Duration 1 year
You twist and stunt plants in the area, causing them to wither. In
addition to other dangers from failing plant life, this decreases
the crop yield for farms. If you cast this ritual in an area affected
by plant growth, blight attempts to counteract plant growth
instead of producing its usual effect.

decrease the yield by half in an area with up to a 1-mile radius.
Success Decease the crop yield in the area by half.

Duration up to 10 minutes
You tear the veil to the afterlife and call a spirit from its final
resting place. You must call the spirit by name, and you must
provide a connection to the spirit, such as a possession, a
garment, or a piece of its corpse. A spirit unwilling to heed your
call can attempt a Will save to avoid it; on a critical success, a
trickster spirit Impersonates the spirit you meant to call. The DC
of the Will save is 2 lower if you haven’t met the spirit in life.
Either way, the spirit appears as a wispy form of the creature
you meant to call. Each minute of the duration, you can ask the
spirit a question. It can answer how it pleases or even refuse to
answer. If the spirit isn’t in the afterlife (such as if it’s an undead),
all results other than critical failures use the failure effect.
Critical Success The spirit is particularly cooperative, and
even if it has strong reasons to deceive you, it takes a –2
circumstance penalty to its Deception checks.
Success You call the spirit.
Failure You fail to call a spirit.
Critical Failure One or more evil spirits appear and attack.

Duration up to 10 minutes
You call upon an unknown planar entity to answer questions;
this is a servitor of your deity if you have one and use
Religion. You can ask up to seven questions that could be
answered with “Yes” or “No.” The entity is likely to know
answers related to its purview; a servitor of Gozreh would
likely know about unnatural weather patterns and a servitor
of Desna would likely know someone’s travel route. The
entity answers with one word answers such as “Yes,” “No,”
“Likely,” and “Unknown,” though its answers always reflect
its own agenda and could be deceptive.
Critical Success You contact a more powerful entity aligned
strongly with your interests, possibly even your deity. The
entity won’t attempt to deceive you, though it still might not
know the answers. When it’s important to provide clarity, the
entity will answer your questions with up to five words, such
as “If you leave immediately” or “That was true once.”
Success You can ask your questions and receive answers.
Failure You fail to contact a planar entity.
Critical Failure You are exposed to the enormity of the cosmos
and are stupefied 4 for 1 week (can’t remove by any means).

creating a sacred space. While within the area, worshippers
of your deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill
checks, saving throws, and Perception checks, and creatures
anathema to your deity (such as undead for Pharasma or
Sarenrae) take a –1 status penalty to those checks. Attacks
made by worshippers of your deity within the area deal 1
damage of one of your deity’s alignment types (your choice);
if your deity is true neutral, you don’t gain this benefit.
Critical Success The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts
for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the
radius. Occasionally, with your deity’s favor, this might
produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently
consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.
Success The consecration succeeds.
Failure The consecration fails.
Critical Failure The consecration fails spectacularly and
angers your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at
least 1 year, further attempts to consecrate the site fail.
Heightened (7th) The consecrated area also gains the effects
of the dimensional lock spell, but the effect doesn’t attempt

tornado
•	 Summer drizzle, downpour, extreme heat, hail, heat
•	 Autumn cold weather, fog, mild heat, sleet
•	 Winter blizzard, mild cold, extreme cold, thaw
You can’t specifically control the manifestations, such as the

Success You change the weather as desired.

Critical Failure The weather changes in an unanticipated way,
determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to
your true desires as possible (for instance, a terrible storm
emerges when you would prefer good weather).
Heightened (9th) You can create unseasonable weather and

Cast 1 day; Cost black onyx, see Table 7–1; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion
(expert); Secondary Checks Religion
Range 10 feet; Target 1 dead creature
You transform the target into an undead creature with
a level up to that allowed in Table 7–1. There are many
versions of this ritual, each specific to a particular type
of undead (one ritual for all zombies, one for skeletons,
one for ghouls, and so on), and the rituals that create rare
undead are also rare. Some forms of undead, such as liches,
form using their own unique methods and can’t be created
with a version of create undead.
Critical Success The target becomes an undead creature of the
appropriate type. If it’s at least 4 levels lower than you, you
can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning
it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding
it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate
traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your
control. If it’s intelligent and doesn’t become a minion, the
undead is helpful to you for awakening it, though it’s still
a horrid and evil creature. If it’s unintelligent and doesn’t
become a minion, you can give it one simple command. It
pursues that goal single‑mindedly, ignoring any of your
subsequent commands.
Success As critical success, except an intelligent undead that
doesn’t become your minion is only friendly to you, and
an unintelligent undead that doesn’t become your minion
leaves you alone unless you attack it. It marauds the local
area rather than following your command.
Failure You fail to create the undead.
Critical Failure You create the undead, but its soul, tortured by
your foul necromancy, is full of nothing but hatred for you.
It attempts to destroy you.

than the effect’s spell level. To perform the ritual, you must
be within 10 feet of the target, or within 10 feet of the place
where the target was imprisoned (in the case of effects that
trap the creature in an unreachable prison, like the oubliette
form of imprisonment). You must know the name of the
creature and details of its background; if the creature is not
a close associate, a failure or critical failure on a secondary
Society check reduces even a critical success on the primary
check to a failure.

Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion

Range 10 feet; Target 1 creature of a level no greater than
double the geas ritual’s level
Duration see text
You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to
either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A
geas to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, “Always
offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.” An
unconditional geas to perform a certain act doesn’t require the
target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize
the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common geas
to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid
violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster
usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the
contract is attuned correctly with the ritual’s magic. Because
the target is willing, geas can have a duration that lasts for
as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill
the geas, it becomes sickened 1, and the sickened condition
increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from
following the geas, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened
condition ends immediately when it follows the geas again; it
can’t remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only
powerful magic such as a wish spell can remove the effects of
geas from a willing target.
Critical Success The geas succeeds, and the target receives a
+1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the geas
(at the GM’s discretion).
Success The geas succeeds.
Failure The geas fails.
Critical Failure The geas fails, and you are instead affected
by the geas you were attempting to place on the target.
You are considered an unwilling target, so the geas can be
counteracted with a remove curse spell.
Heightened (5th) You can use geas on an unwilling creature;
it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target
fails this Will save, the geas lasts up to 1 week. A remove
curse spell can counteract a geas on an unwilling creature,
in addition to powerful magic such as a wish spell. A clever
unwilling creature can subvert the geas by contriving
situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it
becomes sickened (as described above).
Heightened (7th) As 5th level, but the geas lasts for up to
1 year on an unwilling creature.
Heightened (9th) As 5th level, but the geas lasts for a duration
you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.

Cast 1 day; Cost reagents to construct the magical prison
worth a total value of 800 gp × the target’s level; Secondary
Casters 6
Primary Check Arcana (legendary) or Occultism (legendary);
Secondary Checks Crafting, Society
Range 10 feet; Target 1 creature of up to 16th level
You perform a ritual to imprison a creature in one of
several forms. While some versions of this ritual offer all
of the forms, others include only a single form or only a
few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can’t be
counteracted, though it can be ended by freedom. Some forms
of imprisonment can be ended by other means. Because the
ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times,
it typically requires you to subdue the target first.
•	 Chains You bind the creature with chains, rendering it
unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other
creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains,
or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed
at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The
chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the imprisonment
ritual’s spell level, and double that many Hit Points.
Destroying the chains frees the target.
•	 Prison You render the creature completely unable to
leave a particular confined area or structure of your
choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also
prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either
directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature’s
prison is entirely destroyed by some external force,
the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural
prisons, this might be unfeasible.
•	 Slumber (sleep effect) You put the creature into an eternal
sleep. It ceases aging and doesn’t require food or drink. A
single sincere physical display of affection from a creature
who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically,
filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber. This form
of imprisonment is also enchantment magic.
•	 Temporal Stasis You send the creature into a state of
suspended animation outside the flow of time. The
creature doesn’t grow older and can’t be affected by any
effect from within the normal timestream. While casting
this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time
for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends.
Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can
be counteracted by a dispel magic or haste spell. This
form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.
•	 Object (9th level or higher) You either shrink the creature
to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial
form whose body trails away into wisps below its head.
Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or
similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn’t
require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

surroundings and can move within the container and
speak, but it can’t use any other  actions. Destroying
the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This
form of imprisonment is also transmutation magic.
•	 Oubliette (10th level only) You entomb the target
in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the
surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so
that it can’t be reached by any means. You also prevent
divinations from revealing the location where the
imprisonment occurred. Powerful magic such as wish
can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even
such magic can’t free the target from the oubliette;
only a 10th-level freedom ritual can do so.
Critical Success You imprison the target. You can either use a
form of imprisonment that usually requires 1 additional spell
level, or give any creatures trying to use a freedom ritual
to rescue the target a –2 circumstance penalty to checks
associated with that ritual.
Success You imprison the target.
Failure You fail to imprison the target.
Critical Failure You imprison yourself and the secondary casters
in the same way you intended to imprison the target.
Heightened (9th) You can use the object form of imprisonment
in addition to the other options, and you can target a creature
of up to 18th level. The base cost increases to 2,000 gp.
Heightened (10th) You can use the object and oubliette forms
of imprisonment in addition to the other options, and you can
target a creature of up to 20th level. The base cost increases
to 6,000 gp.

Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or

Range 10 feet; Target 1 creature of a level no greater than
double the inveigle ritual’s level
Duration 1 year or until dismissed
You win over the target’s mind, causing it to see you as a close
and trusted friend and look upon your every suggestion as
reasonable. The target is helpful toward you, so it will go out
of its way to help you. As with any other helpful creature,
there are limits to what you can ask of it. If you ever ask
the target to do something completely against its nature or
needlessly harmful to the target or its interests, not only does
it refuse, but it also can attempt a Will save to end the effect
early. Because of the casting time and range, it’s generally
difficult to cast this ritual unless the target is willing (perhaps
convinced the ritual will have some other effect) or restrained.
If the creature is unwilling to accept the ritual, it can attempt
a Will save to negate the effect.
Critical Success The ritual succeeds and the target takes a –4
status penalty to Will saves to end the effect.
Success The ritual succeeds.
Failure The ritual fails.
Critical Failure The ritual fails and the target instead hates
you, becoming hostile to you for the duration.
Heightened (6th) You can use inveigle on a creature up to 1
mile away throughout the casting, as long as you have a lock
of hair, a drop of blood, or some other piece of the creature’s
body, which you mix into the oils used in the cost. The base cost
increases to 100 gp. The duration is shorter than normal, based
on how large a piece of the creature’s body you use. Blood, hair,
scales, and the like cause the ritual to last 1 week, while a hand
or other substantial body part causes the ritual to last 1 month.

You attempt to learn useful legends about a particular

If the subject is present, increase the degree of success of
your primary skill check by one step. If you have only vague
information about the subject before attempting the ritual,
decrease the degree of success of your primary skill check by
one step. These modifiers cancel each other out if you have a
subject present with little to no baseline information.
Critical Success You recite legends, tales, and lore about the
subject over the course of an hour after the ritual ends. The
information is mostly coherent, emphasizing more accurate
or useful legends over those exaggerated over time.
Success You recite mysterious legends, tales, and lore about
the subject over the course of an hour after the ritual ends.
These provide useful information for further inquiry but are
generally incomplete or enigmatic. As is the nature of legends,
you are likely to learn multiple contradictory versions.
Failure You fail to learn any useful legends.
Critical Failure Your mind becomes lost in the past. You can’t
sense or respond to anything in the present for 1 week except
to perform necessities like breathing and sleeping. When you
return, however, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore
based on the knowledge of the past you were uncontrollably

is automatically a critical success. If the ritual succeeds, you
must offer the servitor payment depending on factors such
as the duration and danger of the task. Payment always costs
at least as much as a consumable item of the creature’s level,
even for a short and simple task, and it often costs as much
as a permanent magic item of the creature’s level to persuade
a creature to fight alongside you. If you use the ritual without
good reason, the result is automatically a critical failure.
Critical Success Your deity sends a servitor, and the servitor’s
payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for a
particular servitor by name, your deity is likely to send that
servitor unless the servitor is busy.
Success Your deity sends a servitor.
Failure Your deity does not send a servitor.
Critical Failure Your deity is offended and sends a sign of
displeasure or possibly even a servitor to scold or attack you,
depending on your deity’s nature. You must conduct an atone

Range interplanar; Targets 1 extraplanar creature
Duration varies
You call forth an extraplanar creature of a level no greater than
double that of the planar binding ritual’s level and attempt to
bargain with it. The secondary caster attempting the Crafting
check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar
creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that
caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects
of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the
extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate.
You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a
Crafting check, with the same result (if you’re summoning a
good outsider you trust, for example). The creature can also
attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the
warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you
and the secondary casters each take your places at specific
points at the diagram’s edge where power concentrates.
You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and
negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in
exchange for payment. A creature that doesn’t wish to negotiate
at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most
good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have
something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals
and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses
significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to
accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to
wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world

along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of
a consumable item of the creature’s level for a short and simple
task to a permanent magic item of the creature’s level or more
to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some
extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money,
such as permission to cast a geas on you to fulfill an unspecified
later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal
contract. If you can’t come to an agreement in a reasonable
length of time after you’ve made your case, the extraplanar
creature can return from whence it came at any time.
Critical Success You call the extraplanar creature and bind it
in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home,
potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by
threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.
Success You call the extraplanar creature.

Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 10th level
You attempt to call forth the target’s soul and return it to
its body. This requires the target’s body to be present and
relatively intact. The target must have died within the past
year. If Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come
or the target doesn’t wish to return, this ritual automatically
fails, but you discover this after the successful Religion check
and can end the ritual without paying the cost.
Critical Success You resurrect the target. They return to life
with full Hit Points and the same spells prepared and points
in their pools they had when they died, and still suffering
from any long-term debilitations of the old body. The target
meets an agent of their deity during the resurrection who
inspires them, granting them a +1 status bonus to attack
rolls, Perception, saving throws, and skill checks for 1
week. The target is also permanently changed in some
way by their time in the afterlife, such as gaining a slight
personality shift, a streak of white in the hair, or a strange
new birthmark.
Success As critical success, except the target returns to life
with 1 Hit Point and no spells prepared or points in any
pools, and still is affected by any long-term debilitations of
the old body. Instead of inspiring them, the character’s time
in the Boneyard has left them temporarily debilitated. The
target is clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week;
these conditions can’t be removed or reduced by any means
until the week has passed.
Failure Your attempt is unsuccessful.
Critical Failure Something goes horribly wrong—an evil spirit
possesses the body, the body transforms into a special kind
of undead, or some worse fate befalls the target.
Heightened (6th) You can resurrect a target of up to 12th level,
and the base cost is 125 gp.
Heightened (7th) You can use resurrect even with only a
small portion of the body; the ritual creates a new body on a
success or critical success. The target must have died within
the past decade. The ritual requires four secondary casters,
each of whom must be at least half the target’s level. The
target can be up to 14th level, and the base cost is 200 gp.
Heightened (8th) As 7th level, but the target can be up to 16th
level and the base cost is 300 gp.
Heightened (9th) You can use resurrect even without the
body as long as you know the target’s name and have
touched a portion of its body at any time. The target must
have died within the past century, and it doesn’t gain the
negative conditions on a success. The ritual requires eight
secondary casters, each of whom must be at least half the
target’s level. The target can be up to 18th level, and the base
cost is 600 gp.
Heightened (10th) As 9th level, except it doesn’t matter how
long ago the target died. The ritual requires 16 secondary
casters, each of whom must be at least half the target’s level.

Dwarves ascended to the surface from the underground reaches of the
Darklands in their legendary Quest for Sky, elves returned from the neighboring
planet of Castrovel via a network of portals to reclaim their lands and traditions,
and gnomes from the mysterious First World sought shelter from a now-forgotten
terror. Survivors from other ancestries who had sheltered through the terror and
destruction of Earthfall emerged during the Age of Darkness
to reclaim their ancestral lands, from scrappy goblin tribes
with a knack for surviving despite all odds against them to
industrious halflings who emerged from the ruins to found
societies of their own.
But humanity made the most astounding recovery. Less than
2,000 years after the near-extinction from Earthfall, the Age of
Destiny saw the rise of many new human empires throughout
the world. Humanity built wondrous structures, and its schools
relearned magic that had been thought lost. Among these human
nations walked a man named Aroden—an immortal survivor of
the devastation of Earthfall. Aroden had long since cultivated
a following of loyal subjects who regarded him with awe, for
immortality was but one of the wonders he’d achieved. Greatest
among these was his discovery of a shard of potent magic known
today as the Starstone, a fragment from the stars that fell during
Earthfall, which had lodged at the bottom of the Inner Sea. Contact
with this alien artifact assailed Aroden with phantasmagoric visions,
subjected him to a series of deadly martial trials, and posed
exhausting moral quandaries that challenged his limits more than
any of the arduous experiences he had yet endured. He emerged from
this test a living god, and his first divine act was to raise the Starstone
and the mass of land on which it had lain from the bottom of the sea to
form the Isle of Kortos—also known as Starstone Isle—where he then
established the city of Absalom.
In the centuries to follow, Absalom grew into one of the largest
cities in the world, and Aroden’s legacy grew alongside it. As the
millennia passed, his attentions increasingly turned away from the
concerns of the Inner Sea’s inhabitants to otherworldly matters beyond
mortal ken, but prophecy spoke of a time when he would return to
Golarion and lead humanity triumphantly into an Age of Glory. As the
time of Aroden’s return drew near, entire nations undertook monumental
preparations to welcome him back to Golarion.
But instead, Aroden died, and with him the reliability of prophecy as well.
Golarion was wracked by storms, war, and supernatural devastation as
the god’s death marked the beginning of a new age—a time of uncertainty,
but also a time of opportunity. This is the Age of Lost Omens, an age in
need of heroes like never before.
Chapter 8:
The Age of Lost Omens
Ten thousand years ago, the world of Golarion came close to ending. Earthfall, as this
extinction-level event came to be known, saw the world pummeled by a shower of
falling stars that sank continents, hollowed out new seas, and destroyed civilizations. It
took centuries for the world to recover, and centuries more for society to rebuild, but
recover it did.
