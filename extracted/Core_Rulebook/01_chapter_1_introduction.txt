Chapter 1: Introduction
Pathfinder is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) where you and a group of friends
gather to tell a tale of brave heroes and cunning villains in a world filled with terrifying
monsters and amazing treasures. More importantly, Pathfinder is a game where your
character’s choices determine how the story unfolds.

The Game Master
While the other players create and control their characters,
the Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the story
and world. The GM describes all the situations player
characters experience in an adventure, considers how the
actions of player characters affect the story, and interprets
the rules along the way.
The GM can create a new adventure—crafting a narrative,
selecting monsters, and assigning treasure on their own—
or they can instead rely on a published adventure, using
it as a basis for the session and modifying it as needed to
accommodate their individual players and the group’s style
of play. Some even run games that combine original and
published content, mixed together to form a new narrative.
Being the GM is a challenge, requiring you to adjudicate
the rules, narrate the story, and juggle other responsibilities.
But it can also be very rewarding and worth all the work
required to run a good game. If it is your first time running
a game, remember that the only thing that matters is that
everyone has a good time, and that includes you. Everything
else will come naturally with practice and patience.
Gaming Is for All
Whether you are the GM or a player, participating in a
tabletop roleplaying game includes a social contract:
everyone has gathered together to have fun telling a story.
For many, roleplaying is a way to escape the troubles of
everyday life. Be mindful of everyone at the table and what
they want out of the game, so that everyone can have fun.
When a group gathers for the first time, they should talk
about what they hope to experience at the table, as well as
any topics they want to avoid. Everyone should understand
that elements might come up that make some players feel
uncomfortable or even unwelcome, and everyone should
agree to respect those boundaries during play. That way,
everyone can enjoy the game together.
Pathfinder is a game for everyone, regardless of their age,
gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any
other identities and life experiences. It is the responsibility
of all of the players, not just the GM, to make sure the
table is fun and welcoming to all.
Tools of Play
In addition to this book, there are a few things you will
need to play Pathfinder. These supplies can be found at
your local hobby shop or online at paizo.com.
Character Sheet: Each player will need a character sheet
to create their character and to record what happens to
that character during play. You can find a character sheet
in the back of this book and online as a free pdf.
Dice: The players and GM will need at least one set of
polyhedral dice, although most participants bring their
own. Six-sided dice are quite common, but all the dice in
the set can be found at hobby game stores or online. See
the Dice sidebar on page 7 for more on the different kinds
of dice and how they are discussed in the text.
Adventure: Every table needs an adventure to play,
whether it’s designed by the GM or found in a published
resource. You can find a variety of exciting adventures
and even entire Adventure Path campaigns at paizo.com.
Bestiary: From terrifying dragons to mischievous
gremlins, monsters are a common threat that the PCs
might face, and each type has its own statistics and
abilities. These can be found in the Pathfinder Bestiary, an
absolutely invaluable book for GMs. Monster statistics
can also be found online for free at paizo.com/prd.
Maps and Miniatures: The chaos of combat can be
difficult to imagine, so many groups use maps to represent
the battlefield. These maps are marked with a 1-inch grid,
and each square represents 5 feet in the game. Miniatures
and illustrated tokens called pawns are used to represent
the characters and the adversaries they face.
Additional Accessories: There are a number of
additional accessories you can add to your game to
enhance the experience, including tools that help you
track turns in combat, decks of cards for referencing
common rules, digital character-creation tools, and even
background music and sound-effect sets.
Basics of Play
Before creating your first character or adventure, you
should understand a number of basic concepts used in
the game. New concepts are presented in bold to make
them easy to find, but this chapter is only an introduction
to the basics of play. The complete game rules are defined
in later chapters, and the Glossary and Index in the back
of this book will help you find specific rules you need.
Defining Characters
In Pathfinder, the players take on the role of player
characters (PCs), while the Game Master portrays
nonplayer characters (NPCs) and monsters. While PCs
and NPCs are both important to the story, they serve very
different purposes in the game. PCs are the protagonists—
the narrative is about them—while NPCs and monsters
are allies, contacts, adversaries, and villains. That said,
PCs, NPCs, and monsters share several characteristics.
Level is one of the most important statistics of the game,
as it conveys the approximate power and capabilities of
every individual creature. PCs range in level from 1st, at
the start of the character’s adventuring career, to 20th,
the very height of power. As the characters overcome
challenges, defeat foes, and complete adventures, they
accumulate Experience Points (XP). Every time a character
amasses 1,000 XP, they go up a level, gaining new abilities
so they can take on even greater challenges. A 1st-level PC
might face off against a giant rat or a group of bandits, but
at 20th level, that same character might be able to bring
ruin to an entire city with a single spell.
In addition to level, characters are defined by ability
scores, which measure a character’s raw potential and are

THE WORLD AS A
PARTICIPANT
Aside from characters and
monsters, the world of
Pathfinder itself can be a
force at the table and in
the narrative. While the
presence of the larger world
can sometimes be an obvious
hazard, such as when a
powerful storm lashes the
countryside, the world can
also act in subtle, small ways.
Traps and treasures are just
as important in many tales
as cunning beasts. To help
you understand these game
elements, many of them use
the same characteristics as
characters and monsters. For
example, most environmental
hazards have a level, which
indicates how dangerous they
are, and the level of a magic
item gives you a sense of its
overall power and impact on
a story.
used to calculate most of their other statistics. There are six ability scores in the game.
Strength represents a character’s physical might, while Dexterity represents agility
and the ability to avoid danger. Constitution indicates a character’s overall health and
well-being. Intelligence represents raw knowledge and problem-solving ability, while
Wisdom measures a character’s insight and the ability to evaluate a situation. Finally,
Charisma indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality. Ability scores for
ordinary folk range from as low as 3 to as high as 18, with 10 representing average
human capabilities. High-level characters can have ability scores that range much
higher than 18.
An ability score that’s above the average increases your chance of success at tasks
related to the ability score, while those below the average decrease your chance. This
adjustment is called an ability modifier.
Your player character is also defined by some key choices you make. The first choice
is a PC’s ancestry, representing the character’s parents and heritage, such as human,
elf, or goblin. Next up is the PC’s background, which describes their upbringing, from
lowly street urchin to wealthy noble. Finally, and most importantly, a PC’s class defines
the majority of their aptitudes and abilities, like a wizard’s command of powerful
arcane spells or a druid’s power to transform into a fearsome beast!
In addition to these key choices, player characters also have a number of feats—
individual abilities selected during character creation and as the character increases
in level. Every feat has a type to denote where its explanation can be found (for
example, elf feats can be found in the elf ancestry) and its theme (wizard feats, for
example, grant abilities that deal with spells). Finally, characters have skills that
measure their ability to hide, swim, bargain, and perform other common tasks.
Creating a Narrative
Characters and their choices create the story of Pathfinder, but how they interact
with each other and the world around them is governed by rules. So, while you might
decide that your character undertakes an epic journey to overcome terrifying foes
and make the world a safer place, your character’s chance of success is determined
by their abilities, the choices you make, and the roll of the dice.
The GM determines the premise and background of most adventures, although
character histories and personalities certainly play a part. Once a game
session begins, the players take turns describing what their
characters attempt to do, while the GM determines
the outcome, with the table working together
toward a specific goal. The GM also describes
the environment, other characters’ actions,
and events. For example, the GM might
announce that the characters’ hometown
is under attack by marauding trolls. The
characters might track the trolls to a nearby
swamp—only to discover that the trolls were driven
from their swamp by a fearsome dragon! The
PCs then have the choice of taking on an
entire tribe of trolls, the dragon, or
both. Whatever they decide, their
success depends on their choices and
the die rolls they make during play.
A single narrative—including the
setup, plot, and conclusion—is called
an adventure. A series of adventures
creates an even larger narrative, called
a campaign. An adventure might take
several sessions to complete, whereas a
campaign might take months or even years!

Playing the Game
In a Pathfinder game, three modes of play determine the
pacing of each scene in the story. Most of your character’s
time is spent in exploration, uncovering mysteries, solving
problems, and interacting with other characters. The
Age of Lost Omens abounds with danger, however, and
characters often find themselves in an encounter, fighting
savage beasts and terrifying monsters. Finally, time moves
quickly when the characters enjoy downtime, a respite
from the world’s troubles and a chance to rest and train
for future expeditions. Throughout an adventure, game
play moves between these three modes many times, as
needed for the story. The more you play the game, the
more you’ll see that each mode has its own play style, but
moving from mode to mode has few hard boundaries.
During the game, your character will face situations
where the outcome is uncertain. A character might need
to climb a sheer cliff, track down a wounded chimera, or
sneak past a sleeping dragon, all of which are dangerous
tasks with a price for failure. In such cases, the acting
character (or characters) will be asked to attempt a check
to determine whether or not they succeed. A check is
usually made by rolling a single 20-sided die (a d20) and
adding a number based on the relevant ability. In such
cases, rolling high is always good.
Once a check is rolled, the GM compares the result to a
target number called the difficulty class (DC) to determine
the outcome. If the result of the check is equal to or greater
than the DC, the check is successful. If it is less, the check is
a failure. Beating the DC by 10 or more is referred to as a
critical success, which usually grants an especially positive
outcome. Similarly, failing the check by 10 or more is a
critical failure (sometimes called a fumble). This sometimes
results in additional negative effects. You also often score a
critical success by rolling a 20 on the die when attempting
a check (before adding anything). Likewise, rolling a 1 on
the die when attempting a check often results in a critical
failure. Note that not all checks have a special effect on a
critical success or critical failure and such results should
be treated just like an ordinary success or failure instead.
For example, in pursuit of the wounded chimera, your
character might find the path blocked by a fast-moving
river. You decide to swim across, but the GM declares this
a dangerous task and asks you to roll an Athletics skill
check (since swimming is covered by the Athletics skill). On
your character sheet, you see that your character has a +8
modifier for such checks. Rolling the d20, you get an 18, for
a total of 26. The GM compares this to the DC (which was
16) and finds that you got a critical success (since the result
exceeded the DC by 10). Your character swims quickly
across the river and continues the pursuit, drenched but
unharmed. Had you gotten a result less than 26 but equal
to or greater than 16, your character would have made it
halfway across the river. Had your result been less than 16,
your character might have been swept downriver or, worse,
been pulled under the current and begun to drown!
Checks like this are the heart of the game and are rolled
all the time, in every mode of play, to determine the outcome
of tasks. While the roll of the die is critical, the statistic you
add to the roll (called a modifier) often makes the difference
between success and failure. Every character is made up
of many such statistics governing what the character is
good at, each consisting of a relevant ability modifier plus
a proficiency bonus, and sometimes modified further by
other factors, such as bonuses or penalties from gear, spells,
feats, magic items, and other special circumstances.
Proficiency is a simple way of assessing your character’s
general level of training and aptitude for a given task. It
is broken into five different ranks: untrained, trained,
expert, master, and legendary. Each rank grants a different
proficiency bonus. If you’re untrained at a statistic, your
proficiency bonus is +0—you must rely solely on the raw
potential of your ability modifier. If your proficiency rank
for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your
bonus equals your character’s level plus another number
based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). Proficiency
ranks are part of almost every statistic in the game.
Exploration
Most of the time, your character will explore the world,
interact with characters, travel from place to place, and
overcome challenges. This is called exploration. Game play
is relatively free-form during exploration, with players
responding to the narrative whenever they have an idea of
what to do next. Leaving town via horseback, following the
trail of a marauding orc tribe, avoiding the tribe’s scouts, and
convincing a local hunter to help in an upcoming fight are
all examples of things that might occur during exploration.
Throughout this mode of play, the GM asks the players
what their characters are doing as they explore. This is
important in case a conflict arises. If combat breaks out,
the tasks the PCs undertook while exploring might give
them an edge or otherwise inform how the combat begins.
Encounters
In the course of your adventures, there will be times when
a simple skill check is not enough to resolve a challenge—
when fearsome monsters stand in your character’s way
and the only choice is to do battle. In Pathfinder, this is
called an encounter. Encounters usually involve combat,
but they can also be used in situations where timing is
critical, such as during a chase or when dodging hazards.
While exploration is handled in a free-form manner,
encounters are more structured. The players and GM roll
initiative to determine who acts in what order. The encounter
occurs over a number of rounds, each of which is equal to
about 6 seconds of time in the world of the game. During
a round, each participant takes a turn. When it’s your
turn to act, you can use up to three actions. Most simple
things, such as drawing a weapon, moving a short distance,
opening a door, or swinging a sword, use a single action to
perform. There are also activities that use more than a single
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

================================================================================

action to perform; these are often special abilities from your
character’s class and feats. One common activity in the game
is casting a spell, which usually uses two actions.
Free actions, such as dropping an object, don’t count
toward the three actions you can take on your turn. Finally,
each character can use up to one reaction during a round.
This special type of action can be used even when it’s not
your turn, but only in response to certain events, and only
if you have an ability that allows it. Rogues, for example,
can select a feat that lets them use their reaction to dodge
an incoming attack.
Attacking another creature is one of the most common
actions in combat, and is done by using the Strike action.
This requires an attack roll—a kind of check made against
the Armor Class (AC) of the creature you’re attacking.
Strikes can be made using weapons, spells, or even parts
of a creature’s body, like a fist, claw, or tail. You add a
modifier to this roll based on your proficiency rank with
the type of attack you’re using, your ability scores, and
any other bonuses or penalties based on the situation.
The target’s AC is calculated using their proficiency rank
in the armor they’re wearing and their Dexterity modifier.
An attack deals damage if it hits, and rolling a critical
success results in the attack dealing double damage!
You can use more than one Strike action on your turn,
but each additional attack after the first becomes less
accurate. This is reflected by a multiple attack penalty
that starts at –5 on the second attack, but increases to –10
on the third. There are many ways to reduce this penalty,
and it resets at the end of your turn.
If your character finds themself the target of a magical
lightning bolt or the freezing breath of a fearsome white
dragon, you will be called on to attempt a saving throw,
representing your character’s ability to avoid danger or
otherwise withstand an assault to their mind or body. A
saving throw is a check attempted against the DC of the
spell or special ability targeting your character. There are
three types of saving throws, and a character’s proficiency
in each says a great deal about what they can endure. A
Fortitude saving throw is used when your character’s health
or vitality is under attack, such as from poison or disease.
A Reflex saving throw is called for when your character
must dodge away from danger, usually something that
affects a large area, such as the scorching blast of a fireball
spell. Finally, a Will saving throw is often your defense
against spells and effects that target your character’s mind,
such as a charm or confusion spell. For all saving throws,
a success lessens the harmful effect, and scoring a critical
success usually means your character escapes unscathed.
Attacks, spells, hazards, and special abilities frequently
either deal damage to a character or impose one or more
conditions—and sometimes both. Damage is subtracted
from a creature’s Hit Points (HP)—a measure of health—
and when a creature is reduced to 0 HP, it falls unconscious
and may die! A combat encounter typically lasts until one
side has been defeated, and while this can mean retreat or

surrender, it most often happens because one side is dead or
dying. Conditions can hinder a creature for a time, limiting
the actions they can use and applying penalties to future
checks. Some conditions are even permanent, requiring a
character to seek out powerful magic to undo their effects.

adventuring. Instead, they recover from wounds, plan
future conquests, or pursue a trade. In Pathfinder, this is
called downtime, and it allows time to pass quickly while
characters work toward long-term tasks or objectives.
Most characters can practice a trade in downtime,
earning a few coins, but those with the right skills can
instead spend time crafting, creating new gear or even
magic items. Characters can also use downtime to retrain,
replacing one character choice with another to reflect their
evolving priorities. They might also research a problem,
learn new spells, or even run a business or kingdom!
Key Terms
There are a number of important terms that you’ll need
to know as you create your first character or adventure.
Some of the most important terms mentioned on previous
pages are also included here for reference.
Ability Score
Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These
scores represent a creature’s raw potential and basic
attributes. The higher the score, the greater the creature’s
potential in that ability. Ability scores are described in full
later in this chapter.
Alignment
Alignment represents a creature’s fundamental moral and
ethical attitude.
Ancestry
An ancestry is the broad family of people that a character
belongs to. Ancestry determines a character’s starting Hit
Points, languages, senses, and Speed, and it grants access
to ancestry feats. Ancestries can be found in Chapter 2.
Armor Class (AC)
All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score
represents how hard it is to hit and damage a creature. It
serves as the Difficulty Class for hitting a creature with
an attack.
Attack
When a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes
a Strike or uses some other attack action. Most attacks
are Strikes made with a weapon, but a character might
Strike with their fist, grapple or shove with their hands,
or attack with a spell.
Background
A background represents what a character experienced
before they took up the life of an adventurer. Each
background grants a feat and training in one or more
skills. You can read more about backgrounds in Chapter 2.
Bonuses and Penalties
Bonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain
statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties.
If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you
use only the highest bonus. Likewise, you use only the
worst penalty of each type.
Class
A class represents the adventuring profession chosen by
a character. A character’s class determines most of their
proficiencies, grants the character Hit Points each time
they gain a new level, and gives access to a set of class
feats. Classes appear in Chapter 3.
Condition
An ongoing effect that changes how a character can act, or
that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition. The
rules for the basic conditions used in the game can be found
in the Conditions Appendix at the back of this book.
Currency
The most common currencies in the game are gold pieces
(gp) and silver pieces (sp). One gp is worth 10 sp. In
addition, 1 sp is worth 10 copper pieces (cp), and 10 gp
are worth 1 platinum piece (pp). Characters begin play
with 15 gp (or 150 sp) to spend on equipment.
Feat
A feat is an ability you can select for your character due to
their ancestry, background, class, general training, or skill
training. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions.
Game Master (GM)
The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules
and narrates the various elements of the Pathfinder story
and world that the other players explore.
Golarion
Pathfinder is set on the planet Golarion during the Age of
Lost Omens. It is an ancient world with a rich diversity
of people and cultures, exciting locations to explore, and
deadly villains. More information on the Age of Lost
Omens, the world of Golarion, and its deities can be
found in Chapter 8.
Hit Points (HP)
Hit Points represent the amount of punishment a creature
can take before it falls unconscious and begins dying.
Damage decreases Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis, while
healing restores Hit Points at the same rate.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 14
================================================================================

Initiative
At the start of an encounter, all creatures involved roll for
initiative to determine the order in which they act. The
higher the result of its roll, the earlier a creature gets to act.
Initiative and combat are described in Chapter 9.
Level
A level is a number that measures something’s overall
power. Player characters have a level, ranging from 1st
to 20th, representing their level of experience. Monsters,
NPCs, hazards, diseases, and poisons have levels ranging
from –1 to 30 that measure the danger they pose. An item’s
level, usually within the range of 0 to 20 but sometimes
higher, indicates its power and suitability as treasure.
Spells have levels ranging from 1st to 10th, which
measure their power; characters and monsters can usually
cast only a certain number of spells of any given level.
Nonplayer Character (NPC)
A nonplayer character, controlled by the GM, interacts
with players and helps advance the story.
Perception
Perception measures your character’s ability to notice
hidden objects or unusual situations, and it usually
determines how quickly the character springs into action
in combat. It is described in full in Chapter 9.
Player Character (PC)
This is a character created and controlled by a player.
Proficiency
Proficiency is a system that measures a character’s aptitude
at a specific task or quality, and it has five ranks: untrained,
trained, expert, master, and legendary. Proficiency gives
you a bonus that’s added when determining the following
modifiers and statistics: AC, attack rolls, Perception, saving
throws, skills, and the effectiveness of spells. If you’re
untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0. If you’re trained,
expert, master, or legendary, your proficiency bonus equals
your level plus 2, 4, 6, or 8, respectively.
Rarity
Some elements of the game have a rarity to denote how
often they’re encountered in the game world. Rarity
primarily applies to equipment and magic items, but
spells, feats, and other rules elements also have a rarity.
If no rarity appears in the traits of an item, spell, or other
game element, it is of common rarity. Uncommon items are
available only to those who have special training, grew up
in a certain culture, or come from a particular part of the
world. Rare items are almost impossible to find and are
usually given out only by the GM, while unique ones are
literally one-of-a-kind in the game. The GM might alter the
way rarity works or change the rarity of individual items
to suit the story they want to tell.
Roleplaying
Describing a character’s actions, often while acting from
the perspective of the character, is called roleplaying. When
a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of
a character, they are “in character.”
Round
A round is a period of time during an encounter in which
all participants get a chance to act. A round represents
approximately 6 seconds in game time.
Saving Throw (Save)
When a creature is subject to a dangerous effect that must
be avoided, it attempts a saving throw to mitigate the effect.
You attempt a saving throw automatically—you don’t
have to use an action or a reaction. Unlike for most checks,
the character who isn’t acting rolls the d20 for a saving
throw, and the creature who is acting provides the DC.
There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (to
resist diseases, poisons, and physical effects), Reflex (to
evade effects a character could quickly dodge), and Will
(to resist effects that target the mind and personality).
Skill
A skill represents a creature’s ability to perform certain
tasks that require instruction or practice. Skills are fully
described in Chapter 4. Each skill includes ways anyone
can use that skill even if untrained, as well as uses that
require a character to be trained in the skill.
Speed
Speed is the distance a character can move using a single
action, measured in feet.
Spell
Spells are magical effects created by performing mystical
incantations and gestures known only to those with special
training or inborn abilities. Casting a spell is an activity
that usually uses two actions. Each spell specifies what it
targets, the actions needed to cast it, its effects, and how
it can be resisted. If a class grants spells, the basics of that
ability are provided in the class description in Chapter 3,
while the spells themselves are detailed in Chapter 7.
Trait
A trait is a keyword that conveys additional information
about a rules element, such as a school of magic or rarity.
Often, a trait indicates how other rules interact with an
ability, creature, item, or another rules element that has
that trait. All the traits used in this book appear in the
Glossary and Index beginning on page 628.
Turn
During the course of a round, each creature takes a single
turn according to initiative. A creature can typically use
up to three actions during its turn.

Example of Play
The following example is presented to give you a better idea
of how the game of Pathfinder is played. In this adventure,
Erik is the GM. Lyz is playing Valeros, a daring human
fighter, James is playing Merisiel, a deadly elven rogue, and
Judy is taking on the role of Kyra, a fiery human cleric of
Sarenrae. The group has just defeated a horde of undead
and is making its way into an ancient mausoleum.
Erik:
The entrance to the crypt stands before you,
a set of crumbling stairs leading down into
darkness. A terrible smell issues forth from the
doorway—the stench of old, rotted flesh.
Lyz:
I’m not afraid of a foul stink! I draw my sword
and ready my shield.
Judy:
The light of Sarenrae will guide us. I cast my
light spell on my religious symbol.
Erik:
All right, a glowing radiance spills forth,
illuminating the stairs. They appear to go
down only about 10 feet before opening up
into a chamber. Puddles of stagnant water fill
the cracks between uneven stone tiles.
James:
I should go first to make sure it’s safe. I’m going
to draw my rapier and carefully go down the
stairs, looking for traps as I go.
Erik:
Sure, but looking for traps is a secret check, so I’ll
roll for you. What’s your Perception modifier?
James:
I have a +5.
Erik rolls a d20 behind his GM screen, hidden from the
players’ view, and gets a 17 on the die for a total of 22,
more than enough to find the trip wire on the third step.
Erik:
Your caution pays off! You spot a thin wire
located at ankle height just above the third stair.
James:
I point it out to the others and head down.
Lyz:
I follow right behind Merisiel, avoiding the wire
but otherwise keeping an eye out for danger.
Judy:
Me too.
Erik:
Okay! You make it down the stairs to find
yourselves in a crypt. Ancient wood coffins are
arranged around the room, covered in cobwebs
and dust. Directly ahead, on a raised dais, is
a stone casket adorned with wicked-looking
symbols. You can tell that it was once wrapped
in iron chains, but now twisted links are scattered
around the room, along with chunks of what
must have been the casket’s lid. From the damage,
it looks like it was shattered from within!
Judy:
Sarenrae protect us. I draw my blade and
advance—I want a better look at those symbols.
Lyz:
I’ll keep pace with her. I don’t like the look of this.
James:
I think I’ll stay back here and hide behind one
of the coffins.
Erik:
Merisiel takes cover while the two of you
advance. As you draw near, the stench of rot
grows stronger until it’s almost overpowering.
Suddenly you see the source of the horrid odor.
Rising up out of the casket is a nightmarish
dead thing. It might have once been a human,
but it’s hard to tell from its withered body. Its
flesh is the color of a new bruise, pulled so
tight across its bones that it has split in places.
It’s hairless, with pointed ears, but worst of all,
its mouth is lined with tiny, sharp teeth and its
tongue is entirely too long.
Lyz:
So, not a friend?
Erik:
Most certainly not. It looks poised to leap at
you and attack. Roll for initiative! Valeros and
Kyra need to roll Perception, while Merisiel
should roll Stealth.
Everyone rolls for their initiative. Lyz rolls a 2 for Valeros,
getting a total of 8. Judy rolls better for Kyra, getting
a total of 14. James uses Stealth for Initiative, because
Merisiel was hiding at the start of the fight, and rolls a
17 for a total of 25! Erik rolls for the undead creature,
getting a 12. Erik records all these totals, putting the
characters in order from highest to lowest.
Erik:
Looks like Merisiel gets to act first. Whatever
that thing is, you’re pretty sure it doesn’t know
you are there.
James:
Awesome! For my first action, I want to draw a
dagger. For my second, I want to move closer.
Erik:
You can get to within 15 feet of it with one
Stride action.
James:
Perfect. For my final action, I’m going to throw
my dagger at it!
James rolls a 13 and adds 8, due to Merisiel’s skill at
thrown daggers, for a total of 21, but the range means
he takes a –2 penalty for a result of 19. Erik consults his
notes to learn that the monster has an AC of 18.
Erik:
That’s a hit! Go ahead and roll damage.
James:
Okay, and I get to add extra damage due to
sneak attack.
Rogues have the ability to deal extra damage to foes that
haven’t acted yet in an encounter. This extra damage also
applies to attacks against enemies that are distracted. James
rolls 1d4 for the dagger and 1d6 for the sneak attack, and
he adds 4 for Merisiel’s Dexterity, getting a total of 9.
Erik:
It hisses as the blade sinks into its shoulder. That
looks like it hurt, but the undead thing doesn’t
appear to be slowing down. James, that was all
three of your actions. Next up is Kyra!
Judy:
I think this is undead. What do I know about it?
Erik:
You use an action to recall your training about
the living dead. Give me a Religion skill check.

Judy rolls a 16, adding Kyra’s +8 with Religion to get a
total of 24.
Erik:
At first, you thought this thing might be a
ghoul, which is a type of undead that feasts
on the flesh of the dead, but the terrible smell
reveals the truth. This thing is a ghast, a more
powerful type of ghoul. You are pretty sure
that its stench can make you sick and that its
claws can paralyze you with a touch.
Judy:
This is bad. I am going to spend my last two
actions to cast bless. It gives anyone next to me
a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
Casting this spell is an activity that requires two actions
to complete, and it has two components. The complex
gestures needed to invoke the spell are the somatic
component, and Kyra’s prayers to her deity are the
verbal component.
Erik:
Okay! The ghast leaps from the casket straight
toward Merisiel. The stench of its rotting
body is absolutely horrific up close. Attempt a
Fortitude save!
James rolls an 8, for a total of 14.
Erik:
Not quite enough—you gain the sickened 1
condition, which is going to give you a –1
penalty to most of your d20 rolls. Next, it
lunges at you, trying to bite you!
James:
Oh no! I use my reaction to nimbly dodge out
of the way.
Erik rolls an attack roll for the ghast, getting an 9 on the
die. Looking at the monster’s statistics, he adds 11 for a
total of 20. Merisiel’s AC is normally 19, but the Nimble
Dodge feat lets her use her reaction to increase her AC by 2
against a single attack. In this case, it turns the ghast’s attack
into a miss.
Erik:
Does a 20 hit you?
James:
Nope, just missed!
Erik:
You twist away from the ghast as its tongue
leaves a slimy film on your armor. With its final
action, the undead menace lashes out at you
with its claw.
Erik rolls a second attack with the ghast, this time with its
claw. Normally this attack would take a –5 multiple attack
penalty, but since the claw has the agile trait, the penalty is
only –4. He rolls a 19 on the die, adds 11 for the ghoul’s
attack modifier and subtracts 4, for a total of 26.
Erik:
You may have dodged the ghast’s bite, but the
thing’s bony claw rakes across your face!
Erik knows this is a hit and rolls the ghast’s claw damage,
getting a total of 8.
Erik:
Take 8 points of damage, and I need you to
attempt a Fortitude saving throw as a numbing
sensation spreads from the wound.
James rolls a Fortitude saving throw. He gets a 4 on the
die, and after adding his bonus and the penalty from the
sickened condition, it comes out to only a 9.
James:
This isn’t my day. I don’t suppose a 9 is good
enough?
Erik:
I am afraid not. You are paralyzed!
Erik notes that Merisiel is paralyzed, making her unable
to act, but she will get a new saving throw at the end of
each of her turns to shake off the effect.
Erik:
A dry, creaking laugh escapes the ghast’s curled
lips, but that’s the end of its turn. Valeros, you
are the last one to act this round.
Lyz:
About time, too! I raise my shield and use my
final two actions to make a Sudden Charge!
Sudden Charge is a fighter feat that lets Valeros move up
to twice his Speed and attack at the end of his movement,
all for only two actions.
Erik:
As you draw near, the smell is horrific. Attempt
a Fortitude save.
After rolling, Lyz gets a 19 on the Fortitude save.
Erik:
You fight off the nausea from this thing’s
stench. Make your attack roll.
Lyz rolls the die and it comes up a 20.
Lyz:
I got a 20! That must be a critical success!
Erik:
Your blade hits the vile creature right in the
neck, dealing double damage!
Lyz rolls a 5 on her d8, then adds 4 because of Valeros’s
Strength modifier. Because it is a critical success, she then
doubles the total.
Lyz:
A mighty 18 damage! That surely had to kill it!
Erik:
I’m afraid not. Black ichor runs from the deep
wound on its neck, but it only turns to look at
you. You can see burning hatred in its eyes!
Lyz:
Uh-oh.
That is the end of the first round of combat. The second
round begins immediately after this, using the same
initiative order as before. The fight is far from over…

Using This Book
While this chapter is here to teach you the basics of
Pathfinder, the rest of this rulebook serves as a reference
manual during play, and it is organized to make finding
the rule you need as easy as possible. Rules are grouped
together in chapters, with the early chapters focusing on
character creation. The last two chapters contain rules
for GMs, with advice on how to run a game of Pathfinder
and a rich array of treasure. The following is a summary
of what you can expect to find in each chapter.
Chapter 1: Introduction
This introduction is designed to help you understand the
basics of Pathfinder. This chapter also includes the rules
for building and leveling up a character. The chapter ends
with an example of building a 1st-level character.
Chapter 2: Ancestries & Backgrounds
The rules for the most common ancestries in the Age of
Lost Omens are in this chapter, including their ancestry
feat options. Backgrounds are at the end of this chapter,
along with a section about languages, as these are most
often influenced by your choice of ancestry.
Chapter 3: Classes
This chapter contains the rules for all 12 classes. Each
class entry includes guidelines on playing the class, rules
for building and advancing a character of that class,
sample builds, and all of the class feats available to
members of that class. This chapter also includes rules
for animal companions and familiars, which can be
acquired by members of several different classes. At the
end of this chapter are the rules for archetypes—special
options available to characters as they increase in level.
These rules allow a character to dabble in the abilities of
another class or concept.
Chapter 4: Skills
The rules for using skills are presented in this chapter,
and they detail what a character can do with a given
skill, based on that character’s proficiency rank.
Ancestry, background, and class can define some of
a character’s skill proficiencies, and each character
can also select a few additional skills to reflect their
personality and training.
Chapter 5: Feats
As a character advances in level, they gain additional
feats to represent their growing abilities. General feats
and skill feats (which are a subset of general feats) are
presented in this chapter.
Chapter 6: Equipment
Armor, weapons, and other gear can all be found in this
chapter, along with the price for services, cost of living,
and animals (such as horses, dogs, and pack animals).
Chapter 7: Spells
This chapter starts with rules for casting spells,
determining their effects, and getting rid of foes’ spells
(called counteracting). After that, the spell lists for
each spellcasting tradition are included, making it easy
to quickly find spells by their level. Next are rules for
every spell, presented in alphabetical order. Following
the spell descriptions are all of the focus spells—special
spells granted by specific class abilities and feats. While
most spells appear on multiple spell lists, focus spells
are granted only to members of a specific class and are
grouped together by class for ease of reference. Finally, at
the end of the chapter are rules for rituals, complicated
and risky spells that any character can cast.
