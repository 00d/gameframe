Treasure comes in all sorts of forms, from humble copper
coins to incredibly powerful and valuable magic items.
The GM controls the flow of items in the game as the PCs
win them through adventures, find them for purchase, or
acquire the formulas to make the items themselves.
Items can support characters by granting bonuses to their
statistics, allowing them to cast more spells, and creating
all sorts of effects that can’t be achieved in any other way.
Magic items come in many varieties, from enchanted swords
that can harm even incorporeal undead to containers that
can store a king’s ransom within a tiny space; many are
permanent items that can be used repeatedly. Alchemical
items, by contrast, are not intrinsically magical and are
often consumed when used. Both have a variety of uses,
from curing the sick to lighting foes on fire. Some treasures
are neither magical nor alchemical, but are instead crafted
from precious materials or using specialized expertise.
This chapter provides rules for using different kinds
of items encountered in the game. Rules for distributing
treasure and creating treasure hoards can be found on
page 508 of Chapter 10: Game Mastering.
•	 Using Items, beginning below, describes how to
activate items and explains the statistics for items.
•	 Table 11–1: Treasure by Level, beginning on page
536, lists the options for treasures, arranged by
level, category, and Price.
•	 The catalog of items, which begins on page 543,
presents descriptions and rules for all sorts of
different treasures that can appear in the game,
sorted by category (page 533 has a list of key
categories and subcategories). This also includes
a section on precious materials found in the game
world, which can give items unusual properties.
Using Items
This section presents the rules for how characters use
alchemical items, magic items, and other special items
during play.
The myriad types of items give their powerful boons in
different ways. Some function automatically, while others
need to be activated. While you need only swing a flaming
greataxe to scorch foes, you need to invest a diadem of
intellect for it to work, imbibe an elixir of life to heal
yourself, activate slippers of spider climbing to walk up
a wall, activate your mail of luck to protect yourself, and
Cast a Spell using a magical scroll.
Chapter 11: Crafting & Treasure
Characters acquire treasure from the glittering hoards of their foes, as rewards for defending
the innocent, and as favors from the grand personalities they treat with. As they progress
through their adventures and improve their station in the world, characters collect ever
more fabulous items from enchanted armor and weapons to spell-infused staves.
Constant Abilities
Some magic items have abilities that always function.
You don’t have to use any actions to do anything special
(beyond wearing and investing a worn item or wielding
a held item) to make these abilities work. For example,
an everburning torch always sheds light, and a flaming
weapon deals fire damage every time it deals damage.
Investing Magic Items
Certain magic items convey their magical benefits only
when worn and invested using the Invest an Item activity,
tying them to your inner potential. These items have the
invested trait. Many invested items have constant abilities
that function all the time or that always trigger when you
use the item—but only when they’re invested. If you don’t
have an item invested, these abilities don’t work. If an
invested item can be activated, you must have invested
the item to activate it.
You can benefit from no more than 10 invested magic
items each day. Because this limit is fairly high, and because
it matters only for worn items, you probably won’t need
to worry about reaching the limit until higher levels, when
you’ve acquired many useful magic items to wear.
You can still gain the mundane benefits of an item if you
don’t invest it. A suit of +1 resilient armor still gives you
its item bonus to AC when not invested, but it doesn’t give
its magical bonus to saving throws, and winged boots still
protect your feet even though you can’t activate them to
fly. Entirely non-magical items don’t need to be invested.
INVEST AN ITEM
You invest your energy in an item with the invested trait as
you don it. This process requires 1 or more Interact actions,
usually taking the same amount of time it takes to don the item.
Once you’ve Invested the Item, you benefit from its constant
magical abilities as long as you meet its other requirements
(for most invested items, the only other requirement is that
you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you
remove the item.
You can invest no more than 10 items per day. If you remove
an invested item, it loses its investiture. The item still counts
against your daily limit after it loses its investiture. You reset
the limit during your daily preparations, at which point you
Invest your Items anew. If you’re still wearing items you had
invested the previous day, you can typically keep them invested
on the new day, but they still count against your limit.

Activating Items
Some items produce their effects only when used properly
in the moment. Others always offer the same benefits as
their mundane counterparts when worn, but have magical
abilities you can gain by further spending actions. Either
case requires you to use the Activate an Item activity.
Activating an Item works much like Casting a Spell, in that
the activity takes a variable number of actions and can have
different components depending on how you Activate the
Item. This information appears in the item’s Activate entry.
If an item is used up when activated, as is the case for
consumable items, its Activate entry appears toward the
top of the stat block. For permanent items with activated
abilities, the Activate entry is a paragraph in the description.
Activations are not necessarily magical—for instance,
drinking an alchemical elixir isn’t usually a magical effect.
ACTIVATE AN ITEM
Requirement You can Activate an Item with the invested
trait only if it’s invested by you. If the item requires you to
Interact with it, you must be wielding it (if it’s a held item)
or touching it with a free hand (if it’s another type of item).
You call forth the effect of an item by properly activating
it. This is a special activity that takes a variable number of
actions, as listed in the item’s stat block.
Some items can be activated as a reaction or free action. In
this case, you Activate the Item as a reaction or free action (as
appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases are noted
in the item’s Activate entry in its stat block—for example,
“Activate [reaction] command.”
Long Activation Times Some items take minutes or hours
to activate. The Activate an Item activity for these items
includes a mix of the listed activation components, but it’s not
necessary to break down which one you’re providing at a given
time. You can’t use other actions or reactions while activating
such an item, though at the GM’s discretion, you might be able
to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take
a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and
you can’t activate them in an encounter. If combat breaks out
while you’re activating one, your activation is disrupted (see
the Disrupting Activations sidebar).
Activation Components Each activation entry lists any
components involved in the activation after the action icons
or text, such as “[one-action] command.” The activation components,
DISRUPTING ACTIVATIONS
Some abilities and effects can disrupt the process of
Activating an Item. If something disrupts your item
activation, you fail to Activate the Item and lose the
actions you committed. If the item can be activated only
a certain number of times per day, the failed activation
still counts against that limit. If an item requires you to
spend actions to Sustain an Activation and one of those
actions is disrupted, the item’s effect ends.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

described below, add traits (listed in parentheses) and
requirements to the activation. If you can’t provide the
components, you fail to Activate the Item.
•	 Command (auditory, concentrate)
•	 Envision (concentrate)
•	 Interact (manipulate)
•	 Cast a Spell
Activation Components
An item’s activate entry lists the components required to
activate its abilities. Each component adds certain traits
to the Activate an Item activity, and some components
have special requirements. The components that appear
in this book are listed below.
Command
This component is a specific utterance you must make
in a loud and strong voice. Activate an Item gains the
auditory and concentrate traits. You must be able to speak
to provide this component.
Envision
This component is a specific image or phenomenon you
need to imagine. Activate an Item gains the concentrate trait.
Interact
This component works like the Interact basic action.
Activate an Item gains the manipulate trait and requires
you to use your hands, just like with any Interact action.
Cast a Spell
If an item lists “Cast a Spell” after “Activate,” the activation
requires you to use the Cast a Spell activity (described on
page 302) to Activate the Item. This happens when the
item replicates a spell. You must have a spellcasting class
feature to Activate an Item with this activation component.
If the item can be used for a specific spell, the action icon
for that spell is provided. If it’s an item like a staff, which
can be used for many spells, the icon is omitted, and you
must refer to each spell to determine which actions you
must spend to Activate the Item to cast it.
In this case, Activate an Item gains all the traits from
the relevant components of the Cast a Spell activity.
Limited Activations
Some items can be activated only a limited number of
times per day, as described in the items. This limit is
independent of any costs for activating the item. The
limit resets during your daily preparations. The limit is
inherent to the item, so if an ability that can be used only
once per day is used, it doesn’t refresh if another creature
later invests or tries to activate the item.
Sustaining Activations
Some items, once activated, have effects that can be
sustained if you concentrate on them. This works much
ITEM CATEGORIES
Items are grouped into the following categories, shown
here with the page number where those items appear
and a brief description of the category.
•	 Alchemical Items (page 543) are powered by the
reactions of alchemical reagents. Almost all alchemical
items are consumable items that are used up when you
activate them. This category includes bombs, elixirs
(including mutagens), poisons, and alchemical tools.
•	 Ammunition (page 559), in Consumables, includes
different types of magical arrows, crossbow bolts, and
other types of ammunition.
•	 Apex Items (page 603) are a subcategory of worn
items of a high level that increase an ability score.
•	 Armor (page 555) includes the rules for basic magical
armor as well as special suits of armor.
•	 Companion Items (page 604) are a category of worn
items meant for animal companions and mounts.
•	 Consumables (page 559) are used up when you
activate them, and include ammunition, oils, potions,
scrolls, and talismans, among others. Categories of
items that are consumables but have specific rules,
such as alchemical items, are presented separately.
•	 Held Items (page 572) include a wide variety of items
you use with your hands. This doesn’t include more
narrow categories of held items, such as weapons.
•	 Materials (page 577) can be used to make items with
unique properties and other advantages.
•	 Oils (page 561) are consumables applied to the surface
of an object or person.
•	 Potions (page 562) are consumable magical liquids
you drink to activate.
•	 Runes (page 580) modify armor and weapons when
etched onto them. This section includes fundamental
runes for weapons (weapon potency and striking) and
armor (armor potency and resilient).
•	 Scrolls (page 564) are consumables that allow
spellcasters to cast more spells.
•	 Shields (page 586) include more durable shields and
ones with special magical powers.
•	 Snares (page 589) are single-use traps typically made
by rangers.
•	 Staves (page 592) provide flexible spellcasting options.
•	 Structures (page 596) include buildings, tents, and
other larger items.
•	 Talismans (page 565) are consumables that are affixed
to items and then activated for a one-time combat or
physical benefit.
•	 Wands (page 597) hold a spell of the crafter’s choice,
and can be used to repeatedly cast that spell.
•	 Weapons (page 599) include the rules for basic magical
weapons, weapons made from precious materials, and
specific magic weapons.
•	 Worn Items (page 603) consist of a vast collection of
clothing and other items you wear on your body.

================================================================================

ITEM NAME
ITEM [LEVEL]
TRAITS
Price This entry lists the item’s Price. An item that has multiple
types includes Price for each type in its entry.
Ammunition Magic ammunition lists the types of ammunition
available for that kind of item.
Usage This entry describes whether the item is held, worn, or
affixed to or etched onto another item; Bulk The item’s Bulk
is listed here (the rules for Bulk appear on page 271). Runes
don’t have a Bulk entry.
Activate The number of actions needed to Activate the Item
appear here, followed by the components in parentheses.
You can find activation rules on page 532. This entry
appears here for consumables and lower in the stat block
for permanent items that can be activated. This section
might also have Frequency, Trigger, or Requirements
entries as necessary.
Onset This entry appears if the item’s effect is delayed, which
most often occurs with alchemical poisons. The onset is
the amount of time that elapses between when a character
Activates an Item and any effect occurs.
The section after the line describes the item and its constant
abilities. If the item can be activated and doesn’t have an
Activate entry above, that entry appears here in a paragraph
beginning with “Activate.”
Type If multiple types of the item exist, entries here indicate
the name of each type, its level, its Price, and any other
relevant details or alterations from the above description.
Craft Requirements An item that has special requirements to
be Crafted details those requirements here.
Level
An item’s level indicates what level of adventurer the item
is best suited for. There’s no limit to the items a character
can use, though. A 3rd-level character who finds an
item of 4th level or higher while adventuring can use it
normally. Likewise, they can purchase the item if they can
find it for sale and can afford it.
When making items, a character’s level must be equal
to or higher than the item’s level in order to Craft it. In
addition to anything listed in the Craft Requirements
entry in the item’s stat block, the crafter must have the
appropriate skill proficiencies and feats, as well as the
item’s formula; see the Craft activity on page 244 for
more information about these requirements.
Multiple Types
If multiple types of an item exist, the title line gives the
minimum level followed by a plus symbol (“+”). The
description includes information on the base version of the
item, and the Type entries at the bottom of the stat block
lists the specifics for each version, including the level, Price,
and any modified or added abilities of the different types.
For some items, the types listed are upgrades to the base
item. For other items, such as aeon stones and wondrous
figurines, each type is distinct from the others.
like the Sustain a Spell action (found on page 304). If an
item’s description states that you can sustain the effect, that
effect lasts until the end of your turn in the round after you
Activated the Item. You can use a Sustain an Activation
action on that turn to extend the duration.
[one-action] SUSTAIN AN ACTIVATION
CONCENTRATE
Requirements You have at least one magic item activation that
you can sustain, and you are not fatigued.
Choose one magic item activation with a sustained duration
you have in effect. The duration of that activation continues
until the end of your next turn. Some activations may have
slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them.
Sustaining an Activation for more than 10 minutes (100
rounds) ends the activation and makes you fatigued unless
the item’s description states a different maximum duration
(such as “up to 1 minute” or “up to 1 hour”).
If your Sustain an Activation action is disrupted, the item’s
effect immediately ends.
Dismissing Activations
Some item effects can be dismissed, ending the duration
early due to you or the target taking action. Dismissing
an activation requires using the Dismiss action.
[one-action] DISMISS
CONCENTRATE
You end one spell effect or magic item effect. This must be an
effect that you are allowed to dismiss, as defined by the spell
or item. Dismissal might end the effect entirely, or might end
it just for a certain target or targets, depending on the spell
or item.
Reading Items
Hundreds of items lie ahead. Each item is presented in a
stat block, much like spells or feats. The example below
shows the structure of an item stat block and gives a
brief description of each entry. Entries appear only when
applicable, so not all items will have every entry described
here. Detailed rules governing aspects of the stat block
specific to items appear after the stat block.
ITEM RARITY
Like many other aspects of the rules, items have rarities.
Player characters might find uncommon magic items for
sale, but only infrequently and often by private sellers
or in clandestine markets. Their formulas are often
guarded and not readily available. Unless the GM decides
otherwise, a character cannot purchase rare items, and
their formulas are lost to time.
Rarities for uncommon and rare treasures are indicated
by the first trait in the stat block. Unique items are indicated
in the same way, though there are none in this book.
Core Rulebook
534

PAGE 536
================================================================================

Price
If an item is available for purchase, a character can
typically buy it for the listed Price, and the character uses
this Price when they use the Craft activity to make the
item. If a character wants to sell an item, they can sell it
for half its Price (or full Price, if the item was made on
commission), assuming they’re able to find a buyer. The
GM determines whether a buyer is available.
Usage
An item’s stat block includes a Usage entry that indicates
whether a character must be holding or wearing the item
in order to use it, or whether she instead must have it
etched or affixed onto another item.
Held or Worn
If a character must wield the item to use it, this entry in
the item’s stat block lists the word “held” along with the
number of hands the character must use when wielding
the item, such as “held in 1 hand.” The rules for carrying
and using items are provided on page 271.
An item that needs to be worn to function lists “worn”
as its usage. This is followed by another word if the
character is limited to only one of that type of item. For
instance, a character can wear any number of rings, so the
entry for a ring would list only “worn.” However, if the
Usage entry were “worn cloak,” then a character couldn’t
wear another cloak on top of that one. It’s assumed that
items are meant to be worn by humanoids; any item
that can or must be worn by a different type of creature
either states this in its description or has the companion
trait. Most magic items a character must wear have the
invested trait, as described on page 531.
Affixed or Etched
Some items enhance other items. Talismans function
only if affixed to other items. They have a Usage
entry indicating the type or types of items to which a
character can attach them, such as “affixed to armor.”
Rules for affixing a talisman are on page 565.
Runes must be etched onto permanent items, such as
armor, weapons, or runestones (found on page 571) to
grant their benefit. Adding or transferring a rune takes
downtime to accomplish. The Usage entry indicates the
type or types of items a rune can be etched into, such
as “etched onto a weapon.” More information about
etching runes is on page 580.
Craft Requirements
An item might require the crafter to provide specific raw
materials, supply spells, have a certain alignment, or meet
other special requirements to Craft it. These appear in the
Craft Requirements entry of the stat block. Every item
also has default requirements. The crafter must provide
half the item’s Price in raw materials (as explained in
the Craft activity on page 244). In addition, creating
alchemical items requires the Alchemical Crafting feat
(page 258), creating magic items requires the Magical
Crafting feat (page 263), and crafting snares requires the
Snare Crafting feat (page 266). Finally, crafting higher-
level items requires greater proficiency in Crafting.
Unless stated otherwise, creating items of 9th level and
higher requires you to have the master proficiency rank
in Crafting, and items of 16th level and higher require
legendary Crafting.
NOTABLE ITEM TRAITS
The following traits apply to items. Some specific
categories of item have special traits—such as elixir or
scroll—described in their sections.
Alchemical: Alchemical items are powered by the
reactions of alchemical reagents. Alchemical items aren’t
magical, and they don’t radiate a magical aura. Characters
can Craft these items only if they have the Alchemical
Crafting feat (page 258).
Consumable: An item with this trait can be used only
once. Unless stated otherwise, it’s destroyed after activation,
though, part of it might be recoverable for other purposes.
For instance, while a potion is consumable, the vial it comes
in is not destroyed when you drink it. Consumable items
include alchemical items (page 543) as well as ammunition
oils, potions, scrolls, snares, talismans, and other magical
consumables (which begin on page 559).
When a character creates consumable items, she
can make them in batches of four, as described in
Consumables and Ammunition (page 245).
Focused: An item with this trait can give you an
additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from
your focus pool and doesn’t count toward the cap on your
focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a
focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the
point can be used. You can’t gain more than 1 Focus
Point per day from focused items, no matter how many
focused items you have.
Invested: A character can wear only 10 magical items
that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects
of the item apply if the character hasn’t invested it,
though the character still gains any normal benefits from
wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off a
character’s head).
Magical: Items with this trait are imbued with magical
energies. Each one radiates a magic aura infused with
its dominant school of magic (abjuration, conjuration,
divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy,
or transmutation; these are described on pages 297–298).
A character can craft these items only if she has the
Magical Crafting feat (page 263).
Some items are closely tied to a particular tradition of
magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine,
occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of
these traits indicates that the item is magical.

Alchemical Items
Alchemical items are not magical. They instead use the
properties of volatile chemicals, exotic minerals, potent
plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as
alchemical reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t
radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed
or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set
amount of time or until they are countered in some way,
typically physically.
Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times they straddle
the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable.
Alchemists can infuse reagents with some of their own
essence, allowing them to efficiently create short-lived
alchemical items at no monetary cost. Even in these cases,
alchemical items don’t radiate magic auras, instead using
the alchemist’s infused essence as one additional catalyst
for the item’s alchemical effects.
Rules for creating alchemical items are found in the
Craft activity on page 244, and you must have the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to use Crafting to create
alchemical items. Critically failing a Crafting check to
make alchemical items often causes a dangerous effect,
such as an explosion for a bomb or accidental exposure
for a poison, in addition to losing some of the materials.
Some alchemical items have additional requirements
beyond those stated in the Craft activity; these items list
their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.
All alchemical items have the alchemical trait. Most
also have the consumable trait, which means that the item
is used up once activated. The bomb, elixir, and poison
traits indicate special categories of alchemical items, each
of which is described on the following pages. Alchemical
items without any of these traits are called alchemical
tools, and are described further on page 554.
This section contains the following subcategories.
Special rules appear at the start of the relevant section.
•	 Alchemical bombs appear on page 544.
•	 Alchemical elixirs are listed on page 546.
•	 Alchemical poisons begin on page 550.
•	 Alchemical tools can be found on page 554.

Alchemical Bombs
An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical
components that explode when the bomb hits a creature
or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though
some produce other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait.
Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you
make a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as
you would for any other weapon. It takes one hand to
draw, prepare, and throw a bomb. Due to the complexity
involved in preparing bombs, Strikes to throw alchemical
bombs gain the manipulate trait. The bomb is activated
when thrown as a Strike—you don’t have to activate
it separately.
Splash Trait
Most bombs also have the splash trait. When you use a
thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your
Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a
splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all
creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target)
take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical
failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage.
Add splash damage together with the initial damage against
the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness.
You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.
For example, if you threw a lesser acid flask and hit
your target, that creature would take 1d6 persistent acid
damage and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures
within 5 feet of it would take 1 acid splash damage. On
a critical hit, the target would take 2d6 persistent acid
damage, but the splash damage would still be 1. If you
missed, the target would take 1 splash damage. If you
critically failed, no one would take any damage.

Alchemical Elixirs
Elixirs are alchemical liquids that are used by drinking
them. They have the elixir trait. These potent concoctions
grant the drinker some alchemical benefits. While all
elixirs follow the same general rules, mutagens (described
below) have additional rules that apply to their use.
Activating Elixirs
You usually Interact to activate an elixir as you drink it
or feed it to another creature. You can feed an elixir only
to a creature within reach that is either willing or unable
to prevent you from doing so. You usually need only one
hand to consume an elixir or feed it to another creature.
Mutagens
These elixirs, indicated by the mutagen trait, temporarily
transmogrify the subject’s body and alter its mind. Typically,
only alchemists have the expertise to craft mutagens, and
some say they are the only ones reckless enough to use them.
A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial
effects (listed in the Benefit entry) paired with one or
more detrimental effects (shown in the Drawback entry).
Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can
benefit from only one at a time (see page 301 for more
information about the polymorph trait).

Favored by spies and tricksters, an infiltrator’s
elixir is used to alter your appearance. When
imbibed, you take the shape of a humanoid
creature of your size, but different enough so you

you transform into when you imbibe the elixir, including eye
color, skin tone, and hair color. The elixir can’t change your
form into that of a specific person. After the form takes hold,
you retain it for the next 10 minutes.

Alchemical Poisons
Alchemical poisons are potent toxins distilled or extracted
from natural sources and made either stronger or easier to
administer. Each poison’s stat block includes the Price and
features for a single dose. Poison doses are typically kept
in a vial or some other type of safe and secure container.
Applying alchemical poisons uses Interact actions. A
poison typically requires one hand to pour into food
or scatter in the air. Applying a poison to a weapon or
another item requires two hands, with one hand holding
the weapon or item. The Usage entry for a poison
indicates the number of hands needed for a typical means
of application, but the GM might determine that using
poisons in other ways functions differently.
The full rules for how poisons and other afflictions
work begin on page 457. A creature attempts the listed
saving throw as soon as it’s exposed to the poison; on a
failed save, the creature advances to stage 1 of the poison
after any listed onset time elapses.
Some poisons have the virulent trait. This means the
poison is harder to remove once it has taken effect; see
Virulent Afflictions on page 458.
Method of Exposure
Each alchemical poison has one of the following traits,
which define how a creature can be exposed to that poison.
Contact: A contact poison is activated by applying it to
an item or directly onto a living creature’s skin. The first
creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving
throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly,
the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately
when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are
infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to
the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself.
Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute.
Ingested: An ingested poison is activated by applying
it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature,
or by placing it directly into a living creature’s mouth. A
creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison
when it consumes the poison or the food or drink treated
with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons
typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day.
Inhaled: An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing
it from its container. Once unleashed, the poison creates a
cloud filling a 10-foot cube lasting for 1 minute or until a
strong wind dissipates the cloud. Every creature entering
this cloud is exposed to the poison and must attempt a
saving throw against it; a creature aware of the poison
before entering the cloud can use a single action to hold
its breath and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving
throw for 1 round.
Injury: An injury poison is activated by applying it to
a weapon, and it affects the target of the first Strike made
using the poisoned weapon. If that Strike is a success and
deals piercing or slashing damage, the target must attempt
a saving throw against the poison. On a failed Strike, the
target is unaffected, but the poison remains on the weapon
and you can try again. On a critical failure, or if the Strike
fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some other
reason, the poison is spent but the target is unaffected.

PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
ITEM 20
UNCOMMON
 ALCHEMICAL
 CONSUMABLE
Price —
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 2
Activate [one-action] Interact or 1 or more days; see below
An alchemist with the Craft Philosopher’s Stone feat can
create a philosopher’s stone once per month by spending 1
batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations
using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only
way to create a philosopher’s stone.
At a glance, a philosopher’s stone appears to be an ordinary,
sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a
Force Open action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone’s
heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that
can transmute base metals into precious metals or create
an elixir of rejuvenation (page 548).
To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting
and have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then use the
stone’s quicksilver for one of two effects:
•	 You can apply the stone’s quicksilver to an
infused true elixir of life using an Interact
action. This turns the elixir into an infused elixir
of rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesn’t
require any crafting time or additional materials.
•	 You can spend up to a month of downtime applying
the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead
to create gold. Treat this as a 20th-level task to Earn
Income using Crafting, except that you create 500 gp
worth of your chosen metal per day on a success or
750 gp worth per day on a critical success.
SILVERSHEEN
ITEM 2
ALCHEMICAL
 CONSUMABLE
Price 6 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
You can slather this silvery paste onto one melee weapon,
one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. Silversheen
spoils quickly, so once you open a vial, you must use it all
at once, rather than saving it. For the next hour, the weapon
or ammunition counts as silver instead of its normal precious
material (such as cold iron) for any physical damage it deals.
SMOKESTICK
ITEM 1+
ALCHEMICAL
 CONSUMABLE
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
With a sharp twist of this item, you

concealed, and all other creatures are concealed to
them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by
a strong wind.
Type lesser; Level 1; Price 3 gp
The radius of the burst is 5 feet.
Type greater; Level 7; Price 53 gp
The radius of the burst is 20 feet.
SNAKE OIL
ITEM 1
ALCHEMICAL
 CONSUMABLE
Price 2 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
You can apply snake oil onto a wound or other outward
symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a
disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour, the
symptom disappears and the wounded or afflicted creature
doesn’t feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all
effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding
at a DC 17 Perception check, but only if it uses a Seek action
to specifically examine the snake oil’s effects.
SUNROD
ITEM 1
ALCHEMICAL
 CONSUMABLE

This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped rod glows after it’s struck on a

it to a flammable object as part of the same Interact action.

Armor
Suits of armor can be crafted from precious materials or
infused with magic to grant them abilities exceeding those
of typical armor. Many suits of magic armor are created
by etching runes onto them, as described on page 580.
The magic armor stat block lists the Price and
attributes of the most common armors you can
make with fundamental runes. Other special
suits of armor might be made of precious
materials, and some are specially crafted
items all on their own.
Precious Material Armor
Suits of armor made of precious
materials are more expensive and
sometimes grant special effects.
You can make leather armor
out of dragonhide, wooden
armor out of darkwood, and metal armor
out of any precious materials except for
darkwood. Because armor’s Bulk is
reduced when the armor is worn, use
its carried Bulk when determining
its material Price. (Materials are on
page 577.)

glitters in even the faintest light. It grants a +2 item bonus
to AC and has no check penalty.
Created by elven artisans employing ancient crafting
techniques, elven chain is exceptionally quiet. Unlike other
chain shirts—even other mithral chain shirts—elven chain
does not have the noisy  trait. This suit of armor can be
etched with runes like any other mithral chain shirt.

Basic Magic Armor
The most common special armors are suits of armor with
some combination of armor potency and resilient runes.
The following stat block provides a quick reference for
these types of armor.
MAGIC ARMOR
ITEM 5+
ABJURATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Usage worn armor; Bulk varies by armor
A suit of magic armor is simply a suit of
armor or explorer’s clothing etched with
fundamental runes. An armor potency
rune increases the armor’s item bonus
to AC, and a resilient rune adds an item
bonus to saving throws.
The Prices here are for all types of armor.
You don’t need to adjust the Price from leather
armor to full plate or the like. These armors
are made of standard materials, not precious
materials such as mithral.
Type +1 armor; Level 5; Price 160 gp
This armor has a +1 armor potency rune (increase the
item bonus to AC by 1).
Type +1 resilient armor; Level 8; Price 500 gp
This armor has a +1 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 1) and a resilient rune (+1 item bonus to saves).
Type +2 resilient armor; Level 11; Price 1,400 gp
This armor has a +2 armor potency rune (increase the
item bonus to AC by 2) and a resilient rune (+1 item bonus
to saves).
Type +2 greater resilient armor; Level 14; Price 4,500 gp
This armor has a +2 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 2) and a greater resilient rune (+2 item bonus
to saves).
Type +3 greater resilient armor; Level 18; Price 24,000 gp
This armor has a +3 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 3) and a greater resilient rune (+2 item bonus
to saves).
Type +3 major resilient armor; Level 20; Price 70,000 gp
This armor has a +3 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 3) and a major resilient rune (+3 item bonus
to saves).
ARMOR ALTERNATIVES
If you don’t want to wear armor, or you’re trained in
only unarmored defense, you can wear either explorer’s
clothing or bracers of armor. Explorer’s clothing can be
etched with runes just like armor can, so it can provide
item bonuses to AC or saves.
Bracers of armor give a +1 item bonus to AC with no Dex
modifier cap, and also grant a bonus to saves. This item
can be found on page 607.

================================================================================

Specific Magic Armor
These suits of armor have abilities far different from
what can be gained by etching runes. A specific magic
armor lists its fundamental runes, which you can
upgrade, add, or transfer as normal. You can’t etch
any property runes onto a specific armor that it doesn’t
already have.

This suit of +2 resilient splint mail has a large, green gemstone
inset in a prominent location.
Activate [free-action] envision; Frequency once per day; Trigger You

Activating the armor causes the gemstone to turn gray
and become inert. You cannot activate the armor again until
the stone returns to its original green color. The gem turns
green again after 1 week or when a significant foe critically
succeeds at an attack roll targeting you. (If an enemy rolls
a critical success at an attack against you and you force the
attacker to reroll that critical success, that critical success
does not recharge the mail of luck.) Even if the armor’s power

turns a significant foe’s critical hit into a normal hit, one of
the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to
physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a
maximum of 8.
At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.

Consumables
This section includes magic items with the consumable
trait. An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless
stated otherwise, it is destroyed after activation. When
a character creates consumable items, they can make
them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity.
Consumables includes the following subcategories, with
any special rules appearing at the start of the section.
•	 Ammunition begins on this page.
•	 Oils appear on page 561.
•	 Potions are described on page 562.
•	 Scrolls are listed on page 564.
•	 Talismans begin on page 565.
•	 Other Consumables begins on page 570.
Ammunition
These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons.
Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry that
lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or
“any” if it’s not limited to any particular type. All stat
blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use
the standard rules in Chapter 6: Equipment for the type of
ammunition to determine reloading times and Bulk.
When using magic ammunition, use your ranged
weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack
modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your
weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states
otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic
ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition
to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise.
Regardless of whether an attack with magic ammunition
hits or misses, launching the ammunition consumes its
magic. Magic ammunition is made of normal materials,
not precious materials, unless stated otherwise.
Activated Ammunition
If magic ammunition doesn’t have an Activate entry, it’s
activated automatically when it’s launched. Types of magic
ammunition that have an Activate entry must be activated
with additional actions before being used. Once you activate
the ammunition, you must shoot it before the end of your
turn. Otherwise, it deactivates (but it isn’t consumed) and
you must activate it again before you can use it. If you shoot
the ammunition without activating it first, it functions as
non-magical ammunition and is still consumed.
The action required to activate the ammunition doesn’t
alter how many actions it takes to reload. For example,
you could activate a beacon shot arrow by touching it with
1 action, then draw and shoot the arrow as part of a Strike
as normal. For a beacon shot bolt, you could activate it,
load it into a crossbow, then shoot it, or load it into the
crossbow, then activate it, and then shoot it.
BEACON SHOT
ITEM 3
CONSUMABLE
 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 10 gp
Ammunition arrow, bolt
Activate [one-action] Interact
The shaft of a beacon shot is studded with tiny flecks of
glimmering gemstones. When an activated beacon shot hits a
target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for
1 minute. If the target is invisible, it becomes merely hidden
to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The
sparks also negate the concealed condition if the target was
otherwise concealed.
A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact
basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 Athletics check.
CLIMBING BOLT
ITEM 4
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 15 gp
Ammunition bolt
The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. When the
bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges
into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the
bolt struck. The rope can be pulled free with an Interact action
and a successful DC 20 Athletics check.
DISINTEGRATION BOLT
ITEM 15
UNCOMMON
 CONSUMABLE
 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 1,300 gp
Ammunition bolt
Activate [one-action] Interact
The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling
it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an
activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a
disintegrate spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with
the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target’s
saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of disintegrate.
EXPLOSIVE AMMUNITION
ITEM 9+
CONSUMABLE
 EVOCATION
 FIRE
 MAGICAL
Ammunition any
Activate [one-action] Interact
This piece of ammunition is coated in gritty black soot. When
activated explosive ammunition hits a target, the missile
explodes in a 10-foot burst, dealing 6d6 fire damage to each
creature in the area (including the target). Each creature must
attempt a DC 25 basic Reflex save.
Type standard; Level 9; Price 130 gp
Type greater; Level 13; Price 520 gp
The damage is 10d6 and the save DC is 30.

barriers and ignores all cover, the target still benefits from
the flat check from being concealed or hidden. You still can’t
target an undetected creature without guessing.
After it is launched, the ammunition vanishes into mist.
However, in the dead of the night 1d4 days later, it reappears
in the last quiver or other container it was taken from.
PENETRATING AMMUNITION
ITEM 12
CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Price 400 gp
Ammunition arrow, bolt
Activate [one-action] Interact
This ammunition has a slender shape and a viciously pointed
tip. When you activate and shoot penetrating ammunition, the
Strike takes the shape of a 60-foot line originating from you.
Roll one attack roll and compare the result to the AC of each
target in the line. The ammunition ignores up to 10 of a target’s
resistance, and it can penetrate walls up to 1 foot thick with
Hardness 10 or less. Each target that takes damage from this
ammunition also takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
If your attack roll result is a natural 20, you improve your
degree of success only against the first target in the line, but
you can still score a critical hit on other targets if your result
exceeds their AC by 10 or more. If you have access to your bow’s
critical specialization effect, penetrating ammunition applies
that effect only against a target in the last square of the line.
SHINING AMMUNITION
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
 EVOCATION
 LIGHT
 MAGICAL
Price 3 gp
Ammunition any
A piece of shining ammunition gives off a faint glow. When
shot, this ammunition sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius
(and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits
a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the
same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an
Interact action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow
for the rest of the duration or until destroyed.
SLEEP ARROW
ITEM 3
CONSUMABLE
 ENCHANTMENT
 MAGICAL
 MENTAL
 SLEEP
Price 11 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] Interact
Sleep arrows often have shafts of deep blue or black, and
their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated
sleep arrow deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it is
subject to the effects of a sleep spell (DC 17).
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of sleep.
SPELLSTRIKE AMMUNITION
ITEM 3+
CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Ammunition any
Activate [two-actions] Cast a Spell
Mystic patterns create a magic reservoir within this
ammunition. You activate spellstrike ammunition by Casting
a Spell into the ammunition. The spell must be of a spell level
the ammunition can hold, and the spell must be able to target
a creature other than the caster. A creature hit by activated
spellstrike ammunition is targeted by the spell. If the creature
isn’t a valid target for the spell, the spell is lost.
The ammunition affects only the target hit, even if the
spell would normally affect more than one target. If the spell
requires a spell attack roll, use the result of your ranged attack
roll with the ammunition to determine the degree of success
of the spell. If the spell requires a saving throw, the target
attempts the save against your spell DC.
The maximum level of spell the ammunition can hold
determines its item level and Price.

STONE BULLET 
ITEM 15
CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,300 gp
Ammunition sling bullet
Activate [one-action] Interact
This sling bullet looks like a petrified serpent’s eye. A creature
hit by an activated stone bullet is subject to the effects of a
6th-level flesh to stone spell (DC 34).
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of flesh to stone.
STORM ARROW
ITEM 9
AIR
 CONSUMABLE
 ELECTRICITY
 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 130 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] Interact
The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.
When an activated storm arrow hits a target, it is buffeted
by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals
3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25
Reflex saving throw. If this arrow is shot from a weapon with
a shock property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though
the attack doesn’t benefit from the shock property rune itself.
Critical Success The foe is unaffected.
Success The foe takes half damage and isn’t affected by the wind.
Failure The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for
1 round, taking a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack
rolls and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.
Critical Failure As failure, but the foe takes double damage.
VINE ARROW
ITEM 3
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 10 gp
Ammunition arrow
Core Rulebook
560

PAGE 562
================================================================================

Activate [one-action] command
Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When
an activated vine arrow hits a target, the arrow’s shaft splits
and grows, wrapping the target in vines. The target takes a
–10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or
until it Escapes against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target
is also immobilized until it Escapes.
VIPER ARROW
ITEM 4
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 17 gp
Ammunition arrow
Activate [one-action] command
The shaft of this arrow is covered in fine green scales, and its
iron head comes to a pair of points almost like fangs. After an
activated viper arrow hits a target, the arrow transforms into
a viper (Pathfinder Bestiary 302). The target is affected by the
viper’s poison, as if it had been bitten. The viper then lands in
an open space adjacent to the target.
The viper has the summoned trait and acts at the end of your
turn, even though you didn’t use the Sustain a Spell action. It is
under the GM’s control, but it generally attacks the creature the
arrow struck. The viper vanishes after 1 minute or when slain.
Craft Requirements Supply one casting of summon animal.
Oils
Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that
are typically applied to an object and are used up in the
process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually
takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil,
and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can
only apply an oil to an item or creature within your
reach. Because the process is so thorough, it is usually
impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an
item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that
target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.

RARE
 ABJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL

This oil contains energy that repels nearly all types of magic.
When you apply this oil to armor, the creature wearing the
armor becomes immune to all spells, effects of magic items
(the wearer’s and those of others), and effects with the magical
trait for 1 minute. The oil affects neither the magic of the armor
nor the fundamental runes of weapons attacking the wearer.
Magical effects from a source of 20th level or higher, such as a
deity, still function on the armor’s wearer.
ALIGNED OIL

Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L

This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each
aligned oil is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law
(such as a good-aligned oil). A weapon anointed with this oil
gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment:
anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), holy (good), or unholy (evil).
This lasts for 1 minute.
NECTAR OF PURIFICATION

Potions
A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it,
which uses it up. Potions have the potion trait. You can
activate a potion with an Interact action as you drink it
or feed it to another creature. You can feed a potion only
to a creature that is within reach and willing or otherwise
so helpless that it can’t resist. You usually need only one
hand to consume a potion or feed it to another creature.

Price 60 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L

Upon drinking this potion, your biology instantly transforms to
take on a set of sexual characteristics of your choice, changing
your appearance and physiology accordingly. You have mild
control over the details of this change, but you retain a strong
“family resemblance” to your former appearance.
The magic functions instantaneously and can’t be
counteracted. Your new anatomy is as healthy and functional
as your previous body’s, potentially allowing you to procreate
(depending on your ancestry’s biology). Drinking a subsequent
serum of sex shift allows you to either revert back to your
original form or adopt other sexual characteristics, as you
choose. The elixir has no effect if you are pregnant or from
an ancestry with no sexual differentiation. Most ancestries

others more rare.

you are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the

A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without
having to expend a spell slot. A scroll can be Crafted to
contain nearly any spell, so the types of scrolls available
are limited only by the number of spells in the game. The
exceptions are cantrips, focus spells, and rituals, none of
which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can
be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of
the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular
spell level, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a
scroll of magic missile (1st level) can be used to cast the
1st-level version of magic missile, but not a magic missile
heightened to 2nd level. If no level is listed, the scroll can
be used to cast the spell at its lowest level.
If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell
it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell
list or a spell you know, you can spend a single Recall
Knowledge action and automatically succeed at identifying
the scroll’s spell. If it’s not, you must use Identify Magic
(page 238) to learn what spell the scroll holds.
Casting a Spell from a Scroll
Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll
in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity
using the normal number of actions for that spell.
To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on
your spell list. Because you’re the one Casting the Spell,
use your spell attack roll and spell DC. The spell also
gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane,
divine, occult, or primal).
Any physical material components and costs are
provided when a scroll is created, so you don’t need to
provide them when Casting a Spell from a scroll. You
must replace any required material component for that
spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from
a scroll.
Scroll Statistics
All scrolls have the same base statistics unless noted
otherwise. A scroll has light Bulk, and it must be held in
one hand to be activated.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

Varying Statistics
Table 11–3 indicates the item level and Price of a
scroll, both of which are based on the level of the spell
contained on the scroll. Any costs to Cast the Spell are
added to the scroll’s Price when the scroll is crafted, so
a scroll containing a spell with a Cost entry will have a
higher Price than what appears on the table. The scroll’s
rarity matches the spell’s rarity.
The traits for a scroll vary based on the spell it contains.
A scroll always has the consumable, magical, and scroll
traits, plus the traits of the spell stored on it.

Crafting a Scroll
The process to Craft a scroll is much like that to Craft any
other magic item. When you begin the crafting process,
choose a spell to put into the
scroll. You have to either Cast
that Spell during the crafting
process, or someone else must
do so in your presence. Casting
that Spell doesn’t produce its normal
effects; instead, the magic is trapped
inside the scroll. The casting must come
from a spellcaster expending a spell slot.
You can’t Craft a scroll from a spell
produced from another magic item, for
example. The caster has to provide any
cost of the spell.
Like other consumables, scrolls can be crafted
in batches of four. All scrolls of one batch must
contain the same spell at the same level, and you
must provide one casting for each scroll crafted.
Sample Scrolls
A wide variety of spells can appear on scrolls. The
following specific scrolls are just examples.
SCROLL OF GLITTERDUST

Craft Requirements Supply one casting of illusory disguise.
Talismans
An item with the talisman trait is a magical charm, gem,
stone, or other small object affixed to armor, a shield, or
a weapon (called the affixed item). Each talisman holds a
sliver of combat knowledge or magical energy that can be
unleashed for a momentary boost of power or enhanced
ability. Many talismans can be activated as a free action
when you use a particular action or activity. A talisman is
a consumable item and has the talisman trait.
You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a
talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns
out permanently, usually crumbling into a fine dust.
Affixing a Talisman
Each talisman’s stat block indicates the type of item it
can be affixed to. Affixing or removing requires using
the Affix a Talisman activity. A single talisman can be
affixed to only one item at a time, and an
item can have only one talisman affixed to
it at a time.
AFFIX A TALISMAN
EXPLORATION
 MANIPULATE
Requirements You must use a repair kit (page
291).
You spend 10 minutes affixing a talisman to an
item, placing the item on a stable surface and
using the repair kit with both hands. You can
also use this activity to remove a talisman. If
more than one talisman is affixed to an item,
the talismans are suppressed; none of them
can be activated.

 MAGICAL
Price 135 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
This powder shimmers like a thousand tiny motes of light.
Activating the dust by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature
within reach casts a 4th-level invisibility spell with a
duration of 1 minute on that creature. This invisibility can’t
be negated or seen through by any spell of 3rd level or
lower or any item of 5th level or lower.
ELEMENTAL GEM
ITEM 10
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 200 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact
You shout the name of an elemental lord and
dash this glassy gem against a hard surface
to activate it. It cracks open, casting a 5th-level
summon elemental spell to summon forth an
elemental you control as long as you spend an action
each round to Sustain the Activation.
This gem comes in four varieties: transparent for a living
whirlwind, light brown for a living landslide, reddish orange
for a living wildfire, and blue-green for a living waterfall.
FEATHER TOKEN
ITEM 1+
CONJURATION
 CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
Activate [one-action] Interact
Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some
exotic bird. The feather’s shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single
arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform
into another object, which then can be used as normal for that
object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of
them permanently becoming the item in their description.
Type anchor; Level 7; Price 55 gp
This feather can be activated only on a boat. When activated,
this feather transforms into a massive anchor that causes the
boat to immediately stop. After 1 day, the anchor vanishes and
the boat can move as normal. The anchor is attached to the
boat by a magical chain of force, but the chain can be removed
by dispel magic or destroyed (Hardness 30, HP 40).
Type bird; Level 3; Price 8 gp
When activated, this token transforms into a small sparrow that
waits on your finger for you to relay a message up to 1 minute in
length, along with the name and rough location of a recipient.
The recipient must be someone you have met, and the location
must be somewhere you have visited. After receiving the
message, the bird flies off to deliver it, traveling at 30 miles
per hour and then searching for the target in the location you
provided. If the bird finds the target, it moves adjacent to them,
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

your words emanate from the bird, and the bird then flies off
and vanishes. The bird also vanishes if it fails to find your target
after 10 hours of searching the location you specified.
Type chest; Level 3; Price 10 gp
When you use this token, a small wooden chest appears and
immediately opens. This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth
of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again—this
time into a key—taking all of the stored items with it. You can
activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an
imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest
with all of the items still inside. Once it has turned into a chest
a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest.
Type fan; Level 4; Price 15 gp
Activating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction.
If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters
up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air
and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its
Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead
produces a single casting of gust of wind (DC 20).
Type holly bush; Level 2; Price 6 gp
When this feather is activated, it immediately transforms into a
living holly bush, filling a single square. This bush can provide
standard cover. In addition, the bush has 2d4 bright-red berries.
While holly berries are usually poisonous, these berries are
infused with beneficial magic. You can pick and eat a berry as an
Interact action to recover 1 Hit Point. Once plucked from the bush,
a berry becomes non-magical after a few seconds, so it doesn’t
heal you if you don’t eat it within the span of your Interact action.
If activated on soil, the plant continues to grow and thrive
(although it doesn’t produce any more healing berries). If
activated elsewhere, it withers and dies within 1d4 days.
Type ladder; Level 1; Price 3 gp
When
activated,
this
feather
transforms
permanently into a 20-foot-long wooden ladder.
Type swan boat; Level 8; Price 76 gp
This feather can be activated only when tossed
into a large body of water, such as a lake or
broad river. It transforms into a swan-shaped
boat capable of carrying up to 32 Medium
creatures, 8 Large creatures, or 2 Huge
creatures. The boat moves on the water at a
Speed of 50 feet, and lasts 1 day.
Type tree; Level 6; Price 38 gp
This token can be activated only on an unoccupied
patch of earth or soil. When activated, this token transforms
into an oak tree, 60 feet tall with a 5-foot-wide trunk. The tree
continues to live and grow if conditions are favorable.
Type whip; Level 9; Price 130 gp
This feather transforms into a +1 striking dancing whip when
activated. The whip immediately jumps from your grasp and
proceeds to attack your enemies until 1 minute has passed or
it fails its flat check for dancing, at which point it vanishes.
If the whip’s target isn’t prone, the whip uses its actions to
attempt to Trip that creature instead of making a Strike. The
whip’s total attack modifier for Striking or Tripping is +18
instead of the normal bonus for a dancing weapon.
HOLY WATER
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
 DIVINE
 GOOD
 SPLASH
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Strike
This vial contains water blessed by a good deity. You activate
a vial of holy water by throwing it as a Strike. It’s a simple
thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an

JAVELIN OF LIGHTNING
ITEM 9
CONSUMABLE
 ELECTRICITY
 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 110 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact
This item looks like a normal javelin carved with lightning-bolt
motifs. If thrown without being activated, it wobbles in the
air and fails to strike true. When you Activate the javelin, your
command makes the carvings crackle with electricity. You then
hurl the javelin. It shatters immediately after leaving your hand
and unleashes its magic as a 4th-level lightning bolt originating
from your space. The bolt deals 5d12 electricity damage and
has a Reflex save DC of 25.
Craft Requirements Supply a casting of lightning bolt (4th level).
RUNESTONE
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
 MAGICAL
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This flat piece of hard stone is specially prepared for etching a
magical fundamental rune or property rune. You can
etch only one rune upon a stone. Once the stone is
etched, it gains the magic school trait of the rune
etched upon it. When a rune is transferred from
the runestone to another object, the runestone
cracks and is destroyed. The Price listed is for an
empty stone; a stone holding a rune adds the Price
of the rune.
UNHOLY WATER
ITEM 1
CONSUMABLE
 DIVINE
 EVIL
 SPLASH
Price 3 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Strike
An evil deity’s malice lies within this vial of water. You activate
a vial of unholy water by throwing it as a Strike. It’s a simple
thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an
alchemical bomb, it doesn’t add the manipulate trait to the
attack made with it.
Unholy water deals 1d6 evil damage and 1 evil splash damage.
It damages only celestials and creatures that have a weakness
to evil damage.

Held Items
These items need to be held to use them. Weapons, wands,
and staves follow special rules and have their own sections.
BAG OF HOLDING
ITEM 4+
CONJURATION
 EXTRADIMENSIONAL
 MAGICAL
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
Though it appears to be a cloth sack decorated with panels
of richly colored silk or stylish embroidery, a bag of holding
opens into an extradimensional space larger than its outside
dimensions. The Bulk held inside the bag doesn’t change the
Bulk of the bag of holding itself. The amount of Bulk the bag’s
extradimensional space can hold depends on its type.
You can Interact with the bag of holding to put items in or
remove them just like a mundane sack. Though the bag can
hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able
to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside.
If the bag is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is
ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it’s
turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed,
but the bag must be put right before
it can be used again. A living creature
placed inside the bag has enough air for
10 minutes before it begins to suffocate,
and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An
item inside the bag provides no benefits unless it’s
retrieved first. An item in the bag can’t be detected
by magic that detects only things on the same plane.
Type I; Level 4; Price 75 gp; Capacity 25 Bulk

BOTTLED AIR
ITEM 7
AIR
 CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 320 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Appearing to be an ordinary corked glass
bottle, this item contains a limitless supply of
fresh air. You must uncork the bottle with an
Interact action before you can activate it.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You draw a
breath of air from the bottle. This allows you to
breathe even in an airless or toxic environment. Air doesn’t
escape the mouth of the bottle, so leaving the open bottle in
an airless environment doesn’t change the environment.
BROOM OF FLYING
ITEM 12
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Price 1,900 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This broom has a tenuous connection to gravity, and it tends to
drift even while stowed. You can ride on the broom using one
hand to guide it, and the broom can carry up to one passenger
in addition to you. The broom moves at a fly Speed of 20 feet.
The broom can carry only so much, taking a –10‑foot penalty
to its Speed if laden with more than 20 Bulk, and crashing to
the ground if it carries more than 30 Bulk.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect You name
a destination on the same plane, and the broom
speeds toward it at a fly Speed of 40 feet. You must
either clutch the broom with two hands in order to
ride it, or you need to release the broom to send it
off with no rider. If you don’t have a good idea of the
location, layout, and general direction of the destination,
or if your named destination is on another plane, the
broom wanders aimlessly, circling back to its starting
location after 30 minutes.
If the broom carries a rider, this activation lasts until
4 hours pass (typically 16 miles of travel), the broom
reaches its destination, or you Dismiss the activation.
If the broom doesn’t have a rider, the activation lasts
until the broom reaches its destination. When the
activation ends, the broom floats to the ground and
can’t be activated again for 1 hour.
CHIME OF OPENING

UNCOMMON
 EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 235 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
This hollow mithral tube is about a foot long and bears
engravings reminiscent of open locks and broken chains.
The chime can be activated 10 times before it cracks and
becomes useless.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You aim the chime at a
container, door, or lock you want to open and strike the
chime. The chime sends out magical vibrations that
attempt a Thievery check against the lock’s DC, with
a Thievery bonus of +13. This targets only one lock
or binding at a time, so you might need to activate
the chime multiple times to open a target with
several forms of protection.
CRYSTAL BALL
ITEM 14+
UNCOMMON
 DIVINATION
 MAGICAL
 SCRYING
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This polished crystal sphere enhances scrying magic. Any
visual information received through a spell with the scrying
trait that was cast by the crystal ball appears within the
sphere, and any auditory information sounds out from the
surface of the sphere. When you cast a scrying spell by any
other means while holding the sphere, you can relay any
information you receive in the same way, allowing others to
see or hear the target.
The base version of a crystal ball is a sphere of clear quartz,
but other versions are made of different stones.
Activate 1 minute (command, envision, Interact); Frequency

ITEM 7
CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
 WATER
Price 320; Bulk L
This item looks like an ordinary glass flask full of water.
The stopper can’t be removed unless you speak one of
the item’s three command words, each of which causes
water to pour forth in a different way. Pulling the stopper
straight out creates fresh water, and rotating it as you pull
creates salt water. Any effect of the decanter lasts until the

 DIVINE
 HEALING
 NECROMANCY
 POSITIVE
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk —
This strand of ordinary-looking prayer beads glows with a
soft light and becomes warm to the touch the first time you
cast a divine spell while holding it. When you do, the prayer
beads become attuned to your deity, changing their form
and iconography to prominently incorporate your deity’s
religious symbol and iconography. The beads don’t transform
or function for an evil spellcaster.
Whenever you cast a divine spell from your own spell slots
while holding the prayer beads, you recover 1 Hit Point; this
is a positive healing effect. If the spell you cast was a healing
spell, you can grant this additional healing to one of the

each once per day.

an Interact action to gain the effects of see invisibility for 1
round by peering through the smoke.
Type greater; Level 18; Price 19,000 gp
The thurible grants a +3 bonus. The greater version shares the
once-per-day enhanced revelations of the moderate version,
except peering through the smoke also grants you the effects
of true seeing.

TRAVELER’S ANY-TOOL 
ITEM 6
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Price 200 gp
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk 1
Before it’s activated, this item appears to be an ash rod capped
with steel on either end.
Activate [two-actions] Interact, envision; Effect You imagine a
specific simple tool, and the any-tool transforms into it.
(Usually, you can choose from a tool listed in Chapter 6). This
transforms the wooden portion into any haft and the metal
caps into spades, hammer heads, or the like, allowing for most
basic tools but nothing more complex. You can return the item
to its rod form with an Interact action.
TRITON’S CONCH 
ITEM 9
MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Price 640 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
If you put this large opalescent conch shell to your ear,
you can hear the sound of the roaring sea crashing against
the shore.
Activate [one-action] Interact (auditory); Effect You can raise
the conch to your lips and blow into it, letting out a long,
rumbling note. For the next minute, you and all allies who
were within 30 feet of you when you activated the conch
gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to Swim and can
breathe under water.
WONDROUS FIGURINE
ITEM 2+
CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
Each one of these statuettes is 1 inch in height, carved from
a specific material and taking the shape of a particular animal
or animals.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Effect You activate
the statue by placing it on solid ground and then speaking
its name, causing the statuette to transform into a living
creature or creatures. In creature form, the figurine has the
minion trait. It can understand your language and it obeys
you to the best of its ability when you use an action to
command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the
activation’s frequency (if any), appear in its entry below.
If the figurine is slain while in animal form, it reverts to
its statue shape and cannot be activated again until 1 week
has passed. If the figurine is destroyed in statue form, it is
shattered and its magic is lost.
Type golden lions; Level 10; Price 900 gp
This statuette depicts a pair of gold lions, and when activated,
it becomes a pair of adult lions (Pathfinder Bestiary 52). The
lions can be called on only once per day, and they remain
in lion form for no more than 1 hour. If either of the lions
is slain, that lion cannot be summoned again until 1 week
has passed, but this doesn’t prevent you from summoning
the other.
Type jade serpent; Level 7; Price 340 gp
This tiny statue first appears to be a formless lump of jade
until closer inspection reveals it to be a serpentine body curled
into a snug knot. When activated, this figurine becomes a
giant viper (Pathfinder Bestiary 303). The figurine can be used
only once per day, and it can remain in serpent form for no
more than 10 minutes.
Type marble elephant; Level 13; Price 2,700 gp
Finely carved from a solid piece of marble, this gleaming
elephant statuette becomes a fully grown elephant
(Pathfinder Bestiary 154) when activated. The elephant
can be called upon no more than four times per month.
It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a
beast of burden or for transport. If it attempts an attack or
otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form
after 1d4 rounds.
Type obsidian steed; Level 15 (uncommon); Price 6,000 gp
This sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing
up on its hind legs. When activated, this figurine becomes a
nightmare (Pathfinder Bestiary 244). It can be called upon
once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won’t use plane
shift or its other abilities on behalf of its rider. Although evil,
it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment,
although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt
a DC 3 flat check. On a failure, the nightmare uses plane shift
to take the rider to a random location in the Abyss, where
it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that
nightmarish place.
Type onyx dog; Level 2; Price 34 gp
This simple onyx statue transforms into a guard dog
(Pathfinder Bestiary 102). The dog has a +4 circumstance
bonus to Survival checks to Track, and it has darkvision.
When the dog senses a hidden creature with its scent, that
creature is instead observed and concealed. The onyx dog
can be activated once per week and remains in its form for
up to 6 hours.

Materials
Most items are made from readily available materials—
usually leather, wood, or steel—but some weapons and
armor are made from more exotic materials, giving
them unique properties and other advantages. Weapons
made from precious materials are better able to harm
certain creatures, and armor of these materials provides
enhanced protection.
Most materials are metals; they can be used to make
metal weapons and armor. The GM is the final arbiter of
what items can be made using a material. An item can be
made with no more than one precious material, and only
an expert in Crafting can create it. Some rare and exotic
materials require master or even legendary proficiency.
A material’s Price depends on how hard it is to work,
its scarcity, and its purity; most items made with precious
materials use an alloy, blend, or coating rather than using
the material in its purest form. The three grades of purity
for precious materials are low-grade, standard-grade, and
high-grade. Regardless of a precious material’s purity, an
item made from it gains the full effects of the precious
material, but creating higher-level items and more powerful
magic runes with precious material requires greater purity.
Some precious materials are available only at certain
grades. For instance, adamantine can’t be low-grade, and
orichalcum must be high-grade. Items made of materials
with a lower grade than expected for the item’s level, or of
a higher grade than necessary, will mention the precious
material’s grade.
Material Statistics
Table 11–4 below provides the Hardness, Hit Points,
Broken Threshold, and example items for some types
of common materials. The table has separate entries for
thin items (like shields), ordinary items (like armor), and
reinforced or durable structures (such as walls).
Stone is a catchall for any hard stone, such as granite
and marble. Likewise, wood covers ordinary woods, such
as oak and pine. Metal weapons and armor are assumed
to be made of iron or steel unless noted otherwise.
If an object consists of more than one material, the
GM typically uses the statistics for the strongest material
involved. For instance, breaking a wall made of paper
panels over a woven wooden framework would require
damaging thin wood, not paper. However, the GM
might choose the weaker material based on the item’s
function. For instance, breaking the wooden handle of
a hammer rather than its iron head would still render
the item unusable. Sometimes an item is even less sturdy
than the Hardness and Hit Points provided for a thin
object; for instance, a twig doesn’t take 9 damage to
break, even though it’s made of thin wood. Similarly,
a particularly sturdy item or structure might have even
higher Hardness and Hit Points. Certain structures,
particularly thick walls, are so reinforced that you have
to break them down over time with tools. (Page 515 has
more information on walls.)
Precious Materials
Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for
base materials. For example, a hammer’s head could be
made of adamantine instead of iron. Items made of a
precious material cost more than typical items; not only
does precious material cost more, but the crafter must
invest more time working with it. In addition, more
powerful items require precious materials of greater purity.

================================================================================

A number of precious materials are described below. The
Price entry for each material gives the Price of a simple
non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk
(if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk),
as well as Prices for different amounts of the material itself.
Prices for armor, shields, and weapons made of precious
material are in the Armor (page 555), Shields (page 586),
and Weapons (page 599) sections of this chapter.
Crafting with Precious Materials
Only an expert crafter can create a low-grade item, only
a master can create a standard-grade item, and only a
legendary crafter can create a high-grade item. In addition,
to Craft with a precious material, your character level
must be equal to or greater than that of the material.
Low-grade items can be used in the creation of magic
items of up to 8th level, and they can hold runes of up
to 8th level. Standard-grade items can be used to create
magic items of up to 15th level and can hold runes of
up to 15th level. High-grade items use the purest form
of the precious material, and can be used to Craft magic
items of any level holding any runes. Using purer forms
of common materials is so relatively inexpensive that the
Price is included in any magic item.
When you Craft an item that incorporates a precious
material, your initial raw materials for the item must
include that material; at least 10% of the investment
must be of the material for low-grade, at least 25% for
standard-grade, and all of it for high-grade. For instance,
a low-grade silver object of 1 Bulk costs 20 gp. Of the 10
gp of raw materials you provide when you start to Craft
the item, at least 1 gp must be silver. The raw materials
you spend to complete the item don’t have to consist of the
precious material, though the GM might rule otherwise in
certain cases.
After creating an item with a precious material, you can
use Craft to improve its grade, paying the Price difference
and providing a sufficient amount of the precious material.
ADAMANTINE
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one
of the hardest metals known. It has a shiny, black appearance,
and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an
incredibly sharp edge.

DARKWOOD
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
Darkwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old-
growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but
has a slight purple tint. A darkwood item’s Bulk is reduced by
1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an
item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made
of darkwood is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not its reduced
Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before
making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.

MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON

The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item
normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in
color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came
from. Due to the scales’ resiliency, it can also be used to Craft
armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate,
half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without
metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type,
depending on the type of dragon (see the table below).

MITHRAL
MATERIAL 8+
UNCOMMON
 PRECIOUS
Mithral is renowned for its lightness, durability, and
effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and
lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly
lighter hue. Mithral weapons and armor are treated as if
they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with
weakness to silver. A metal item made of mithral is lighter
than one made of iron or steel: the item’s Bulk is reduced by
1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect
on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item
made of this material is based on the item’s normal Bulk, not
its reduced Bulk for being made of mithral, but reduce the
Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size
of the item.

MATERIAL 17+
RARE
 PRECIOUS
The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for
its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery
metal isn’t as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum’s
time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness
and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn’t
destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.

================================================================================

Runes
Most magic weapons and armor gain their enhancements
from potent eldritch runes etched into them. These runes
allow for in-depth customization of items.
Runes must be physically engraved on items through a
special process to convey their effects. They take two forms:
fundamental runes and property runes. Fundamental
runes offer the most basic and essential benefits: a weapon
potency rune adds a bonus to a weapon’s attack rolls,
and the striking rune adds extra weapon damage dice. An
armor potency rune increases the armor’s item bonus to
AC, and the resilient rune grants a bonus to the wearer’s
saving throws. Property runes, by contrast, grant more
varied effects—typically powers that are constant while
the armor is worn or that take effect each time the weapon
is used, such as a rune that grants energy resistance or one
that adds fire damage to a weapon’s attacks.
The number of property runes a weapon or armor can
have is equal to the value of its potency rune. A +1 weapon
can have one property rune, but it could hold another
if the +1 weapon potency rune were upgraded to a +2
weapon potency rune. Since the striking and resilient runes
are fundamental runes, they don’t count against this limit.
An item with runes is typically referred to by the value of
its potency rune, followed by any other fundamental runes,
then the names of any property runes, and ends with the
name of the base item. For example, you might have a +1
longsword or +2 greater resilient fire-resistant chain mail.
Rune-etched armor and weapons have the same Bulk
and general characteristics as the non-magical version
unless noted otherwise. The level of an item with runes
etched onto it is equal to the highest level among the base
item and all runes etched on it; therefore, a +1 striking
mace (a 4th-level item) with a disrupting rune (a 5th-level
rune) would be a 5th-level item.
Each rune can be etched into a specific type of armor or
weapon, as indicated in the Usage entry of the rune’s stat
block. Explorer’s clothing can have armor runes etched on
it even though it’s not armor, but because it’s not in the
light, medium, or heavy armor category, it can’t have runes
requiring any of those categories.
Investiture
If a suit of armor has any runes, it has the invested trait,
requiring you to invest it to get its magical benefits.
Rune Formulas
The Price of a rune’s formula is the same as the Price of a
formula for an item of the same level; it can be acquired in
the same way as an item formula (described on page 293).
The Etching Process
Etching a rune on an item follows the same process as
using the Craft activity to make an item. You must have
the formula for the rune, the item you’re adding the rune to
must be in your possession throughout the etching process,
and you must meet any special Craft Requirements of the
rune. The rune has no effect until you complete the Craft
activity. You can etch only one rune at a time.
Transferring Runes
You can transfer runes between one item and another,
including a runestone (page 571). This also uses the Craft
activity. This lets you either move one rune from one item
to another or swap a rune on one item with a rune on the
other item. To swap, the runes must be of the same form
(fundamental or property).
If an item can have two or more property runes, you
decide which runes to swap and which to leave when
transferring. If you attempt to transfer a rune to an item
that can’t accept it, such as transferring a melee weapon
rune to a ranged weapon, you get an automatic critical
failure on your Crafting check. If you transfer a potency
rune, you might end up with property runes on an item
that can’t benefit from them. These property runes go
dormant until transferred to an item with the necessary
potency rune or until you etch the appropriate potency
rune on the item bearing them.
The DC of the Crafting check to transfer a rune is
determined by the item level of the rune being transferred,
and the Price of the transfer is 10% of the rune’s Price,
unless transferring from a runestone, which is free. If you’re
swapping, use the higher level and higher Price between the
two runes to determine these values. It takes 1 day (instead
of the 4 days usually needed to Craft) to transfer a rune or
swap a pair of runes, and you can continue to work over
additional days to get a discount, as usual with Craft.
Fundamental Runes
Four fundamental runes produce the most essential magic
of protection and destruction: armor potency and resilient
runes for armor, and weapon potency and striking runes for
weapons. A potency rune is what makes a weapon a magic
weapon (page 599) or armor magic armor (page 556).
An item can have only one fundamental rune of each
type, though etching a stronger rune can upgrade an
existing rune to the more powerful version (as described
in each rune’s entry). As you level up, you typically
alternate between increasing an item’s potency rune and
its striking or resilient rune when you can afford to.

================================================================================

SPECIFIC ARMOR AND WEAPONS
Unlike armor and weapons enhanced with runes, specific
armor and weapons (such as ghoul hide or a holy avenger)
are created for a specific purpose and can work quite
differently from other items of their type. Specific magic
armor and weapons can’t gain property runes, but you
can add or improve their fundamental runes.
RUNE TRANSFER EXAMPLES
You could transfer a flaming rune from a +1 striking
flaming greatsword to a +2 striking longsword, resulting
in a +2 striking flaming longsword and a +1 striking
greatsword. You could swap the weapon potency runes
from a +1 longsword and a +2 greatsword, resulting in a
+2 longsword and a +1 greatsword. However, you couldn’t
swap a +1 weapon potency rune from one weapon with a
flaming property rune from another weapon, as the two
runes don’t have the same form.
When transferring a rune to an item that can hold
multiple property runes, you can decide whether you
transfer a single rune or swap runes between the items.
For example, a +2 weapon can hold two property runes. If
you transferred a flaming rune from a +1 striking flaming
rapier to a +2 striking frost warhammer, you would
decide whether you wanted to end up with a +1 striking
rapier and a +2 striking flaming frost warhammer or a +1
striking frost rapier and a +2 striking flaming warhammer.

Usage etched onto armor
Magic wards deflect attacks. Increase the armor’s item bonus
to AC by 1. The armor can be etched with one property rune.
You can upgrade the armor potency rune already etched
on a suit of armor to a stronger version, increasing the
values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You
must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and
the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the two
runes’ Prices.
Type +1 armor potency; Level 5; Price 160 gp; Craft
Requirements You are an expert in Crafting.
Type +2 armor potency; Level 11; Price 1,060 gp; Craft
Requirements You are a master in Crafting.
Increase the armor’s item bonus to AC by 2, and the armor can
be etched with two property runes.
Type +3 armor potency; Level 18; Price 20,560 gp; Craft
Requirements You are legendary in Crafting.
Increase the armor’s item bonus to AC by 3, and the armor can
be etched with three property runes.
RESILIENT
RUNE 8+
ABJURATION
 MAGICAL

Resilient runes imbue armor with additional protective magic.
This grants the wearer a +1 item bonus to saving throws.
You can upgrade the resilient rune already etched on a suit
of armor to a stronger version, increasing the values of the
existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the
formula of the stronger rune to do so, and the Price of the
upgrade is the difference between the two runes’ Prices.
Type resilient; Level 8; Price 340 gp

upgrade is the difference between the two runes’ Prices.

UPGRADING ARMOR AND WEAPON RUNES
You’ll often want to upgrade the fundamental runes of magic armor or a magic weapon you already have. This requires
upgrading each rune separately. Tables 11–5 and 11–6 summarize the Price of each step, with a number in parentheses
indicating the item’s level for the Craft activity. This also indicates the typical progression for an adventurer to follow when
upgrading their armor and weapons. The tables here don’t include progressions that aren’t as likely to come up, like turning
a +1 weapon directly into a +1 greater striking weapon.

Property Runes
Property runes add special abilities to armor or a weapon
in addition to the item’s fundamental runes. If a suit of
armor or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same
rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade
a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the
same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune.
Rune abilities that must be activated follow the rules
for activating magic items on page 532.

RUNE 13
UNCOMMON
ABJURATION

Price 2,700 gp
Usage etched onto a melee weapon
A spell-storing rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within
the etched weapon. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to cast
a spell of 3rd level or lower into the weapon. The spell must
have a casting of 2 actions or fewer and must be able to target
a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate
effect—it is instead stored for later. When you wield a
spell-storing weapon, you immediately know the name and level
of the stored spell. A spell-storing weapon found as treasure has
a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM’s choice stored in it.
Activate [one-action] command; Requirements On your previous action
this turn, you hit and damaged a creature with this weapon;
Effect You unleash the stored spell, which uses the target of
the triggering attack as the target of the spell. This empties the
spell from the weapon and allows a spell to be cast into it again.
If the spell requires a spell attack roll, the result of your attack
roll with the weapon determines the degree of success of the
spell, and if the spell requires a saving throw, the DC is 30.

spell. This frees the weapon to have a new spell cast into it.

the weapon; Effect The target takes persistent bleed damage
equal to 1d8 per weapon damage die of the etched weapon.

jabberwock, vorpal weapons prove equally effective against
nearly any foe with a head.

a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon, critically succeed,
and deal slashing damage. The target must have a head;
Effect The target must succeed at a DC 37 Fortitude save or
be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don’t
require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this
usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
WOUNDING
RUNE 7
MAGICAL
 NECROMANCY
Price 340 gp
Usage etched onto a piercing or slashing melee weapon
Weapons with wounding runes are said to thirst for blood.
When you hit a creature with a wounding weapon, you deal an
extra 1d6 persistent bleed damage. On a critical hit, it instead
deals 1d12 persistent bleed damage.

Specific Shields
These shields have unique abilities that differentiate them
from their typical counterparts.
ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD
ITEM 11
ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 1,350 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
This wooden shield (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) is carved with
images of overlapping fletched arrows.
Activate [reaction] Interact; Trigger A ranged weapon Strike targets
a creature within 15 feet of you when you have this shield
raised, and the attacker has not yet rolled their attack; Effect
The triggering Strike targets you instead of its normal target.
If it hits, you gain the effects of the Shield Block reaction.
DRAGONSLAYER’S SHIELD
ITEM 9
UNCOMMON
 ABJURATION
 MAGICAL
Price 670 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
A dragonslayer’s shield is a steel shield covered with
dragonhide from a certain type of dragon, which distinguishes
each shield from the others. While raised, this steel shield
(Hardness 8, HP 32, BT 16) grants its circumstance bonus to
Reflex saves against area effects (as well as to AC, as normal).
While you hold the shield, it also grants you a +2 circumstance
bonus to Will saves against a dragon’s frightful presence
ability. The shield has resistance 10 against the damage type
corresponding to the type of dragon whose hide was used in
its creation (see dragonhide on page 579); this applies after
reducing the damage for Hardness, so when you use Shield
Block, the dragonslayer’s shield takes 18 less damage from
attacks of that damage type. You can use Shield Block against
attacks that deal damage of that type.
Craft Requirements The initial raw materials must include at
least 30 gp of dragonhide.
FLOATING SHIELD
ITEM 11+
UNCOMMON
 MAGICAL
Usage strapped to 1 hand; Bulk L
A floating shield is usually carved with wing motifs. This
buckler (Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12) can protect you on its own.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency once per day; Effect The
shield magically releases itself and floats off your arm into
the air next to you, granting you its bonus automatically, as
if you had Raised the Shield. Because you’re not wielding the
shield, you can’t use reactions such as Shield Block with the
shield, but you gain its benefits even when using both of your
hands. After 1 minute, the shield drops to the ground, ending
its floating effect. While the shield is adjacent to you, you can
Interact to grasp it, ending its floating effect early.

Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
The religious symbol of Torag, the forge god—an ornate hammer
of dwarven construction—adorns the face of this steel shield
(Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12). The shield is a religious symbol
of Torag.
You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance
5 while you have the shield raised. When used
for a Shield Block, the forge warden rings
out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith,
and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires
of a furnace.

melee Strike with it as part of the same action. The shield’s
biting maw is a martial melee weapon that deals 2d6 piercing
damage and has the deadly 1d6 trait; it can’t be enhanced by
runes. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, during which
time you can Strike with it each time you Raise the Shield, as
well as with a Strike action.
REFLECTING SHIELD

ITEM 7
EVOCATION
 MAGICAL
Price 360 gp
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk 1
Five jagged spines project from the surface of this steel shield
(Hardness 6, HP 24, BT 12). The spines are +1 striking shield
spikes. When you use the Shield Block reaction with this
shield, the spines take the damage before the shield itself
does. When the shield would take damage (after
applying Hardness), one spine snaps off per
6 damage, reducing the damage by 6. The
shield takes any remaining damage. When
there are no spines left, the shield takes
damage as normal.
When all the spines are gone, you
lose the ability to attack with them until
the spines regenerate the next day.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You shoot
one of the shield’s spines at a target. A
fired spine uses the spikes’ statistics, but it is
a martial ranged weapon with a range increment
of 120 feet.

Snares
Snares are small annoyances and simple traps you can
create using the Crafting skill if you have the Snare
Crafting feat (page 266). Creating a snare requires a
snare kit (page 291) and an amount of raw materials
worth the amount listed in the snare’s Price entry. Unlike
other items, found snares cannot be collected or sold in
their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.
Crafting Snares
A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Once
constructed, it can’t be moved without destroying
(and often triggering) the snare.
You must have the Snare Crafting feat to create snares.
You can spend 1 minute to Craft a snare at its listed Price.
If you want to Craft a snare at a discount, you must
spend downtime as described in the Craft activity.
Some snares have additional requirements beyond
those stated in the Craft activity; these snares list
their requirements in a Craft Requirements entry.
Detecting Snares
Creatures can detect snares as they would any
trap or hazard (as described on page 520), using
the creator’s Crafting DC as the snare’s Stealth
DC. As you become better at creating snares,
your snares become harder to detect by those
with lesser ability. If you are an expert in
Crafting, only a creature that is trained in
Perception  can find  your snares; if you are
a master in Crafting, only a creature that is an
expert in  Perception can find your snares; and if you are
legendary in Crafting, only a creature that is a master in
Perception can find your snares.
If your proficiency rank is expert or better in Crafting,
only creatures actively searching can find your snares.
Triggering Snares
Unless stated otherwise in a snare’s description, when a
Small or larger creature enters a snare’s square, the snare’s
effect occurs and then the snare is destroyed.
Disabling Snares
Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much like
it can other physical traps, using the Disable a Device action
of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of the snare’s
creator as the DC. As you become better at creating snares,
your snares become harder to disable by those with lesser
ability. If you are an expert in Crafting, only a creature that
is trained in Thievery can disable them; if you are a master
in Crafting, only a creature that is an expert in Thievery can
disable them; and if you are legendary in Crafting, only a
creature that is a master in Thievery can disable them.
You can automatically disarm a snare that you
personally Crafted without triggering it by spending an
Interact action while adjacent to the snare.
ALARM SNARE
SNARE 1
AUDITORY
 CONSUMABLE
 MECHANICAL
 SNARE
 TRAP
Price 3 gp
You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy
objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an
alarm snare, you designate a range between 100 to 500 feet
at which it can be heard. When a Small or larger creature
enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that
it can be heard by all creatures in the range you designated.
BITING SNARE

BLEEDING SPINES SNARE
SNARE 12
CONSUMABLE
 MECHANICAL
 SNARE
 TRAP
Price 320 gp
When a creature enters the square, spines
covered in numerous jagged thorns protrude
out to stab it, dealing 8d8 piercing damage and 2d8
persistent bleed damage. The creature must attempt a DC 31
basic Reflex saving throw. After the initial trigger, the spines
retract and protrude again repeatedly for 1 minute, forcing any
creature that enters the space or ends its turn in the space to
attempt a Reflex save against the spines’ damage.
BOMB SNARE
SNARE 8
CONSUMABLE
 MECHANICAL
 SNARE
 TRAP
Price 75 gp
You create a snare that catalyzes three 3rd-level moderate
alchemical bombs of the same type to explode when a creature
enters the snare’s square. The target and all creatures in adjacent
squares must attempt a DC 26 Reflex save, as the snare deals
damage equal to three times the direct hit damage from one
of the component bombs (for example, 6d6 electricity damage
from bottled lightning) with no splash damage or other effects.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and no other effects.
Failure The creature takes full damage. It also takes all other
effects of a direct hit from one of the component bombs
(such as flat-footed from bottled lightning or persistent
damage from an acid flask).
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, plus all
other effects of a direct hit (as failure).
Craft Requirements Supply six of the same damaging 3rd-level
moderate alchemical bomb.

 SNARE
 TRAP
Price 15 gp

================================================================================

Staves
A magical staff is an indispensable accessory for an elite
spellcaster. A staff is tied to one person during a preparation
process, after which the preparer, and only the preparer, can
harness the staff to cast a variety of spells throughout the
day. The spells that can be cast from a staff are listed in
bullet points organized by level under each version of the
staff. Many staves can be found in multiple versions, with
more powerful versions that contain more spells and can
hold more charges—such a staff always contains the spells
of all lower-level versions, in addition to the spells listed in
its own entry. All magical staves have the staff trait.
Casting Spells from a Staff
A staff gains charges when someone prepares it for the day.
The person who prepared a staff can expend the charges to
cast spells from it. You can Cast a Spell from a staff only if
you have that spell on your spell list, are able to cast spells
of the appropriate level, and expend a number of charges
from the staff equal to the spell’s level. Casting a Spell from
a staff requires holding the staff (typically in one hand) and
Activating the staff by Casting the Spell, which takes the
spell’s normal number of actions.
Use your spell attack roll and spell DC when Casting a
Spell from a staff. The spell gains the appropriate trait for
your magical tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal)
and can be affected by any modifications you can
normally make when casting spells, such as metamagic
feats. You must provide any material components, cost,
or focus required by the spell, or you fail to cast it.
Prepared spellcasters and spontaneous spellcasters
each have a unique way of altering how their staves gain
charges and the ways they can be used (see the Prepared
Spellcasters and Spontaneous Spellcasters sections below).
Casting Cantrips from a Staff
If a staff contains a cantrip, you can cast that cantrip using
the staff without expending any charges. The cantrip’s
level is heightened to the same level as cantrips you cast.
Preparing a Staff
During your daily preparations, you can prepare a staff to
add charges to it for free. When you do so, that staff gains a
number of charges equal to the highest level of spell you’re
able to cast. You don’t need to expend any spells to add
charges in this way. No one can prepare more than one
staff per day, nor can a staff be prepared by more than one
person per day. If the charges aren’t used within 24 hours,
they’re lost, and preparing the staff anew removes any
charges previously stored in it. You can prepare a staff only
if you have at least one of the staff’s spells on your spell list.
Prepared Spellcasters
A prepared spellcaster—such as a cleric, druid, or wizard—
can place some of their own magic in a staff to increase its
number of charges. When a prepared spellcaster prepares a
staff, they can expend a spell slot to add a number of charges
to the staff equal to the level of the spell. They can’t expend
more than one spell in this way each day. For example, if
Ezren can cast 3rd-level spells and prepared a staff, the staff
would gain 3 charges, but Ezren could increase this to 6
by expending one of his 3rd-level spells, 5 by expending a
2nd‑level spell, or 4 by expending a 1st-level spell.
Spontaneous Spellcasters
A spontaneous spellcaster, such as a bard or sorcerer, can
reduce the number of charges it takes to Activate a staff by
supplementing with their own energy. When a spontaneous
spellcaster Activates a staff, they can expend 1 charge from
the staff and one of their spell slots to cast a spell from the
staff of the same level (or lower) as the expended spell slot.
This doesn’t change the number of actions it takes to cast
the spell. For example, if Seoni can cast 3rd-level spells and
prepared a staff, the staff would gain 3 charges. She could
expend 1 charge and one of her 3rd-level spell slots to cast
a 3rd-level spell from the staff, or 1 charge and one of her
2nd-level spell slots to cast a 2nd-level spell from the staff.
She could still expend 3 charges from the staff to cast a 3rd-
level spell from it without using any of her own slots, just
like any other spellcaster.
Attacking with a Staff
Staves are also staff weapons (page 280), included in their
Price. They can be etched with runes as normal for a staff.
This doesn’t alter any of their spellcasting abilities.

Structures
These items create structures of significant size, typically
by growing from their more manageable, normal forms.
All these items have the structure trait, described in the
sidebar below.
EXPLORER’S YURT
ITEM 10
CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
 STRUCTURE
Price 880 gp
Bulk 1 (when not activated)
Before activation, this item appears to be nothing more than a
simple rolled-up tent, barely large enough to fit four Medium
creatures. Despite attempts to clean it, the tent is perpetually
smudged with dirt in various places.
Activate (10 minutes) Interact; Frequency once per
day; Effect The rolled-up tent expands into a spacious yurt
complete with a fire pit, 10 bedrolls, various cooking utensils,
and basic food and water.
The yurt can house and feed you and up to nine other
Medium creatures that eat roughly as much as a human does;
they need not attempt a Survival check to Subsist when you
use the yurt. Fires and light inside the yurt do not extend
illumination into the area surrounding the yurt, making it
harder to spot from a distance.
A large loop of red cloth hangs from one wall. If this loop
is pulled, which takes an Interact action, the entire yurt
immediately folds back up into its deactivated form, ready for
further travel.
INSTANT FORTRESS
ITEM 16
UNCOMMON
CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
 STRUCTURE
Price 9,300 gp
Bulk L (when not activated)
This metal cube is small enough to fit in your palm. Close
inspection reveals fine lines in the dark gray metal, as though
the cube were folded thousands of times.
Activate [three-actions] command, Interact; Effect You toss the
cube on the ground, and it immediately unfolds into an
adamantine fortress.
The fortress is 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with adamantine
stairs leading up to three sets of battlements at heights of 10
feet and 20 feet and at the top. Arrow slits along the lower
battlements and crenelations at the top provide standard cover
to anyone within the fortress. There’s no roof, leaving an open,
10-foot-square vertical shaft through the center of the structure.
As a magical structure, the fortress has the structure trait.
Because it expands outward, the fortress can’t catch creatures
inside it as a magical structure normally does. Instead, it pushes
those creatures back. It can’t push a creature into a surface or
hazard this way, and stops expanding if that would happen.
The fortress has a single door in the center of one wall on
the ground level, and the door appears directly in front of
you when you activate the fortress. Provided you’re within
100 feet of the door, you can cause the door to open or slam
shut and lock by spending a single action to issue a verbal
command, which has the auditory trait. The DC to Force Open
the door or Pick its Lock is 40.
You can instantly return the instant fortress to its cube form
by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which
has the auditory trait. Once deactivated, the fortress can’t be
activated again for 4 hours.
If the fortress becomes damaged, it can be repaired
only with a remake spell or by someone who is legendary
at Crafting.
POCKET STAGE
ITEM 5
CONJURATION
 MAGICAL
 STRUCTURE
Price 138 gp
Bulk L (when not activated)
This item appears to be a miniature replica of a theater.
It includes a small pocket full of minute set dressing and
costumed paper dolls.
Activate (1 minute) command, envision, Interact; Effect You
place the miniature theater on the ground, filling it with any
set dressing and up to six figures you choose. Then, you tap
a rhythm on the miniature, causing it to grow into a modest
stage 20 feet wide and 15 feet deep. It’s dressed with the
decorations you selected, and simple mannequins wear the
costumes you chose. A wooden proscenium arch frames the
stage, and simple curtains along the sides conceal the wings.
As a magical structure, the stage has the structure trait.
All the stage’s set dressing is illusory and disappears if
taken more than 20 feet from the stage. The costumes are
physical but with illusory embellishments that fade at the
same range, revealing only plain, white smocks.
THE STRUCTURE TRAIT
An item with the structure trait creates a magical building
or other structure when activated. The item must be
activated on a plot of land free of other structures.
The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting
the structural requirements for being built there. The
structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or
spires of rock, but it can’t be created on water or other
nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or
other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the
structure’s foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If
an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable
surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors,
roll a DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure
begins to sink or collapse.
The structure doesn’t harm creatures within the area
when it appears, and it can’t be created within a crowd or
in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently
caught inside the structure when the item is activated
ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and
always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the
structure when the activation ends isn’t harmed, and it
lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level
of the structure.
Core Rulebook

PAGE 598
================================================================================

Wands
Short, slender items typically made of wood, wands let you
cast a specific spell without expending a spell slot. They can
be used once per day, but can be overcharged to attempt
to cast them again at great risk. Each wand holds a spell
of a certain level, determined when the wand is created.
Cantrips, focus spells, and rituals can’t be placed in wands.
If you find a wand, you can try to figure out what
spell is in it. If the spell is a common spell from your
spell list or is a spell you know, you can use a single
Recall Knowledge action and automatically succeed.
If it’s not, you must Identify Magic (page 238).
Casting Spells from a Wand
A wand contains a spell that can be cast once per day.
Casting a spell from a wand requires holding the wand
in one hand and activating the item with a Cast a Spell
activity using the normal number of actions for the spell.
To cast a spell from a wand, it must be on your spell
list. Because you’re the one casting the spell, use your spell
attack roll and spell DC. The spell is of your tradition.
A spell cast from a wand doesn’t require physical
material components, but you must replace any
material component normally required to cast the spell
with a somatic component. If the spell requires a focus,
you must still have that focus to cast the spell from a
wand, and if the spell has a cost, you must still pay that
cost to cast the spell from a wand.
Overcharging a Wand
After the spell is cast from the wand for the day, you can
attempt to cast it one more time—overcharging the wand
at the risk of destroying it. Cast the Spell again, then roll
a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the wand is broken.
On a failure, the wand is destroyed. If anyone tries to
overcharge a wand when it’s already been overcharged
that day, the wand is automatically destroyed (even if it
had been repaired) and no spell is cast.
Wand Statistics
A wand’s base statistics are the same unless noted
otherwise in a special wand. It has light Bulk, and must
be held in one hand to be activated. Each wand contains
a specific level of the spell. When you activate a wand, you
can only cast the spell at the specified level, but you can
craft a wand with a heightened version of a spell.
Varying Statistics
Each type of wand has a Level and Price determined by the
spell’s level. The wand’s rarity matches the spell’s rarity.
The item’s traits also vary, based on the spell. A wand has
any traits listed in its stat block (usually just magical and
wand), plus any traits of the spell stored on it.
Crafting a Wand
For the most part, the process to Craft a wand is like that to
Craft any other magic item. When you begin the crafting
process, choose a spell to put into the wand. You have
to either cast that spell during the process, or someone
else must do so in your presence. That spell doesn’t have
its normal effects; instead, the magic is captured inside the
wand. The caster doesn’t need to pay any cost of the spell.
The casting must come from a spellcaster expending a
spell slot. You can’t make a wand from a spell that comes
from another magic item, for example.
Magic Wand
The simplest form of wand contains a spell, with Price
and level based on that spell. The wand has the magical
and wand traits, as well as the traits the spell has. The
name of a magic wand with a spell in it is simply “wand
of,” followed by the spell’s name.

Weapons
Weapons can be crafted from precious materials or infused
with magic to grant them powerful and unusual abilities.
Precious Material Weapons
Weapons made of precious materials are more expensive
and sometimes have special effects. You can make metal
weapons out of any of these materials except darkwood,
and wooden weapons out of darkwood. To determine the
Price of 10 pieces of ammunition, use the base Price for a
single weapon, without adding any extra for Bulk.

magic property runes instead of three.
Due to orichalcum’s temporal properties,

an orichalcum weapon costs half the normal Price
(though transferring the rune to a weapon made
of another material requires you to first pay the
remaining Price and then pay the cost to transfer).

etch any property runes onto a specific weapon that it
doesn’t already have.

to attack a creature you’re undetected by, you deal 1d6

Worn Items
This section includes magic items you wear. Most have the
invested trait, which means you can wear no more than 10
(page 531). Worn items include the following subcategories,
with special rules appearing at the start of the section.
•	 Apex Items on this page.
•	 Companion Items on page 604.
•	 Other Worn Items on page 604.
Apex Items
When you Invest an Item that has the
apex trait, it improves one of your ability
scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18,
whichever grants the higher score. This gives you all the
benefits of the new ability score until the investiture runs
out: increasing Intelligence lets you become trained in an
additional skill and learn a new language,
increasing Constitution gives you more
Hit Points, and so on.
An apex item grants this benefit only
the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour
period, and you can benefit from only one
apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item
when you already have one invested, you don’t
gain the ability score increase, though you
do gain any other effects of Investing
the Item.

you confused, fascinated, or stupefied; Effect The
headband of inspired wisdom clears your mind. You can
reroll the saving throw and use the better result.
Companion Items
You might want to acquire items that benefit an animal
or beast that assists you. These items have the companion
trait, meaning they function only for animal companions,
familiars, and similar creatures. If it’s unclear whether a
creature can benefit from such an item, the GM decides.
Investing Companion Items
Any worn companion item needs to be invested. However,
your companion needs to invest it rather than you
doing so. This requires you to use the Invest an Item
activity alongside your companion. A companion has an
investiture limit of two items (instead of the 10-item limit
a player character has).

for as long as you are using your animal companion’s senses.

ITEM 1+
UNCOMMON
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn; Bulk —
Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones
have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to
discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and
functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the
universe in primeval times.
When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the
stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body.
You can stow an aeon stone with an Interact action, and an
orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful
Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains
invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to
orbit your head again.
There are various types of aeon stones, each with
a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each
aeon stone also gains a resonant power when
slotted into a special magical item called a
wayfinder (page 617).
Type clear spindle; Level 7; Price 325 gp
You don’t need to eat or drink while this aeon
stone is invested by you. This aeon stone doesn’t
function until it has been worn continuously for a
week and invested each day therein. If it’s invested by
someone else, this interval starts over.
The resonant power allows you to cast air bubble as a
primal innate spell once per day.
Type dull gray; Level 1; Price 9 gp
A dull gray aeon stone has lost its special magical properties,
sometimes as a result of overusing a tourmaline sphere or
pale lavender ellipsoid aeon stone. It still orbits your head
like any other aeon stone and can thus serve as a stylish,
hands-free option for various spells that target an object, like
continual flame.
Dull gray aeon stones have no resonant power.
Type gold nodule; Level 6; Price 230 gp
When a gold nodule aeon stone is created, its creator chooses
a language they know to store within the crystal. When you
invest the stone, you gain the ability to understand, speak,
and write that language.
The resonant power allows you to cast comprehend
language as an occult innate spell once per day.
Type
lavender
and
green
ellipsoid; Level 19; Price
30,000 gp
This functions as a pale lavender
ellipsoid aeon stone, but it casts an 8th-
level dispel magic spell with a counteract
modifier of +31.
The resonant power allows you to cast detect magic
and read aura as arcane innate spells at will.
Type orange prism; Level 16; Price 9,750 gp
An orange prism aeon stone must be activated to provide a
benefit. The resonant power grants you a +2 item bonus to
Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks—whichever
corresponds to the tradition of the last spell you enhanced
with this aeon stone.
Activate [one-action] envision; Effect If your next action is to Cast a
Spell, that spell’s level is 1 higher (maximum 10th level) for the
purposes of counteracting and being counteracted.
Type pale lavender ellipsoid; Level 13; Price 2,200 gp
This aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The
resonant power allows you to cast the read aura cantrip as an
arcane innate spell.
Activate [reaction] envision; Frequency once per day; Trigger A
spell targets you; Effect The stone casts a 6th-level dispel
magic spell in an attempt to counteract the triggering spell,
with a counteract modifier of +22. This can be used only on
spells that specifically target you—not area spells that don’t
have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all
targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you.
Each time you activate this aeon stone, attempt
a DC 5 flat check. On a failure, the stone
permanently turns into a dull gray aeon stone.
Type pink rhomboid; Level 12; Price 1,900 gp
When you invest this stone, you gain 15
temporary Hit Points. If the stone’s effects are
suppressed, you lose any of the temporary Hit
Points remaining until it returns. The temporary
Hit Points refresh during your daily preparations;
they do not refresh if you re-invest the stone, or
invest another pink rhomboid aeon stone, before then.
The resonant power allows you to cast the stabilize cantrip
as a divine innate spell.
Type tourmaline sphere; Level 7; Price 350 gp
When you would die from the dying condition (typically at
dying 4), this aeon stone automatically activates and reduces
your dying value to 1 less than would normally kill you
(typically to dying 3). The stone then permanently turns into
a dull gray aeon stone. You can benefit from this ability only
once per day, even if you have multiple such stones.
The resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level heal as a
divine innate spell once per day.

================================================================================

This item consists of two magically linked rings: an
intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and
a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in
the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon’s fundamental
runes are replicated onto any melee weapon you
wield in the hand wearing the iron ring. (The
fundamental runes are weapon potency
and striking, which add an item bonus
to attack rolls and extra weapon
damage dice, respectively.) Any
fundamental runes on the
weapon in the hand wearing
the iron ring are suppressed.
The replication functions only
if you wear both rings, and it ends as
soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in
one of your hands. Consequently, the benefit
doesn’t apply to thrown attacks or if you’re
holding a weapon but not wielding it
(such as holding in one hand a weapon
that requires two hands to wield).
Type doubling rings; Level 3; Price 50 gp
Type greater doubling rings; Level 11; Price
1,300 gp
The rings also replicate property runes from the weapon in
the gold-ringed hand, so long as the weapon in the iron-ringed
hand meets all the prerequisites for a given rune and is not
a specific weapon. The weapon in the iron-ringed hand gains
the benefits of those runes. All its own runes are suppressed.
When you invest the rings, you can elect for the rings to
transfer only fundamental runes, in which case they function
as standard doubling rings.

HANDWRAPS OF MIGHTY BLOWS
ITEM 2+
INVESTED
 MAGICAL
 TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn gloves; Bulk —
As you invest these embroidered strips of cloth, you must
meditate and slowly wrap them around your hands. These
handwraps have weapon runes etched into them to give your
unarmed attacks the benefits of those runes, making your
unarmed attacks work like magic weapons. For example, +1
striking handwraps of mighty blows would give you a +1 item
bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase
the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die
to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have
a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed
attacks, use two of that die size instead).
You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and
from the handwraps just as you would for a
weapon, and you can attach talismans to the
handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee
weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk
for these purposes. Property runes apply only
when they would be applicable to the unarmed
attack you’re using. For example, a property that
must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn’t function when
you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you
attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.
The entries below list the most typical combinations of
fundamental runes.

your mental commands effortlessly.
When using this apparatus, you gain a +3 item bonus

you reduce the minimum time required to Craft an item to
1 day. If you succeed at your Crafting check and spend more
downtime to continue work on the item after the minimum

your proficiency rank in Crafting; on a critical success, each

 HEALING  INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Usage worn backpack; Bulk L
This sturdy leather satchel contains three compartments
fastened with large clasps. The first compartment is lined in
blue satin and contains an extradimensional space equivalent
to a type II bag of holding.
The second compartment has no lining. You can pull forth
cookware and cooking utensils from it. Once they have been
used to prepare a meal, the items transform into plates and
silverware, and they evaporate once the meal has been eaten,
taking any leftovers with them. The cookware reappears
cleaned in the compartment 1 hour later. The compartment
provides only kitchenware, not any food.
The third compartment is lined
with plush purple velvet and
contains berry tarts wrapped in
parchment paper. A creature can unwrap
and eat one tart with an Interact action
to regain 2d8+4 Hit Points. The knapsack
produces four tarts per day, which appear
at breakfast time. Any tarts not eaten by
the end of the day evaporate.

The berry tarts each restore 4d8+8 Hit Points,
and the bag has two additional compartments,
each of which can be Activated with an Interact action.
The fourth compartment is lined in golden velvet. Once
per day, you can draw a lucky magic sling bullet from this
compartment. If you attack with this sling bullet, you roll twice
and use the better result on your attack roll and your damage
roll. This is a fortune effect. The stone becomes non-magical
if not hurled by the end of your turn. Once activated, this
compartment stitches itself shut until the next day.
The bag’s fifth compartment is lined in black wool. Once per
day, you can unfold this compartment into a 5-foot-diameter
portal on the ground. The first person to Step into the portal
from an adjacent square is teleported away. This has the same
effect as an 5th-level dimension door spell, except the affected
creature takes the knapsack with them. When the portal is
used, or at the start of your next turn if it hasn’t been used,

Usage worn; Bulk —
This string of beads appears to be a hemp string with lustrous
red beads of various sizes hanging from it. When activated,

spheres attached by fine threads.
Numerous varieties of the necklace of fireballs exist. Each
has a different basic Reflex save DC and includes a combination
of spheres dealing different amounts of damage, as listed for
each type below. When all the beads are gone, the necklace
becomes a non-magical hemp string.
Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You detach a sphere from the
necklace, causing it to glow with orange light. After you
activate a sphere, if you or anyone else hurls it (an Interact
action with the ranged trait), it detonates as a fireball where it
lands. Your toss can place the center of the fireball anywhere
within 70 feet, though at the GM’s discretion you might
need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually
challenging. If no one hurls the sphere by the start of
your next turn, it turns into a non-magical red bead.

ITEM 10
UNCOMMON
 ABJURATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 925 gp
Usage worn; Bulk —
This ornate silver ring bears two competing geometric designs
of brightly colored and wildly clashing inlaid gemstones. A
spellcaster can cast a single spell into this ring as long as no
spell is currently stored within, expending the normal time,
costs, and so forth to Cast the Spell. The spell’s effect doesn’t
occur; the spell’s power is instead stored within the ring.
When you invest a ring of counterspells, you immediately
know the name and level of the spell stored inside, if any. A
ring of counterspells found as treasure has a 50% chance of
having a spell stored in it. The GM determines that spell.
Activate [reaction] envision; Trigger You are targeted by or within
the area of the spell stored within the ring; Effect You can
attempt to counteract the triggering spell, using the level of
the spell stored in the ring and a counteract modifier of +19.

 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Usage worn; Bulk —
This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances
your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds. You can
use an Interact action to pull a set of thieves’ tools from the
ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the

a Lock, and the ring’s insights grant you the same bonus to
Crafting checks to Craft and Repair snares and traps.

RING OF WIZARDRY
ITEM 7+
UNCOMMON
 ARCANE
 DIVINATION
 INVESTED
Usage worn; Bulk —
This ring is made from the purest platinum and
is covered in esoteric arcane symbols. It does
nothing unless you have a spellcasting class feature
with the arcane tradition. While wearing the ring of
wizardry, you gain a +1 item bonus to Arcana checks and
have two additional 1st-level arcane spell slots each day. You
prepare spells in these slots or cast from them spontaneously,
just as you normally cast your spells.
If you take off the ring for any reason, you lose the
additional spell slots. You can’t gain spell slots from more
than one ring of wizardry per day, nor can a single
ring of wizardry grant spell slots more than once
per day.
If you can cast arcane spells in a variety of
different ways (such as if you are a draconic
bloodline sorcerer with the wizard multiclass
archetype), you can divide the spell slots as you
wish among your various sources of arcane spells.
Type I; Level 7; Price 360 gp
Type II; Level 10; Price 1,000 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 2nd-level spell slots
and one 1st-level spell slot.
Type III; Level 12; Price 2,000 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 3rd-level spell slots
and one 2nd-level spell slot.
Type IV; Level 14; Price 4,500 gp
The bonus is +2, and the ring grants two 4th-level spell slots
and one 3rd-level spell slot.

the arcane tradition.
ROBE OF EYES

 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 13,000 gp
Usage worn garment; Bulk 1
This garment appears to be an ordinary robe until donned, at
which point numerous strange and alien eyes of varied shapes
and colors open and blink across its fabric. While wearing the
robe, you gain a +3 item bonus to Perception checks, and
you constantly benefit from the effects of a 2nd-level see
invisibility spell.
You can also see powerful magic auras. The highest-level
magic aura within 30 feet of you glows in a color that reveals
its school to you and allows you to determine where the effect
originates. This can narrow down the origin point of the effect
to a 5-foot-cube, but not more precisely than that.

The robe of eyes is not without its dangers. If any spell
with the light trait is cast on you or your square while you
are wearing the robe, you are blinded for a number of rounds
equal to the spell’s level unless you succeed at a Fortitude
save against the spell’s DC.

ROBE OF THE ARCHMAGI
ITEM 15+
UNCOMMON
 ABJURATION
 ARCANE
 INVESTED
Usage worn garment; Bulk 1
Embroidered with fine silver thread in ornate arcane patterns,
these robes come in one of three colors depending on their
attuned alignment. Good robes are white, neutral robes are
gray, and evil robes are black. An evil or good robe gains the
appropriate trait. The robes benefit only characters who can
cast arcane spells and whose alignment on the good-evil
axis matches that of the robe. If your alignment does
not match that of the robe, or you are not an arcane
spellcaster, you are instead stupefied 2 while
wearing a robe of the archmagi. This condition
can’t be removed in any way until you
remove the robe.
The robes are +2 greater resilient
explorer’s clothing, and they grant a +1
circumstance bonus to saving throws
against arcane spells and resistance 5 to
damage from arcane spells.
Activate [reaction] command; Frequency
once per day; Trigger You attempt a
saving throw against an arcane spell,
but you haven’t rolled yet; Effect You

The resistance against arcane spells is 10.
You can activate the robe when you or an ally
within 30 feet attempts a saving throw against
an arcane spell, and the robe grants either you
or the ally a success on the triggering saving
throw; you still can activate it only once per day.
Craft Requirements You are an arcane spellcaster.
SLIPPERS OF SPIDER CLIMBING

Price 325 gp
Usage worn shoes; Bulk L
These soft slippers are made of fine gray silk. If the slippers
are left unattended for a while, they tend to attract spiders
that nest inside.
Activate [one-action] command; Frequency once per hour; Effect
Tiny, hairlike tendrils extend from the slippers’ soles, allowing
you to walk on vertical surfaces or even to move upside down
along ceilings. For 1 minute, you gain a 20-foot
climb Speed and you don’t need to use
your hands to Climb. However, the
slippers require decent traction for
you to walk on a wall, so they provide
no benefit when you’re moving across
greased, icy, or oiled surfaces.
THIRD EYE
ITEM 19
DIVINATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 40,000 gp
Usage worn; Bulk —
When invested, this ornate crown and its incandescent
gemstone meld into your head and take the form of a tattoo.

auras. No one but you can manipulate the third eye while it’s
invested by you. Your heightened senses and ability to
sense emotional auras grant you a +3 item bonus to
Perception checks.
You continuously see magic auras, as a 9th-
level detect magic spell, except you see the
location of all auras within 30 feet, not
just the strongest. If you use a Seek
action to study a creature you can see,
you can perceive an aura that conveys
knowledge of that creature’s health,
including all conditions and afflictions it
has and an approximate percentage of its
remaining Hit Points.

VOYAGER’S PACK
ITEM 17
UNCOMMON
 CONJURATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 14,800 gp
Usage worn backpack; Bulk —
This leather rucksack has icons burned into it,
and every time it’s taken to a plane it hasn’t
been to before, a new icon representing that
plane scorches into the surface. The pack
grants you a +3 bonus to Survival checks.
It also enables you to see the magical traces
of creatures’ passage, allowing you to Track a
creature that has teleported. The GM sets the DC
of this check, usually using the level and DC of the
teleportation spell. This lets you find the location of the
creature’s destination, and you can use that destination
when casting teleport or activating the pack, even though you
don’t know what it looks like.
The pack contains an extradimensional space with the
same properties as a type II bag of holding. This space
contains the contents of a climber’s kit. If any components
of that kit are removed and not returned, they return to the
pack at dawn each day.
Activate 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact);
Effect  As you activate the pack, you can harness up to
four willing creatures to the ropes on the pack. At the end
of the activation time, the pack casts a 7th-level plane shift
or teleport spell, transporting you and everyone attached
to the pack. Attempt a DC 45 Survival check. On a success,
you arrive 25 miles off target using plane shift or halve the
distance you’re off-target with teleport. On a critical success,
you arrive exactly on target.
WAYFINDER
ITEM 2
UNCOMMON
 EVOCATION
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 28 gp
Usage worn; Bulk —
This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw
fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called
aeon stones. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the
Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers
of any stripe. A wayfinder functions as a compass.
An indentation in the middle of the wayfinder can hold a
single aeon stone (page 604). Placing an aeon stone in this
indentation provides you all the benefits of having the aeon
stone orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being
noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a wayfinder and the
aeon stone within it simultaneously, and they count as only
one item toward your investiture limit. An invested aeon stone
slotted in a wayfinder also grants its resonant power.
If you have more than one wayfinder with
an invested aeon stone on your person at a
given time, destructive interference from
their resonance prevents you from gaining
benefits from any of them. You can
still benefit from additional aeon stones
orbiting your head, just not in wayfinders.
Activate [one-action] command; Effect The wayfinder is
targeted by a 1st-level light spell.
WHISPER OF THE FIRST LIE ITEM 20
RARE
 ENCHANTMENT
 INVESTED
 MAGICAL
Price 60,000 gp
Usage worn; Bulk —
This delicate necklace contains
bottled whispers distilled from a
source on the Astral Plane rumored to
be connected to the first lie ever told.
While wearing the necklace, you gain a +3
item bonus to Deception checks, and you can
attempt to counteract effects that would force
you to tell the truth or determine whether you
are lying. Success on this counteract attempt lets
you ignore the effect, rather than removing the effect
entirely. The counteract level is 9, with a counteract
modifier of +35.
Activate [three-actions] Interact, envision, command; Effect
You unstopper the vial and release the lie, creating the
effect of a fabricated truth (DC 47). The vial is emptied and
can never be activated again.
Craft Requirements Supply a casting of fabricated truth.

boots automatically cast feather fall on you. This benefit can’t
trigger again for 10 minutes.
Activate [two-actions] command, Interact; Frequency once per day;
Effect You speak a command word and click the boots’ heels
together to cause the wings to animate and flap rapidly,
granting you a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes.

================================================================================

Core Rulebook
618
Conditions are persistent. Whenever you’re affected by
a condition, its effects last until the condition’s stated
duration ends, the condition is removed, or terms dictated
in the condition itself cause it to end.
Condition Values
Some conditions have a numerical value, called a
condition value, indicated by a numeral following the
condition. This value conveys the severity of a condition,
and such conditions often give you a bonus or penalty
equal to their value. These values can often be reduced by
skills, spells, or simply waiting. If a condition value is ever
reduced to 0, the condition ends.
Overriding Conditions
Some conditions override others. This is always specified
in the entry for the overriding condition. When this
happens, all effects of the overridden condition are
suppressed until the overriding condition ends. The
overridden condition’s duration continues to elapse, and
it might run out while suppressed.
List of Conditions
Blinded
You can’t see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you.
You can’t detect anything using vision. You automatically
critically fail Perception checks that require you to be
able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you
take a –4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are
immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides dazzled.
Broken
Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is
broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points below
its Broken Threshold. A broken object can’t be used for
its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses—with the
exception of armor. Broken armor still grants its item bonus
to AC, but it also imparts a status penalty to AC depending
on its category: –1 for broken light armor, –2 for broken
medium armor, or –3 for broken heavy armor.
A broken item still imposes penalties and limitations
normally incurred by carrying, holding, or wearing  it.
For example, broken armor would still impose its Dexterity
modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth.
If an effect makes an item broken automatically and the
item has more HP than its Broken Threshold, that effect
also reduces the item’s current HP to the Broken Threshold.
Clumsy
Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy
always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal
to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and
DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and
skill checks using Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery.
Concealed
While you are concealed from a creature, such as in a thick
fog, you are difficult for that creature to see. You can still
be observed, but you’re tougher to target. A creature that
you’re concealed from must succeed at a DC 5 flat check
when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect.
Area effects aren’t subject to this flat check. If the check
fails, the attack, spell, or effect doesn’t affect you.
Confused
You don’t have your wits about you, and you attack
wildly. You are flat-footed, you don’t treat anyone as your
ally (though they might still treat you as theirs), and you
can’t Delay, Ready, or use reactions.
You use all your actions to Strike or cast offensive
cantrips, though the GM can have you use other actions
to facilitate attack, such as draw a weapon, move so that a
target is in reach, and so forth. Your targets are determined
randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets,
you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a
critical hit. If it’s impossible for you to attack or cast spells,
you babble incoherently, wasting your actions.
Each time you take damage from an attack or spell,
you can attempt a DC 11 flat check to recover from your
confusion and end the condition.
Controlled
Someone else is making your decisions for you, usually
because you’re being commanded or magically dominated.
The controller dictates how you act and can make you
use any of your actions, including attacks, reactions, or
even Delay. The controller usually does not have to spend
their own actions when controlling you.
Conditions Appendix
While adventuring, characters (and sometimes their belongings) are affected by abilities and
effects that apply conditions. For example, a spell or magic item might turn you invisible or
cause you to be gripped by fear. Conditions change your state of being in some way, and they
represent everything from the attitude other creatures have toward you and how they interact
with you to what happens when a creature drains your blood or life essence.

Dazzled
Your eyes are overstimulated. If vision is your only precise
sense, all creatures and objects are concealed from you.
Deafened
You can’t hear. You automatically critically fail Perception
checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a
–2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and
checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses. If
you perform an action with the auditory trait, you must
succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt
the check after spending the action but before any effects
are applied. You are immune to auditory effects.
Doomed
A powerful force has gripped your soul, calling you
closer to death. Doomed always includes a value. The
dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed
value. If your maximum dying value is reduced to 0, you
instantly die. When you die, you’re no longer doomed.
Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a
full night’s rest.
Drained
When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life
force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes
a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained
value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude
saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your
level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your
maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount.
For example, if you’re hit by an effect that inflicts drained
3 and you’re a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points
and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these
Hit Points doesn’t count as taking damage.
Each time you get a full night’s rest, your drained value
decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points,
but you don’t immediately recover the lost Hit Points.
Dying
You are bleeding out or otherwise at death’s door. While
you have this condition, you are unconscious. Dying always
includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If
you’re dying, you must attempt a recovery check (page 459)
at the start of your turn each round to determine whether
you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1
if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage
from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save.
If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a
recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain
unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that
condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and
wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time
you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1
condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1
if you already have that condition.
GROUPS OF CONDITIONS
Some conditions exist relative to one another or share a
similar theme. It can be useful to look at these conditions
together, rather than viewing them in isolation, to
understand how they interact.
Degrees of Detection: Observed, hidden, undetected,
unnoticed
Senses: Blinded, concealed, dazzled, deafened, invisible
Death and Dying: Doomed, dying, unconscious, wounded
Attitudes: Hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, helpful
Lowered Abilities: Clumsy, drained, enfeebled, stupefied
Encumbered
You are carrying more weight than you can manage.
While you’re encumbered, you’re clumsy 1 and take a
10-foot penalty to all your Speeds. As with all penalties
to your Speed, this can’t reduce your Speed below 5 feet.
Enfeebled
You’re physically weakened. Enfeebled always includes a
value. When you are enfeebled, you take a status penalty
equal to the condition value to Strength-based rolls
and DCs, including Strength-based melee attack rolls,
Strength-based damage rolls, and Athletics checks.
Fascinated
You are compelled to focus your attention on something,
distracting you from whatever else is going on around
you. You take a –2 status penalty to Perception and skill
checks, and you can’t use actions with the concentrate
trait unless they or their intended consequences are
related to the subject of your fascination (as determined
by the GM). For instance, you might be able to Seek
and Recall Knowledge about the subject, but you likely
couldn’t cast a spell targeting a different creature. This
DEATH AND DYING RULES
The doomed, dying, unconscious, and wounded
conditions all relate to the process of coming closer to
death. The full rules are on pages 459–461. The most
significant information not contained in the conditions
themselves is this: When you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points,
you’re knocked out with the following effects:
•	 You immediately move your initiative position to
directly before the creature or effect that reduced you
to 0 Hit Points.
•	 You gain the dying 1 condition. If the effect that
knocked you out was a critical success from the
attacker or the result of your critical failure, you
gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the
wounded condition, increase these values by your
wounded value. If the damage came from a nonlethal
attack or effect, you don’t gain the dying condition—
you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.

PAGE 621
================================================================================

Core Rulebook
620
condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against
you or any of your allies.
Fatigued
You’re tired and can’t summon much energy. You take
a –1  status penalty to AC and saving throws. While
exploring, you can’t choose an exploration activity.
You recover from fatigue after a full night’s rest.
Flat-Footed
You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full
attention on defense. You take a –2 circumstance penalty
to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only
to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others—
especially conditions—can make you universally flat-
footed against everything. If a rule doesn’t specify that the
condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies
to all of them; for example, many effects simply say “The
target is flat-footed.”
Fleeing
You’re forced to run away due to fear or some other
compulsion. On your turn, you must spend each of your
actions trying to escape the source of the fleeing condition
as expediently as possible (such as by using move actions
to flee, or opening doors barring your escape). The source
is usually the effect or caster that gave you the condition,
though some effects might define something else as the
source. You can’t Delay or Ready while fleeing.
Friendly
This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward
a particular character, and it affects only creatures that
are not player characters. A creature that is friendly to a
character likes that character. The character can attempt
to make a Request of a friendly creature, and the friendly
creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that
doesn’t cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of
their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the
creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the
severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.
Frightened
You’re gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves.
The frightened condition always includes a value. You take
a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and
DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your
turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases
by 1.
Grabbed
You’re held in place by another creature, giving you the
flat-footed and immobilized conditions. If you attempt a
manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a
DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending
the action, but before any effects are applied.
Helpful
This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward
a particular character, and it affects only creatures that
are not player characters. A creature that is helpful to a
character wishes to actively aid that character. It will
accept reasonable Requests from that character, as long as
such requests aren’t at the expense of the helpful creature’s
goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies
uses a hostile action against the creature, the creature gains
a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the
hostile action, as determined by the GM.
Hidden
While you’re hidden from a creature, that creature knows
the space you’re in but can’t tell precisely where you are.
You typically become hidden by using Stealth to Hide.
When Seeking a creature using only imprecise senses, it
remains hidden, rather than observed. A creature you’re
hidden from is flat-footed to you, and it must succeed at
a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack,
spell, or other effect or it fails affect you. Area effects aren’t
subject to this flat check.
A creature might be able to use the Seek action to try to
observe you, as described on page 471.
Hostile
This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a
particular character, and it affects only creatures that are not
player characters. A creature that is hostile to a character
actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn’t necessarily
attack, but it won’t accept Requests from the character.
Immobilized
You can’t use any action with the move trait. If you’re
immobilized by something holding you in place and an
external force would move you out of your space, the
force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the
effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually
Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.
Indifferent
This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward a
particular character, and it affects only creatures that are
not player characters. A creature that is indifferent to a
character doesn’t really care one way or the other about
that character. Assume a creature’s attitude to a given
character is indifferent unless specified otherwise.
Invisible
While invisible, you can’t be seen. You’re undetected to
everyone. Creatures can Seek to attempt to detect you; if
a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your
Stealth DC, you become hidden to that creature until
you Sneak to become undetected again. If you become
invisible while someone can already see you, you start
out hidden to the observer (instead of undetected) until

you successfully Sneak. You can’t become observed while
invisible except via special abilities or magic.
Observed
Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature
takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using Stealth
to Hide, it can become hidden or undetected instead of
observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in
addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or
object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature
only with precise senses. When Seeking a creature using only
imprecise senses, it remains hidden, rather than observed.
Paralyzed
Your body is frozen in place. You have the flat-footed
condition and can’t act except to Recall Knowledge and
use actions that require only the use of your mind (as
determined by the GM). Your senses still function, but
only in the areas you can perceive without moving your
body, so you can’t Seek while paralyzed.
Persistent Damage
Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on
fire, or many other situations. It appears as “X persistent
[type] damage,” where “X” is the amount of damage dealt
and “[type]” is the damage type. Instead of taking persistent
damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your
turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage
dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll
a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent
damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.
Petrified
You have been turned to stone. You can’t act, nor can
you sense anything. You become an object with a Bulk
double your normal Bulk (typically 12 for a petrified
Medium creature or 6 for a petrified Small creature), AC 9,
Hardness 8, and the same current Hit Points you had when
alive. You don’t have a Broken Threshold. When you’re
turned back into flesh, you have the same number of Hit
Points you had as a statue. If the statue is destroyed, you
immediately die. While petrified, your mind and body are
in stasis, so you don’t age or notice the passing of time.
Prone
You’re lying on the ground. You are flat-footed and take
a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move
actions you can use while you’re prone are Crawl and
Stand. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can
Take Cover while prone to hunker down and gain cover
against ranged attacks, even if you don’t have an object to
get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against
ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).
If you would be knocked prone while you’re Climbing
or Flying, you fall (see pages 463–464 for the rules on
falling). You can’t be knocked prone when Swimming.
PERSISTENT DAMAGE RULES
The additional rules presented below apply to persistent
damage in certain cases.
Assisted Recovery
You can take steps to help yourself recover from
persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you
to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your
turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and
it must be something that would reasonably improve
your chances (as determined by the GM). For example,
you might try to smother a flame, wash off acid, or use
Medicine to Administer First Aid to stanch bleeding. This
allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately.
The GM decides how your help works, using the
following examples as guidelines.
•	 Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly
appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to
put out flames.
•	 Automatically end the condition due to the type of help,
such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP
to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself
in a lake to end persistent fire damage.
•	 Alter the number of actions required to help you if
the means the helper uses are especially efficient or
remarkably inefficient.
Persistent damage runs its course and automatically
ends after a certain amount of time as fire burns out,
blood clots, and the like. The GM determines when this
occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute.
Immunities, Resistances, and Weaknesses
Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to
persistent damage. If an effect deals initial damage
in addition to persistent damage, apply immunities,
resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial
damage and to the persistent damage. Usually, if an
effect negates the initial damage, it also negates the
persistent damage, such as with a slashing weapon that
also deals persistent bleed damage because it cut you.
The GM might rule otherwise in some situations.
Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions
You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent
damage conditions so long as they have different damage
types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage
condition with the same damage type, the higher amount
of damage overrides the lower amount. The damage you
take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if
something triggers when you take damage, it triggers
only once; for example, if you’re dying with several types
of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases
your dying condition only once.

Core Rulebook

Quickened
You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each
round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the
types of actions you can use with this additional action.
If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can
use the extra action you’ve been granted for any single
action allowed by any of the effects that made you
quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start
of your turn, you don’t immediately gain actions if you
become quickened during your turn.
Restrained
You’re tied up and can barely move, or a creature has
you pinned. You have the flat-footed and immobilized
conditions, and you can’t use any actions with the attack
or manipulate traits except to attempt to Escape or Force
Open your bonds. Restrained overrides grabbed.
Sickened
You feel ill. Sickened always includes a value. You take
a status penalty equal to this value on all your checks
and DCs. You can’t willingly ingest anything—including
elixirs and potions—while sickened.
You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to
recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude
save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened.
On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by
2 on a critical success).
Slowed
You have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value.
When you regain your actions at the start of your turn,
reduce the number of actions you regain by your slowed
value. Because slowed has its effect at the start of your
turn, you don’t immediately lose actions if you become
slowed during your turn.
Stunned
You’ve become senseless. You can’t act while stunned.
Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how
many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns,
from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such
as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain
by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value
by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you
were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on
your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn,
you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use
your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also
have a duration instead of a value, such as “stunned for
1 minute.” In this case, you lose all your actions for the
listed duration.
Stunned overrides slowed. If the duration of your
stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count
the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost
to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2
at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action
from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by
being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining
to use that turn.
Stupefied
Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always
includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this
value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based
checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell
attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these
ability scores. Any time you attempt to Cast a Spell while
stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a
flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.
Unconscious
You’re sleeping, or you’ve been knocked out. You can’t
act. You take a –4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and
Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and flat-footed
conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone
and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the
effect states otherwise or the GM determines you’re in a
position in which you wouldn’t.
If you’re unconscious because you’re dying, you can’t
wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored
to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and
unconscious conditions and can act normally on your
next turn.
If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not
dying, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken
after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long
you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes
GAINING AND LOSING ACTIONS
Quickened, slowed, and stunned are the primary ways
you can gain or lose actions on a turn. The rules for
how this works appear on page 462. In brief, these
conditions alter how many actions you regain at the
start of your turn; thus, gaining the condition in the
middle of your turn doesn’t adjust your number of
actions on that turn. If you have conflicting conditions
that affect your number of actions, you choose which
actions you lose. For instance, the action gained from
haste lets you only Stride or Strike, so if you need to
lose one action because you’re also slowed, you might
decide to lose the action from haste, letting you keep
your other actions that can be used more flexibly.
Some conditions prevent you from taking a certain
subset of actions, typically reactions. Other conditions
simply say you can’t act. When you can’t act, you’re
unable to take any actions at all. Unlike slowed or
stunned, these don’t change the number of actions you
regain; they just prevent you from using them. That
means if you are somehow cured of paralysis on your
turn, you can act immediately.

to several hours. If you receive healing during this time,
you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally
on your next turn.
If you’re unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point
(typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to
an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways.
Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.
• You take damage, provided the damage doesn’t
reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces
you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and
gain the dying condition as normal.
• You receive healing, other than the natural healing
you get from resting.
• Someone shakes you awake with an Interact action.
• There’s loud noise going on around you—though
this isn’t automatic. At the start of your turn, you
automatically attempt a Perception check against
the noise’s DC (or the lowest DC if there is more
than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If
creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you,
this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some
magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they
don’t allow you to attempt this Perception check.
• If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake
up either because you have had a restful night’s
sleep or something disrupted that rest.
Undetected
When you are undetected by a creature, that creature
cannot see you at all, has no idea what space you occupy,
and can’t target you, though you still can be affected by
abilities that target an area. When you’re undetected by a
creature, that creature is flat-footed to you.
A creature you’re undetected by can guess which square
you’re in to try targeting you. It must pick a square and
attempt an attack. This works like targeting a hidden
creature (requiring a DC 11 flat check, as described on
page 466), but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in
secret by the GM, who doesn’t reveal whether the attack
missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll,
or choosing the wrong square.
A creature can use the Seek action to try to find you, as
described on page 471.
Unfriendly
This condition reflects a creature’s disposition toward
a particular character, and it affects only creatures that
are not player characters. A creature that is unfriendly
to a character dislikes and specifically distrusts that
character. The unfriendly creature won’t accept Requests
from the character.
Unnoticed
If you are unnoticed by a creature, that creature has no
idea you are present at all. When you’re unnoticed, you’re
also undetected by the creature. This condition matters
for abilities that can be used only against targets totally
unaware of your presence.
Wounded
You have been seriously injured. If you lose the dying
condition and do not already have the wounded
condition, you become wounded 1. If you already
have the wounded condition when you lose the dying
condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1.
If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase
your dying condition value by your wounded value.
The wounded condition ends if someone successfully
restores Hit Points to you with Treat Wounds, or if you
are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
REDUNDANT CONDITIONS
You can have a given condition only once at a time. If
an effect would impose a condition you already have,
you now have that condition for the longer of the two
durations. The shorter-duration condition effectively
ends, though other conditions caused by the original,
shorter-duration effect might continue.
For example, let’s say you have been hit by a monster
that drains your vitality; your wound causes you to be
enfeebled 2 and flat-footed until the end of the monster’s
next turn. Before the end of that creature’s next turn, a
trap poisons you, making you enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. In
this case, the enfeebled 2 that lasts for 1 minute replaces
the enfeebled 2 from the monster, so you would be
enfeebled 2 for the longer duration. You would remain
flat-footed, since nothing replaced that condition, and it
still lasts only until the end of the monster’s next turn.
Any ability that removes a condition removes it
entirely, no matter what its condition value is or how
many times you’ve been affected by it. In the example
above, a spell that removes the enfeebled condition from
you would remove it entirely—the spell wouldn’t need to
remove it twice.
Redundant Conditions with Values
Conditions with different values are considered different
conditions. If you’re affected by a condition with a
value multiple times, you apply only the highest value,
although you might have to track both durations if one
has a lower value but lasts longer. For example, if you
had a slowed 2 condition that lasts 1 round and a slowed
1 condition that lasts for 6 rounds, you’d be slowed 2 for
the first round, and then you’d change to slowed 1 for
the remaining 5 rounds of the second effect’s duration. If
something reduces the condition value, it reduces it for
all conditions of that name affecting you. For instance, in
this example above, if something reduced your slowed
value by 1, it would reduce the first condition from the
example to slowed 1 and reduce the second to slowed 0,
removing it.

aberration (trait) Aberrations are creatures from beyond the planes or corruptions
of the natural order.
ability This is a general term referring to rules that provide an exception to the basic
rules. An ability could come from a number of sources, so “an ability that gives you
a bonus to damage rolls” could be a feat, a spell, and so on.
ability boost An ability boost allows you to increase one of your ability scores by 2,
or by 1 if the ability score was already 18 or higher. When you get more than one
ability boost at once, you must apply each to a different score. 20
ability flaw An ability flaw decreases one of your ability scores by 2. 20, 26
ability modifier A value added to calculations based on your ability score. 20
ability score Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature’s raw
potential and basic attributes. 12, 19–20, 24, 26
	 key ability (class) 67

	 hostile actions 305
	 single action ([one-action]) See also single action. 471
Activate an Item (activity) You provide specified components to activate an alchemical
or magical item. The number of actions this takes varies by item. 532–533
activity A category of action that typically takes more than a single action. Activities
on your turn take 2 actions ([two-actions]) or 3 actions ([three-actions]). Exploration and downtime
activities can take minutes, hours, or days. 17, 461–462
	 exploration activities 479–480

this trait consist primarily of air or have a magical connection to that element.
alchemical (trait) Alchemical items are powered by reactions of alchemical reagents.
Alchemical items aren’t magical and don’t radiate a magical aura. 543–554

Glossary and Index
This appendix contains page references for essential rules of the game, full definitions for
most traits, and partial definitions and calculations for many other rules.
alchemist (trait)  This indicates abilities from the alchemist class.
alignment Alignment represents a creature’s basic moral and ethical attitude on a
law-to-chaos axis and a good-to-evil axis. 12, 28–29
alignment (damage type) An umbrella category of damage including chaotic, evil,
good, and lawful damage. 452
ally An ally is someone on your side. You are not counted as your own ally. 456
ammunition 280, 559–561
anathema When a character violates restrictions on their behavior imposed by
the source of their power, they can lose related abilities. 86–87, 106, 118, 130
ancestry A broad family of people that a creature belongs to. Each player character
chooses an ancestry as the first step of character creation. 12, 22, 24–25, 32–59
angel (trait) This family of celestials is native to the plane of Nirvana. Most angels
are neutral good, have darkvision, and have a weakness to evil damage.
animal (trait) An animal is a creature with a relatively low intelligence. It typically
doesn’t have an Intelligence ability modifier over –4, can’t speak languages, and
can’t be trained in Intelligence-based skills.
animal companion 214–217
apex (trait) When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of
your ability scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18, whichever grants
the higher score. This gives you all the benefits of the new ability score until
the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it’s
invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item

mental (damage type) 452
mental (trait) A mental effect can alter the target’s mind. It has no effect on an object
or a mindless creature.
metamagic (trait) Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats,
tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly
before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free
actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits
of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are
part of the spell’s effect, not of the metamagic action itself. 304
mindless (trait) A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental
attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental ability modifiers are –5. They are
immune to all mental effects.
minion (trait) Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature
with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn and can’t use reactions. Your minion
acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it
commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s
a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain
an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command, a single action
with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no
actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended
for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don’t act, animals
follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.
misfortune (trait) A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice.
You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple
misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a
fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel
each other out, and you roll normally. 449
mithral (material) 579

downtime—each has a different time scale and degree of rules precision. 10–12,

	 multiclass archetype 227
monk (trait) Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon with this trait
is primarily used by monks.

PCs in some way. Beneficial monsters are exceptions in most games. The GM plays
the role of any monster the PCs encounter. 8
	 monster identification 238–239, 506
morph (trait) Effects that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait. Any
Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected
by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more
than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same
manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait).
Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph
effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph
effects can be used together and which can’t.
Mount [one-action] (specialty basic action) Get on an allied creature to ride it. 472
mount An animal companion with this special ability supports its rider. 214

	 movement without a grid 494
	 special movement types 463
	 Speed (land Speed) 13, 24, 463
multiclass (trait) Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your
training into another class’s specialties. You can’t select a multiclass archetype’s
dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name. 219
multiple attack penalty You take this penalty on all attacks after the first on your
turn. This is a –5 penalty on your second attack and –10 on all subsequent attacks
(or –4 and –8 if your weapon or unarmed attack has the agile trait). 446
multiplying 444
mutagen (trait) An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the
subject’s body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more
beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are
polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time.
narrow surface (terrain) You must Balance to cross a narrow surface. 476
natural 1, natural 20 When you roll a d20 and the number on the die is a 1, decrease
your degree of success by one step. When the number is a 20, increase the degree

ability scores and immunity to mental effects and precision damage.
open (trait) These maneuvers work only as the first salvo on your turn. You can use an
open only if you haven’t used an action with the attack or open trait yet this turn.
orc (trait) A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. These

plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter
in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.

Point Out [one-action] (specialty basic action) Indicate an undetected creature’s location. 472
poison (damage type) 452
poison (trait) An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An
item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction. 457–458, 550—554
polymorph (trait) These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can’t
be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under
the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts
to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has
no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect
are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to
take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic
creature of a general type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can
be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless
otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking,
and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there’s doubt about
whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you;
the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any items.
positive (damage type) 452
positive (trait) Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal
positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.
possession (trait) Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit
into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can’t use a possession effect.
While possessing a target, a possessor’s true body is unconscious (and can’t wake
up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter
the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that
amount of damage as mental damage.
A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect
its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target’s active spells and
abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target’s abilities
that are purely physical, and it can’t use any of its own abilities except spells and
purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or
purely mental. A possessor uses the target’s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save,
Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills,
spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant
(the possessor’s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target’s
invested items apply when using the target’s values). A possessor gains no benefit
from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn’t in its own body.
The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act.
If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its
true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal
and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the
possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession
or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the
possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.

attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure.
The effects that are added on a failure don’t apply on a critical failure. If your press
action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example,
you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)

splash (trait) When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add
your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails,
succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including
the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure),
the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together
with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses
or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit. 544
Squeeze (skill action) Move through a gap while exploring. (Acrobatics, trained) 241

to cast additional spells by preparing the staff. 592–595

action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts
until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the

use an action with the stance trait, you can’t use another one for 1 round. You can
enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

or more is even better—a critical success. If a stat block has no success entry, that
means there is no effect on a success. 445–446
suffocation 478
summoned (trait) A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the
summoned trait. A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create
things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to
cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers
the summoning magic, causing the summoned creature’s spell to fail and the
summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard
abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of
its abilities. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but
the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses
its 2 actions for that turn. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells
