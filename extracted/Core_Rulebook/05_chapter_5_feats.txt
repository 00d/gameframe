Chapter 5: Feats
All kinds of experiences and training can shape your character beyond what you learn by
advancing in your class. Abilities that require a degree of training but can be learned by
anyone—not only members of certain ancestries or classes—are called general feats.
These feats also have the skill trait. Most characters gain
skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. When
you gain a skill feat, you must select a general feat with the
skill trait; you can’t select a general feat that lacks the skill
trait. The level of a skill feat is typically the minimum level
at which a character could meet its proficiency prerequisite.

ADDITIONAL LORE
 FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Lore
Your knowledge has expanded to encompass a new field. Choose
an additional Lore skill subcategory. You become trained in it. At
3rd, 7th, and 15th levels, you gain an additional skill increase
you can apply only to the chosen Lore subcategory.
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each time
you must select a new subcategory of Lore and you gain the
additional skill increases to that subcategory for the listed levels.
ADOPTED ANCESTRY
 FEAT 1
GENERAL
You’re fully immersed in another ancestry’s culture and
traditions, whether born into them, earned through rite of
passage, or bonded through a deep friendship or romance.
Choose a common ancestry. You can select ancestry feats
from the ancestry you chose, in addition to your character’s
own ancestry, as long as the ancestry feats don’t require any
physiological feature that you lack, as determined by the GM.
ALCHEMICAL CRAFTING
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can use the Craft activity to create alchemical items. When
you select this feat, you immediately add the formulas for four
common 1st-level alchemical items to your formula book.
ANCESTRAL PARAGON
 FEAT 3
GENERAL
Whether through instinct, study, or magic, you feel a deeper
connection to your ancestry. You gain a 1st-level ancestry feat.
ARCANE SENSE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Arcana
Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its
presence. You can cast 1st-level detect magic at will as an arcane
innate spell. If you’re a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened
to 3rd level; if you’re legendary, it is heightened to 4th level.
ARMOR PROFICIENCY
 FEAT 1
GENERAL
You become trained in light armor. If you already were trained
in light armor, you gain training in medium armor. If you were
trained in both, you become trained in heavy armor.
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each time,
you become trained in the next type of armor above.
ASSURANCE
 FEAT 1
FORTUNE
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in at least one skill
Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks.
Choose a skill you’re trained in. You can forgo rolling a skill check
for that skill to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency
bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
choose a different skill and gain the benefits for that skill.
AUTOMATIC KNOWLEDGE
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in a skill with the Recall Knowledge
action, Assurance in that skill
You know basic facts off the top of your head. Choose a skill
you’re an expert in that has the Recall Knowledge action and
for which you have the Assurance feat. You can use the Recall
Knowledge action with that skill as a free action once per round.
If you do, you must use Assurance on the skill check.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a
different skill each time. You can use Automatic Knowledge
with any skills you have chosen, but you can still use Automatic
Knowledge only once per round.
BARGAIN HUNTER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You can Earn Income (page 236) using Diplomacy, spending
your days hunting for bargains and reselling at a profit. You
can also spend time specifically sniffing out a great bargain
on an item; this works as if you were using Earn Income with
Diplomacy, except instead of gaining money, you purchase
the item at a discount equal to the money you would have
gained, gaining the item for free if your earned income equals
or exceeds its cost. Finally, if you select Bargain Hunter
during character creation at 1st level, you start play with an
additional 2 gp.
BATTLE CRY
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Intimidation
When you roll initiative, you can yell a mighty battle cry and
Demoralize an observed foe as a free action. If you’re legendary
in Intimidation, you can use a reaction to Demoralize your foe
when you critically succeed at an attack roll.
BATTLE MEDICINE [one-action]
FEAT 1
GENERAL
HEALING
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Medicine
You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even in combat.
Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat
Wounds and provide the corresponding amount of healing.
As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against
higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The
target is then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine
for 1 day.
BIZARRE MAGIC
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Occultism
You can draw upon strange variations in your spellcasting,
whether or not you can cast occult spells. The DCs to Recognize
Spells you cast and Identify Magic you use increase by 5.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

BONDED ANIMAL
FEAT 2
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Nature
You forge strong connections with animals. You can spend 7
days of downtime trying to bond with a normal animal (not
a companion or other special animal). After this duration,
attempt a DC 20 Nature check. If successful, you bond with
the animal. The animal is permanently helpful to you, unless
you do something egregious to break your bond. A helpful
animal is easier to direct, as described under Command an
Animal on page 249.
Bonding with a new animal ends any previous bond you had.
You can’t have both a bonded animal and an animal companion
(though you can have both a bonded animal and a familiar).
BREATH CONTROL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
You have incredible breath control, which grants you
advantages when air is hazardous or sparse. You can hold your
breath for 25 times as long as usual before suffocating. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled
threats, such as inhaled poisons, and if you roll a success on
such a saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
CANNY ACUMEN
FEAT 1
GENERAL
Your avoidance or observation is beyond the ken of most in
your profession. Choose Fortitude saves, Reflex saves, Will
saves, or Perception. You become an expert in your choice. At
17th level, you become a master in your choice.
CAT FALL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your
falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you’re an expert in
Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter. If you’re a master in
Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you’re legendary
in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don’t take
damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
CHARMING LIAR
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When
you get a critical success using the Lie action, the target’s
attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d
succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This
works only once per conversation, and if you critically
succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you
choose one creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying
to impart seemingly important information, inflate your
status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies
can’t achieve.

Impersonate to pretend to be a noble if you aren’t one. If you
want to impersonate a specific noble, you still need to use
Deception to Impersonate normally, and to Lie when necessary.
CRAFT ANYTHING
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Crafting
You can find ways to craft just about anything, despite
restrictions. As long as you have the appropriate Crafting skill
feat (such as Magical Crafting for magic items) and meet the
item’s level and proficiency requirement, you ignore just about
any other requirement, such as being of a specific ancestry or
providing spells. The only exceptions are requirements that add
to the item’s cost, including castings of spells that themselves
have a cost, and requirements of special items such as the
philosopher’s stone that have exclusive means of access and
Crafting. The GM decides whether you can ignore a requirement.
DIEHARD
FEAT 1
GENERAL
It takes more to kill you than most. You die from the dying
condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.
DIVINE GUIDANCE
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Religion
You’re so immersed in divine scripture that you find meaning
and guidance in your texts in any situation. Spend 10 minutes
Deciphering Writing on religious scriptures of your deity
or philosophy while thinking about a particular problem or
conundrum you face, and then attempt a Religion check (DC
determined by the GM). If you succeed, you unearth a relevant
passage, parable, or aphorism that can help you move forward
or change your thinking to help solve your conundrum. For
example, the GM might provide you with a cryptic poem or hint
that can guide you to the next step of solving your problem.
DUBIOUS KNOWLEDGE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in a skill with the Recall Knowledge action
You’re a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes
from reputable sources. When you fail a Recall Knowledge
check using any skill, you learn a bit of true knowledge and
a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don’t have any way to
differentiate which is which.
EXPEDITIOUS SEARCH
FEAT 7
GENERAL
Prerequisites master in Perception
You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding
details and secrets twice as quickly as others can. When
Searching, you take half as long as usual to Search a given
area. This means that while exploring, you double the Speed
you can move while ensuring you’ve Searched an area before
walking into it (up to half your Speed). If you’re legendary in
Perception, you instead Search areas four times as quickly.
CLOUD JUMP
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Athletics
Your unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible
distances. Triple the distance you Long Jump (so you could jump
60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you High Jump, use
the calculation for a Long Jump but don’t triple the distance.
When you Long Jump or High Jump, you can also increase
the number of actions you use (up to the number of actions you
have remaining in your turn) to jump even further. For each extra
action, add your Speed to the maximum distance you jump.
COMBAT CLIMBER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
Your techniques allow you to fight as you climb. You’re not
flat-footed while Climbing and can Climb with a hand occupied.
You must still use another hand and both legs to Climb.
CONFABULATOR
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception
Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the
circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts
to Create a Diversion or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you’re a master
in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you’re legendary,
your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.
CONNECTIONS
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Society, Courtly Graces
You have social connections you can leverage to trade favors or
meet important people. When you’re in an area with connections
(typically a settlement where you’ve spent downtime building
connections, or possibly another area in the same nation), you
can attempt a Society check to arrange a meeting with an
important political figure or ask for a favor in exchange for a
later favor of your contact’s choice. The GM decides the DC
based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure’s prominence.
CONTINUAL RECOVERY
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You zealously monitor a patient’s progress to administer
treatment faster. When you Treat Wounds, your patient
becomes immune for only 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. This
applies only to your Treat Wounds activities, not any other the
patient receives.
COURTLY GRACES
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper
etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a
noble and play games of influence and politics. You can use
Society to Make an Impression on a noble, as well as with
Core Rulebook
260

PAGE 262
================================================================================

EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONAL
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Lore
You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent
disaster. When you use Lore to Earn Income, if you roll a critical
failure, you instead get a failure. If you’re an expert in Lore, you
gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income,
unless it was originally a critical failure.
EXPERIENCED SMUGGLER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Stealth
You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM
rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a
small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled
or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it
to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result.
If you’re a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or
15, and if you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed
at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This
provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception
check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to
your smuggling skill, you’re more likely to find more lucrative
smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.
EXPERIENCED TRACKER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you
can follow a trail without pause. You can Track while moving
at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check.
If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the –5 penalty.
If you’re legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a
new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still
need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.
FASCINATING PERFORMANCE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Performance
When you Perform, compare your result to the Will DC of one
observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1
round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate
attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate
it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must
choose which creature you’re trying to fascinate before you roll
your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
If you’re an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up
to four observers; if you’re a master, you can fascinate up to
10 observers; and if you’re legendary, you can fascinate any
number of observers at the same time.
FAST RECOVERY
FEAT 1
GENERAL
Prerequisites Constitution 14
Your body quickly bounces back from afflictions. You regain
twice as many Hit Points from resting. Each time you succeed
at a Fortitude save against an ongoing disease or poison, you
reduce its stage by 2, or by 1 against a virulent disease or poison.
Each critical success you achieve against an ongoing disease or
poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 against a virulent disease
or poison. In addition, you reduce the severity of your drained
condition by 2 when you rest for a night instead of by 1.
FEATHER STEP
FEAT 1
GENERAL
Prerequisites Dexterity 14
You step carefully and quickly. You can Step into difficult terrain.
FLEET
FEAT 1
GENERAL
You move more quickly on foot. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.
FOIL SENSES
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You are adept at foiling creatures’ special senses and cautious
enough to safeguard against them at all times. Whenever you
use the Avoid Notice, Hide, or Sneak actions, you are always
considered to be taking precautions against special senses
(see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar on page 465).
FORAGER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than
a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide
subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures,
and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many
creatures as on a success.
Each time your proficiency rank in Survival increases, double
the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a
success (to eight if you’re an expert, 16 if you’re a master, or 32
if you’re legendary). You can choose to care for half the number
of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead
of subsistence living.
Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly
smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature
for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly
greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM
determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.
GLAD-HAND
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Diplomacy
First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet
someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately
attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that
creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You
take a –5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you
can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new
check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure
or critical failure result.

INTIMIDATING GLARE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize
loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don’t
take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.
INTIMIDATING PROWESS
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites Strength 16, expert in Intimidation
In situations where you can physically menace the target when
you Coerce or Demoralize, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not
sharing a language. If your Strength score is 20 or higher and
you are a master in Intimidation, this bonus increases to +2.
INVENTOR
FEAT 7
DOWNTIME
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Crafting
You are a genius at Crafting, easily able to determine how things
are made and create new inventions. You can spend downtime
to invent a common formula that you don’t know. This works
just like the Craft activity: you spend half the Price of the
formula up front, attempt a Crafting check, and on a success
either finish the formula by paying the difference or work for
longer to decrease the Price. The difference is that you spend
the additional time in research, design, and development, rather
than in creating an item. Once it’s complete, you add the new
formula you invented to your formula book.
KIP UP [free-action]
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Acrobatics
You stand up. This movement doesn’t trigger reactions.
LASTING COERCION
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Intimidation
When you successfully Coerce someone, the maximum time
they comply increases to a week, still determined by the GM.
If you’re legendary, the maximum increases to a month.
LEGENDARY CODEBREAKER
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Society
Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you
can decipher information with little more than a quick read
through a text. You can Decipher Writing using Society
while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend
the full amount of time that’s ordinarily required and roll a
success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed
while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly
word-for-word understanding of the document.
GROUP COERCION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check
result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It’s possible
to get a different degree of success for each target. The number
of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to four if
you’re an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.
GROUP IMPRESSION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
When you Make an Impression, you can compare your
Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead
of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for
each target. The number of targets increases to four if you’re
an expert, 10 if you’re a master, and 25 if you’re legendary.
HEFTY HAULER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You can carry more than your frame implies. Increase your
maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 2.
HOBNOBBER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Diplomacy
You are skilled at learning information through conversation.
The Gather Information exploration activity takes you half as
long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you’re a
master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal
speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you
get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you
learn with Gather Information is accurate.
IMPECCABLE CRAFTING
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Crafting, Specialty Crafting
You craft flawless creations with great efficiency. Whenever you
roll a success at a Crafting check to make an item of the type you
chose with Specialty Crafting, you get a critical success instead.
IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Performance
Your performances inspire admiration and win you fans. You can
Make an Impression using Performance instead of Diplomacy.
INCREDIBLE INITIATIVE

================================================================================

LEGENDARY LINGUIST
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Society, Multilingual
You’re so skilled with languages you can create a pidgin instantly.
You can always talk to any creature that has a language—even a
language you don’t know­—by creating a new pidgin language that
uses simplified terms and conveys basic concepts. To do so, you
must first understand at least what medium of communication
the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on).
LEGENDARY MEDIC
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Medicine
You’ve discovered medical breakthroughs or techniques that
achieve miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can
spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a Medicine check
to remove a disease or the blinded, deafened, doomed, or drained
condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that
created the condition. If the effect’s source is an artifact, above
20th level, or similarly powerful, increase the DC by 10.
LEGENDARY NEGOTIATION [three-actions]
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Diplomacy
You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You
attempt to Make an Impression and then Request your opponent
cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You
take a –5 penalty to your Diplomacy check. The GM sets the
DC of the Request based on the circumstances—it’s generally
at least a very hard DC of the creature’s level. Some creatures
might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might
ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.
LEGENDARY PERFORMER
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Performance, Virtuosic Performer
Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed
at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you
and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than
normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC’s disposition.
For instance, if you’re well-known for cruel and demanding
behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be
friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance,
you attract higher-level audiences than your location would
allow, as audiences flock to see you. For instance, rulers and
angels might travel to your small tower in the woods to hear
you perform. Typically, this increases the audiences available by
2 levels or more, determined by the GM.
LEGENDARY PROFESSIONAL
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Lore
Your fame has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if
you have Warfare Lore, you might be a legendary general or
tactician). This works as Legendary Performer above, except
you gain higher-level jobs when you Earn Income with Lore.
LEGENDARY SNEAK
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Stealth, Swift Sneak
You’re always sneaking unless you choose to be seen, even
when there’s nowhere to hide. You can Hide and Sneak even
without cover or being concealed. When you employ an
exploration tactic other than Avoiding Notice, you also gain
the benefits of Avoiding Notice unless you choose not to. See
page 479 for more information about exploration tactics.
LEGENDARY SURVIVALIST
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Survival
You can survive indefinitely without food or water and can
endure severe, extreme, and incredible cold and heat without
taking damage from doing so.
LEGENDARY THIEF
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Thievery, Pickpocket
Your ability to Steal defies belief. You can attempt to Steal
something that is actively wielded or that would be extremely
noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or
armor). You must do so slowly and carefully, spending at least 1
minute (and significantly longer for items that are normally time
consuming to remove, like armor). Throughout this duration you
must have some means of staying hidden, such as the cover of
darkness or a bustling crowd. You take a –5 penalty to your
Thievery check. Even if you succeed, if the item is extremely
prominent—like a suit of full plate armor—onlookers will quickly
notice it’s gone after you steal it.
LENGTHY DIVERSION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue
to remain hidden after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for
an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation,
as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).
LIE TO ME
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Deception
You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying
to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone
trying to Lie to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than
your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This
doesn’t apply if you don’t have a back-and-forth dialogue, such
as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
MAGICAL CRAFTING
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Crafting
You can Craft magic items, though some have other requirements,
as listed in Chapter 11. When you select this feat, you gain
formulas for four common magic items of 2nd level or lower.

================================================================================

MAGICAL SHORTHAND 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Learning spells comes easily to you. If you’re an expert in a
tradition’s associated skill, you take 10 minutes per spell level to
learn a spell of that tradition, rather than 1 hour per spell level. If
you fail to learn the spell, you can try again after 1 week or after
you gain a level, whichever comes first. If you’re a master in the
tradition’s associated skill, learning a spell takes 5 minutes per
spell level, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 minute per spell level.
You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works
as if you were using Earn Income with the tradition’s associated
skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to
you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free
if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.
MULTILINGUAL 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You easily pick up new languages. You learn two new languages,
chosen from common languages, uncommon languages, and
any others you have access to. You learn an additional language
if you are or become a master in Society and again if you are or
become legendary.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
you learn additional languages.
NATURAL MEDICINE 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Nature
You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use
Nature instead of Medicine to Treat Wounds. If you’re in the
wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients,
allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to
Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM’s determination.
NIMBLE CRAWL
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Acrobatics
You can Crawl incredibly swiftly—up to half your Speed, rather
than 5 feet. If you’re a master in Acrobatics, you can Crawl at full
Speed, and if you’re legendary, you aren’t flat-footed while prone.
ODDITY IDENTIFICATION
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Occultism
You have a sense for spells that twist minds or reveal secrets. You
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Occultism checks to Identify
Magic with the mental, possession, prediction, or scrying traits.
PICKPOCKET 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
You can Steal or Palm an Object that’s closely guarded, such as
in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can’t steal objects
that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove
(like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you’re a
master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in
combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires
2 manipulate actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.
PLANAR SURVIVAL 
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Survival
You can Subsist using Survival on different planes, even those
without resources or natural phenomena you normally need.
For instance, you can forage for food even if the plane lacks
food that could normally sustain you. A success on your check
to Subsist can also reduce the damage dealt by the plane, at the
GM’s discretion.
POWERFUL LEAP 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Athletics
When you Leap, you can jump 5 feet up with a vertical Leap, and
you increase the distance you can jump horizontally by 5 feet.
QUICK CLIMB 
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Athletics
When Climbing, you move 5 more feet on a success and 10 more
feet on a critical success, to a maximum of your Speed.
If you’re legendary in Athletics, you gain a climb Speed
equal to your Speed.
QUICK COERCION 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Intimidation
You can bully others with just a few choice implications. You
can Coerce a creature after 1 round of conversation instead
of 1 minute. You still can’t Coerce a creature in the midst of
combat, or without engaging in a conversation.
QUICK DISGUISE 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Deception
You can set up a disguise in half the usual time (generally 5
minutes). If you’re a master, it takes one-tenth the usual time
(usually 1 minute). If you’re legendary, you can create a full
disguise and Impersonate as a 3-action activity.
QUICK IDENTIFICATION 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism or Religion
You can Identify Magic swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using
Identify Magic to determine the properties of an item, ongoing
effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you’re a master, it
takes a 3-action activity, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 action.
QUICK JUMP 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
Core Rulebook
264

PAGE 266
================================================================================

You can use High Jump and Long Jump as a single action
instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don’t perform the initial
Stride (nor do you fail if you don’t Stride 10 feet).
QUICK RECOGNITION 
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion;
Recognize Spell
You Recognize Spells swiftly. Once per round, you can Recognize
a Spell using a skill in which you’re a master as a free action.
QUICK REPAIR 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You take 1 minute to Repair an item. If you’re a master in
Crafting, it takes 3 actions. If you’re legendary, it takes 1 action.
QUICK SQUEEZE 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
You Squeeze 5 feet per round (10 feet on a critical success).
If you’re legendary in Acrobatics, you Squeeze at full Speed.
QUICK SWIM 
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Athletics
You Swim 5 feet farther on a success and 10 feet farther on a
critical success, to a maximum of your Speed. If you’re legendary
in Athletics, you gain a swim Speed equal to your Speed.
QUICK UNLOCK 
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Thievery
You can Pick a Lock using 1 action instead of 2.
QUIET ALLIES 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Stealth
You’re skilled at moving with a group. When you are Avoiding
Notice and your allies Follow the Expert, you and those allies can
roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of
rolling separately. This doesn’t apply for initiative rolls.
RAPID MANTEL 
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Athletics
You easily pull yourself onto ledges. When you Grab an Edge,
you can pull yourself onto that surface and stand. You can use
Athletics instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge.
READ LIPS 
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You can read lips of others nearby who you can clearly see. When
you’re at your leisure, you can do this automatically. In encounter
mode or when attempting a more difficult feat of lipreading,
you’re fascinated and flat-footed during each round in which you
focus on lip movements, and you must succeed at a Society check
(DC determined by the GM) to successfully read someone’s lips. In
either case, the language read must be one that you know.
If you are deaf or hard of hearing and have Read Lips,
you recognize the lip movements for the spoken form of
your languages. You can also speak the spoken form of your
languages clearly enough for others to understand you.
RECOGNIZE SPELL [reaction]
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SECRET
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Trigger A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don’t
have prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar
object casts such a spell. You must be aware of the casting.
If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition
and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically
identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but
can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell

you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6
if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a
secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever
corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re
not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure.
Critical Success You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.
Success You correctly recognize the spell.
Failure You fail to recognize the spell.
Critical Failure You misidentify the spell as another spell
entirely, of the GM’s choice.
RIDE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
When you Command an Animal you’re mounted on to take a
move action (such as Stride), you automatically succeed instead
of needing to attempt a check. Any animal you’re mounted on
acts on your turn, like a minion. If you Mount an animal in the
middle of an encounter, it skips its next turn and then acts on
your next turn. Page 249 has more on Command an Animal.
ROBUST RECOVERY
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You learned folk medicine to help recover from diseases and
poison, and using it diligently has made you especially resilient.
When you Treat a Disease or a Poison, or someone else uses
one of these actions on you, increase the circumstance bonus
granted on a success to +4, and if the result of the patient’s
saving throw is a success, the patient gets a critical success.
SCARE TO DEATH [one-action]
FEAT 15
DEATH
EMOTION
FEAR
GENERAL
INCAPACITATION
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Intimidation
You can frighten foes so much, they might die. Attempt an
Intimidation check against the Will DC of a living creature within
30 feet of you that you sense or observe and who can sense or
observe you. If the target can’t hear you or doesn’t understand
the language you are speaking, you take a –4 circumstance
penalty. The creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Critical Success The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
against your Intimidation DC or die. If the target succeeds
at its save, it becomes frightened 2 and is fleeing for 1
round; it suffers no effect on a critical success.
Success The target becomes frightened 2.
Failure The target becomes frightened 1.
Critical Failure The target is unaffected.
SHAMELESS REQUEST
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Requirements master in Diplomacy
You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of
your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you
Request something, you reduce any DC increases for making an
outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your
Request, you get a failure instead. While this means you can
never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by
making a Request, they eventually tire of requests, even though
they still have a positive attitude toward you.
SHIELD BLOCK [reaction]
FEAT 1
GENERAL
Trigger While you have your shield raised, you would take
damage from a physical attack.
You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield
prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the
shield’s Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining
damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.
SIGN LANGUAGE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You learn the sign languages associated with the languages
you know, allowing you to sign and understand signs. Sign
languages typically require both hands to convey more complex
concepts, and they are visual rather than auditory.
Sign language is difficult to understand during combat due
to the level of attention needed, unlike basic gestures like
pointing at a foe to suggest a target. Sign language is hard to
use in areas of low visibility, just like speech is difficult in a
noisy environment.
SKILL TRAINING
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites Intelligence 12
You become trained in the skill of your choice.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a
new skill to become trained in each time.
SLIPPERY SECRETS
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Deception
You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or
intentions. When a spell or magical effect tries to read your mind,
detect whether you are lying, or reveal your alignment, you can
attempt a Deception check against the spell or effect’s DC. If you
succeed, the effect reveals nothing.
SNARE CRAFTING
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
You can use the Craft activity to create snares, using the
rules from page 244. When you select this feat, you add the
formulas for four common snares to your formula book.
SPECIALTY CRAFTING
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Crafting
Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item.
Select one of the specialties listed on page 267; you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that
type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2.
Core Rulebook
266

PAGE 268
================================================================================

If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.
Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you
were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking,
the GM might give you half your bonus because the item
requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

STEADY BALANCE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Acrobatics
You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions.
Whenever you roll a success using the Balance action, you
get a critical success instead. You’re not flat-footed while
attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven
ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt
an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge.
STREETWISE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Society
You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your
local settlement. You can use your Society modifier instead
of your Diplomacy modifier to Gather Information. In any
settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall
Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of
information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather
Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you
know the information without spending time gathering it. If
you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently
attempt to Gather Information normally.
STUDENT OF THE CANON
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Religion
You’ve researched many faiths enough to recognize notions
about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure
at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or
to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get a failure
instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets
of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead,
and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
SUBTLE THEFT
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Thievery
When you successfully Steal something, observers (creatures
other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance
penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft.
Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception,
taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn’t end your
undetected condition.
SURVEY WILDLIFE
 FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
You can study details in the wilderness to determine the
presence of nearby creatures. You can spend 10 minutes
assessing the area around you to find out what creatures
are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation.
Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM
based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can
attempt a Recall Knowledge check with a –2 penalty to learn
more about the creatures just from these signs. If you’re a
master in Survival, you don’t take the penalty.
SWIFT SNEAK
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Stealth
You can move your full Speed when you Sneak. You can use Swift
Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead
of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
TERRAIN EXPERTISE
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Survival
Your experience in navigating a certain type of terrain
makes you supremely confident while doing so. You gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks in one of the
following types of terrain, chosen when you select this feat:
aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp,
or underground.
Special You can select this feat more than once, choosing a
different type of terrain each time.
TERRAIN STALKER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Stealth
Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list:
rubble, snow, or underbrush. While undetected by all
non-allies in that type of terrain, you can Sneak without
attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than
5 feet and do not move within 10 feet of an enemy at any point
during your movement. This also allows you to automatically
approach creatures to within 15 feet while Avoiding Notice
during exploration as long as they aren’t actively Searching
or on guard.
Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time,
choose a different type of terrain.

GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount
of time the training takes (usually at least a week). It’s usually
impossible to teach an animal a trick that uses critical thinking.
If you’re expert, master, or legendary in Nature, you might be
able to train more unusual creatures, at the GM’s discretion.
Success The animal learns the action. If it was an action the
animal already knew, you can Command the Animal to take
that action without attempting a Nature check. If it was a
new basic action, add that action to the actions the animal
can take when Commanded, but you must still roll.
Failure The animal doesn’t learn the trick.
TRICK MAGIC ITEM [one-action]
FEAT 1
GENERAL
MANIPULATE
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You examine a magic item you normally couldn’t use in an effort
to fool it and activate it temporarily. For example, this might allow
a fighter to cast a spell from a wand or allow a wizard to cast a
spell that’s not on the arcane list using a scroll. You must know
what activating the item does, or you can’t attempt to trick it.
Attempt a check using the skill matching the item’s magic
tradition, or matching a tradition that has the spell on its list,
if you’re trying to cast a spell from the item. The relevant skills
are Arcana for arcane, Nature for primal, Occultism for occult,
Religion for divine, or any of the four for an item that has the
magical trait and not a tradition trait. The GM determines the
DC based on the item’s level (possibly adjusted depending on
the item or situation).
If you activate a magic item that requires a spell attack roll
or spell DC and you don’t have the ability to cast spells of the
relevant tradition, use your level as your proficiency bonus and
the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.
If you’re a master in the appropriate skill for the item’s tradition,
you instead use the trained proficiency bonus, and if you’re
legendary, you instead use the expert proficiency bonus.
Success For the rest of the current turn, you can spend actions
to activate the item as if you could normally use it.
Failure You can’t use the item or try to trick it again this turn,
but you can try again on subsequent turns.
Critical Failure You can’t use the item, and you can’t try to
trick it again until your next daily preparations.
UNDERWATER MARAUDER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Athletics
You’ve learned to fight underwater. You are not flat-footed
while in water, and you don’t take the usual penalties for using
a bludgeoning or slashing melee weapon in water.
UNIFIED THEORY
FEAT 15
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites legendary in Arcana
You’ve started to make a meaningful connection about the
common underpinnings of the four traditions of magic and
magical essences, allowing you to understand them all through
an arcane lens. Whenever you use an action or a skill feat that
requires a Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, depending on
the magic tradition, you can use Arcana instead. If you would
normally take a penalty or have a higher DC for using Arcana
on other magic (such as when using Identify Magic), you no
longer do so.
UNMISTAKABLE LORE
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Lore
You never get information about your areas of expertise wrong.
When you Recall Knowledge using any Lore subcategory in
which you’re trained, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure
instead. If you’re a master in a Lore subcategory, on a critical
success, you gain even more information or context than usual.
UNTRAINED IMPROVISATION
FEAT 3
GENERAL
You’ve learned how to handle situations when you’re out of
your depth. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks
is equal to half your level instead of +0. If you’re 7th level
or higher, the bonus increases to your full level instead. This
doesn’t allow you to use the skill’s trained actions.
VIRTUOSIC PERFORMER
FEAT 1
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites trained in Performance
You have exceptional talent with one type of performance. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus when making a certain type of
performance. If you are a master in Performance, this bonus
increases to +2. Select one of the following specialties and apply
Core Rulebook

WALL JUMP
FEAT 7
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites master in Athletics
You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself
off a wall. If you’re adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump
(whether performing a High Jump, Long Jump, or Leap),
you don’t fall as long as your next action is another jump.
Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum,
you can use High Jump or Long Jump as a single action, but
you don’t get to Stride as part of the activity.
You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you’re
legendary in Athletics, in which case you can use Wall Jump as
many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.
WARD MEDIC
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Medicine
You’ve studied in large medical wards, treating several patients
at once and tending to all their needs. When you use Treat
Disease or Treat Wounds, you can treat up to two targets. If
you’re a master in Medicine, you can treat up to four targets,
and if you’re legendary, you can treat up to eight targets.
WARY DISARMAMENT
FEAT 2
GENERAL
SKILL
Prerequisites expert in Thievery
If you trigger a device or set off a trap while disarming it, you
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC or saving throw
against the device or trap. This applies only to attacks or
effects triggered by your failed attempt, not to any later ones,
such as additional attacks from a complex trap.
WEAPON PROFICIENCY
FEAT 1
GENERAL
You become trained in all simple weapons. If you were already
trained in all simple weapons, you become trained in all martial
weapons. If you were already trained in all martial weapons,
you become trained in one advanced weapon of your choice.
Special You can select this feat more than once. Each
time you do, you become trained in additional weapons as
appropriate, following the above progression.

Chapter 6: Equipment
To make your mark on the world, you’ll need to have the right equipment, including
armor, weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents the various equipment that you can
purchase during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities
and other large settlements.

Your character starts out with 15 gold pieces (150 silver
pieces) to spend on any common items from this chapter.
Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased only if
you have special access from abilities you selected during
character creation or your GM gives you permission to
purchase them.
Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are
three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you
can find them during an adventure, make them using the
Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.
Coins and Currency
Though you might be able to barter valuable items in
some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make
transactions when you head to market. The most common
currency is coins. For most commoners and beginning
adventurers, the standard unit is the silver piece (sp). Each
silver piece is a standard weight of silver and is typically
accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where
it was minted. There are three other common types of
coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The
first is the copper piece (cp). Each copper piece is worth
one‑tenth of a silver piece. The gold piece (gp) is often used
for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as
1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces.
The platinum piece (pp) is used by nobles to demonstrate
their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or
simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency.
A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces,
or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the
exchange rates of common types of coins.
Other Currency
Art objects, gems, and raw materials (such as those used
for the Craft activity) can be used much like currency:
you can sell them for the same Price you can buy them.
Price
Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is
the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that
item. An item with a Price of “—” can’t be purchased. An
item with a Price of 0 is normally free, but its value could
be higher based on the materials used to create it. Most
items can be sold for half their Price, but coins, gems, art
objects, and raw materials (such as components for the
Craft activity) can be exchanged for their full Price.
Item Level
Each item has an item level, which represents the item’s
complexity and any magic used in its construction.
Simpler items with a lower level are easier to construct,
and you can’t Craft items that have a higher level than
your own (page 243). If an item’s level isn’t listed, its level
is 0. While characters can use items of any level, GMs
should keep in mind that allowing characters access to
items far above their current level may have a negative
impact on the game.
Carrying and Using Items
A character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold
an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using
both hands. Drawing or changing how you’re carrying an
item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though
to drop an item, you use the Release action instead).
Table 6–2: Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some
ways that you might change the items you’re holding or
carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so.
Many ways of using items require you to spend
multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in
your belt pouch requires using an Interact action to draw
it and then using a second action to drink it as described in
its Activate entry (page 532).
Bulk
Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make
it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading
yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item
reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its
size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high
Strength score, you usually don’t need to worry about
Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items.
