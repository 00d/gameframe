Chapter 2: Ancestries & Backgrounds
Your character’s ancestry determines which people they call their own, whether it’s diverse
and ambitious humans, insular but vivacious elves, traditionalist and family-focused
dwarves, or any of the other folk who call Golarion home. A character’s ancestry and their
experiences prior to their life as an adventurer—represented by a background—might be
key parts of their identity, shape how they see the world, and help them find their place in it.
A character has one ancestry and one background, both
of which you select during character creation. You’ll also
select a number of languages for your character. Once
chosen, your ancestry and background can’t be changed.
This chapter is divided into three parts:
• Ancestries express the culture your character hails
from. Within many ancestries are heritages—
subgroups that each have their own characteristics.
An ancestry provides ability boosts (and perhaps
ability flaws), Hit Points, ancestry feats, and
sometimes additional abilities.
• Backgrounds, starting on page 60, describe training
or environments your character experienced
before becoming an adventurer. Your character’s
background provides ability boosts, skill training,
and a skill feat.
• Languages, starting on page 65, let your character
communicate with the wonderful and weird
people and creatures of the world.
Ancestry Entries
Each entry includes details about the ancestry and
presents the rules elements described below (all of these
but heritages and ancestry feats are listed in a sidebar).
Hit Points
This tells you how many Hit Points your character gains
from their ancestry at 1st level. You’ll add the Hit Points
from your character’s class (including their Constitution
modifier) to this number. For more on calculating Hit
Points, see Step 7: Record Class Details, on page 25.
Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the ancestry.
Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight
range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half that.
Speed
This entry lists how far a member of the ancestry can move
each time they spend an action (such as Stride) to do so.
Ability Boosts
This lists the ability scores you apply ability boosts to
when creating a character of this ancestry. Most ancestries
provide ability boosts to two specified ability scores, plus
a free ability boost that you can apply to any other score
of your choice. For more about ability boosts, see page 20.
Ability Flaw
This lists the ability score to which you apply an ability
flaw when creating a character of this ancestry. Most
ancestries, with the exception of humans, include an ability
flaw. For more about applying ability flaws, see page 20.
Languages
This tells you the languages that members of the ancestry
speak at 1st level. If your Intelligence modifier is +1 or
higher, you can select more languages from a list given
here. More about languages can be found on page 65.
Traits
These descriptors have no mechanical benefit, but they’re
important for determining how certain spells, effects, and
other aspects of the game interact with your character.
Special Abilities
Any other entries in the sidebar represent abilities, senses,
and other qualities all members of the ancestry manifest.
These are omitted for ancestries with no special rules.
Heritages
You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed
down to you from your ancestors or common among
those of your ancestry in the environment where you were
born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can’t
change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or
ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have
more or fewer members from a particular heritage.
Ancestry Feats
This section presents ancestry feats, which allow you to
customize your character. You gain your first ancestry
feat at 1st level, and you gain another at 5th level, 9th
level, 13th level, and 17th level, as indicated in the class
advancement table in the descriptions of each class.
Ancestry feats are organized by level. As a starting
character, you can choose from only 1st-level ancestry
feats, but later choices can be made from any feat of
your level or lower. These feats also sometimes list
prerequisites—requirements that your character must
fulfill to select that feat.

Dwarf
Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels
and cities carved from solid rock. While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of
stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their
unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger,
they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and
caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.
If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails,
a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of
rugged toughness and deep wisdom—or at least dogged
conviction—you should play a dwarf.
You Might...
•	 Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter
the situation.
•	 Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and
insist upon it for all your gear.
•	 Don’t waver or back down once you’ve set your
mind to something.
Others Probably...
•	 See you as stubborn, though whether they see
this as an asset or a detriment changes from one
person to the next.
•	 Assume you are an expert in matters related to
stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems.
•	 Recognize the deep connection you have with your
family, heritage, and friends.
Physical Description
Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot
shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact
bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride
themselves on the length of their hair, which they often
braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent
specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and
honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male
dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.
Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the
age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more
value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to
each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can
live to around 350 years old.
Society
The ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell
long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies.
Today’s dwarves today retain many of the qualities that
propelled their people to greatness in ancient times:
fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors
ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties
with family and friends.
Dwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but
this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long
history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles
against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants,
goblinoids, orcs, and the horrors that dwell deep below
the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once
gained it is as strong as iron.
Core Rulebook

PAGE 36
================================================================================

While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural
divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of
similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork,
and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share
a hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.
Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is
forged just before a dwarf’s birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this
dagger to cut the infant’s umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.
Alignment and Religion
Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and
kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often
very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder—
especially when strong ale is involved.
The typical dwarf is lawful good or lawful neutral and prefers to worship deities of
those alignments. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is the dwarves’ primary deity, though
worship of Torag’s family members is also common.
Names
Dwarves honor their children with names taken from ancestors or dwarven
heroes, and it’s quite rare to invent a new name or to borrow a name from
another culture for a child. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to
list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and
honorifics. Dwarven names usually contain hard consonants and are rarely more
or fewer than two syllables.
Sample Names
Agna, Bodill, Dolgrin, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kazmuk, Kotri, Lupp, Morgrym,
Rogar, Rusilka, Torra, Yangrit
Dwarf Heritages
With their long family lines and hardy physiologies, dwarves take great pride in the
resilience their bloodlines provide. Choose one of the following dwarven heritages
at 1st level.
Ancient-Blooded Dwarf
Dwarven heroes of old could shrug off their enemies’ magic, and some of that
resistance manifests in you. You gain the Call on Ancient Blood reaction.
CALL ON ANCIENT BLOOD [reaction]
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet.
Your ancestors’ innate resistance to magic surges, before slowly ebbing down. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw and until the end of this turn.
Death Warden Dwarf
Your ancestors have been tomb guardians for generations, and the power they
cultivated to ward off necromancy has passed on to you. If you roll a success on a
saving throw against a necromancy effect, you get a critical success instead.
Forge Dwarf
You have a remarkable adaptation to hot environments from ancestors who inhabited
blazing deserts or volcanic chambers beneath the earth. This grants you fire resistance
equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental heat effects as
if they were one step less extreme (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat
becomes severe, and so on).

Rock Dwarf
Your ancestors lived and worked among the great ancient
stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This
makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex
DC against attempts to Shove or Trip you. This bonus
also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that
attempt to knock you prone.
In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10
feet or more, you are moved only half the distance.
Strong-Blooded Dwarf
Your blood runs hearty and strong, and you can shake
off toxins. You gain poison resistance equal to half your
level (minimum 1), and each of your successful saving
throws against a poison affliction reduces its stage by 2,
or by 1 for a virulent poison. Each critical success against
an ongoing poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a
virulent poison.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a dwarf, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
DWARVEN LORE
FEAT 1
DWARF
You eagerly absorbed the old stories and traditions of your
ancestors, your gods, and your people, studying in subjects
and techniques passed down for generation upon generation.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and
Religion. If you would automatically become trained in one
of those skills (from your background or class, for example),
you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also
become trained in Dwarven Lore.
DWARVEN WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
DWARF
Your kin have instilled in you an affinity for hard-hitting
weapons, and you prefer these to more elegant arms. You are
trained with the battle axe, pick, and warhammer.
You also gain access to all uncommon dwarf weapons. For
the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial dwarf
weapons are simple weapons and advanced dwarf weapons
are martial weapons.
ROCK RUNNER
FEAT 1
DWARF
Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving
across uneven surfaces. You can ignore difficult terrain caused
by rubble and uneven ground made of stone and earth.
In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on
narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you
aren’t flat-footed, and when you roll a success at one of these
Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success instead.
STONECUNNING
FEAT 1
DWARF
You have a knack for noticing even small inconsistencies and
craftsmanship techniques in the stonework around you. You
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to notice
unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover
mechanical traps made of stone or hidden within stone.
If you aren’t using the Seek action or searching, the GM
automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual
stonework anyway. This check doesn’t gain the circumstance
bonus, and it takes a –2 circumstance penalty.
UNBURDENED IRON
FEAT 1
DWARF
You’ve learned techniques first devised by your ancestors
during their ancient wars, allowing you to comfortably wear
massive suits of armor. Ignore the reduction to your Speed
from any armor you wear.
In addition, any time you’re taking a penalty to your Speed
from some other reason (such as from the encumbered
condition or from a spell), deduct 5 feet from the penalty.
For example, the encumbered condition normally gives a
–10-foot penalty to Speed, but it gives you only a –5-foot
penalty. If your Speed is taking multiple penalties, pick only
one penalty to reduce.
VENGEFUL HATRED
FEAT 1
DWARF
You heart aches for vengeance against those who have
wronged your people. Choose one of the following dwarven
ancestral foes when you gain Vengeful Hatred: drow, duergar,
giant, or orc. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage
with weapons and unarmed attacks against creatures with
that trait. If your attack would deal more than one weapon die
of damage (as is common at higher levels than 1st), the bonus
is equal to the number of weapon dice or unarmed attack dice.
In addition, if a creature critically succeeds at an attack
against you and deals damage to you, you gain your bonus
to damage against that creature for 1 minute regardless of
whether it has the chosen trait.
Special Your GM can add appropriate creature traits to the
ancestral foes list if your character is from a community that
commonly fights other types of enemies.
5TH LEVEL
BOULDER ROLL [two-actions]
FEAT 5
DWARF
Prerequisites Rock Runner
Your dwarven build allows you to push foes around, just like
Core Rulebook
36

PAGE 38
================================================================================

a mighty boulder tumbles through a subterranean cavern. Take a Step into the square of
a foe that is your size or smaller, and the foe must move into the empty space directly
behind it. The foe must move even if doing so places it in harm’s way. The foe can attempt
a Fortitude saving throw against your Athletics DC to block your Step. If the foe attempts
this saving throw, unless it critically succeeds, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your
level plus your Strength modifier.
If the foe can’t move into an empty space (if it is surrounded by solid objects or other
creatures, for example), your Boulder Roll has no effect.
DWARVEN WEAPON CUNNING
FEAT 5
DWARF
Prerequisites Dwarven Weapon Familiarity
You’ve learned cunning techniques to get the best effects out of your dwarven weapons.
Whenever you critically hit using a battle axe, pick, warhammer, or a dwarf weapon, you
apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
9TH LEVEL
MOUNTAIN’S STOUTNESS
FEAT 9
DWARF
Your hardiness lets you withstand more punishment than most before going down.
Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level. You also decrease the DC of recovery
checks when you have the dying condition by 1.
If you also have the Toughness feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat
are cumulative, and you decrease the DC of recovery
checks by 4.
STONEWALKER
FEAT 9
DWARF
You have a deep reverence for and connection
to stone. You gain meld into stone as a 3rd‑level
divine innate spell that you can cast once
per day.
If you have the Stonecunning dwarf ancestry
feat, you can attempt to find unusual stonework and
stonework traps that require legendary proficiency
in Perception. If you have both Stonecunning and
legendary proficiency in Perception, when
you’re not Seeking and the GM rolls a secret
check for you to notice unusual stonework,
you keep the bonus from Stonecunning and
don’t take the –2 circumstance penalty.
13TH LEVEL
DWARVEN WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
DWARF
Prerequisites Dwarven Weapon Familiarity
Your dwarven affinity blends with your training,
granting you great skill with dwarven weapons.
Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you
expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also
gain that proficiency for battle axes, picks, warhammers,
and all dwarven weapons in which you are trained.
DWARVEN
ADVENTURERS
Dwarven adventurers tend to
work as treasure hunters or
sellswords. They often leave their
citadels and subterranean cities
in search of wealth to enrich their
homeland or to reclaim long-lost
dwarven treasures or lands taken
by the enemies of their kin.
Typical dwarven backgrounds
include acolyte, artisan, merchant,
miner, and warrior. Dwarves excel
at many of the martial classes,
such as barbarian, fighter, monk,
and ranger, but they also make
excellent clerics and druids.

================================================================================

Elf
As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can
come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving the world in ancient times, they
returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most
notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves
are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among
themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on
living up to these ideals.
hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment
in which you live.
Others Probably...
• Focus on your appearance, either admiring
your grace or treating you as if you’re
physically fragile.
•	Assume you practice archery, cast
spells, fight demons, and have perfected
one or more fine arts.
Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect,
and mysterious charm in a way that is practically
magnetic to members of other ancestries. They
are often voraciously intellectual, though their
studies delve into a level of detail
that most shorter-lived peoples
find excessive or inefficient.
Valuing kindness and beauty,
elves ever strive to improve
their manners, appearance,
and culture.
Elves are often rather
private people, steeped in
the secrets of their groves and
kinship groups. They’re slow to
build friendships outside their
kinsfolk, but for a specific reason:
they subtly and deeply attune
to their environment and their
companions. There’s a physical
element to this attunement, but
it
isn’t
only
superficial.
Elves
who
spend
their
lives
among
shorter‑lived peoples often develop
a skewed perception of their own
mortality and tend to become
morose after watching generation
after generation of companions
age and die. These elves are called
the Forlorn.
If you want a character who is
magical, mystical, and mysterious,
you should play an elf.
You Might...
•	 Carefully
curate
your
relationships with people
with shorter lifespans, either
keeping a careful emotional
distance or resigning yourself
to outliving them.
•	 Adopt specialized or obscure interests
simply for the sake of mastering them.
•	 Have features such as eye color, skin tone,
• Worry that you privately look down on
them, or feel like you’re condescending
and aloof.
Physical Description
While generally taller than humans, elves
possess a fragile grace, accentuated by
long features and sharply pointed ears.
Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped,
featuring large and vibrant-colored
pupils that make up the entire visible
portion of the eye. These pupils give
them an alien look and allow them to see
sharply even in very little light.
Elves
gradually
adapt
to
their
environment and their companions,
and they often take on physical traits
reflecting their surroundings. An elf who
has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries,
for example, might exhibit verdant hair and
gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a
desert might have golden pupils and skin.
Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends
Core Rulebook
38

PAGE 40
================================================================================

to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales
wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live
in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.
Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren’t
considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing
of their first century, once they’ve experienced more, held several occupations, and
outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600
years old.
Society
Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago,
long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They’ve since returned,
but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make
elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon
their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep
appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.
Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore
multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits
her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but
these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.
Alignment and Religion
Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their
hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of
all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former
for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the
most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to
the extreme.
Names
An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname
when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in
the elf’s life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by
associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and
are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in
“-el” or “-ara” that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables
to avoid sounding too elven.
Sample Names
Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal,
Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon
Elf Heritages
Elves live long lives and adapt to their environment after dwelling there for a long
time. Choose one of the following elven heritages at 1st level.
Arctic Elf
You dwell deep in the frozen north and have gained incredible resilience against cold
environments, granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You
treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold
becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Cavern Elf
You were born or spent many years in underground tunnels or caverns where light
is scarce. You gain darkvision.

Seer Elf
You have an inborn ability to detect and understand
magical phenomena. You can cast the detect magic cantrip
as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to
a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to
checks to Identify Magic and to Decipher Writing of
a magical nature. These skill actions typically use the
Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion skill.
Whisper Elf
Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest
whispers of sound. As long as you can hear normally, you
can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in
a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone. You also gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures
that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.
Woodland Elf
You’re adapted to life in the forest or the deep jungle,
and you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your
advantage. When Climbing trees, vines, and other foliage,
you move at half your Speed on a success and at full
Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed
on a success if you have Quick Climb). This doesn’t affect
you if you’re using a climb Speed.
You can always use the Take Cover action when you
are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you’re not
next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As an elf, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
ANCESTRAL LONGEVITY
FEAT 1
ELF
Prerequisites at least 100 years old
You have accumulated a vast array of lived knowledge over
the years. During your daily preparations, you can reflect
upon your life experiences to gain the trained proficiency
rank in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts until
you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you
can’t use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent
character option like a feat.
ELVEN LORE
FEAT 1
ELF
You’ve studied in traditional elven arts, learning about
arcane magic and the world around you. You gain the
trained proficiency rank in Arcana and Nature. If you would
automatically become trained in one of those skills (from
your background or class, for example), you instead become
trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in
Elven Lore.
ELVEN WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
ELF
You favor bows and other elegant weapons. You are trained
with longbows, composite longbows, longswords, rapiers,
shortbows, and composite shortbows.
In addition, you gain access to all uncommon elf weapons.
For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial elf
weapons are simple weapons and advanced elf weapons are
martial weapons.
FORLORN
FEAT 1
ELF
Watching your friends age and die fills you with moroseness
that protects you against harmful emotions. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.
If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion
effect, you get a critical success instead.
NIMBLE ELF
FEAT 1
ELF
Your muscles are tightly honed. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.
OTHERWORLDLY MAGIC
FEAT 1
ELF
Your elven magic manifests as a simple arcane spell, even if
you aren’t formally trained in magic. Choose one cantrip from
the arcane spell list (page 307). You can cast this cantrip as an
arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell
level equal to half your level rounded up.
UNWAVERING MIEN
FEAT 1
ELF
Your mystic control and meditations allow you to resist
external influences upon your consciousness. Whenever you
are affected by a mental effect that lasts at least 2 rounds, you
can reduce the duration by 1 round.
You still require natural sleep, but you treat your saving
throws against effects that would cause you to fall asleep as
one degree of success better. This protects only against sleep
effects, not against other forms of falling unconscious.
5TH LEVEL
AGELESS PATIENCE
FEAT 5
ELF
You work at a pace born from longevity that enhances your
thoroughness. You can voluntarily spend twice as much
time as normal on a Perception check or skill check to gain
a +2 circumstance bonus to that check. You also don’t treat
a natural 1 as worse than usual on these checks; you get a
Core Rulebook
40

PAGE 42
================================================================================

critical failure only if your result is 10 lower than the DC. For example, you could get these
benefits if you spent 2 actions to Seek, which normally takes 1 action. You can get these
benefits during exploration by taking twice as long exploring as normal, or in downtime by
spending twice as much downtime.
The GM might determine a situation doesn’t grant you a benefit if a delay would
be directly counterproductive to your success, such as a tense negotiation with an
impatient creature.
ELVEN WEAPON ELEGANCE
FEAT 5
ELF
Prerequisites Elven Weapon Familiarity
You are attuned to the weapons of your elven ancestors and are particularly deadly when
using them. Whenever you critically hit using an elf weapon or one of the weapons listed in
Elven Weapon Familiarity, you apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
9TH LEVEL
ELF STEP [one-action] 
FEAT 9
ELF
You move in a graceful dance, and even your steps are broad. You Step 5 feet twice.
EXPERT LONGEVITY
FEAT 9

Prerequisites Ancestral Longevity
You’ve continued to refine the knowledge and skills you’ve gained through
your life. When you choose a skill in which to become trained with
Ancestral Longevity, you can also choose a skill in which you are already
trained and become an expert in that skill. This lasts until your Ancestral
Longevity expires.
When the effects of Ancestral Longevity and Expert Longevity expire, you can
retrain one of your skill increases. The skill increase you gain from this retraining must
either make you trained in the skill you chose with Ancestral Longevity or make you an
expert in the skill you chose with Expert Longevity.

Gnome
Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While
it’s unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern
gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as
naivete. These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as
spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features
that further reflect their otherworldly origins.
Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly
wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave
off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people.
This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who
fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences,
in the gnomes’ absence of crucial magical essence
from the First World. Gnomes latch onto a source of
localized magic where they live, typically primal magic,
as befits their fey lineage, but this isn’t enough to avoid
the Bleaching unless they supplement this magic with
new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the
color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those
affected into states of deep depression that eventually
claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive
this scourge, becoming deeply morose
and wise survivors known
as bleachlings.
If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm
and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should
play a gnome.
You Might...
•	 Embrace learning and hop from one area of study
to another without warning.
•	 Rush into action before fully taking stock of the
entire situation.
•	 Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience
with those who can’t keep up.
Others Probably...
•	 Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with
which you approach new situations.
•	 Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt
to your rapid changes of direction.
•	 See you as unpredictable, flighty, unreliable, or
even reckless.
Physical Description
Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh
little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide
range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes
that haven’t begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and
eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant
colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly
narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and
pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale
blue. Gnomes’ large eyes and dense facial muscles allow
them to be particularly expressive in their emotions.
Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age
of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike
curiosity about the world even into adulthood.
A gnome can theoretically live to any age if
she can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely,
but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than
around 400 years.
Society
While most gnomes adopt some of the cultural
practices of the region in which they live, they tend
to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to
fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority
gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely
Core Rulebook
42

PAGE 44
================================================================================

of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to
move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their
own. No gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and gnomes
wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if they had one.
By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their
course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new
experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities
raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. As adults depart the
settlement, unrelated adolescents sometimes tag along, creating adopted families to
journey together.
Alignment and Religion
Though gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing
methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place. They are prone to
fits of powerful emotion, and they are often good but rarely lawful. Gnomes most
commonly worship deities that value individuality and nature, such as Cayden
Cailean, Desna, Gozreh, and Shelyn.
Names
Gnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. They have little interest in
familial names, and most children receive their names purely on a parent’s whim.
Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce,
and they often go by shorter nicknames. Some even collect and chronicle
these nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it’s
considered to be.
Sample Names
Abroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai,
Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie
Gnome Heritages
A diverse collection of oddballs, gnomes have all sorts of peculiar strains among
their bloodlines. Choose one of the following gnome heritages at 1st level.
Chameleon Gnome
The color of your hair and skin is mutable, possibly due to latent magic. You can
slowly change the vibrancy and the exact color, and the coloration can be different
across your body, allowing you to create patterns or other colorful designs. It takes
a single action for minor localized shifts and up to an hour for dramatic shifts
throughout your body. While you’re asleep, the colors shift on their own in tune
with your dreams, giving you an unusual coloration each morning. When you’re in
an area where your coloration is roughly similar to the environment (for instance,
forest green in a forest), you can use the single action to make minor localized
shifts designed to help you blend into your surroundings. This grants you a +2
circumstance bonus to Stealth checks until your surroundings shift in coloration
or pattern.
Fey-touched Gnome
The blood of the fey is so strong within you that you’re truly one of them. You gain
the fey trait, in addition to the gnome and humanoid traits. Choose one cantrip
from the primal spell list (page 314). You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell
at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
You can change this cantrip to a different one from the same list once per day by
meditating to realign yourself with the First World; this is a 10-minute activity that
has the concentrate trait.

================================================================================

Sensate Gnome
You see all colors as brighter, hear all sounds as richer,
and especially smell all scents with incredible detail.
You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of
30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to
determine the exact location of a creature (as explained
on page 465). The GM will usually double the range if
you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range
if you’re upwind.
In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
Perception checks whenever you’re trying to locate an
undetected creature that is within the range of your scent.
Umbral Gnome
Whether from a connection to dark or shadowy fey,
from the underground deep gnomes also known as
svirfneblin, or another source, you can see in complete
darkness. You gain darkvision.
Wellspring Gnome
Some other source of magic has a greater hold on
you than the primal magic of your fey lineage does.
This connection might come from an occult plane
or an ancient occult song; a deity, celestial, or fiend;
magical effluent left behind by a mage war; or ancient
rune magic.
Choose arcane, divine, or occult. You gain one
cantrip from that magical tradition’s spell list (pages
307–315). You can cast this spell as an innate spell
at will, as a spell of your chosen tradition. A cantrip
is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level
rounded up. Whenever you gain a primal innate spell
from a gnome ancestry feat, change its tradition from
primal to your chosen tradition.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th level). As a gnome, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
ANIMAL ACCOMPLICE
FEAT 1
GNOME
You build a rapport with an animal, which becomes magically
bonded to you. You gain a familiar using the rules on page
217. The type of animal is up to you, but most gnomes choose
animals with a burrow Speed.
BURROW ELOCUTIONIST
FEAT 1
GNOME
You recognize the chittering of ground creatures as its own
peculiar language. You can ask questions of, receive answers
from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals that have a
burrow Speed, such as badgers, ground squirrels, moles, and
prairie dogs. The GM determines which animals count for
this ability.
FEY FELLOWSHIP
FEAT 1
GNOME
Your enhanced fey connection affords you a warmer reception
from creatures of the First World as well as tools to foil their
tricks. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to both Perception
checks and saving throws against fey.
In addition, whenever you meet a fey creature in a social
situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to
Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to
converse for 1 minute. You take a –5 penalty to the check.
If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and
attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than
accepting the failure or critical failure result.
Special If you have the Glad-Hand skill feat, you don’t take
the penalty on your immediate Diplomacy check if the target
is a fey.
FIRST WORLD MAGIC
FEAT 1
GNOME
Your connection to the First World grants you a primal innate
spell, much like those of the fey. Choose one cantrip from the
primal spell list (page 314). You can cast this spell as a primal
innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level
equal to half your level rounded up.
GNOME OBSESSION
FEAT 1
GNOME
You might have a flighty nature, but when a topic captures
your attention, you dive into it headfirst. Pick a Lore skill. You
gain the trained proficiency rank in that skill. At 2nd level,
you gain expert proficiency in the chosen Lore as well as the
Lore granted by your background, if any. At 7th level you gain
master proficiency in these Lore skills, and at 15th level you
gain legendary proficiency in them.
GNOME WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
GNOME
You favor unusual weapons tied to your people, such as blades
with curved and peculiar shapes. You are trained with the
glaive and kukri.
In addition, you gain access to all uncommon gnome
weapons. For the purpose of determining your proficiency,
martial gnome weapons are simple weapons and advanced
gnome weapons are martial weapons.
ILLUSION SENSE
FEAT 1
GNOME
Your ancestors spent their days cloaked and cradled in
illusions, and as a result, sensing illusion magic is second
nature to you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to both
Perception checks and Will saves against illusions.
Core Rulebook
44

PAGE 46
================================================================================

When you come within 10 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret
check for you to disbelieve it, even if you didn’t spend an action to Interact with the illusion.
5TH LEVEL
ANIMAL ELOCUTIONIST
FEAT 5
GNOME
Prerequisites Burrow Elocutionist
You hear animal sounds as conversations instead of unintelligent noise, and can respond in turn.
You can speak to all animals, not just animals with a burrow Speed. You gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to Make an Impression on animals (which usually uses the Diplomacy skill).
ENERGIZED FONT [one-action]
FEAT 5
GNOME
Prerequisites focus pool, at least one innate spell from a gnome heritage or ancestry feat that
shares a tradition with at least one of your focus spells
Frequency once per day
The magic within you provides increased energy you can use to focus. You regain 1 Focus
Point, up to your usual maximum.
GNOME WEAPON INNOVATOR
FEAT 5
GNOME
Prerequisites Gnome Weapon Familiarity
You produce outstanding results when wielding unusual weapons. Whenever you
critically hit using a glaive, kukri, or gnome weapon, you apply the weapon’s
critical specialization effect.
9TH LEVEL
FIRST WORLD ADEPT
FEAT 9
GNOME
Prerequisites at least one primal innate spell
Over time your fey magic has grown stronger. You gain faerie fire and invisibility as
2nd-level primal innate spells. You can cast each of these
primal innate spells once per day.
VIVACIOUS CONDUIT
FEAT 9
GNOME
Your connection to the First World has grown, and
its positive energy flows into you rapidly. If you rest
for 10 minutes, you gain Hit Points equal to your Constitution
modifier × half your level. This is cumulative with any healing you
receive from Treat Wounds.
13TH LEVEL
GNOME WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
GNOME
Prerequisites Gnome Weapon Familiarity
Your gnome affinity blends with your class training, granting you great skill with gnome
weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency
in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the glaive, kukri, and all
gnome weapons in which you are trained.
GNOME ADVENTURERS
Adventure is not so much a
choice as a necessity for most
gnomes. Adventuring gnomes
often claim mementos, allowing
them to remember and relive
their most exciting stories.
Gnomes often consider the
entertainer, merchant, or nomad
backgrounds. In addition, the
animal whisperer, barkeep,
gambler, and tinker backgrounds
are particularly appropriate.
Gnomes’ connection to magic
makes spellcasting classes
particularly thematic for you,
especially classes that match the
tradition of your primal innate
spells, such as druid or primal
sorcerer, though wellspring
gnomes might choose others.

================================================================================

Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love
songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate
reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many
for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great
changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more
goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among
goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their
old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible
degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or
fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs.
Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’
trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.
Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their
reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel
to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and
many work twice as hard at proving their worth.
If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic,
and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.
You Might...
•	 Strive to prove that you have a place among other
civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.
•	 Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to
protect yourself and your friends from danger.
•	 Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry
(and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.
Others Probably...
•	 Work to ensure you don’t accidentally (or
intentionally) set too many things on fire.
•	 Assume you can’t—or won’t—read.
•	 Wonder how you survive given your ancestry’s
typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior,
and love of fire.
Physical Description
Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies,
scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large
ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to
gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes.
Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little
or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow
constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat
constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more
common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins
usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of
power or fortune.
Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood
4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more,
but without anyone to protect them from each other or
themselves, few live past 20 years of age.
Society
Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small
tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred,
Goblin
The convoluted histories other people cling to don’t interest goblins. These small folk live
in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades
ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are
happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They
strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To
tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.
Core Rulebook
46

PAGE 48
================================================================================

though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a
notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal
elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer
their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins
than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.
Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who
have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their
own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to
colloquially as “longshanks,” won’t treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks
is difficult for a goblin, and it’s been only in recent years that such a partnership
has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly,
and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.
Alignment and Religion
Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they’re
rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good.
Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their
own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they
find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of
divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend
time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though,
and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.
Names
Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short
enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often
picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier.
Since there aren’t any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children
often name themselves once they’re old enough to do something resembling talking.
Sample Names
Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak,
Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini
Goblin Heritages
Goblins, especially those of different tribes, have all sorts of physiological differences,
which they often discover only through hazardous “experiments.” Choose one of the
following goblin heritages at 1st level.
Charhide Goblin
Your ancestors have always had a connection to fire and a thicker skin, which allows
you to resist burning. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).
You can also recover from being on fire more easily. Your flat check to remove
persistent fire damage is DC  10 instead of DC  15, which is reduced to DC 5 if
another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help.
Irongut Goblin
You can subsist on food that most folks would consider spoiled. You can keep yourself
fed with poor meals in a settlement as long as garbage is readily available, without using
the Subsist downtime activity. You can eat and drink things when you are sickened.
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against afflictions, against
gaining the sickened condition, and to remove the sickened condition. When you
roll a success on a Fortitude save affected by this bonus, you get a critical success
instead. All these benefits apply only when the affliction or condition resulted from
something you ingested.

You are acclimated to living in frigid lands and have
skin ranging from sky blue to navy in color, as well as
blue fur. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level
(minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if
they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes
extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
Unbreakable Goblin
You’re able to bounce back from injuries easily due to an
exceptionally thick skull, cartilaginous bones, or some
other mixed blessing. You gain 10 Hit Points from your
ancestry instead of 6. When you fall, reduce the falling

gain a +1 status bonus to any persistent fire damage you deal.
CITY SCAVENGER
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
You know that the greatest treasures often look like refuse, and
you scoff at those who throw away perfectly good scraps. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Subsist, and you can
use Society or Survival when you Subsist in a settlement.
When you Subsist in a city, you also gather valuable junk
that silly longshanks threw away. You can Earn Income using
Society or Survival in the same time as you Subsist, without
spending any additional days of downtime. You also gain a +1
circumstance bonus to this check.
Special If you have the irongut goblin heritage, increase the

GOBLIN LORE
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
You’ve picked up skills and tales from your goblin community.
You gain the trained proficiency rank in Nature and Stealth.

become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained
in Goblin Lore.
GOBLIN SCUTTLE [reaction]
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
Trigger An ally ends a move action adjacent to you.
You take advantage of your ally’s movement to adjust your

silly and repetitive lyrics. Attempt a Performance check
against the Will DC of a single enemy within 30 feet. This has
all the usual traits and restrictions of a Performance check.
You can affect up to two targets within range if you have
expert proficiency in Performance, four if you have master
proficiency, and eight if you have legendary proficiency.

the weapons of your people are as effective as they are sharp.
You are trained with the dogslicer and horsechopper.
In addition, you gain access to all uncommon goblin weapons.
For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial goblin
weapons are simple weapons and advanced goblin weapons are
martial weapons.
JUNK TINKER
FEAT 1
GOBLIN
You can make useful tools out of even twisted or rusted scraps.
When using the Crafting skill to Craft, you can make level 0
items, including weapons but not armor, out of junk. This reduces
the Price to one-quarter the usual amount but always results in a
shoddy item. Shoddy items normally give a penalty, but you don’t
take this penalty when using shoddy items you made.
You can also incorporate junk to save money while you Craft
any item. This grants you a discount on the item as if you had
spent 1 additional day working to reduce the cost, but the item
is obviously made of junk. At the GM’s discretion, this might
affect the item’s resale value depending on the buyer’s tastes.
ROUGH RIDER

GOBLIN ADVENTURERS
To some degree, almost every
goblin is an adventurer, surviving
life on the edge using skill and
wits. Goblins explore and hunt
for treasures by nature, though
some become true adventurers
in their own rights, often after
being separated from their group
or tribe.
Goblins often have the
acrobat, criminal, entertainer,
gladiator, hunter, and street

playing an alchemist, since many
goblins love fire, or a bard, since

them to the pursuit of magical
classes such as sorcerer.

================================================================================

Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size
or, worse, treat them like children. Halflings use these
prejudices and misconceptions to their advantage, gaining
access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring
mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered
by wisdom and caution, leading to calculated risks and
narrow escapes.
While their wanderlust and curiosity sometimes drive
them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties
to house and home, often spending above their means to
achieve comfort in their homelife.
If you want to play a character who must contend with
these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort,
you should play a halfling.
You Might...
•	 Get along well with a wide variety of people and
enjoy meeting new friends.
•	 Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity,
even when you know it’s going to lead to trouble.
•	 Hold a deep and personal hatred of the practice of
slavery and devote yourself to freeing those who
still labor against their will.
Others Probably...
•	 Appreciate your ability to always find a silver
lining or something to laugh about, no matter
how dire the situation.
•	 Think you bring good luck with you.
•	 Underestimate your strength, endurance, and
fighting prowess.
Physical Description
Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like
smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3
feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some
looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger
heads and others having proportions closer to those of
a human child.
Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than
wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly
calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick,
often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned
feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades
like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light
golden blond to raven black.
Halfling
Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages.
Instead, they frequently live among humans within the walls of larger cities, carving out
small communities alongside taller folk. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the
shadows of their larger neighbors, while others prefer a nomadic existence, traveling the
world and taking advantage of opportunities and adventures as they come.
Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and
driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for
their short stature with an abundance of bravado and
curiosity. At once excitable and easygoing, they are the
best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy
over violence. Even in the jaws of danger, halflings rarely
lose their sense of humor.
Core Rulebook
50

PAGE 52
================================================================================

Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live
to be around 150 years old.
Society
Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t usually tend to congregate.
They have no cultural homeland in the Inner Sea region, and they instead weave
themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever
living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service
jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling
from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often
travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends
and family.
Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves
in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding
their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches
both cultures.
Alignment and Religion
Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren’t afraid to do what
needs to be done in order to survive. Halfling alignments vary, typically closely in
keeping with the alignment of the other ancestries that live around them. Halflings
favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber,
and many appreciate Cayden Cailean’s role as a liberator, as well as any religions
common among other ancestries around them.
Names
Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids
hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long
or complex names as a sign of arrogance. This goes only for their own people,
however—halflings have names that suit them, and they understand that elves and
humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics. Humans in particular
have a tendency to refer to halflings by nicknames, with “Lucky” being common to
the point of absurdity.
Sample Names
Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka,
Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra
Halfling Heritages
Living across the land, halflings of different heritages might appear in regions far
from are their ancestors lived. Choose one of the following halfling heritages at
1st level.
Gutsy Halfling
Your family line is known for keeping a level head and staving off fear when the
chips were down, making them wise leaders and sometimes even heroes. When
you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical
success instead.
Hillock Halfling
Accustomed to a calm life in the hills, your people find rest and relaxation especially
replenishing, particularly when indulging in creature comforts. When you regain Hit
Points overnight, add your level to the Hit Points regained. When anyone uses the
Medicine skill to Treat your Wounds, you can eat a snack to add your level to the Hit
Points you regain from their treatment.

================================================================================

Nomadic Halfling
Your ancestors have traveled from place to place for
generations, never content to settle down. You gain two
additional languages of your choice, chosen from among
the common and uncommon languages available to you,
and every time you take the Multilingual feat, you gain
another new language.
Twilight Halfling
Your ancestors performed many secret acts under the
concealing cover of dusk, whether for good or ill, and
over time they developed the ability to see in twilight
beyond even the usual keen sight of halflings. You gain
low-light vision.
Wildwood Halfling
You hail from deep in a jungle or forest, and you’ve
learned how to use your small size to wriggle through
undergrowth, vines, and other obstacles. You ignore
difficult terrain from trees, foliage, and undergrowth.
Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a halfling, you select from
among the following ancestry feats.
1ST LEVEL
DISTRACTING SHADOWS
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You have learned to remain hidden by using larger folk as
a distraction to avoid drawing attention to yourself. You
can use creatures that are at least one size larger than you
(usually Medium or larger) as cover for the Hide and Sneak
actions, though you still can’t use such creatures as cover for
other uses, such as the Take Cover action.
HALFLING LORE
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You’ve dutifully learned how to keep your balance and how
to stick to the shadows where it’s safe, important skills
passed down through generations of halfling tradition. You
gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Stealth.
If you would automatically become trained in one of those
skills (from your background or class, for example), you
instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also
become trained in Halfling Lore.
HALFLING LUCK [free-action]
FEAT 1
FORTUNE
HALFLING
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail a skill check or saving throw.
Your happy-go-lucky nature makes it seem like misfortune
avoids you, and to an extent, that might even be true. You
can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new
result, even if it’s worse than your first roll.
HALFLING WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You favor traditional halfling weapons, so you’ve learned how
to use them more effectively. You have the trained proficiency
with the sling, halfling sling staff, and shortsword.
In addition, you gain access to all uncommon halfling
weapons. For you, martial halfling weapons are simple
weapons, and advanced halfling weapons are martial weapons.
SURE FEET
FEAT 1
HALFLING
Whether keeping your balance or scrambling up a tricky
climb, your hairy, calloused feet easily find purchase. If
you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Balance or an
Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
You’re not flat-footed when you attempt to Balance or Climb.
TITAN SLINGER
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You have learned how to use your sling to fell enormous
creatures. When you hit on an attack with a sling against
a Large or larger creature, increase the size of the weapon
damage die by one step (details on increasing weapon
damage die sizes can be found on page 279).
UNFETTERED HALFLING
FEAT 1
HALFLING
You were forced into service as a laborer, either pressed into
indentured servitude or shackled by the evils of slavery, but
you’ve since escaped and have trained to ensure you’ll never
be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to
Escape or a saving throw against an effect that would impose
the grabbed or restrained condition on you, you get a critical
success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check
to Grapple you, they get a critical failure instead. If a creature
uses the Grab ability on you, it must succeed at an Athletics
check to grab you instead of automatically grabbing you.
WATCHFUL HALFLING
FEAT 1
HALFLING
Your communal lifestyle causes you to pay close attention
to the people around you, allowing you to more easily notice
when they act out of character. You gain a +2 circumstance
bonus to Perception checks when using the Sense Motive
basic action to notice enchanted or possessed characters. If
you aren’t actively using Sense Motive on an enchanted or
possessed character, the GM rolls a secret check, without the
usual circumstance and with a –2 circumstance penalty, for you
to potentially notice the enchantment or possession anyway.
In addition to using it for skill checks, you can use the Aid
basic action to grant a bonus to another creature’s saving
throw or other check to overcome enchantment or possession.
Core Rulebook
52

PAGE 54
================================================================================

As usual for Aid, you need to prepare by using an action on your turn to encourage the
creature to fight against the effect.
5TH LEVEL
CULTURAL ADAPTABILITY
FEAT 5
HALFLING
During your adventures, you’ve honed your ability to adapt to the culture of the predominant
ancestry around you. You gain the Adopted Ancestry general feat, and you also gain one
1st-level ancestry feat from the ancestry you chose for the Adopted Ancestry feat.
HALFLING WEAPON TRICKSTER
FEAT 5
HALFLING
Prerequisites Halfling Weapon Familiarity
You are particularly adept at fighting with your people’s favored weapons. Whenever you
critically succeed at an attack roll using a shortsword, a sling, or a halfling weapon, you
apply the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
9TH LEVEL
GUIDING LUCK
FEAT 9
HALFLING
Prerequisites Halfling Luck
Your luck guides you to look the right way and aim your blows unerringly. You can use
Halfling Luck twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you
fail a Perception check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger.
IRREPRESSIBLE
FEAT 9
HALFLING
You are easily able to ward off attempts to play on your fears and
emotions. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an
emotion effect, you get a critical success instead. If your heritage
is gutsy halfling, when you roll a critical failure on a saving throw
against an emotion effect, you get a failure instead.
13TH LEVEL
CEASELESS SHADOWS
FEAT 13
HALFLING
Prerequisites Distracting Shadows
You excel at going unnoticed, especially among a crowd. You no longer
need to have cover or be concealed to Hide or Sneak. If you would have
lesser cover from creatures, you gain cover and can Take Cover, and if
you would have cover from creatures, you gain greater cover.
HALFLING WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
HALFLING
Prerequisites Halfling, Weapon Familiarity
Your halfling affinity blends with your class training, granting you great
skill with halfling weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants
you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also
gain that proficiency in the sling, halfling sling staff, shortsword, and all
halfling weapons in which you are trained.
HALFLING ADVENTURERS
Halflings’ natural wanderlust
and opportunistic nature make
them ideal adventurers. Many
people put up with their vivacious
attitudes in return for the natural
talents they provide and the
popular superstition that traveling
with a halfling is good luck.
Typical backgrounds for
halflings include acrobat,
criminal, emissary, entertainer,
laborer, and street urchin.
Halflings make great clerics
and rogues, but many also
become monks or rangers.

Humans’ ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential
have led to their status as the world’s predominant ancestry.
Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things,
and their citizens carve names for themselves with the
strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells.
Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut
from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of
them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of
the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to
lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for
no better reason than because they can.
If you want a character who can be
just about anything, you should play
a human.
You Might...
•	 Strive
to
achieve
greatness, either in
your own right or on
behalf of a cause.
•	 Seek to understand your
purpose in the world.
•	 Cherish your relationships
with family and friends.
Others Probably...
•	 Respect
your
flexibility,
your
adaptability, and—in most cases—
your open‑mindedness.
•	 Distrust your intentions, fearing
you seek only power or wealth.
•	 Aren’t sure what to expect
from you and are hesitant to
assume your intentions.
Physical Description
Humans’ physical characteristics
are as varied as the world’s
climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair
colors, body types, and facial features. Generally
speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to
the equator they or their ancestors lived.
Humans reach physical adulthood around
the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a
few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90
years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other
Human
As unpredictable and varied as any of Golarion’s peoples, humans have exceptional drive
and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity
rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies
throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the
realms around the Inner Sea.
ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of
both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves
and half-orcs.
Society
Human variety also manifests in terms of their
governments, attitudes, and social norms.
Though the oldest of human cultures can
trace their shared histories thousands of years
into the past,
when compared
to the societies
of the elves or
dwarves, human
civilizations seem in a
state of constant flux as
empires fragment and new
kingdoms subsume the old.
Alignment and Religion
Humanity is perhaps the most
heterogeneous of all the ancestries,
with a capacity for great evil and boundless
good. Some humans assemble into vast
raging
hordes,
while
others
build
sprawling cities. Considered as a whole,
most humans are neutral, yet they
tend to congregate into nations or
communities of a shared alignment,
or at least a shared tendency
toward an alignment. Humans
also worship a wide range
of gods and practice many
different religions, tending to
seek favor from any divine
being they encounter.
Names
Unlike many ancestral cultures, which
generally cleave to specific traditions and
shared histories, humanity’s diversity has resulted
in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of
northern tribes have different names than those
dwelling in southern nation‑states. Humans
throughout much of the world speak Common
(though some continents on Golarion have
Core Rulebook
54

PAGE 56
================================================================================

their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs
and appearances.
Ethnicities
 A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands—
populates the continents bordering Golarion’s Inner Sea. Human characters can be
any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home. Information about
Golarion’s human ethnicities appears on page 430 in Chapter 8.
Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known
as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.
Half-Elves
A half-elf is born to an elf and a human, or to two half-elves. The life of a half-elf
can be difficult, often marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-elves don’t have their own
homeland on Golarion, nor are populations of half-elves particularly tied to one
another, since they often have very disparate human and elven traditions. Instead,
most half-elves attempt to find acceptance in either human or elven settlements.
Half-elves often appear primarily human, with subtly pointed ears and a taller
stature than most full-blooded humans. Half-elves lack the almost alien eyes of their
elf parents, though they do have a natural presence—and often a striking beauty—
that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many
half‑elves have difficulty forming lasting bonds with either humans or elves due to the
distance they feel from both peoples as a whole.
Half-elves live longer than other humans, often reaching an age around 150 years.
This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with humans, knowing
that they’ll likely outlive their companions.
Playing a Half-Elf
You can create a half-elf character by selecting the half-elf heritage at 1st level. This
gives you access to elf and half-elf ancestry feats in addition to human ancestry feats.
You Might...
•	 Keep to yourself and find it difficult to form close bonds with others.
•	 Strongly embrace or reject one side or the other of your parentage.
•	 Identify strongly with and relate to other people with mixed ancestries.
Others Probably...
•	 Find you more attractive than humans and more approachable than elves.
•	 Dismiss your human ethnicity and culture in light of your elven heritage.
•	 Downplay the challenges of being caught between two cultures.
Half-Orcs
A half-orc is the offspring of a human and an orc, or of two half-orcs. Because some
intolerant people see orcs as more akin to monsters than people, they sometimes
hate and fear half-orcs simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-orcs
to the margins of society, where some find work in manual labor or as mercenaries,
and others fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can’t stand the indignities heaped on
them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek into the wilderness
to live in peace, apart from society’s judgment.
Humans often assume half-orcs are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-orcs rarely
find acceptance among societies with many such folk. To an orc tribe, a half-orc is
considered smart enough to make a good war leader but weaker physically than other
orcs. Many half-orcs thus end up having low status among orc tribes unless they can
prove their strength.

OTHER HALVES

ancestry. In these cases, the
GM will let you select the
half-elf or half-orc heritage
as the heritage for this other
ancestry. The most likely
other parent of a half-elf
are gnomes and halflings,
and the most likely parents
of a half-orc are goblins,
halflings, and dwarves.

A half-orc has a shorter lifespan than other humans,
living to be roughly 70 years old.
Playing a Half-Orc
You can create a half-orc character by selecting the
half‑orc heritage at 1st level. This gives you access to
orc and half‑orc ancestry feats in addition to human
ancestry feats.
You Might...
•	 Ignore, embrace, or actively counter the common
stereotypes about half-orcs.
•	 Make the most of your size and strength, either
physically or socially.
•	 Keep your distance from people of most other
ancestries, in case they unfairly reject you due to
your orc ancestors.
Others Probably...
•	 Assume you enjoy and excel at fighting but aren’t
inclined toward magical or intellectual pursuits.
•	 Pity you for the tragic circumstances they assume
were involved in your birth.
•	 Get out of your way and back down rather than
face your anger.
Human Heritages
Unlike other ancestries, humans don’t have significant
physiological differences defined by their lineage. Instead,
their heritages either reveal their potential as a people or
reflect lineages from multiple ancestries. Choose one of the
following human heritages at 1st level.
Half-Elf
Either one of your parents was an elf, or one or both
were half-elves. You have pointed ears and other telltale
signs of elf heritage. You gain the elf trait and low‑light
vision. In addition, you can select elf, half-elf, and
human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
Half-Orc
One of your parents was an orc, or one or both were
half-orcs. You have a green tinge to your skin and
other indicators of orc heritage. You gain the orc
trait and low‑light vision. In addition, you can select
orc, half‑orc, and human feats whenever you gain an
ancestry feat.
Skilled Heritage
Your ingenuity allows you to train in a wide variety of
skills. You become trained in one skill of your choice.
At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.
Versatile Heritage
Humanity’s versatility and ambition have fueled its
ascendance to be the most common ancestry in most
nations throughout the world. Select a general feat of
your choice for which you meet the prerequisites (as with
your ancestry feat, you can select this general feat at any
point during character creation).
Human Ancestry Feats
At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an
additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th,
9th, 13th, and 17th levels). As a human, you choose from
among the following ancestry feats.
Core Rulebook
56

PAGE 58
================================================================================

1ST LEVEL
ADAPTED CANTRIP
FEAT 1
HUMAN
Prerequisites spellcasting class feature
Through study of multiple magical traditions, you’ve altered
a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip
from a magical tradition other than your own. If you have a
spell repertoire or a spellbook, replace one of the cantrips you
know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you
prepare spells without a spellbook (if you’re a cleric or druid,
for example), one of your cantrips must always be the chosen
spell, and you prepare the rest normally. You can cast this
cantrip as a spell of your class’s tradition.
If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its
replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one.
COOPERATIVE NATURE
FEAT 1
HUMAN
The short human life span lends perspective and has taught
you from a young age to set aside differences and work with
others to achieve greatness. You gain a +4 circumstance
bonus on checks to Aid.
GENERAL TRAINING
FEAT 1
HUMAN
Your adaptability manifests in your mastery of a range of
useful abilities. You gain a 1st-level general feat. You must
meet the feat’s prerequisites, but if you select this feat during
character creation, you can select the feat later in the process
in order to determine which prerequisites you meet.
Special You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a
different feat each time.
HAUGHTY OBSTINACY
FEAT 1
HUMAN
Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you
around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a
mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions,
you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a
check to Coerce you using Intimidation, it gets a critical failure
instead (so it can’t try to Coerce you again for 1 week).
NATURAL AMBITION
FEAT 1
HUMAN
You were raised to be ambitious and always reach for the stars,
leading you to progress quickly in your chosen field. You gain a
1st-level class feat for your class. You must meet the prerequisites,
but you can select the feat later in the character creation process
in order to determine which prerequisites you meet.
NATURAL SKILL
FEAT 1
HUMAN
Your ingenuity allows you to learn a wide variety of skills. You
gain the trained proficiency rank in two skills of your choice.
UNCONVENTIONAL WEAPONRY
FEAT 1
HUMAN
You’ve familiarized yourself with a particular weapon, potentially
from another ancestry or culture. Choose an uncommon simple
or martial weapon with a trait corresponding to an ancestry
(such as dwarf, goblin, or orc) or that is common in another
culture. You gain access to that weapon, and for the purpose of
determining your proficiency, that weapon is a simple weapon.
If you are trained in all martial weapons, you can choose
an uncommon advanced weapon with such a trait. You gain
access to that weapon, and for the purpose of determining your
proficiency, that weapon is a martial weapon.
5TH LEVEL
ADAPTIVE ADEPT
FEAT 5
HUMAN
Prerequisites Adapted Cantrip, can cast 3rd-level spells
You’ve continued adapting your magic to blend your class’s
tradition with your adapted tradition. Choose a cantrip or
1st‑level spell from the same magical tradition as your cantrip
from Adapted Cantrip. You gain that spell, adding it to your spell
repertoire, spellbook, or prepared spells just like the cantrip from
Adapted Spell. You can cast this spell as a spell of your class’s
magical tradition. If you choose a 1st-level spell, you don’t gain
access to the heightened versions of that spell, meaning you can’t
prepare them if you prepare spells and you can’t learn them or
select the spell as a signature spell if you have a spell repertoire.
CLEVER IMPROVISER
FEAT 5
HUMAN
You’ve learned how to handle situations when you’re out of
your depth. You gain the Untrained Improvisation general
feat. In addition, you can attempt skill actions that normally
require you to be trained, even if you are untrained.
9TH LEVEL
COOPERATIVE SOUL
FEAT 9
HUMAN
Prerequisites Cooperative Nature
You have developed a soul-deep bond with your comrades and
maintain an even greater degree of cooperation with them. If you
are at least an expert in the skill you are Aiding, you get a success
on any outcome rolled to Aid other than a critical success.
INCREDIBLE IMPROVISATION [free-action]

A human with elf or orc blood is called a half-elf
or half-orc, respectively, which is represented by the
corresponding heritage. If you have the half-elf or half‑orc
heritage, you can select from additional ancestry feats not
available to other humans.
Half-Elf Ancestry Feats
The following feats are available to half-elves.
1ST LEVEL
ELF ATAVISM
FEAT 1
HALF-ELF
Your elven blood runs particularly strong, granting you features
far more elven than those of a typical half-elf. You may also
have been raised among elves, steeped in your elven ancestors’
heritage. You gain the benefits of the elf heritage of your elven
parent or ancestors. You typically can’t select a heritage that
depends on or improves an elven feature you don’t have. For
example, you couldn’t gain the cavern elf’s darkvision ability
if you didn’t have low-light vision. In these cases, at the GM’s
discretion, you might gain a different benefit.
Special You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you
can’t retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
5TH LEVEL
INSPIRE IMITATION
FEAT 5
HALF-ELF
 Your own actions inspire your allies to great
achievements. Whenever you critically succeed at
a skill check, you automatically qualify to use the Aid
reaction when attempting to help an ally using the same
skill, even without spending an action to prepare to do so.
SUPERNATURAL CHARM
FEAT 5
HALF-ELF
The elven magic in your blood manifests as a force you can use

to become more appealing or alluring. You can cast 1st‑level
charm as an arcane innate spell once per day.
Half-Orc Ancestry Feats
The following feats are available to half-orcs. Some of
these feats are common to people with orc blood, and
have the orc trait, while others are specific to half‑orcs
and have the half‑orc trait.
1ST LEVEL
MONSTROUS PEACEMAKER
FEAT 1
HALF-ORC
Your dual human and orc nature has given you a unique
perspective, allowing you to bridge the gap between humans
and the many intelligent creatures in the world that humans
consider monsters. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus
to Diplomacy checks against non-humanoid intelligent
creatures and against humanoids that are marginalized in
human society (at the GM’s discretion, but typically at least
including giants, goblins, kobolds, and orcs). You also gain
this bonus on Perception checks to Sense the Motives of
such creatures.
ORC FEROCITY [reaction]
FEAT 1
ORC
Frequency once per day
Trigger You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not
immediately killed.
Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, and you refuse to
fall from your injuries. You avoid being knocked out and remain
at 1 Hit Point, and your wounded condition increases by 1.
ORC SIGHT
FEAT 1
HALF-ORC
Prerequisites low-light vision
Your orc blood is strong enough to grant you the keen vision of
your orc forebears. You gain darkvision, allowing you to see in
darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light.
However, in darkness, you see in black and white only.
Special You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can’t
retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
ORC SUPERSTITION [reaction]
FEAT 1
CONCENTRATE
ORC
Trigger You attempt a saving throw against a spell or magical
effect, before rolling.
You defend yourself against magic by relying on techniques
derived from orc cultural superstitions. You gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your saving throw against the
triggering spell or magical effect.
ORC WEAPON FAMILIARITY
FEAT 1
ORC
In combat, you favor the brutal weapons that are traditional
for your orc ancestors. You are trained with the falchion
and greataxe. In addition, you gain access to all uncommon
orc weapons.
For you, martial orc weapons are simple weapons, and
advanced orc weapons are martial weapons.
5TH LEVEL
ORC WEAPON CARNAGE
FEAT 5
ORC
Prerequisites Orc Weapon Familiarity
You are brutally efficient with the weapons of your orc
ancestors. Whenever you critically hit using a falchion, a
greataxe, or an orc weapon, you apply the weapon’s critical
specialization effect.
VICTORIOUS VIGOR [reaction]
FEAT 5
ORC
Trigger You bring a foe to 0 Hit Points.
Your victories in battle fill you with pride and imbue you
with the energy to fight a bit longer despite your wounds.
You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your Constitution
modifier until the end of your next turn.
9TH LEVEL
PERVASIVE SUPERSTITION
FEAT 9
ORC
Prerequisites Orc Superstition
You steep yourself in superstition and practice ancient orc
mental exercises for shrugging off the effects of magic. You
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells
and magical effects at all times.
13TH LEVEL
INCREDIBLE FEROCITY
FEAT 13
ORC
Prerequisites Orc Ferocity
Given time to collect yourself after a near-death scrape, you
can rebuild your ferocity and withstand additional finishing
blows. You can use Orc Ferocity with a frequency of once per
hour, rather than once per day.
ORC WEAPON EXPERTISE
FEAT 13
ORC
Prerequisites Orc Weapon Familiarity
Your orc affinity blends with your class training, granting
you great skill with orc weapons. Whenever you gain a class
feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a
given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in
the falchion, the greataxe, and all orc weapons in which you
are trained.

================================================================================

At 1st level when you create your character, you gain a
background of your choice. This decision is permanent;
you can’t change it at later levels. Each background listed
here grants two ability boosts, a skill feat, and the trained
proficiency rank in two skills, one of which is a Lore skill.
If you gain the trained proficiency rank in a skill from your
background and would then gain the trained proficiency
rank in the same skill from your class at 1st level, you
instead become trained in another skill of your choice.
Lore skills represent deep knowledge of a specific
subject and are described on page 247. If a Lore skill
involves a choice (for instance, a choice of terrain), explain
your preference to the GM, who has final say on whether
it’s acceptable or not. If you’d like some suggestions, the
Common Lore Subcategories sidebar on page 248 lists a
number of Lore skills that are suitable for most campaigns.
Skill feats expand the functions of your skills and
appear in Chapter 5: Feats.
ACOLYTE
BACKGROUND

Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Scribing Lore
skill. You gain the Student of the Canon skill feat.

Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill and the Circus Lore
skill. You gain the Steady Balance skill feat.

along the way.

Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Nature skill and a Lore skill related to
one terrain inhabited by animals you like (such as Plains Lore
or Swamp Lore). You gain the Train Animal skill feat.
ARTISAN
BACKGROUND

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or
Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Guild Lore skill.
You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat.
ARTIST

skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.
BARRISTER

might need to know them on short notice.
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or
Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Legal Lore skill.
You gain the Group Impression skill feat.
Backgrounds
Backgrounds allow you to customize your character based on their life before adventuring.
This is the next step in their life story after their ancestry, which reflects the circumstances
of their birth. Your character’s background can help you learn or portray more about their
personality while also suggesting what sorts of things they’re likely to know. Consider
what events set your character on their path to the life of an adventurer and how those
circumstances relate to their background.

BOUNTY HUNTER
BACKGROUND

pretending to be a hero, you’ve become the mask.

You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld
Lore skill. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.

You’re trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore
skill. You gain the Experienced Smuggler skill feat.

Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Society skill and the Underworld Lore

Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Farming Lore
skill. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Athletics.

Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Medicine skill and the Warfare Lore

FORTUNE TELLER
BACKGROUND
The strands of fate are clear to you, as you have learned many
traditional forms by which laypeople can divine the future.

Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
You’re trained in the Occultism skill and the Fortune-Telling
Lore skill. You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.
GAMBLER
BACKGROUND

You’re trained in the Performance skill and the Gladiatorial
Lore skill. You gain the Impressive Performance skill feat.

the edges.

You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Mining
Lore skill. You gain the Terrain Expertise skill feat with

one of idyllic luxury, but growing up

you have traded silks and pageantry for
an adventurer’s life.

must be to Intelligence or Charisma,
and one is a free ability boost.

feat in your chosen skill. You’re also trained in the Academia

to survive.

lived in as a street urchin (such as Absalom Lore or Magnimar

Core Rulebook

PAGE 66
================================================================================

Your ancestry entry states which languages you know at
1st level. Typically, this means you can both speak and read
these languages. Having a positive Intelligence modifier
grants a number of additional languages equal to your
Intelligence modifier. You can choose these languages
from the list presented in your character’s ancestry entry
and from those available from your region or ethnicity.
Ask your GM if there’s a language you want to select that
isn’t on these lists. If your Intelligence changes later on,
you adjust your number of languages accordingly.
The languages presented here are grouped according to
how common they are throughout the Inner Sea region.
Languages that are common are regularly encountered in
most places, even among those who aren’t native speakers.
Languages that are uncommon (see Table 2–2 and Regional
Languages) are most frequently spoken by native speakers,
but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others
interested in the associated cultures.
Druidic is a secret language, and is available only to
characters who are druids. In fact, druids are prohibited
from teaching the language to non-druids (described
further in Anathema on page 130).
It is possible for your character to learn languages later
in their adventuring career. Selecting the Multilingual feat,
for example, grants a character two new languages chosen
from those listed in Table 2–1: Common Languages and
Table 2–2: Uncommon Languages. Other abilities and
effects might grant access to common or uncommon
languages, as detailed in their descriptions.

Regional Languages
Regional languages depend on the game world you’re
playing in. Chapter 8: The Age of Lost Omens lists the
regional languages of the Pathfinder world and where
they’re spoken (page 432). These languages are uncommon.
Most characters learn the Common language. This is
the most widely used language in the region where the
campaign takes place. In the Inner Sea region of Golarion,
the Common tongue is Taldane, for example. Characters
with Common might face a language barrier if they travel
somewhere with a different Common language.
Sign Language
and Reading Lips
The language entry for most characters lists languages they
use to communicate in spoken words. However, you might
know the signed version of a language or know how to read
lips. You can learn these by taking the Sign Language and
Read Lips skill feats. If you are creating a character who is
deaf, hard of hearing, or unable to speak, discuss with your
GM whether it makes sense for your character to know sign
languages or lip reading. If so, your GM might allow you to
select one of these feats for free (even if you don’t meet the
prerequisites) to represent your character concept.
Languages
The people of the Inner Sea region speak dozens of different languages, along with
hundreds of dialects and regional variations. While a character can generally get by
with Taldane, also known as Common, knowing another language is vital in some
regions. Being able to speak these tongues can help you with negotiation, spying
on enemies, or just conducting simple commerce. Languages also afford you the
chance to contextualize your character in the world and give meaning to your other
character choices.

================================================================================

The rules within each class allow you to bring a wealth
of character concepts to life. Perhaps you want to create
a brilliant but scatterbrained alchemist who can rattle off
complex formulas for alchemical items but has trouble
remembering his best friend’s birthday. Or perhaps you
want your character to be a muscle-bound swordswoman
who becomes as immovable as a mountain when she
hoists a shield. Maybe they’ll be a hot-tempered sorcerer
whose gesticulating fingers pulse with light from an angelic
ancestor. The choices you make for your character within
their class—such as a cleric’s choice of deity, a fighter’s
choice of weapon, or a sorcerer’s bloodline—bring these
visions to life within the context of the rules and the world.
The entries on the pages that follow describe the 12 core
classes in Pathfinder. Each entry contains the information
you need to play a character of that class, as well as to
advance them from their humble beginnings at 1st level to
the dizzying heights of power at 20th level. In addition to
the class entries, you might need to reference the following
sections, which detail additional character options and
how to advance your character in level.
•	 Leveling Up on page 31 tells you how to make
your character stronger when you get enough
Experience Points to reach a new level.
•	 Animal Companions and Familiars on page 214
provides rules to create an animal companion
or a familiar to share your adventures with. You
must have a class feature or feat that grants you a
companion or familiar to use these rules.
•	 Archetypes on page 219 gives you thematic
options that allow you to further customize your
character’s abilities. Though these rules are not
recommended for beginners, the archetypes in this
book allow you to gain abilities from other classes
starting at 2nd level.
Reading Class Entries
Every class entry includes information about typical
members of the class, plus suggestions for roleplaying
characters of that class and playing these characters in the
game’s various modes. Each class provides your character
with an ability boost to a key ability score; a number of
Hit Points they receive at each level; proficiency ranks for
Chapter 3: Classes
Just as your character’s ancestry plays a key role in expressing their identity and worldview,
their class indicates the training they have and will improve upon as an adventurer.
Choosing your character’s class is perhaps the most important decision you will make
for them. Groups of players often create characters whose skills and abilities complement
each other mechanically—for example, ensuring your party includes a healer, a combat-
oriented character, a stealthy character, and someone with command over magic—so you
may wish to discuss options with your group before deciding.
various abilities, equipment, and skills; special abilities
from their class features; and more. Your character’s class
entry also provides the information needed when they
gain levels, so it will be a vital reference throughout the
course of your campaign.
Playing the Class
The first section of each class describes the interests and
tendencies typical of that class, as well as information
on how others view them. This can help inspire you
as you determine your character’s actions and define
their personality, but you aren’t obligated to play your
character as this section describes.
Key Ability
This is the ability score that a member of your class cares
about the most. Many of your most useful and powerful
abilities are tied to this ability in some way.
For instance, this is the ability score you’ll use to
determine the Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your
character’s class features and feats. This is called your
class DC. If your character is a member of a spellcasting
class, this key ability is used to calculate spell DCs and
similar values.
Most classes are associated with one key ability score,
but some allow you to choose from two options. For
instance, if you’re a fighter, you can choose either Strength
or Dexterity as your key ability. A fighter who chooses
Strength will excel in hand-to-hand combat, while those
who choose Dexterity prefer ranged or finesse weapons.
Additionally, when you choose your character’s class,
they gain an ability boost to their key ability score,
increasing that ability score by 2. For more about ability
boosts, see page 20.
Hit Points
This section tells you how many Hit Points your
character gains from their class at each level. To
determine your character’s starting Hit Points, add
together the Hit Points they got when you chose their
ancestry and the amount listed in this entry, which
equals your Constitution modifier plus a fixed number.
Classes that intend for characters to rush into battle
with weapons bared gain a higher number of Hit Points
