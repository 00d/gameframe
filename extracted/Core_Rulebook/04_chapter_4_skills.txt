Chapter 4: Skills
While your character’s ability scores represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent
their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your
character’s ability scores and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise
in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class. In this chapter,
you’ll learn about skills, their scope, and the actions they can be used for.
A character’s acumen in skills can come from all sorts of training, from practicing
acrobatic tricks to studying academic topics to rehearsing a performing art. When
you create your character and as they advance in level, you have flexibility as to
which skills they become better at and when. Some classes depend heavily on
certain skills—such as the alchemist’s reliance on Crafting—but for most classes,
you can choose whichever skills make the most sense for your character’s theme and
backstory at 1st level, then use their adventure and downtime experiences to inform
how their skills should improve as your character levels up.
A character gains training in certain skills at 1st level: typically two skills from
their background, a small number of predetermined skills from their class, and
several skills of your choice granted by your class. This training increases your
proficiency ranks for those skills to trained instead of untrained and lets you use
more of the skills’ actions. Sometimes you might gain training in a specific skill from
multiple sources, such as if your background granted training in Crafting and you
took the alchemist class, which also grants training in Crafting. Each time after the
first that you would gain the trained proficiency rank in a given skill, you instead
allocate the trained proficiency to any other skill of your choice.
Key Ability
Each skill is tied to a key ability. You add your modifier for this ability to checks
and DCs when using that skill. For example, skulking about the shadows of a city at
night with Stealth uses your Dexterity modifier, navigating the myriad personalities
and power plays of court politics with Society uses your Intelligence modifier, and
so on. The key ability for each skill is listed on Table 4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and
Actions on page 235 and also appears in parentheses following the skill’s name
in the descriptions on the following pages. If the GM deems it appropriate for a
certain situation, however, they might have you use a different ability modifier for
a skill check or when determining your skill DC.
Skill Actions
The actions you can perform with a given skill are sorted into those you can use
untrained and those that require you to be trained in the skill, as shown on Table
4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and Actions (page 235). The untrained and trained actions
of each skill appear in separate sections within the skill’s description.
Anyone can use a skill’s untrained actions, but you can use trained actions only
if you have a proficiency rank of trained or better in that skill. A circumstance,
condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your proficiency
rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a
higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table. For instance, even though
a barbarian untrained in Arcana could identify a construct with a lucky roll using
Arcana to Recall Knowledge, the GM might decide that Recalling Knowledge
to determine the spells used to create such a construct is beyond the scope of
the barbarian’s anecdotal knowledge. The GM decides whether a task requires a
particular proficiency rank.
IMPROVING SKILLS
As your character advances
in level, there are two main
ways their skills improve: skill
increases and skill feats. Your
class lists the levels at which you
gain each of these improvements.
SKILL INCREASES
Skill increases improve your
proficiency in skills of your
choice. You can use these
increases to become trained
in new skills or increase your
proficiency rank in skills you’re
trained in (from trained to
expert at any level, expert to
master at 7th level or higher,
and master to legendary at 15th
level or higher). Unlike when
you first become trained at a
skill, if two different abilities
would make you an expert,
master, or legendary in a skill,
you don’t get to choose a second
skill to become expert in—the
redundant benefit simply has
no effect.
SKILL FEATS
Skill feats are a type of general
feat that often grant you a
new way to use a skill or make
you better at using a skill in a
particular way. Skill feats always
have the skill trait. These feats
appear in Chapter 5.

================================================================================
PAGE 235
================================================================================

Skill Checks and Skill DCs
When you’re actively using a skill, often by performing
one of its actions, you might attempt a skill check: rolling
a d20 and adding your skill modifier. To determine this
modifier, add your ability modifier for the skill’s key ability,
your proficiency bonus for the skill, and any other bonuses
and penalties.
Skill modifier = modifier of the skill’s key ability
score + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
When writing down the modifier on your character
sheet, you should write down only the numbers that always
apply—typically just your ability modifier and proficiency
bonus at 1st level. At higher levels, you may wear or use
items to improve your skills with item bonuses pretty much
all the time; you should write those down, too.
The GM sets the DC of a skill check, using the guidelines
in Chapter 10: Game Mastering. The most important DCs
to remember are the five simple skill DCs below.

Task Difficulty
Simple DC

Untrained
10

Trained
15

Expert
20

Master
30

Legendary
40
When someone or something tests your skill, they
attempt a check against your skill DC, which is equal to 10
plus your skill modifier. A skill DC works like any other DC
to determine the effect of an opposing creature’s skill action.
See page 444 in Chapter 9: Playing the Game for more
information about modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.
Armor and Skills
Some armor imposes a penalty on specific skill checks and
DCs. If a creature is wearing armor that imparts a skill
penalty, that penalty is applied to the creature’s Strength-
and Dexterity-based skill checks and skill DCs, unless the
action has the attack trait. Check penalties from armor are
detailed on page 274 in Chapter 6: Equipment.
Secret Checks
Sometimes you won’t know whether you succeed at a skill
check. If an action has the secret trait, the GM rolls the check
for you and informs you of the effect without revealing the
result of the roll or the degree of success. The GM rolls
secret checks when your knowledge about the outcome is
imperfect, like when you’re searching for a hidden creature
or object, attempting to deceive someone, translating a
tricky bit of ancient text, or remembering some piece of lore.
This way, you as the player don’t know things that your
character wouldn’t. This rule is the default for actions with
the secret trait, but the GM can choose not to use secret
checks if they would rather some or all rolls be public.
Exploration and Downtime Activities
Some skill activities have the exploration or downtime
trait. Exploration activities usually take a minute or more,
while downtime activities may take a day or more. They
usually can’t be used during an encounter, though the GM
might bend this restriction. If you’re not sure whether you
have the time to use one of these activities, ask your GM.
General Skill Actions
General skill actions are skill actions that can be used
with multiple different skills. When you use a general skill
action, you might use your modifier from any skill that lists
it as one of the skill’s actions, depending on the situation.

Decipher Writing (Trained)
When you encounter particularly archaic or esoteric texts,
the GM might require you to Decipher the Writing before
you can understand it. You must be trained in the relevant
skill to Decipher Writing. Arcana is typically used for
writing about magic or science, Occultism for esoteric texts
about mysteries and philosophy, Religion for scripture, and
Society for coded messages or archaic documents.
DECIPHER WRITING
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an
obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but
might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting
ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can
read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher
text written in an unfamiliar language using Society instead.
The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or
complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one
check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.
Critical Success You understand the true meaning of the text.
Success You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was
a coded document, you know the general meaning but might
not have a word-for-word translation.
Failure You can’t understand the text and take a –2 circumstance
penalty to further checks to decipher it.
Critical Failure You believe you understand the text on that
page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.

================================================================================

EXTRA PREPARATION
When Earning Income, you might be able to spend days
of downtime to prepare for your task, which adjusts the
DC of the skill check. This might involve rehearsing a play,
studying a topic, and so on. The GM determines how long
preparation takes and how much the DC changes. This is
most useful when you’re trying a task that’s higher level
than you; otherwise such tasks have an increased DC!
ENDING OR INTERRUPTING TASKS
When a task you’re doing is complete, or if you stop
in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new
task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance,
if you quit your job working at the docks, you’ll need to
find another place of employment instead of picking up
where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of
downtime looking for leads on new jobs.
However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or
event that wouldn’t prevent you from returning to the old
job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where
you left off, assuming the task hasn’t been completed by
others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check
when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking,
if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can,
but if you had a bad initial roll, you can’t try for a better one
by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed
during the break—usually because you leveled up while
adventuring—you can attempt a new check.

Earn Income (Trained)
You can use a skill—typically Crafting, Lore, or
Performance—to earn money during downtime. You
must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to
set up, and your income depends on your proficiency
rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because this
process requires a significant amount of time and involves
tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it
won’t come up in every campaign.
In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill
to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually, this is
scholarly work, such as using Religion in a monastery to
study old texts—but giving sermons at a church would still
fall under Performance instead of Religion. You also might
be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using
Acrobatics to perform feats in a circus or Thievery to pick
pockets. If you’re using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or
Performance, the DC tends to be significantly higher.
EARN INCOME
DOWNTIME
You use one of your skills to make money during downtime.
The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative
job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the
GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can
attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though

this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to
Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.
When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your
skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine
your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your
result, the task’s level, and your proficiency rank (as listed on
Table 4–2: Income Earned).
You can continue working at the task on subsequent days
without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after
the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until
the task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can
work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some
can take months or even years.
Critical Success You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of
currency listed for the task level + 1 and your proficiency rank.
Success You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency
listed for the task level and your proficiency rank.
Failure You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum
for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the
failure column for the task level. The GM will likely reduce
how long you can continue at the task.
Critical Failure You earn nothing for your work and are fired
immediately. You can’t continue at the task. Your reputation
suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find
rewarding jobs in that community in the future.
Sample Earn Income Tasks
These examples use Alcohol Lore to work in a bar or
Legal Lore to perform legal work.
Trained bartend, do legal research
Expert curate drink selection, present minor court cases
Master run a large brewery, present important court cases
Legendary run an international brewing franchise, present
a case in Hell’s courts
Crafting Goods for the Market (Crafting)
Using Crafting, you can work at producing common
items for the market. It’s usually easy to find work making
basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement’s
level (see Earn Income on page 504). Higher-level tasks
represent special commissions, which might require you to
Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and
sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don’t
occur as often and might have special requirements—or
serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.
Practicing a Trade (Lore)
You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore
specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This
is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law,
or sailing, where there’s high demand for workers. The GM
might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks
are available if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore
skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools
to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a
merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.
INCOME EXAMPLES
The following examples show the kinds of tasks your
character might take on to Earn Income during low-level
and high-level play.
HARSK MAKES TEA
Harsk is a 3rd-level ranger and an expert at harvesting
and brewing tea. He has a Tea Lore modifier of +7. He
has 30 days of downtime at his disposal and decides to
work at a prestigious local tea house. The GM decides
this is a 5th-level task if Harsk wants to assist the tea
master, or a 2nd-level task if he wants to serve tea.
Harsk chooses the tougher task, and the GM secretly
sets the DC at 20.
Harsk rolls a 4 on his Tea Lore check for a result of 11.
Poor Harsk has failed! He earns only 2 sp for his efforts
and continues working for 3 more days, for a total of
8 sp.
At that point, the GM offers Harsk a choice: either he
can finish out the week with the tea master and look
for a new job, or he can lower his ambitions and serve
in the tea house. Harsk, now more aware of his own
capabilities, accepts the less prestigious job for now.
He moves to his new job and attempts a new Tea Lore
check against DC 16. Rolling a 19, he gets a result of
26—a critical success! He earns 5 sp per day (like a
success at a 3rd-level task). The GM rules that demand
will be high enough that Harsk can work there for the
remainder of his downtime if he so chooses, a total of
26 days. Harsk accepts and earns a total of 138 sp (13
gp, 8 sp) that month.
LEM PERFORMS
Lem is a 16th-level bard and legendary with his flute. He
has a Performance modifier of +31 with his enchanted
flute. With 30 days of downtime ahead of him, Lem
wonders if he can find something that might excite him
more than performing in front of a bunch of stuffy nobles.
He finds a momentous offer indeed—a performance in a
celestial realm, and Lem’s patron goddess Shelyn might
even be in attendance! This is a 20th-level task, and the
GM secretly sets the DC at 40.
Lem rolls an 11 on his Performance check for a result
of 42. Success! The engagement lasts for a week, and
at the end, the grateful celestials present Lem with a
beautiful living diamond rose in constant bloom worth
1,400 gold pieces (200 gp per day for 7 days).
With 23 days of downtime left, Lem accepts a 14th-
level task performing at a prestigious bardic college for
members of a royal court. The GM secretly sets the DC
at 32, and Lem critically succeeds, earning 28 gp per day
for a total of 644 gp. Between the two performances,
Lem has earned just over 2,000 gold pieces during his
downtime—though he’s not sure he’ll ever sell that rose.

================================================================================

Staging a Performance (Performance)
You perform for an audience to make money. The available
audiences determine the level of your task, since more
discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a
bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on
the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of
commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance
for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a
2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and
royalty are increasingly higher level. Your degree of success
determines whether you moved your audience and whether
you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.
Identify Magic (Trained)
Using the skill related to the appropriate tradition, as
explained in Magical Traditions and Skills on page 238,
you can attempt to identify a magical item, location,
or ongoing effect. In many cases, you can use a skill to
attempt to Identify Magic of a tradition other than your
own at a higher DC. The GM determines whether you can
do this and what the DC is.
IDENTIFY MAGIC
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect
is magical, you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the
particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you
must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Cursed
or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be
impossible to identify using this activity alone. Heightening a
spell doesn’t increase the DC to identify it.
Critical Success You learn all the attributes of the magic,
including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means of
activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is cursed.
Success For an item or location, you get a sense of what it does
and learn any means of activating it. For an ongoing effect
(such as a spell with a duration), you learn the effect’s name
and what it does. You can’t try again in hopes of getting a
critical success.
Failure You fail to identify the magic and can’t try again for 1 day.
Critical Failure You misidentify the magic as something else
of the GM’s choice.
Magical Traditions and Skills
Each magical tradition has a corresponding skill, as shown
on the table below. You must have the trained proficiency
rank in a skill to use it to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell.
Something without a specific tradition, such as an item with
the magical trait, can be identified using any of these skills.

Learn a Spell (Trained)
If you’re a spellcaster, you can use the skill corresponding
to your magical tradition to learn a new spell of that
tradition. Table 4–3: Learning a Spell lists the Price of the
materials needed to Learn a Spell of each level.
LEARN A SPELL
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
Requirements You have a spellcasting class feature, and the
spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.
You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from
someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a
spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions,
you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must
use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were
a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn’t use
Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.
To learn the spell, you must do the following:
•	 Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you
must remain in conversation with a person who knows
the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
•	 Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4–3.
•	 Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your
tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the
DC on Table 4–3). Uncommon or rare spells have higher
DCs; full guidelines for the GM appear on page 503.
If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the
spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it’s
added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select
it when you add or swap spells.
Critical Success You expend half the materials and learn the spell.
Success You expend the materials and learn the spell.
Failure You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you
gain a level. The materials aren’t expended.
Critical Failure As failure, plus you expend half the materials.

Recall Knowledge (Untrained)
To remember useful information on a topic, you can
attempt to Recall Knowledge. You might know basic
information about something without needing to attempt
a check, but Recall Knowledge requires you to stop and
think for a moment so you can recollect more specific

facts and apply them. You might even need to spend time
investigating first. For instance, to use Medicine to learn
the cause of death, you might need to conduct a forensic
examination before attempting to Recall Knowledge.
RECALL KNOWLEDGE [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
SECRET
You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of knowledge
regarding a topic related to that skill. The GM determines the
DCs for such checks and which skills apply.
Critical Success You recall the knowledge accurately and gain
additional information or context.
Success You recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful
clue about your current situation.
Critical Failure You recall incorrect information or gain an
erroneous or misleading clue.
The following skills can be used to Recall Knowledge,
getting information about the listed topics. In some cases,
you can get the GM’s permission to use a different but
related skill, usually against a higher DC than normal. Some
topics might appear on multiple lists, but the skills could
give different information. For example, Arcana might tell
you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas Crafting
could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks.
•	 Arcana: Arcane theories, magical traditions,
creatures of arcane significance, and arcane planes.
•	 Crafting: Alchemical reactions and creatures, item
value, engineering, unusual materials, and constructs.
•	 Lore: The subject of the Lore skill’s subcategory.
•	 Medicine: Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics.
•	 Nature: The environment, flora, geography, weather,
creatures of natural origin, and natural planes.
•	 Occultism: Ancient mysteries, obscure philosophy,
creatures of occult significance, and esoteric planes.
•	 Religion: Divine agents, divine planes, theology,
obscure myths, and creatures of religious significance.
•	 Society: Local history, key personalities, legal
institutions, societal structure, and humanoid culture.
The GM might allow checks to Recall Knowledge
using other skills. For example, you might assess the skill
of an acrobat using Acrobatics. If you’re using a physical
skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely have
you use a mental ability score—typically Intelligence—
instead of the skill’s normal physical ability score.
Recall Knowledge Tasks
These examples use Society or Religion.
Untrained name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity
Trained line of succession for a major noble family, core
doctrines of a major deity
Expert genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an
ancient priest
Master hierarchy of a genie noble court, major extraplanar
temples of a deity
Legendary existence of a long-lost noble heir, secret
doctrines of a religion

Subsist (Untrained)
If you need to provide food and shelter, you can use the
Subsist downtime activity. This typically uses Society if
you’re in a settlement or Survival if you’re in the wild.
SUBSIST
DOWNTIME
You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly
others as well, with a standard of living described on page 294.
The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place
where you’re trying to Subsist. You might need a minimum
proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange environments.
Unlike most downtime activities, you can Subsist after 8 hours
or less of exploration, but if you do, you take a –5 penalty.
Critical Success You either provide a subsistence living for
yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your
own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.
Success You find enough food and shelter with basic protection
from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.
Failure You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough
food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food
and shelter.
Critical Failure You attract trouble, eat something you
shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a
–2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week.
You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored
up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you
continue failing.
Sample Subsist Tasks
Untrained lush forest with calm weather or large city
with plentiful resources
Trained typical hillside or village
Expert typical mountains or insular hamlet
Master typical desert or city under siege
Legendary barren wasteland or city of undead
Skill Descriptions
The following entries describe the skills in the game. The
heading for each entry provides the skill’s name, with
that skill’s key ability in parentheses. A brief description
of the skill is followed by a list of actions you can use if
you’re untrained in that skill, and then the actions you
can perform if you are trained in that skill. Some actions
list sample tasks for each rank to give you a better
sense of what you can accomplish as your proficiency
increases. As the actions of a skill aren’t comprehensive,
there may be times when the GM asks you to attempt
a skill check without using any of the listed actions, or
times when the GM asks you to roll using a different key
ability modifier.
Most skills include entries for success and failure, as
well as descriptions of what occurs on a critical success or
a critical failure. If either of the critical entries is absent,
treat those results as a success or failure, as normal.
Acrobatics (Dex)
Acrobatics measures your ability to perform tasks requiring
coordination and grace. When you use the Escape basic
action (page 470), you can use your Acrobatics modifier
instead of your unarmed attack modifier.
BALANCE [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You are in a square that contains a narrow
surface, uneven ground, or another similar feature.
You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground,
attempting an Acrobatics check against its Balance DC. You
are flat-footed while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.
Critical Success You move up to your Speed.
Success You move up to your Speed, treating it as difficult
terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).
Failure You must remain stationary to keep your balance
(wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.
Critical Failure You fall and your turn ends.
Sample Balance Tasks
Untrained tangled roots, uneven cobblestones
Trained wooden beam
Expert deep, loose gravel
Master tightrope, smooth sheet of ice
Legendary razor’s edge, chunks of floor falling in midair
TUMBLE THROUGH [one-action]
MOVE
You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try
to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics
check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter
its space. You can Tumble Through using Climb, Fly, Swim, or
another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.
Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating the
squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10
feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all
the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if
you had moved out of the square you started in.
Acrobatics Trained Actions
MANEUVER IN FLIGHT [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have a fly Speed.
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics
check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but
they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.
Success You succeed at the maneuver.
Failure Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply
can’t move or if some other detrimental effect happens.
The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you
attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were
trying to fly against a strong wind).
Critical Failure As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
Core Rulebook
240

PAGE 242
================================================================================

Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks
Trained steep ascent or descent
Expert fly against the wind, hover midair
Master reverse direction
Legendary fly through gale force winds
SQUEEZE
EXPLORATION
MOVE
You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you
can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small
spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain (page 475) that
you can move through more quickly and without a check.
Critical Success You squeeze through the tight space in
1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
Success You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
Critical Failure You become stuck in the tight space. While
you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another
Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that
check other than a critical failure causes you
to become unstuck.
Sample Squeeze Tasks
Trained space barely fitting your
shoulders
Master space barely fitting your head
Arcana (Int)
Arcana measures how much you know about arcane
magic and creatures. Even if you’re untrained, you can
Recall Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about arcane theories; magic
traditions; creatures of arcane significance (like
dragons and beasts); and the Elemental, Astral,
and Shadow Planes.
Arcana Trained ACTIONS
You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
•	 Decipher Writing about arcane theory.
•	 Identify Magic, particularly arcane magic.
•	 Learn a Spell from the arcane tradition.
BORROW AN ARCANE SPELL
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook,
you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s
spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the
spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning
the Spell.
Success You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal
spell preparation.
Failure You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot
remains available for you to prepare a different
spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell
until the next time you prepare spells.
Athletics (Str)
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical
prowess. When you use the Escape basic action (page
470), you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your
unarmed attack modifier.
CLIMB [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have both hands free.
You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it’s
particularly easy, you must attempt an Athletics check. The
GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and

have a climb Speed.
Critical Success You move up, across, or safely down the
incline for 5 feet plus 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed
(a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
Success You move up, across, or safely down the incline for
5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 5 feet for
most PCs, minimum 5 feet if your Speed is below 20 feet).
Critical Failure You fall. If you began the climb on stable
ground, you fall and land prone.
Sample Climb Tasks
Untrained ladder, steep slope, low-branched tree
Trained rigging, rope, typical tree
Expert wall with small handholds and footholds
Master ceiling with handholds and footholds, rock wall

FORCE OPEN [one-action]
ATTACK
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt
to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate.
With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls.
Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item
penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.
Critical Success You open the door, window, container, or gate
and can avoid damaging it in the process.
Success You break the door, window, container, or gate open,
and the door, window, container, or gate gains the broken
condition. If it’s especially sturdy, the GM might have it take
damage but not be broken.
Critical Failure Your attempt jams the door, window, container,
or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future
attempts to Force it Open.
Sample Force Open Tasks
Untrained fabric, flimsy glass
Trained ice, sturdy glass
Expert flimsy wooden door, wooden portcullis
Master sturdy wooden door, iron portcullis, metal bar
Legendary stone or iron door
GRAPPLE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one free hand. Your target
cannot be more than one size larger than you.
You attempt to grab an opponent with your free hand.
Attempt an Athletics check against their Fortitude DC.
You can also Grapple to keep your hold on a creature you
already grabbed.
Critical Success Your opponent is restrained until the end of
your next turn unless you move or your opponent Escapes
(page 470).
Success Your opponent is grabbed until the end of your next
turn unless you move or your opponent Escapes.
Failure You fail to grab your opponent. If you already had
the opponent grabbed or restrained using a Grapple, those
conditions on that creature end.
Critical Failure If you already had the opponent grabbed or
restrained, it breaks free. Your target can either grab you,
as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you,
or force you to fall and land prone.
HIGH JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then make a vertical Leap and attempt a DC 30
Athletics check to increase the height of your jump. If you
didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check.
This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation,
as determined by the GM.
Critical Success Increase the maximum vertical distance to 8
feet, or increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet
and maximum horizontal distance to 10 feet.
Success Increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet.
Failure You Leap normally.
Critical Failure You don’t Leap at all, and instead you fall prone
in your space.
Leap
The Leap basic action is used for High Jump and Long
Jump. Leap lets you take a careful, short jump. You can
Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least
15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at
least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap
ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your
Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap
if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical
Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet
horizontally onto an elevated surface.
LONG JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then make a horizontal Leap and attempt an
Athletics check to increase the length of your jump. The DC
of the Athletics check is equal to the total distance in feet
you’re attempting to move during your Leap (so you’d need
to succeed at a DC 20 check to Leap 20 feet). You can’t Leap
farther than your Speed.
If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump
in a different direction than your Stride, you automatically fail
your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the
situation, as determined by the GM.
Success Increase the maximum horizontal distance you Leap
to the desired distance.
Core Rulebook
242

PAGE 244
================================================================================

Failure You Leap normally.
Critical Failure You Leap normally, but then fall and land prone.
SHOVE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You push an opponent away from you. Attempt an Athletics
check against your opponent’s Fortitude DC.
Critical Success You push your opponent up to 10 feet away
from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the
same distance and in the same direction.
Success You push your opponent back 5 feet. You can Stride
after it, but you must move the same distance and in the
same direction.
Critical Failure You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.
Forced Movement
The Shove action can force a creature to move. When
an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the
distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you,
not by your Speed. Because you’re not acting to move, this
doesn’t trigger reactions triggered by movement.
SWIM [one-action]
MOVE
You propel yourself through water. In most calm water, you
succeed at the action without needing to attempt a check. If
you must breathe air and you’re submerged in water, you must
hold your breath each round. If you fail to hold your breath, you
begin to drown (as described on page 478). If the water you are
swimming in is turbulent or otherwise dangerous, you might
have to attempt an Athletics check to Swim.
If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a
Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the
current, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action
on your turn was to enter the water, you don’t sink or move
with the current that turn.
Critical Success You move through the water 10 feet, plus 5 feet
per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 15 feet for most PCs).
Success You move through the water 5 feet, plus 5 feet per
20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
Critical Failure You make no progress, and if you’re holding
your breath, you lose 1 round of air.
Sample Swim Tasks
Untrained lake or other still water
Trained flowing water, like a river
Expert swiftly flowing river
Master stormy sea
Legendary maelstrom, waterfall
TRIP [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. Your target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
FALLING
When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage
when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to
half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a
fall, you’re knocked prone when you land.
If you fall into water, snow, or another soft substance,
calculate the damage from the fall as though your fall
were 20 feet shorter. The reduction can’t be greater than
the depth of the water (so when falling into water that is
only 10 feet deep, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter).
You can Grab an Edge as a reaction (page 472) to reduce
or eliminate the damage from some falls. More detailed
rules for falling damage appear on page 463.
You try to knock an opponent to the ground. Attempt an
Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success The target falls and lands prone and takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
Success The target falls and lands prone.
Critical Failure You lose your balance and fall and land prone.
Athletics Trained Action
DISARM [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You try to knock something out of an opponent’s grasp.
Attempt an Athletics check against the opponent’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success You knock the item out of the opponent’s
grasp. It falls to the ground in the opponent’s space.
Success You weaken your opponent’s grasp on the item. Until
the start of that creature’s turn, attempts to Disarm the
opponent of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and
the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with
the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item.
Critical Failure You lose your balance and become flat-footed
until the start of your next turn.
Crafting (Int)
You can use this skill to create, understand, and repair items.
Even if you’re untrained, you can Recall Knowledge
(page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about alchemical reactions, the
value of items, engineering, unusual materials,
and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM
determines which creatures this applies to, but it
usually includes constructs.
REPAIR
EXPLORATION
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have a repair kit (page 291).

both hands. The GM sets the DC, but it’s usually about the same
DC to Repair a given item as it is to Craft it in the first place. You
can’t Repair a destroyed item.
Critical Success You restore 10 Hit Points to the item, plus an
additional 10 Hit Points per proficiency rank you have in
Crafting (a total of 20 HP if you’re trained, 30 HP if you’re an
expert, 40 HP if you’re a master, or 50 HP if you’re legendary).
Success You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional
5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of
10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you’re an expert, 20 HP if
you’re a master, or 25 HP if you’re legendary).
Critical Failure You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the
item’s Hardness to this damage.
Crafting Trained Actions
You must be trained in Crafting to use it to Earn Income
(page 236).
•	 Earn Income by crafting goods for the market.
CRAFT
DOWNTIME
MANIPULATE
You can make an item from raw materials. You need the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items, the
Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items, and the Snare
Crafting feat to create snares.
To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
•	 The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn’t list
a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you
must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s 16th or higher,
you must be legendary.
•	 You have the formula for the item; see Getting
Formulas below for more information.
•	 You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many
cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a
smithy to forge a metal shield.
•	 You must supply raw materials worth at least half the
item’s Price. You always expend at least that amount
of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re
in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get
the amount of raw materials you need, except in the
case of rarer precious materials.
You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt
a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item
based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances.
If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend
the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining
portion of the item’s Price in materials to complete the item
immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days
working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce
the value of the materials you need to expend to complete
the item. This amount is determined using Table 4–2: Income
Earned (page 236), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting
and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of
these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending
the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime
Core Rulebook
244

PAGE 246
================================================================================

days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish
the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of
Crafting appears in the sidebar.
Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional
day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete
the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your
proficiency rank in Crafting.
Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent
Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item
by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.
Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw
materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try
again, you must start over.
Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of
the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the
rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.
Consumables and Ammunition
You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches,
making up to four of the same item at once with a single
check. This requires you to include the raw materials
for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must
complete the batch all at once. You also Craft non-magical
ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in Table
6–8: Ranged Weapons (typically 10).
Getting Formulas
You can gain access to the formulas for all common
items in Chapter 6: Equipment by purchasing a basic
crafter’s book (page 287). See the rules on page 293 for
information on how to acquire other formulas.
 IDENTIFY ALCHEMY
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Requirements You have alchemist’s tools (page 287).
You can identify the nature of an alchemical item with 10 minutes
of testing using alchemist’s tools. If your attempt is interrupted
in any way, you must start over.
Success You identify the item and the means of activating it.
Failure You fail to identify the item but can try again.
Critical Failure You misidentify the item as another item of
the GM’s choice.
Deception (Cha)
You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and
other forms of subterfuge.
CREATE A DIVERSION [one-action]
MENTAL
With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can
create a diversion that draws creatures’ attention elsewhere.
If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate
trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and
linguistic traits.
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the
CRAFTING EXAMPLE
Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in Crafting. He
has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the Magical Crafting
feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides
to craft a striking rune, a 4th-level item. The GM secretly
chooses a DC of 19.
The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp,
5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp
worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 4 days
building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his Crafting
check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At this point,
Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of
materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp.
However, Ezren has 10 more days on his hands, so he
decides to spend additional time to complete the item.
Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert at Crafting,
he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day
spent. After spending 10 days working, he reduces the cost
to complete the item from 65 gp to 55 gp. He spends the
remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the
striking rune, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could
have stayed home to keep working on the striking rune,
eventually reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he
paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!)
If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher, he’d
have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d reduce the
remaining amount by 2 gp per day, lowering the amount
needed to complete the item after 10 additional days of
work to 45 gp.
Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you’re trying
to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt
to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs
against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.
Success You become hidden to each creature whose
Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The
hidden condition allows you to Sneak away, as described
on page 252.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until
you do anything except Step or use the Hide or the Sneak
action of the Stealth skill (pages 251 and 252). If you Strike
a creature, the creature remains flat‑footed against that
attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything
else, you become observed just before you act unless the
GM determines otherwise.
Failure You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose
Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are
aware you were trying to trick them.
IMPERSONATE
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
MANIPULATE
SECRET
You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or
something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes
10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on page 290), but
a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying
to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.

================================================================================

In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your
deception only if they use the Seek action to attempt
Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt
to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM
rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s
Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific
individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a
circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person
you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception
check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.
Success You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person
you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check
if your behavior changes.
Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
Critical Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you claim
to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without
a disguise.
LIE
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
SECRET
You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at
least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single
Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of
every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them
a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of
the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable
lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler
and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s
impossible to get anyone to believe them.
At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your
lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive
against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually
happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter
your statements.
Success The target believes your lie.
Failure The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4
circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the
duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely
to be suspicious of you in the future.
Deception Trained Action
FEINT [one-action]
MENTAL
Requirements You are within melee reach of the opponent you
attempt to Feint.
With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared
for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against that
opponent’s Perception DC.
Critical Success You throw your enemy’s defenses against
you entirely off. The target is flat-footed against melee
attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your
next turn.
Success Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is
flat-footed against the next melee attack that you attempt
against it before the end of your current turn.
Critical Failure Your feint backfires. You are flat-footed against
melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end
of your next turn.
Diplomacy (Cha)
You influence others through negotiation and flattery.
GATHER INFORMATION
EXPLORATION
SECRET
You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in
an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The
GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it
takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any
benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes,
drinks, or gifts.
Success You collect information about the individual or topic.
The GM determines the specifics.
Critical Failure You collect incorrect information about the

MAKE AN IMPRESSION
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage
in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill,
you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them
temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt
a Diplomacy check against the Will DC of one target, modified
by any circumstances the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad
impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social
interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.
Critical Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by
two steps.
Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
Critical Failure The target’s attitude toward you decreases by
one step.
Changing Attitudes
Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes
that reflect how they view your character. These are
only a brief summary of a creature’s disposition. The
GM will supply additional nuance based on the history
and beliefs of the characters you’re interacting with, and
their attitudes can change in accordance with the story.
The attitudes are detailed in the Conditions Appendix and
are summarized here.
•	 Helpful: Willing to help you and responds favorably to
your requests.
Core Rulebook
246

PAGE 248
================================================================================

•	 Friendly: Has a good attitude toward you, but won’t
necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
•	 Indifferent: Doesn’t care about you either way. (Most
NPCs start out indifferent.)
•	 Unfriendly: Dislikes you and doesn’t want to help you.
•	 Hostile: Actively works against you—and might attack
you just because of their dislike.
No one can ever change the attitude of a player character
with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with
player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the
player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or
charming a character is, but players make the ultimate
decisions about how their characters respond.
REQUEST [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
You can make a request of a creature that’s friendly or helpful
to you. You must couch the request in terms that the target
would accept given their current attitude toward you. The
GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some
requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC
would never agree to them.
Critical Success The target agrees to your request without
qualifications.
Success The target agrees to your request, but they might
demand added provisions or alterations to the request.
Failure The target refuses the request, though they might
propose an alternative that is less extreme.
Critical Failure Not only does the target refuse the request,
but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to
the temerity of the request.
Intimidation (Cha)
You bend others to your will using threats.
COERCE
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
EXPLORATION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a
creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least 1
minute of conversation with a creature you can see and that
can either see or sense you. At the end of the conversation,
attempt an Intimidation check against the target’s Will DC,
modified by any circumstances the GM determines. The
attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized in
the Changing Attitudes sidebar on page 246 and described in
full in the Conditions Appendix, starting on page 618.
Critical Success The target gives you the information you
seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they
aren’t likely to harm the target in any way. The target
continues to comply for an amount of time determined by
the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target
becomes unfriendly (if they weren’t already unfriendly
or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to
retaliate—at least in the short term.
Success As critical success, but once the target becomes
unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for
example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting
your enemies.
Failure The target doesn’t do what you say, and if they were
not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.
Critical Failure The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile
if they weren’t already, and can’t be Coerced by you for at
least 1 week.
DEMORALIZE [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
MENTAL
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting put-
down, you can shake an enemy’s resolve. Choose a creature
within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt an
Intimidation check against that target’s Will DC. If the target
does not understand the language you are speaking, you’re
not speaking a language, or they can’t hear you, you take a
–4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your
result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to
Demoralize it for 10 minutes.
Critical Success The target becomes frightened 2.
Success The target becomes frightened 1.
Lore (Int)
You have specialized information on a narrow topic.
Lore features many subcategories. You might have
Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar
subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its
own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore
wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore,
for example.
You gain a specific subcategory of the Lore skill from
your background. The GM determines what other
subcategories they’ll allow as Lore skills, though these
categories are always less broad than any of the other
skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they
should never be able to fully or mainly take the place
of another skill’s Recall Knowledge action. For instance,
Magic Lore wouldn’t enable you to recall the same
breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana, Adventuring
Lore wouldn’t simply give you all the information an
adventurer needs, and Planar Lore would not be sufficient
to gain all the information spread across various skills
and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.
If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could
apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill
in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better
skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there’s
any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic
or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.
Even if you’re untrained in Lore, you can use it to
Recall Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about the subject of your Lore
skill’s subcategory.

Lore Trained Action
You must be trained in Lore to use it to Earn Income
(page 236).
•	 Earn Income by using your knowledge to practice
a trade.
Medicine (Wis)
You can patch up wounds and help people recover from
diseases and poisons. Even if you’re untrained in Medicine,
you can use it to Recall Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about diseases, injuries, poisons,
and other ailments. You can use this to perform
forensic examinations if you spend 10 minutes
(or more, as determined by the GM) checking for
evidence such as wound patterns. This is most useful
when determining how a body was injured or killed.
ADMINISTER FIRST AID [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying or
bleeding. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which
ailment you’re trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer
First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.
•	 Stabilize Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that
has 0 Hit Points and the dying condition. The DC is
equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically
15 + its dying value).
•	 Stop Bleeding Attempt a Medicine check on a creature
that is taking persistent bleed damage (page 452),
giving them a chance to make another flat check to
remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC
of the effect that caused the bleed.
Success If you’re trying to stabilize, the creature loses the dying
condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying to stop
bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.
Critical Failure If you were trying to stabilize, the creature’s
dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop
bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal
to its persistent bleed damage.
Medicine Trained Actions
TREAT DISEASE
DOWNTIME
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature. Attempt
a Medicine check against the disease’s DC. After you attempt to
Treat a Disease for a creature, you can’t try again until after that
creature’s next save against the disease.
Critical Success You grant the creature a +4 circumstance
bonus to its next saving throw against the disease.
Success You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to its
next saving throw against the disease.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the disease.
TREAT POISON [one-action]

next saving throw against the poison.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the poison.
TREAT WOUNDS
EXPLORATION
HEALING
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature
(targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then
temporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but
this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a
patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).
The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might
adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient
outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you’re
an expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check
to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you’re a master of
Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase
the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you’re legendary, you can
instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained
by 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.
If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the
target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total
of 1 hour, double the Hit Points they regain from Treat Wounds.
The result of your Medicine check determines how many
Hit Points the target regains.
Critical Success The target regains 4d8 Hit Points, and its
wounded condition is removed.
Success The target regains 2d8 Hit Points, and its wounded
condition is removed.
Critical Failure The target takes 1d8 damage.
Nature (Wis)
You know a great deal about the natural world, and you
command and train animals and magical beasts. Even
if you’re untrained in Nature, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about fauna, flora, geography,
weather, the environment, creatures of natural origin
(like animals, beasts, fey, and plants), the First World,
the Material Plane, and the Elemental Planes.
COMMAND AN ANIMAL [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check
against the animal’s Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if the
animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a course of
action it was predisposed toward, or you offer it a treat.
You automatically fail if the animal is hostile or unfriendly
to you. If the animal is helpful to you, increase your degree of
COMMANDED ANIMALS
Issuing commands to an animal doesn’t always go
smoothly. An animal is an independent creature with
limited intelligence. Most animals understand only the
simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct
your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate
a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a
certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The
GM decides the specifics of the action your animal uses.
The animal does what you commanded as soon as
it can, usually as its first action on its next turn. If you
successfully commanded it multiple times, it does what
you said in order. It forgets all commands beyond what it
can accomplish on its turn. If multiple people command
the same animal, the GM determines how the animal
reacts. The GM might also make the DC higher if someone
has already tried to Command the Animal that round.
success by one step. You might be able to Command an Animal
more easily with a feat like Ride (page 266).
Most animals know the Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and
Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a
horse’s Gallop, you can Command the Animal to perform the
activity, but you must spend as many actions on Command
an Animal as the activity’s number of actions. You can also
spend multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform
that number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance, you
could spend 3 actions to Command an Animal to Stride three
times or to Stride twice and then Strike.
Success The animal does as you command on its next turn.
Failure The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does nothing.
Critical Failure The animal misbehaves or misunderstands,
and it takes some other action determined by the GM.
Nature Trained Actions
You must be trained in Nature to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
•	 Identify Magic, particularly primal magic.
•	 Learn a Spell from the primal tradition.
Occultism (Int)
You know a great deal about ancient philosophies, esoteric
lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural creatures. Even
if you’re untrained in Occultism, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about ancient mysteries; obscure
philosophies; creatures of occult significance (like
aberrations, spirits, and oozes); and the Positive
Energy, Negative Energy, Shadow, Astral, and
Ethereal Planes.

Performance (Cha)
You are skilled at a form of performance, using your
talents to impress a crowd or make a living.
Basic Competence
Some performances require you to be more than just
charismatic, and if you don’t meet the demands of the
art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty
based on the relevant ability score. For example, if
you’re dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier,
you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing.
Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative
Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your
raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your
intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write
your speeches!
Performance Traits
When you use an action that utilizes the Performance
skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of
performance. The GM might change these depending on
the circumstances, but the most common performance-
based traits are listed below.
Performance
Additional Traits
Act or perform comedy
Auditory, linguistic, and visual
Dance

Play an instrument
Auditory and manipulate
Orate or sing

PERFORM [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance,
or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is most
useful when you want to prove your capability or impress
someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its
own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy
checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—
if the GM sees fit.
Critical Success Your performance impresses the observers,
and they’re likely to share stories of your ability.
Success You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the
quality of your performance.
Failure Your performance falls flat.
Critical Failure You demonstrate only incompetence.
Sample Perform Tasks
Untrained audience of commoners
Trained audience of artisans
Expert audience of merchants or minor nobles
Master audience of high nobility or minor royalty
Legendary audience of major royalty or otherworldly beings
Performance Trained Action
You must be trained in Performance to use it to Earn
Income (page 236).
•	 Earn Income by staging a performance.
Religion (Wis)
The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of
divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to
you. You also understand how magic works, though
your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge.
Even if you’re untrained in Religion, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
•	 Recall Knowledge about divine agents, the finer
points of theology, obscure myths regarding a
faith, and creatures of religious significance (like
celestials, fiends, and undead), the Outer Sphere,
and the Positive and Negative Energy Planes.
Religion Trained Actions
You must be trained in Religion to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
•	 Decipher Writing of a religious nature, including
allegories, homilies, and proverbs.
•	 Identify Magic, particularly divine magic.
•	 Learn a Spell from the divine tradition.
Society (Int)
You understand the people and systems that make
civilization run, and you know the historical events that
make societies what they are today. Further, you can use
that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal,
and economic workings of settlements. Even if you’re
untrained in Society, you can use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
•	 Recall Knowledge about local history, important
personalities, legal institutions, societal structure,
and humanoid cultures. The GM might allow
Society to apply to other creatures that are major
elements of society in your region, such as the
draconic nobility in a kingdom of humans ruled
by dragons.
•	 Subsist in a settlement by finding shelter, scrounging,
or begging for food.
Society Trained Actions
You must be trained in Society to use it to Decipher
Writing (page 234).
•	 Decipher Writing that’s a coded message, text
written in an incomplete or archaic form, or in
some cases, text in a language you don’t know.

================================================================================

CREATE FORGERY
DOWNTIME
SECRET
You create a forged document, usually over the course of a
day or a week. You must have the proper writing material to
create a forgery. When you Create a Forgery, the GM rolls a
secret DC 20 Society check. If you succeed, the forgery is of
good enough quality that passive observers can’t notice the
fake. Only those who carefully examine the document and
attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society
DC can do so.
If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific
to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document
before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your
check, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus).
To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of
that person’s handwriting.
If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some
obvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your
result to each passive observer’s Perception DC or Society DC,
whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below.
Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result
is used against all passive observers’ DCs no matter how many
creatures passively observe that document.
An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still
choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for
a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods
beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with
your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a
Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they
succeed, they know your document is a forgery).
Success The observer does not detect the forgery.
Failure The observer knows your document is a forgery.
Stealth (Dex)
You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip
past foes, hide, or conceal an item.
CONCEAL AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE
SECRET
You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of
light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past
someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check
and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once
the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same
result is used no matter how many passive observers you
try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you
for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your
Stealth DC (finding the object on success).
You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your
person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment
within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in
an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth
DC to determine whether they find the object.
Success The object remains undetected.
Failure The searcher finds the object.
BEING STEALTHY
If you want to sneak around when there are creatures
that can see you, you can use a combination of Hide and
Sneak to do so.
•	 First, Hide behind something (either by taking
advantage of cover or having the concealed condition
due to fog, a spell, or a similar effect). A successful
Stealth check makes you hidden, though the creatures
still know roughly where you are.
•	 Second, now that you’re hidden, you can Sneak. That
means you can move at half your Speed and attempt
another Stealth check. If it’s successful, you’re now
undetected. That means the creatures don’t know
which square you’re in anymore.
If you were approaching creatures that didn’t know
you were there, you could begin Sneaking right away,
since they didn’t know your location to start with. Some
actions can cause you to become observed again, but
they’re mostly what you’d expect: standing out in the
open, attacking someone, making a bunch of noise, and
so forth. If you Strike someone after successfully Hiding
or Sneaking, though, they’re flat-footed to that Strike.
Creatures can try to find you using the Seek action,
described on page 471.
Three conditions explain the states of detection.
Remember that these conditions are relative to each
creature—you can be observed by one creature while
hidden to another and undetected by a third.
OBSERVED
You’re in the creature’s clear view.
HIDDEN
The creature knows your location but can’t see you.
UNDETECTED
The creature doesn’t know your location.
HIDE [one-action]
SECRET
You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into
concealment to become hidden, rather than observed. The
GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the
result to the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed
by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are
concealed from. You gain the circumstance bonus from cover
or greater cover to your check.
Success If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden
from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or
undetected by the creature, you retain that condition.
If you successfully become hidden to a creature but
then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be
concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease
being hidden if you do anything except Hide, Sneak, or Step.

================================================================================

If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains flat-
footed against that attack, and you then become observed. If
you do anything else, you become observed just before you
act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow
you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without
being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.
If a creature uses Seek to make you observed by it, you
must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.
SNEAK [one-action]
MOVE
SECRET
You can attempt to move to another place while becoming
or staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can
use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming
instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement
type; you must move at half that Speed.)
If you’re undetected by a creature and it’s impossible for that
creature to observe you (for a typical creature, this includes
when you’re invisible, the observer is blinded, or you’re in
darkness and the creature can’t see in darkness), for any critical
failure you roll on a check to Sneak, you get a failure instead.
You also continue to be undetected if you lose cover or greater
cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature.
At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your Stealth
check in secret and compares the result to the Perception
DC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by
at the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater
cover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the
+2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover)
to your Stealth check. Because you’re moving, the bonus
increase from Taking Cover doesn’t apply. You don’t get to roll
against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither
are concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against
it. You automatically become observed by such a creature.
Success You’re undetected by the creature during your movement
and remain undetected by the creature at the end of it.
You become observed as soon as you do anything other
than Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature,
the creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and you
then become observed. If you do anything else, you become
observed just before you act unless the GM determines
otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly
unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring
another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate
loud noise, you become hidden instead of undetected.
If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a
result, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected
by that creature again.
Failure A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away,
though you still remain unseen. You’re hidden from the
creature throughout your movement and remain so.
Critical Failure You’re spotted! You’re observed by the creature
throughout your movement and remain so. If you’re
invisible and were hidden from the creature, instead of
being observed you’re hidden throughout your movement
and remain so.
Survival (Wis)
You are adept at living in the wilderness, foraging for
food and building shelter, and with training you discover
the secrets of tracking and hiding your trail. Even if you’re
untrained, you can still use Survival to Subsist (page 240).
•	 Subsist in the wild by foraging for food and
building shelter.
SENSE DIRECTION
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the
geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay
oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check
only once per day, but some environments or changes might
necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC
and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so).
More unusual locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might
require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense
Direction. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to
checks to Sense Direction.
Critical Success You get an excellent sense of where you are.
If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you
know them exactly.
Success You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming
hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal
directions, you have a sense of those directions.
Sense Direction Tasks

Trained find an overgrown path in a forest
Expert navigate a hedge maze

MOVE
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed,

must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it
is higher than the normal DC to Track.
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In
this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the

need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation.
The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.
You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking,
once every hour you continue tracking, and any time
something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines
the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the
trail, the weather, and the type of ground.
Success You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re
already following.
Failure You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
Critical Failure You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.
Sample Track Tasks
Untrained the path of a large army following a road
Trained relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear
through the plains
Expert a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks
after the rain
Master tracks after a winter snow, tracks of a mouse or
smaller creature, tracks left on surfaces that can’t hold
prints like bare rock
Legendary old tracks through a windy desert’s sands,
tracks after a major blizzard or hurricane
Thievery (Dex)
You are trained in a particular set of skills favored by
thieves and miscreants.
PALM AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE
Palming a small, unattended object without being noticed
requires you to roll a single Thievery check against the
Perception DCs of all creatures who are currently observing
you. You take the object whether or not you successfully
conceal that you did so. You can typically only Palm Objects
of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise
depending on the situation.
Success The creature does not notice you Palming the Object.
Failure The creature notices you Palming the Object, and the
GM determines the creature’s response.
STEAL [one-action]
MANIPULATE
You try to take a small object from another creature without
being noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object of
negligible Bulk, and you automatically fail if the creature who
has the object is in combat or on guard.
Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully
Steal the object. The DC to Steal is usually the Perception DC
of the creature wearing the object. This assumes the object
is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch
filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). If the object
is in a pocket or similarly protected, you take a –5 penalty to
your Thievery check. The GM might increase the DC of your
check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such
as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment
mixed in with other documents).
You might also need to compare your Thievery check result
against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person
wearing the object. The GM may increase the Perception DCs
of these observers if they’re distracted.
Success You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an
observer doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.
Failure The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can
take the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt
to take the item. The GM determines the response of any
creature that notices your theft.
Thievery Trained Actions
DISABLE A DEVICE [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements Some devices require you to use thieves’ tools
(page 291) when disabling them.
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex
device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before
becoming disabled, depending on its construction and
complexity. Thieves’ tools are helpful and sometimes even
required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and
sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in
Thievery to disable it.
Your Thievery check result determines how much progress
you make.
Critical Success You disable the device, or you achieve two
successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no
trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later,
if that type of device can be rearmed.
Success You disable the device, or you achieve one success
toward disabling a complex device.
Critical Failure You trigger the device.
PICK A LOCK [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have thieves’ tools (page 291).
Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a
Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity
and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick (locks
and their DCs are found on page 290). Locks of higher qualities
might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even
an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting
the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper
tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are
treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.
Critical Success You unlock the lock, or you achieve two
successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no
trace of your tampering.
Success You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward
opening a complex lock.
Critical Failure You break your tools. Fixing them requires using
Crafting to Repair them or else swapping in replacement
picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for infiltrator thieves’ tools).
