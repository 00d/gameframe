Chapter 4: Skills
While your character’s ability scores represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent
their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your
character’s ability scores and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise
in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class. In this chapter,
you’ll learn about skills, their scope, and the actions they can be used for.
A character’s acumen in skills can come from all sorts of training, from practicing
acrobatic tricks to studying academic topics to rehearsing a performing art. When
you create your character and as they advance in level, you have flexibility as to
which skills they become better at and when. Some classes depend heavily on
certain skills—such as the alchemist’s reliance on Crafting—but for most classes,
you can choose whichever skills make the most sense for your character’s theme and
backstory at 1st level, then use their adventure and downtime experiences to inform
how their skills should improve as your character levels up.
A character gains training in certain skills at 1st level: typically two skills from
their background, a small number of predetermined skills from their class, and
several skills of your choice granted by your class. This training increases your
proficiency ranks for those skills to trained instead of untrained and lets you use
more of the skills’ actions. Sometimes you might gain training in a specific skill from
multiple sources, such as if your background granted training in Crafting and you
took the alchemist class, which also grants training in Crafting. Each time after the
first that you would gain the trained proficiency rank in a given skill, you instead
allocate the trained proficiency to any other skill of your choice.
Key Ability
Each skill is tied to a key ability. You add your modifier for this ability to checks
and DCs when using that skill. For example, skulking about the shadows of a city at
night with Stealth uses your Dexterity modifier, navigating the myriad personalities
and power plays of court politics with Society uses your Intelligence modifier, and
so on. The key ability for each skill is listed on Table 4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and
Actions on page 235 and also appears in parentheses following the skill’s name
in the descriptions on the following pages. If the GM deems it appropriate for a
certain situation, however, they might have you use a different ability modifier for
a skill check or when determining your skill DC.
Skill Actions
The actions you can perform with a given skill are sorted into those you can use
untrained and those that require you to be trained in the skill, as shown on Table
4–1: Skills, Key Abilities, and Actions (page 235). The untrained and trained actions
of each skill appear in separate sections within the skill’s description.
Anyone can use a skill’s untrained actions, but you can use trained actions only
if you have a proficiency rank of trained or better in that skill. A circumstance,
condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your proficiency
rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a
higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table. For instance, even though
a barbarian untrained in Arcana could identify a construct with a lucky roll using
Arcana to Recall Knowledge, the GM might decide that Recalling Knowledge
to determine the spells used to create such a construct is beyond the scope of
the barbarian’s anecdotal knowledge. The GM decides whether a task requires a
particular proficiency rank.
IMPROVING SKILLS
As your character advances
in level, there are two main
ways their skills improve: skill
increases and skill feats. Your
class lists the levels at which you
gain each of these improvements.
SKILL INCREASES
Skill increases improve your
proficiency in skills of your
choice. You can use these
increases to become trained
in new skills or increase your
proficiency rank in skills you’re
trained in (from trained to
expert at any level, expert to
master at 7th level or higher,
and master to legendary at 15th
level or higher). Unlike when
you first become trained at a
skill, if two different abilities
would make you an expert,
master, or legendary in a skill,
you don’t get to choose a second
skill to become expert in—the
redundant benefit simply has
no effect.
SKILL FEATS
Skill feats are a type of general
feat that often grant you a
new way to use a skill or make
you better at using a skill in a
particular way. Skill feats always
have the skill trait. These feats
appear in Chapter 5.

================================================================================
PAGE 235
================================================================================

Skill Checks and Skill DCs
When you’re actively using a skill, often by performing
one of its actions, you might attempt a skill check: rolling
a d20 and adding your skill modifier. To determine this
modifier, add your ability modifier for the skill’s key ability,
your proficiency bonus for the skill, and any other bonuses
and penalties.
Skill modifier = modifier of the skill’s key ability
score + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
When writing down the modifier on your character
sheet, you should write down only the numbers that always
apply—typically just your ability modifier and proficiency
bonus at 1st level. At higher levels, you may wear or use
items to improve your skills with item bonuses pretty much
all the time; you should write those down, too.
The GM sets the DC of a skill check, using the guidelines
in Chapter 10: Game Mastering. The most important DCs
to remember are the five simple skill DCs below.

Task Difficulty
Simple DC

Untrained

Trained

Expert

Master

Legendary
When someone or something tests your skill, they
attempt a check against your skill DC, which is equal to 10
plus your skill modifier. A skill DC works like any other DC
to determine the effect of an opposing creature’s skill action.
See page 444 in Chapter 9: Playing the Game for more
information about modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.
Armor and Skills
Some armor imposes a penalty on specific skill checks and
DCs. If a creature is wearing armor that imparts a skill
penalty, that penalty is applied to the creature’s Strengthand Dexterity-based skill checks and skill DCs, unless the
action has the attack trait. Check penalties from armor are
detailed on page 274 in Chapter 6: Equipment.
Secret Checks
Sometimes you won’t know whether you succeed at a skill
check. If an action has the secret trait, the GM rolls the check
for you and informs you of the effect without revealing the
result of the roll or the degree of success. The GM rolls
secret checks when your knowledge about the outcome is
imperfect, like when you’re searching for a hidden creature
or object, attempting to deceive someone, translating a
tricky bit of ancient text, or remembering some piece of lore.
This way, you as the player don’t know things that your
character wouldn’t. This rule is the default for actions with
the secret trait, but the GM can choose not to use secret
checks if they would rather some or all rolls be public.
Exploration and Downtime Activities
Some skill activities have the exploration or downtime
trait. Exploration activities usually take a minute or more,
while downtime activities may take a day or more. They
usually can’t be used during an encounter, though the GM
might bend this restriction. If you’re not sure whether you
have the time to use one of these activities, ask your GM.
General Skill Actions
General skill actions are skill actions that can be used
with multiple different skills. When you use a general skill
action, you might use your modifier from any skill that lists
it as one of the skill’s actions, depending on the situation.

Decipher Writing (Trained)
When you encounter particularly archaic or esoteric texts,
the GM might require you to Decipher the Writing before
you can understand it. You must be trained in the relevant
skill to Decipher Writing. Arcana is typically used for
writing about magic or science, Occultism for esoteric texts
about mysteries and philosophy, Religion for scripture, and
Society for coded messages or archaic documents.
DECIPHER WRITING
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an
obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but
might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting
ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can
read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher
text written in an unfamiliar language using Society instead.
The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or
complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one
check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.
Critical Success You understand the true meaning of the text.
Success You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was
a coded document, you know the general meaning but might
not have a word-for-word translation.
Failure You can’t understand the text and take a –2 circumstance
penalty to further checks to decipher it.
Critical Failure You believe you understand the text on that
page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.

EXTRA PREPARATION
When Earning Income, you might be able to spend days
of downtime to prepare for your task, which adjusts the
DC of the skill check. This might involve rehearsing a play,
studying a topic, and so on. The GM determines how long
preparation takes and how much the DC changes. This is
most useful when you’re trying a task that’s higher level
than you; otherwise such tasks have an increased DC!
ENDING OR INTERRUPTING TASKS
When a task you’re doing is complete, or if you stop
in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new
task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance,
if you quit your job working at the docks, you’ll need to
find another place of employment instead of picking up
where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of
downtime looking for leads on new jobs.
However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or
event that wouldn’t prevent you from returning to the old
job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where
you left off, assuming the task hasn’t been completed by
others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check
when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking,
if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can,
but if you had a bad initial roll, you can’t try for a better one
by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed
during the break—usually because you leveled up while
adventuring—you can attempt a new check.

Earn Income (Trained)
You can use a skill—typically Crafting, Lore, or
Performance—to earn money during downtime. You
must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to
set up, and your income depends on your proficiency
rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because this
process requires a significant amount of time and involves
tracking things outside the progress of adventures, it
won’t come up in every campaign.
In some cases, the GM might let you use a different skill
to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually, this is
scholarly work, such as using Religion in a monastery to
study old texts—but giving sermons at a church would still
fall under Performance instead of Religion. You also might
be able to use physical skills to make money, such as using
Acrobatics to perform feats in a circus or Thievery to pick
pockets. If you’re using a skill other than Crafting, Lore, or
Performance, the DC tends to be significantly higher.
EARN INCOME
DOWNTIME
You use one of your skills to make money during downtime.
The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative
job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the
GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can
attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though

this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to
Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.
When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your
skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine
your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your
result, the task’s level, and your proficiency rank (as listed on
Table 4–2: Income Earned).
You can continue working at the task on subsequent days
without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after
the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until
the task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can
work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some
can take months or even years.
Critical Success You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of
currency listed for the task level + 1 and your proficiency rank.
Success You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency
listed for the task level and your proficiency rank.
Failure You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum
for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the
failure column for the task level. The GM will likely reduce
how long you can continue at the task.
Critical Failure You earn nothing for your work and are fired
immediately. You can’t continue at the task. Your reputation
suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find
rewarding jobs in that community in the future.
Sample Earn Income Tasks
These examples use Alcohol Lore to work in a bar or
Legal Lore to perform legal work.
Trained bartend, do legal research
Expert curate drink selection, present minor court cases
Master run a large brewery, present important court cases
Legendary run an international brewing franchise, present
a case in Hell’s courts
Crafting Goods for the Market (Crafting)
Using Crafting, you can work at producing common
items for the market. It’s usually easy to find work making
basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement’s
level (see Earn Income on page 504). Higher-level tasks
represent special commissions, which might require you to
Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and
sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don’t
occur as often and might have special requirements—or
serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.
Practicing a Trade (Lore)
You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore
specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This
is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law,
or sailing, where there’s high demand for workers. The GM
might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks
are available if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore
skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools
to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a
merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.
INCOME EXAMPLES
The following examples show the kinds of tasks your
character might take on to Earn Income during low-level
and high-level play.
HARSK MAKES TEA
Harsk is a 3rd-level ranger and an expert at harvesting
and brewing tea. He has a Tea Lore modifier of +7. He
has 30 days of downtime at his disposal and decides to
work at a prestigious local tea house. The GM decides
this is a 5th-level task if Harsk wants to assist the tea
master, or a 2nd-level task if he wants to serve tea.
Harsk chooses the tougher task, and the GM secretly
sets the DC at 20.
Harsk rolls a 4 on his Tea Lore check for a result of 11.
Poor Harsk has failed! He earns only 2 sp for his efforts
and continues working for 3 more days, for a total of
8 sp.
At that point, the GM offers Harsk a choice: either he
can finish out the week with the tea master and look
for a new job, or he can lower his ambitions and serve
in the tea house. Harsk, now more aware of his own
capabilities, accepts the less prestigious job for now.
He moves to his new job and attempts a new Tea Lore
check against DC 16. Rolling a 19, he gets a result of
26—a critical success! He earns 5 sp per day (like a
success at a 3rd-level task). The GM rules that demand
will be high enough that Harsk can work there for the
remainder of his downtime if he so chooses, a total of
26 days. Harsk accepts and earns a total of 138 sp (13
gp, 8 sp) that month.
LEM PERFORMS
Lem is a 16th-level bard and legendary with his flute. He
has a Performance modifier of +31 with his enchanted
flute. With 30 days of downtime ahead of him, Lem
wonders if he can find something that might excite him
more than performing in front of a bunch of stuffy nobles.
He finds a momentous offer indeed—a performance in a
celestial realm, and Lem’s patron goddess Shelyn might
even be in attendance! This is a 20th-level task, and the
GM secretly sets the DC at 40.
Lem rolls an 11 on his Performance check for a result
of 42. Success! The engagement lasts for a week, and
at the end, the grateful celestials present Lem with a
beautiful living diamond rose in constant bloom worth
1,400 gold pieces (200 gp per day for 7 days).
With 23 days of downtime left, Lem accepts a 14thlevel task performing at a prestigious bardic college for
members of a royal court. The GM secretly sets the DC
at 32, and Lem critically succeeds, earning 28 gp per day
for a total of 644 gp. Between the two performances,
Lem has earned just over 2,000 gold pieces during his
downtime—though he’s not sure he’ll ever sell that rose.

================================================================================
PAGE 239
================================================================================

Staging a Performance (Performance)
You perform for an audience to make money. The available
audiences determine the level of your task, since more
discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a
bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on
the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of
commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance
for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a
2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and
royalty are increasingly higher level. Your degree of success
determines whether you moved your audience and whether
you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.
Identify Magic (Trained)
Using the skill related to the appropriate tradition, as
explained in Magical Traditions and Skills on page 238,
you can attempt to identify a magical item, location,
or ongoing effect. In many cases, you can use a skill to
attempt to Identify Magic of a tradition other than your
own at a higher DC. The GM determines whether you can
do this and what the DC is.
IDENTIFY MAGIC
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect
is magical, you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the
particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you
must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Cursed
or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be
impossible to identify using this activity alone. Heightening a
spell doesn’t increase the DC to identify it.
Critical Success You learn all the attributes of the magic,
including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means of
activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is cursed.
Success For an item or location, you get a sense of what it does
and learn any means of activating it. For an ongoing effect
(such as a spell with a duration), you learn the effect’s name
and what it does. You can’t try again in hopes of getting a
critical success.
Failure You fail to identify the magic and can’t try again for 1 day.
Critical Failure You misidentify the magic as something else
of the GM’s choice.
Magical Traditions and Skills
Each magical tradition has a corresponding skill, as shown
on the table below. You must have the trained proficiency
rank in a skill to use it to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell.
Something without a specific tradition, such as an item with
the magical trait, can be identified using any of these skills.

Learn a Spell (Trained)
If you’re a spellcaster, you can use the skill corresponding
to your magical tradition to learn a new spell of that
tradition. Table 4–3: Learning a Spell lists the Price of the
materials needed to Learn a Spell of each level.
LEARN A SPELL
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
Requirements You have a spellcasting class feature, and the
spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.
You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from
someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a
spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions,
you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must
use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were
a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn’t use
Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.
To learn the spell, you must do the following:
• Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you
must remain in conversation with a person who knows
the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
• Have materials with the Price indicated in Table 4–3.
• Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your
tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close to the
DC on Table 4–3). Uncommon or rare spells have higher
DCs; full guidelines for the GM appear on page 503.
If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the
spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it’s
added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select
it when you add or swap spells.
Critical Success You expend half the materials and learn the spell.
Success You expend the materials and learn the spell.
Failure You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you
gain a level. The materials aren’t expended.
Critical Failure As failure, plus you expend half the materials.

Recall Knowledge (Untrained)
To remember useful information on a topic, you can
attempt to Recall Knowledge. You might know basic
information about something without needing to attempt
a check, but Recall Knowledge requires you to stop and
think for a moment so you can recollect more specific
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

facts and apply them. You might even need to spend time
investigating first. For instance, to use Medicine to learn
the cause of death, you might need to conduct a forensic
examination before attempting to Recall Knowledge.
RECALL KNOWLEDGE [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
SECRET
You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of knowledge
regarding a topic related to that skill. The GM determines the
DCs for such checks and which skills apply.
Critical Success You recall the knowledge accurately and gain
additional information or context.
Success You recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful
clue about your current situation.
Critical Failure You recall incorrect information or gain an
erroneous or misleading clue.
The following skills can be used to Recall Knowledge,
getting information about the listed topics. In some cases,
you can get the GM’s permission to use a different but
related skill, usually against a higher DC than normal. Some
topics might appear on multiple lists, but the skills could
give different information. For example, Arcana might tell
you about the magical defenses of a golem, whereas Crafting
could tell you about its sturdy resistance to physical attacks.
• Arcana: Arcane theories, magical traditions,
creatures of arcane significance, and arcane planes.
• Crafting: Alchemical reactions and creatures, item
value, engineering, unusual materials, and constructs.
• Lore: The subject of the Lore skill’s subcategory.
• Medicine: Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics.
• Nature: The environment, flora, geography, weather,
creatures of natural origin, and natural planes.
• Occultism: Ancient mysteries, obscure philosophy,
creatures of occult significance, and esoteric planes.
• Religion: Divine agents, divine planes, theology,
obscure myths, and creatures of religious significance.
• Society: Local history, key personalities, legal
institutions, societal structure, and humanoid culture.
The GM might allow checks to Recall Knowledge
using other skills. For example, you might assess the skill
of an acrobat using Acrobatics. If you’re using a physical
skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely have
you use a mental ability score—typically Intelligence—
instead of the skill’s normal physical ability score.
Recall Knowledge Tasks
These examples use Society or Religion.
Untrained name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity
Trained line of succession for a major noble family, core
doctrines of a major deity
Expert genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an
ancient priest
Master hierarchy of a genie noble court, major extraplanar
temples of a deity
Legendary existence of a long-lost noble heir, secret
doctrines of a religion

Subsist (Untrained)
If you need to provide food and shelter, you can use the
Subsist downtime activity. This typically uses Society if
you’re in a settlement or Survival if you’re in the wild.
SUBSIST
DOWNTIME
You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly
others as well, with a standard of living described on page 294.
The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place
where you’re trying to Subsist. You might need a minimum
proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange environments.
Unlike most downtime activities, you can Subsist after 8 hours
or less of exploration, but if you do, you take a –5 penalty.
Critical Success You either provide a subsistence living for
yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your
own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.
Success You find enough food and shelter with basic protection
from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.
Failure You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough
food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food
and shelter.
Critical Failure You attract trouble, eat something you
shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a
–2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week.
You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored
up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you
continue failing.
Sample Subsist Tasks
Untrained lush forest with calm weather or large city
with plentiful resources
Trained typical hillside or village
Expert typical mountains or insular hamlet
Master typical desert or city under siege
Legendary barren wasteland or city of undead
Skill Descriptions
The following entries describe the skills in the game. The
heading for each entry provides the skill’s name, with
that skill’s key ability in parentheses. A brief description
of the skill is followed by a list of actions you can use if
you’re untrained in that skill, and then the actions you
can perform if you are trained in that skill. Some actions
list sample tasks for each rank to give you a better
sense of what you can accomplish as your proficiency
increases. As the actions of a skill aren’t comprehensive,
there may be times when the GM asks you to attempt
a skill check without using any of the listed actions, or
times when the GM asks you to roll using a different key
ability modifier.
Most skills include entries for success and failure, as
well as descriptions of what occurs on a critical success or
a critical failure. If either of the critical entries is absent,
treat those results as a success or failure, as normal.
Acrobatics (Dex)
Acrobatics measures your ability to perform tasks requiring
coordination and grace. When you use the Escape basic
action (page 470), you can use your Acrobatics modifier
instead of your unarmed attack modifier.
BALANCE [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You are in a square that contains a narrow
surface, uneven ground, or another similar feature.
You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground,
attempting an Acrobatics check against its Balance DC. You
are flat-footed while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.
Critical Success You move up to your Speed.
Success You move up to your Speed, treating it as difficult
terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).
Failure You must remain stationary to keep your balance
(wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.
Critical Failure You fall and your turn ends.
Sample Balance Tasks
Untrained tangled roots, uneven cobblestones
Trained wooden beam
Expert deep, loose gravel
Master tightrope, smooth sheet of ice
Legendary razor’s edge, chunks of floor falling in midair
TUMBLE THROUGH [one-action]
MOVE
You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try
to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics
check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter
its space. You can Tumble Through using Climb, Fly, Swim, or
another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.
Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating the
squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10
feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all
the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if
you had moved out of the square you started in.
Acrobatics Trained Actions
MANEUVER IN FLIGHT [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have a fly Speed.
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics
check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but
they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.
Success You succeed at the maneuver.
Failure Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply
can’t move or if some other detrimental effect happens.
The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you
attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were
trying to fly against a strong wind).
Critical Failure As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks
Trained steep ascent or descent
Expert fly against the wind, hover midair
Master reverse direction
Legendary fly through gale force winds
SQUEEZE
EXPLORATION
MOVE
You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you
can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small
spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain (page 475) that
you can move through more quickly and without a check.
Critical Success You squeeze through the tight space in
1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
Success You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
Critical Failure You become stuck in the tight space. While
you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another
Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that
check other than a critical failure causes you
to become unstuck.
Sample Squeeze Tasks
Trained space barely fitting your
shoulders
Master space barely fitting your head
Arcana (Int)
Arcana measures how much you know about arcane
magic and creatures. Even if you’re untrained, you can
Recall Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about arcane theories; magic
traditions; creatures of arcane significance (like
dragons and beasts); and the Elemental, Astral,
and Shadow Planes.
Arcana Trained ACTIONS
You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
• Decipher Writing about arcane theory.
• Identify Magic, particularly arcane magic.
• Learn a Spell from the arcane tradition.
BORROW AN ARCANE SPELL
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook,
you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s
spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the
spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than Learning
the Spell.
Success You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal
spell preparation.
Failure You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot
remains available for you to prepare a different
spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell
until the next time you prepare spells.
Athletics (Str)
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical
prowess. When you use the Escape basic action (page
470), you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your
unarmed attack modifier.
CLIMB [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have both hands free.
You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it’s
particularly easy, you must attempt an Athletics check. The
GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and

================================================================================
PAGE 243
================================================================================

environmental circumstances. You’re flat-footed unless you
have a climb Speed.
Critical Success You move up, across, or safely down the
incline for 5 feet plus 5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed
(a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
Success You move up, across, or safely down the incline for
5 feet per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 5 feet for
most PCs, minimum 5 feet if your Speed is below 20 feet).
Critical Failure You fall. If you began the climb on stable
ground, you fall and land prone.
Sample Climb Tasks
Untrained ladder, steep slope, low-branched tree
Trained rigging, rope, typical tree
Expert wall with small handholds and footholds
Master ceiling with handholds and footholds, rock wall
Legendary smooth surface

5–15 feet
20–35 feet
40–55 feet
60–65 feet
FORCE OPEN [one-action]
ATTACK
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt
to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate.
With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls.
Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item
penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.
Critical Success You open the door, window, container, or gate
and can avoid damaging it in the process.
Success You break the door, window, container, or gate open,
and the door, window, container, or gate gains the broken
condition. If it’s especially sturdy, the GM might have it take
damage but not be broken.
Critical Failure Your attempt jams the door, window, container,
or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future
attempts to Force it Open.
Sample Force Open Tasks
Untrained fabric, flimsy glass
Trained ice, sturdy glass
Expert flimsy wooden door, wooden portcullis
Master sturdy wooden door, iron portcullis, metal bar
Legendary stone or iron door
GRAPPLE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one free hand. Your target
cannot be more than one size larger than you.
You attempt to grab an opponent with your free hand.
Attempt an Athletics check against their Fortitude DC.
You can also Grapple to keep your hold on a creature you
already grabbed.
Critical Success Your opponent is restrained until the end of
your next turn unless you move or your opponent Escapes
(page 470).
Success Your opponent is grabbed until the end of your next
turn unless you move or your opponent Escapes.
Failure You fail to grab your opponent. If you already had
the opponent grabbed or restrained using a Grapple, those
conditions on that creature end.
Critical Failure If you already had the opponent grabbed or
restrained, it breaks free. Your target can either grab you,
as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you,
or force you to fall and land prone.
HIGH JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then make a vertical Leap and attempt a DC 30
Athletics check to increase the height of your jump. If you
didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check.
This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation,
as determined by the GM.
Critical Success Increase the maximum vertical distance to 8
feet, or increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet
and maximum horizontal distance to 10 feet.
Success Increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet.
Failure You Leap normally.
Critical Failure You don’t Leap at all, and instead you fall prone
in your space.
Leap
The Leap basic action is used for High Jump and Long
Jump. Leap lets you take a careful, short jump. You can
Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least
15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at
least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap
ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your
Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap
if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical
Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet
horizontally onto an elevated surface.
LONG JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then make a horizontal Leap and attempt an
Athletics check to increase the length of your jump. The DC
of the Athletics check is equal to the total distance in feet
you’re attempting to move during your Leap (so you’d need
to succeed at a DC 20 check to Leap 20 feet). You can’t Leap
farther than your Speed.
If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump
in a different direction than your Stride, you automatically fail
your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the
situation, as determined by the GM.
Success Increase the maximum horizontal distance you Leap
to the desired distance.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 244
================================================================================

Failure You Leap normally.
Critical Failure You Leap normally, but then fall and land prone.
SHOVE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You push an opponent away from you. Attempt an Athletics
check against your opponent’s Fortitude DC.
Critical Success You push your opponent up to 10 feet away
from you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the
same distance and in the same direction.
Success You push your opponent back 5 feet. You can Stride
after it, but you must move the same distance and in the
same direction.
Critical Failure You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.
Forced Movement
The Shove action can force a creature to move. When
an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the
distance you move is defined by the effect that moved you,
not by your Speed. Because you’re not acting to move, this
doesn’t trigger reactions triggered by movement.
SWIM [one-action]
MOVE
You propel yourself through water. In most calm water, you
succeed at the action without needing to attempt a check. If
you must breathe air and you’re submerged in water, you must
hold your breath each round. If you fail to hold your breath, you
begin to drown (as described on page 478). If the water you are
swimming in is turbulent or otherwise dangerous, you might
have to attempt an Athletics check to Swim.
If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a
Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the
current, as determined by the GM. However, if your last action
on your turn was to enter the water, you don’t sink or move
with the current that turn.
Critical Success You move through the water 10 feet, plus 5 feet
per 20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 15 feet for most PCs).
Success You move through the water 5 feet, plus 5 feet per
20 feet of your land Speed (a total of 10 feet for most PCs).
Critical Failure You make no progress, and if you’re holding
your breath, you lose 1 round of air.
Sample Swim Tasks
Untrained lake or other still water
Trained flowing water, like a river
Expert swiftly flowing river
Master stormy sea
Legendary maelstrom, waterfall
TRIP [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. Your target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
FALLING
When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage
when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to
half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a
fall, you’re knocked prone when you land.
If you fall into water, snow, or another soft substance,
calculate the damage from the fall as though your fall
were 20 feet shorter. The reduction can’t be greater than
the depth of the water (so when falling into water that is
only 10 feet deep, you treat the fall as 10 feet shorter).
You can Grab an Edge as a reaction (page 472) to reduce
or eliminate the damage from some falls. More detailed
rules for falling damage appear on page 463.
You try to knock an opponent to the ground. Attempt an
Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success The target falls and lands prone and takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
Success The target falls and lands prone.
Critical Failure You lose your balance and fall and land prone.
Athletics Trained Action
DISARM [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You try to knock something out of an opponent’s grasp.
Attempt an Athletics check against the opponent’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success You knock the item out of the opponent’s
grasp. It falls to the ground in the opponent’s space.
Success You weaken your opponent’s grasp on the item. Until
the start of that creature’s turn, attempts to Disarm the
opponent of that item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and
the target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attacks with
the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item.
Critical Failure You lose your balance and become flat-footed
until the start of your next turn.
Crafting (Int)
You can use this skill to create, understand, and repair items.
Even if you’re untrained, you can Recall Knowledge
(page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about alchemical reactions, the
value of items, engineering, unusual materials,
and alchemical or mechanical creatures. The GM
determines which creatures this applies to, but it
usually includes constructs.
REPAIR
EXPLORATION
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have a repair kit (page 291).
You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing
the item on a stable surface and using the repair kit with

================================================================================
PAGE 245
================================================================================

both hands. The GM sets the DC, but it’s usually about the same
DC to Repair a given item as it is to Craft it in the first place. You
can’t Repair a destroyed item.
Critical Success You restore 10 Hit Points to the item, plus an
additional 10 Hit Points per proficiency rank you have in
Crafting (a total of 20 HP if you’re trained, 30 HP if you’re an
expert, 40 HP if you’re a master, or 50 HP if you’re legendary).
Success You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional
5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of
10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you’re an expert, 20 HP if
you’re a master, or 25 HP if you’re legendary).
Critical Failure You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the
item’s Hardness to this damage.
Crafting Trained Actions
You must be trained in Crafting to use it to Earn Income
(page 236).
• Earn Income by crafting goods for the market.
CRAFT
DOWNTIME
MANIPULATE
You can make an item from raw materials. You need the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items, the
Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items, and the Snare
Crafting feat to create snares.
To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
• The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn’t list
a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you
must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s 16th or higher,
you must be legendary.
• You have the formula for the item; see Getting
Formulas below for more information.
• You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many
cases, a workshop. For example, you need access to a
smithy to forge a metal shield.
• You must supply raw materials worth at least half the
item’s Price. You always expend at least that amount
of raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re
in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get
the amount of raw materials you need, except in the
case of rarer precious materials.
You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt
a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Craft the item
based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances.
If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend
the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining
portion of the item’s Price in materials to complete the item
immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days
working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce
the value of the materials you need to expend to complete
the item. This amount is determined using Table 4–2: Income
Earned (page 236), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting
and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of
these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending
the remaining portion of its Price in materials. If the downtime
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 246
================================================================================

days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish
the item later, continuing where you left off. An example of
Crafting appears in the sidebar.
Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional
day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete
the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your
proficiency rank in Crafting.
Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent
Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete the item
by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.
Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw
materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try
again, you must start over.
Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of
the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the
rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.
Consumables and Ammunition
You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches,
making up to four of the same item at once with a single
check. This requires you to include the raw materials
for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must
complete the batch all at once. You also Craft non-magical
ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in Table
6–8: Ranged Weapons (typically 10).
Getting Formulas
You can gain access to the formulas for all common
items in Chapter 6: Equipment by purchasing a basic
crafter’s book (page 287). See the rules on page 293 for
information on how to acquire other formulas.
 IDENTIFY ALCHEMY
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Requirements You have alchemist’s tools (page 287).
You can identify the nature of an alchemical item with 10 minutes
of testing using alchemist’s tools. If your attempt is interrupted
in any way, you must start over.
Success You identify the item and the means of activating it.
Failure You fail to identify the item but can try again.
Critical Failure You misidentify the item as another item of
the GM’s choice.
Deception (Cha)
You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and
other forms of subterfuge.
CREATE A DIVERSION [one-action]
MENTAL
With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can
create a diversion that draws creatures’ attention elsewhere.
If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate
trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and
linguistic traits.
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the
CRAFTING EXAMPLE
Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in Crafting. He
has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the Magical Crafting
feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him, he decides
to craft a striking rune, a 4th-level item. The GM secretly
chooses a DC of 19.
The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32 gp,
5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp, 5 sp
worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 4 days
building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his Crafting
check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At this point,
Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp worth of
materials to complete the item immediately for 65 gp.
However, Ezren has 10 more days on his hands, so he
decides to spend additional time to complete the item.
Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert at Crafting,
he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1 gp for each day
spent. After spending 10 days working, he reduces the cost
to complete the item from 65 gp to 55 gp. He spends the
remaining portion of its Price in materials, completes the
striking rune, and goes out on his next adventure. (He could
have stayed home to keep working on the striking rune,
eventually reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he
paid up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!)
If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher, he’d
have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d reduce the
remaining amount by 2 gp per day, lowering the amount
needed to complete the item after 10 additional days of
work to 45 gp.
Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you’re trying
to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt
to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs
against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.
Success You become hidden to each creature whose
Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The
hidden condition allows you to Sneak away, as described
on page 252.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until
you do anything except Step or use the Hide or the Sneak
action of the Stealth skill (pages 251 and 252). If you Strike
a creature, the creature remains flat‑footed against that
attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything
else, you become observed just before you act unless the
GM determines otherwise.
Failure You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose
Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are
aware you were trying to trick them.
IMPERSONATE
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
MANIPULATE
SECRET
You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or
something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes
10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on page 290), but
a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying
to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.

================================================================================
PAGE 247
================================================================================

In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your
deception only if they use the Seek action to attempt
Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt
to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM
rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s
Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific
individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a
circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person
you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception
check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.
Success You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person
you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check
if your behavior changes.
Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
Critical Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you claim
to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without
a disguise.
LIE
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
SECRET
You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at
least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single
Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC of
every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give them
a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of
the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable
lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler
and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it’s
impossible to get anyone to believe them.
At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes your
lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense Motive
against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This usually
happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter
your statements.
Success The target believes your lie.
Failure The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4
circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the
duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely
to be suspicious of you in the future.
Deception Trained Action
FEINT [one-action]
MENTAL
Requirements You are within melee reach of the opponent you
attempt to Feint.
With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared
for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against that
opponent’s Perception DC.
Critical Success You throw your enemy’s defenses against
you entirely off. The target is flat-footed against melee
attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your
next turn.
Success Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is
flat-footed against the next melee attack that you attempt
against it before the end of your current turn.
Critical Failure Your feint backfires. You are flat-footed against
melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end
of your next turn.
Diplomacy (Cha)
You influence others through negotiation and flattery.
GATHER INFORMATION
EXPLORATION
SECRET
You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in
an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The
GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it
takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any
benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes,
drinks, or gifts.
Success You collect information about the individual or topic.
The GM determines the specifics.
Critical Failure You collect incorrect information about the
individual or topic.
Sample Gather Information Tasks
Untrained talk of the town
Trained common rumor
Expert obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret
Master well-guarded or esoteric information
Legendary information known only to an incredibly
select few, or only to extraordinary beings
MAKE AN IMPRESSION
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage
in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill,
you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them
temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt
a Diplomacy check against the Will DC of one target, modified
by any circumstances the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad
impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social
interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.
Critical Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by
two steps.
Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
Critical Failure The target’s attitude toward you decreases by
one step.
Changing Attitudes
Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes
that reflect how they view your character. These are
only a brief summary of a creature’s disposition. The
GM will supply additional nuance based on the history
and beliefs of the characters you’re interacting with, and
their attitudes can change in accordance with the story.
The attitudes are detailed in the Conditions Appendix and
are summarized here.
• Helpful: Willing to help you and responds favorably to
your requests.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 248
================================================================================

• Friendly: Has a good attitude toward you, but won’t
necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
• Indifferent: Doesn’t care about you either way. (Most
NPCs start out indifferent.)
• Unfriendly: Dislikes you and doesn’t want to help you.
• Hostile: Actively works against you—and might attack
you just because of their dislike.
No one can ever change the attitude of a player character
with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with
player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the
player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or
charming a character is, but players make the ultimate
decisions about how their characters respond.
REQUEST [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
You can make a request of a creature that’s friendly or helpful
to you. You must couch the request in terms that the target
would accept given their current attitude toward you. The
GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some
requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC
would never agree to them.
Critical Success The target agrees to your request without
qualifications.
Success The target agrees to your request, but they might
demand added provisions or alterations to the request.
Failure The target refuses the request, though they might
propose an alternative that is less extreme.
Critical Failure Not only does the target refuse the request,
but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to
the temerity of the request.
Intimidation (Cha)
You bend others to your will using threats.
COERCE
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
EXPLORATION
LINGUISTIC
MENTAL
With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a
creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least 1
minute of conversation with a creature you can see and that
can either see or sense you. At the end of the conversation,
attempt an Intimidation check against the target’s Will DC,
modified by any circumstances the GM determines. The
attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized in
the Changing Attitudes sidebar on page 246 and described in
full in the Conditions Appendix, starting on page 618.
Critical Success The target gives you the information you
seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they
aren’t likely to harm the target in any way. The target
continues to comply for an amount of time determined by
the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target
becomes unfriendly (if they weren’t already unfriendly
or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to
retaliate—at least in the short term.
Success As critical success, but once the target becomes
unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for
example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting
your enemies.
Failure The target doesn’t do what you say, and if they were
not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.
Critical Failure The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile
if they weren’t already, and can’t be Coerced by you for at
least 1 week.
DEMORALIZE [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
EMOTION
MENTAL
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy’s resolve. Choose a creature
within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt an
Intimidation check against that target’s Will DC. If the target
does not understand the language you are speaking, you’re
not speaking a language, or they can’t hear you, you take a
–4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your
result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to
Demoralize it for 10 minutes.
Critical Success The target becomes frightened 2.
Success The target becomes frightened 1.
Lore (Int)
You have specialized information on a narrow topic.
Lore features many subcategories. You might have
Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar
subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its
own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore
wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore,
for example.
You gain a specific subcategory of the Lore skill from
your background. The GM determines what other
subcategories they’ll allow as Lore skills, though these
categories are always less broad than any of the other
skills that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they
should never be able to fully or mainly take the place
of another skill’s Recall Knowledge action. For instance,
Magic Lore wouldn’t enable you to recall the same
breadth of knowledge covered by Arcana, Adventuring
Lore wouldn’t simply give you all the information an
adventurer needs, and Planar Lore would not be sufficient
to gain all the information spread across various skills
and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.
If you have multiple subcategories of Lore that could
apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill
in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better
skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there’s
any doubt whether a Lore skill applies to a specific topic
or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.
Even if you’re untrained in Lore, you can use it to
Recall Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about the subject of your Lore
skill’s subcategory.

================================================================================
PAGE 249
================================================================================

Lore Trained Action
You must be trained in Lore to use it to Earn Income
(page 236).
• Earn Income by using your knowledge to practice
a trade.
Medicine (Wis)
You can patch up wounds and help people recover from
diseases and poisons. Even if you’re untrained in Medicine,
you can use it to Recall Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about diseases, injuries, poisons,
and other ailments. You can use this to perform
forensic examinations if you spend 10 minutes
(or more, as determined by the GM) checking for
evidence such as wound patterns. This is most useful
when determining how a body was injured or killed.
ADMINISTER FIRST AID [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying or
bleeding. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which
ailment you’re trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer
First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.
• Stabilize Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that
has 0 Hit Points and the dying condition. The DC is
equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically
15 + its dying value).
• Stop Bleeding Attempt a Medicine check on a creature
that is taking persistent bleed damage (page 452),
giving them a chance to make another flat check to
remove the persistent damage. The DC is usually the DC
of the effect that caused the bleed.
Success If you’re trying to stabilize, the creature loses the dying
condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying to stop
bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.
Critical Failure If you were trying to stabilize, the creature’s
dying value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop
bleeding, it immediately takes an amount of damage equal
to its persistent bleed damage.
Medicine Trained Actions
TREAT DISEASE
DOWNTIME
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature. Attempt
a Medicine check against the disease’s DC. After you attempt to
Treat a Disease for a creature, you can’t try again until after that
creature’s next save against the disease.
Critical Success You grant the creature a +4 circumstance
bonus to its next saving throw against the disease.
Success You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to its
next saving throw against the disease.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the disease.
TREAT POISON [one-action]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You treat a patient to prevent the spread of poison. Attempt a
Medicine check against the poison’s DC. After you attempt to

Treat a Poison for a creature, you can’t try again until after the
next time that creature attempts a save against the poison.
Critical Success You grant the creature a +4 circumstance
bonus to its next saving throw against the poison.
Success You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to its
next saving throw against the poison.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the poison.
TREAT WOUNDS
EXPLORATION
HEALING
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have healer’s tools (page 290).
You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature
(targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then
temporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but
this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a
patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).
The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might
adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient
outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you’re
an expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check
to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you’re a master of
Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase
the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you’re legendary, you can
instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained
by 50. The damage dealt on a critical failure remains the same.
If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the
target to grant additional healing. If you treat them for a total
of 1 hour, double the Hit Points they regain from Treat Wounds.
The result of your Medicine check determines how many
Hit Points the target regains.
Critical Success The target regains 4d8 Hit Points, and its
wounded condition is removed.
Success The target regains 2d8 Hit Points, and its wounded
condition is removed.
Critical Failure The target takes 1d8 damage.
Nature (Wis)
You know a great deal about the natural world, and you
command and train animals and magical beasts. Even
if you’re untrained in Nature, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about fauna, flora, geography,
weather, the environment, creatures of natural origin
(like animals, beasts, fey, and plants), the First World,
the Material Plane, and the Elemental Planes.
COMMAND AN ANIMAL [one-action]
AUDITORY
CONCENTRATE
You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check
against the animal’s Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if the
animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a course of
action it was predisposed toward, or you offer it a treat.
You automatically fail if the animal is hostile or unfriendly
to you. If the animal is helpful to you, increase your degree of
COMMANDED ANIMALS
Issuing commands to an animal doesn’t always go
smoothly. An animal is an independent creature with
limited intelligence. Most animals understand only the
simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct
your animal to move to a certain square but not dictate
a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a
certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The
GM decides the specifics of the action your animal uses.
The animal does what you commanded as soon as
it can, usually as its first action on its next turn. If you
successfully commanded it multiple times, it does what
you said in order. It forgets all commands beyond what it
can accomplish on its turn. If multiple people command
the same animal, the GM determines how the animal
reacts. The GM might also make the DC higher if someone
has already tried to Command the Animal that round.
success by one step. You might be able to Command an Animal
more easily with a feat like Ride (page 266).
Most animals know the Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and
Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a
horse’s Gallop, you can Command the Animal to perform the
activity, but you must spend as many actions on Command
an Animal as the activity’s number of actions. You can also
spend multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform
that number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance, you
could spend 3 actions to Command an Animal to Stride three
times or to Stride twice and then Strike.
Success The animal does as you command on its next turn.
Failure The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does nothing.
Critical Failure The animal misbehaves or misunderstands,
and it takes some other action determined by the GM.
Nature Trained Actions
You must be trained in Nature to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
• Identify Magic, particularly primal magic.
• Learn a Spell from the primal tradition.
Occultism (Int)
You know a great deal about ancient philosophies, esoteric
lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural creatures. Even
if you’re untrained in Occultism, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about ancient mysteries; obscure
philosophies; creatures of occult significance (like
aberrations, spirits, and oozes); and the Positive
Energy, Negative Energy, Shadow, Astral, and
Ethereal Planes.
Occultism Trained Actions
You must be trained in Occultism to use it for the
following general skill actions (page 234).

================================================================================
PAGE 251
================================================================================

• Decipher Writing on occult topics, including
complex metaphysical systems, syncretic principles,
weird philosophies, and incoherent ramblings.
• Identify Magic, particularly occult magic.
• Learn a Spell from the occult tradition.
Performance (Cha)
You are skilled at a form of performance, using your
talents to impress a crowd or make a living.
Basic Competence
Some performances require you to be more than just
charismatic, and if you don’t meet the demands of the
art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty
based on the relevant ability score. For example, if
you’re dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier,
you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing.
Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative
Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your
raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your
intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write
your speeches!
Performance Traits
When you use an action that utilizes the Performance
skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of
performance. The GM might change these depending on
the circumstances, but the most common performancebased traits are listed below.
Performance
Additional Traits
Act or perform comedy
Auditory, linguistic, and visual
Dance
Move and visual
Play an instrument
Auditory and manipulate
Orate or sing
Auditory and linguistic
PERFORM [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance,
or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is most
useful when you want to prove your capability or impress
someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its
own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy
checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—
if the GM sees fit.
Critical Success Your performance impresses the observers,
and they’re likely to share stories of your ability.
Success You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the
quality of your performance.
Failure Your performance falls flat.
Critical Failure You demonstrate only incompetence.
Sample Perform Tasks
Untrained audience of commoners
Trained audience of artisans
Expert audience of merchants or minor nobles
Master audience of high nobility or minor royalty
Legendary audience of major royalty or otherworldly beings
Performance Trained Action
You must be trained in Performance to use it to Earn
Income (page 236).
• Earn Income by staging a performance.
Religion (Wis)
The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of
divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to
you. You also understand how magic works, though
your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge.
Even if you’re untrained in Religion, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge (page 238).
• Recall Knowledge about divine agents, the finer
points of theology, obscure myths regarding a
faith, and creatures of religious significance (like
celestials, fiends, and undead), the Outer Sphere,
and the Positive and Negative Energy Planes.
Religion Trained Actions
You must be trained in Religion to use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
• Decipher Writing of a religious nature, including
allegories, homilies, and proverbs.
• Identify Magic, particularly divine magic.
• Learn a Spell from the divine tradition.
Society (Int)
You understand the people and systems that make
civilization run, and you know the historical events that
make societies what they are today. Further, you can use
that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal,
and economic workings of settlements. Even if you’re
untrained in Society, you can use it for the following
general skill actions (page 234).
• Recall Knowledge about local history, important
personalities, legal institutions, societal structure,
and humanoid cultures. The GM might allow
Society to apply to other creatures that are major
elements of society in your region, such as the
draconic nobility in a kingdom of humans ruled
by dragons.
• Subsist in a settlement by finding shelter, scrounging,
or begging for food.
Society Trained Actions
You must be trained in Society to use it to Decipher
Writing (page 234).
• Decipher Writing that’s a coded message, text
written in an incomplete or archaic form, or in
some cases, text in a language you don’t know.

================================================================================

CREATE FORGERY
DOWNTIME
SECRET
You create a forged document, usually over the course of a
day or a week. You must have the proper writing material to
create a forgery. When you Create a Forgery, the GM rolls a
secret DC 20 Society check. If you succeed, the forgery is of
good enough quality that passive observers can’t notice the
fake. Only those who carefully examine the document and
attempt a Perception or Society check against your Society
DC can do so.
If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific
to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document
before, and you gain up to a +4 circumstance bonus to your
check, as well as to your DC (the GM determines the bonus).
To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of
that person’s handwriting.
If your check result was below 20, the forgery has some
obvious signs of being a fake, so the GM compares your
result to each passive observer’s Perception DC or Society DC,
whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below.
Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result
is used against all passive observers’ DCs no matter how many
creatures passively observe that document.
An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still
choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for
a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods
beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with
your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a
Perception or Society check against your Society DC (if they
succeed, they know your document is a forgery).
Success The observer does not detect the forgery.
Failure The observer knows your document is a forgery.
Stealth (Dex)
You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip
past foes, hide, or conceal an item.
CONCEAL AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE
SECRET
You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of
light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past
someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check
and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once
the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same
result is used no matter how many passive observers you
try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you
for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your
Stealth DC (finding the object on success).
You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your
person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment
within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in
an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth
DC to determine whether they find the object.
Success The object remains undetected.
Failure The searcher finds the object.
BEING STEALTHY
If you want to sneak around when there are creatures
that can see you, you can use a combination of Hide and
Sneak to do so.
• First, Hide behind something (either by taking
advantage of cover or having the concealed condition
due to fog, a spell, or a similar effect). A successful
Stealth check makes you hidden, though the creatures
still know roughly where you are.
• Second, now that you’re hidden, you can Sneak. That
means you can move at half your Speed and attempt
another Stealth check. If it’s successful, you’re now
undetected. That means the creatures don’t know
which square you’re in anymore.
If you were approaching creatures that didn’t know
you were there, you could begin Sneaking right away,
since they didn’t know your location to start with. Some
actions can cause you to become observed again, but
they’re mostly what you’d expect: standing out in the
open, attacking someone, making a bunch of noise, and
so forth. If you Strike someone after successfully Hiding
or Sneaking, though, they’re flat-footed to that Strike.
Creatures can try to find you using the Seek action,
described on page 471.
Three conditions explain the states of detection.
Remember that these conditions are relative to each
creature—you can be observed by one creature while
hidden to another and undetected by a third.
OBSERVED
You’re in the creature’s clear view.
HIDDEN
The creature knows your location but can’t see you.
UNDETECTED
The creature doesn’t know your location.
HIDE [one-action]
SECRET
You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into
concealment to become hidden, rather than observed. The
GM rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the
result to the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed
by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are
concealed from. You gain the circumstance bonus from cover
or greater cover to your check.
Success If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden
from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or
undetected by the creature, you retain that condition.
If you successfully become hidden to a creature but
then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be
concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease
being hidden if you do anything except Hide, Sneak, or Step.

================================================================================
PAGE 253
================================================================================

If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains flatfooted against that attack, and you then become observed. If
you do anything else, you become observed just before you
act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow
you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without
being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.
If a creature uses Seek to make you observed by it, you
must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.
SNEAK [one-action]
MOVE
SECRET
You can attempt to move to another place while becoming
or staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can
use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming
instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement
type; you must move at half that Speed.)
If you’re undetected by a creature and it’s impossible for that
creature to observe you (for a typical creature, this includes
when you’re invisible, the observer is blinded, or you’re in
darkness and the creature can’t see in darkness), for any critical
failure you roll on a check to Sneak, you get a failure instead.
You also continue to be undetected if you lose cover or greater
cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature.
At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your Stealth
check in secret and compares the result to the Perception
DC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by
at the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater
cover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the
+2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover)
to your Stealth check. Because you’re moving, the bonus
increase from Taking Cover doesn’t apply. You don’t get to roll
against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neither
are concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against
it. You automatically become observed by such a creature.
Success You’re undetected by the creature during your movement
and remain undetected by the creature at the end of it.
You become observed as soon as you do anything other
than Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature,
the creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and you
then become observed. If you do anything else, you become
observed just before you act unless the GM determines
otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly
unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring
another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate
loud noise, you become hidden instead of undetected.
If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a
result, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected
by that creature again.
Failure A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away,
though you still remain unseen. You’re hidden from the
creature throughout your movement and remain so.
Critical Failure You’re spotted! You’re observed by the creature
throughout your movement and remain so. If you’re
invisible and were hidden from the creature, instead of
being observed you’re hidden throughout your movement
and remain so.
Survival (Wis)
You are adept at living in the wilderness, foraging for
food and building shelter, and with training you discover
the secrets of tracking and hiding your trail. Even if you’re
untrained, you can still use Survival to Subsist (page 240).
• Subsist in the wild by foraging for food and
building shelter.
SENSE DIRECTION
EXPLORATION
SECRET
Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the
geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay
oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check
only once per day, but some environments or changes might
necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC
and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so).
More unusual locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might
require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense
Direction. Without a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to
checks to Sense Direction.
Critical Success You get an excellent sense of where you are.
If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you
know them exactly.
Success You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming
hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal
directions, you have a sense of those directions.
Sense Direction Tasks
Untrained determine a cardinal direction using the sun
Trained find an overgrown path in a forest
Expert navigate a hedge maze
Master navigate a byzantine labyrinth or relatively
featureless desert
Legendary navigate an ever-changing dream realm
Survival Trained Actions
COVER TRACKS
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
MOVE
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed,
using the rules on page 479). You don’t need to attempt a
Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you
must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it
is higher than the normal DC to Track.
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In
this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the
exploration trait.
TRACK
CONCENTRATE
EXPLORATION
MOVE
You follow tracks, moving at up to half your travel Speed, using
the rules on page 479). After a successful check to Track, you
can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without
attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour. In some cases,
you might Track in an encounter. In this case, Track is a single
action and doesn’t have the exploration trait, but you might
Core Rulebook

================================================================================

================================================================================

need to roll more often because you’re in a tense situation.
The GM determines how often you must attempt this check.
You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking,
once every hour you continue tracking, and any time
something significant changes in the trail. The GM determines
the DCs for such checks, depending on the freshness of the
trail, the weather, and the type of ground.
Success You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re
already following.
Failure You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
Critical Failure You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.
Sample Track Tasks
Untrained the path of a large army following a road
Trained relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear
through the plains
Expert a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks
after the rain
Master tracks after a winter snow, tracks of a mouse or
smaller creature, tracks left on surfaces that can’t hold
prints like bare rock
Legendary old tracks through a windy desert’s sands,
tracks after a major blizzard or hurricane
Thievery (Dex)
You are trained in a particular set of skills favored by
thieves and miscreants.
PALM AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE
Palming a small, unattended object without being noticed
requires you to roll a single Thievery check against the
Perception DCs of all creatures who are currently observing
you. You take the object whether or not you successfully
conceal that you did so. You can typically only Palm Objects
of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise
depending on the situation.
Success The creature does not notice you Palming the Object.
Failure The creature notices you Palming the Object, and the
GM determines the creature’s response.
STEAL [one-action]
MANIPULATE
You try to take a small object from another creature without
being noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object of
negligible Bulk, and you automatically fail if the creature who
has the object is in combat or on guard.
Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully
Steal the object. The DC to Steal is usually the Perception DC
of the creature wearing the object. This assumes the object
is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch
filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). If the object
is in a pocket or similarly protected, you take a –5 penalty to
your Thievery check. The GM might increase the DC of your
check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such
as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment
mixed in with other documents).
You might also need to compare your Thievery check result
against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person
wearing the object. The GM may increase the Perception DCs
of these observers if they’re distracted.
Success You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an
observer doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.
Failure The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can
take the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt
to take the item. The GM determines the response of any
creature that notices your theft.
Thievery Trained Actions
DISABLE A DEVICE [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements Some devices require you to use thieves’ tools
(page 291) when disabling them.
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex
device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before
becoming disabled, depending on its construction and
complexity. Thieves’ tools are helpful and sometimes even
required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and
sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in
Thievery to disable it.
Your Thievery check result determines how much progress
you make.
Critical Success You disable the device, or you achieve two
successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no
trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later,
if that type of device can be rearmed.
Success You disable the device, or you achieve one success
toward disabling a complex device.
Critical Failure You trigger the device.
PICK A LOCK [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You have thieves’ tools (page 291).
Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a
Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity
and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick (locks
and their DCs are found on page 290). Locks of higher qualities
might require multiple successes to unlock, since otherwise even
an unskilled burglar could easily crack the lock by attempting
the check until they rolled a natural 20. If you lack the proper
tools, the GM might let you used improvised picks, which are
treated as shoddy tools, depending on the specifics of the lock.
Critical Success You unlock the lock, or you achieve two
successes toward opening a complex lock. You leave no
trace of your tampering.
Success You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward
opening a complex lock.
Critical Failure You break your tools. Fixing them requires using
Crafting to Repair them or else swapping in replacement
picks (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for infiltrator thieves’ tools).

Improvising New Activities
If a player wants to do something not covered by other
rules, here are some guidelines. If the activity is similar
to an action someone could use in an encounter, such
as Avoid Notice, it usually consists of a single action
repeated roughly 10 times per minute (such as using the
Sneak action 10 times) or an alternation of actions that
works out similarly (such as Search, which alternates
Stride and Seek). An activity using a quicker pace,
corresponding to roughly 20 actions per minute, might
have limited use or cause fatigue, as would one requiring
intense concentration.
You might find that a player wants to do something
equivalent to spending 3 actions every 6 seconds, just like
they would in combat. Characters can exert themselves to
this extent in combat only because combat lasts such a
short time—such exertion isn’t sustainable over the longer
time frame of exploration.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 500
================================================================================

MONITORING SPELL DURATIONS
Spell durations are approximate values that codify the
vagaries and eccentricities of magic into a convenient
number. However, that doesn’t mean you can set your
watch by a spell with a 1-hour duration. This is one of
the reasons the passage of time outside of encounters is
in your hands and isn’t as precise as encounter rounds.
If a question arises about whether a spell has expired,
you make the call. You shouldn’t be punitive, but you also
shouldn’t treat characters like they move with clockwork
precision and perfect efficiency between encounters.
There are two times these durations matter most: when
players try to fit multiple encounters within the duration
of a spell, and when they want to use a spell before a fight
and keep it in effect during the encounter.
Multiple Encounters
A 1-minute spell should last for multiple encounters only if
the encounters happen in very close proximity (usually in
two adjoining rooms) and if the PCs go directly from one
fight to the next without leaving encounter mode. If they
want to stop and heal, or if the party debates whether to go
on, the process takes enough time that the spell runs out.
Be more generous with spells lasting 10 minutes or
more. A 10-minute spell easily lasts for one encounter and
could continue for another if the locations are close. A
1-hour spell usually lasts for several encounters.
Before a Fight
Casting advantageous spells before a fight (sometimes
called “pre-buffing”) gives the characters a big advantage,
since they can spend more combat rounds on offensive
actions instead of preparatory ones. If the players have the
drop on their foes, you usually can let each character cast
one spell or prepare in some similar way, then roll initiative.
Casting preparatory spells before combat becomes
a problem when it feels rote and the players assume it
will always work—that sort of planning can’t hold up in
every situation! In many cases, the act of casting spells
gives away the party’s presence. In cases where the PCs’
preparations could give them away, you might roll for
initiative before everyone can complete their preparations.
you should usually offer the choice of that roll or
Perception and let the player decide. Don’t do this if it’s
absolutely clear another kind of check matters more sense
than Perception, such as when the character is sneaking
up on enemies and should definitely use Stealth.
You can allow a player to make a case that they should
use a different skill than Perception, but only if they
base it on something they’ve established beforehand. For
example, if in the prelude to the attack, Merisiel’s player
had said, “I’m going to dangle down off the chandelier to
get the drop on them,” you could let them use Acrobatics
for their initiative roll. If they just said, “Hey, I want to
attack these guys. Can I use Acrobatics?” without having
established a reason beforehand, you probably shouldn’t
allow it.
Character Placement
When calling for initiative for a combat encounter, you’ll
need to decide where the participants in the encounter
go on the battle map. Use the party’s order, described on
page 497, as a base. You can move forward characters
who are using Stealth to get into position, putting them
in a place they could reasonably have moved up to before
having a chance to be detected. Consult with each player
to make sure their position makes sense to both of you.
RESTING
Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day. Though
resting typically happens at night, a group gains the
same benefits for resting during the day. Either way,
they can gain the benefits of resting only once every 24
hours. A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the
following ways:
• The character regains Hit Points equal to their
Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied
by their level. If they rest without any shelter or
comfort, you might reduce this healing by half (to a
minimum of 1 HP).
• The character loses the fatigued condition.
• The character reduces the severity of the doomed
and drained conditions by 1.
• Most spellcasters need to rest before they regain
their spells for the day.
A group in exploration mode can attempt to rest, but
they aren’t entirely safe from danger, and their rest might
be interrupted. The 8 hours of rest do not need to be
consecutive, however, and after an interruption, characters
can go back to sleep.
Sleeping in armor results in poor rest and causes a
character to wake up fatigued. If a character would have
recovered from fatigue, sleeping in armor prevents it.
If a character goes more than 16 hours without going
to sleep, they become fatigued.
Taking long-term rest for faster recovery is part of
downtime and can’t be done during exploration. See
page 502 for these rules.
Watches and Surprise Attacks
Adventuring parties usually put a few people on guard to
watch out for danger while the others rest. Spending time
on watch also interrupts sleep, so a night’s schedule needs
to account for everyone’s time on guard duty. Table 10–3:
Watches and Rest on the next page indicates how long the
group needs to set aside for rest, assuming everyone gets a
rotating watch assignment of equal length.
If a surprise encounter would occur during rest, you
can roll a die to randomly determine which character is
on watch at the time. All characters roll initiative; sleeping
characters typically roll Perception with a –4 status penalty
GAME MASTERING

================================================================================
PAGE 501
================================================================================

for being unconscious. They don’t automatically wake up
when rolling initiative, but they might roll a Perception
check to wake up at the start of their turn due to noise. If a
savvy enemy waits for a particularly vulnerable character to
take watch before attacking, the attack can happen on that
character’s watch automatically. However, you might have
the ambusher attempt a Stealth check against the Perception
DCs of all characters to see if anyone noticed its approach.

DAILY PREPARATIONS
Just before setting out to explore, or after a night’s rest,
the PCs spend time to prepare for the adventuring day.
This typically happens over the span of 30 minutes to an
hour in the morning, but only after 8 full hours of rest.
Daily preparations include the following.
• Spellcasters who prepare spells choose which spells
they’ll have available that day.
• Focus Points and other abilities that reset during
daily preparations refresh. This includes abilities that
can be used only a certain number of times per day.
• Each character equips their gear. This includes
donning their armor and strapping on their weapons.
• Characters invest up to 10 worn magic items to gain
their benefits for the day (page 531).
STARVATION AND THIRST
Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive
comfortably. When they can’t, they’re fatigued until
they do. After 1 day + a creature’s Constitution modifier
without water, it takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t
be healed until it quenches its thirst. After the same
amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day
that can’t be healed until it sates its hunger.
Downtime
In downtime, you can sum up the important events of
a whole day with just one roll. Use this mode when the
characters return home or otherwise aren’t adventuring.
Usually, downtime is a few minutes at the start of a
session or a break between major chapters of an adventure.
As with exploration, you might punctuate downtime with
roleplaying or encounters when it’s natural to do so.
This section describes ways to handle downtime and
details several activities and considerations specific to
downtime, such as cost of living, buying and selling goods,
long-term rest, and retraining. Most other downtime
activities are skill actions; a number of these common
downtime activities and their associated skills are listed
below. See the relevant skills in Chapter 4 for details.
• Craft (Crafting)
• Earn Income (Crafting, Lore, Performance)
• Treat Disease (Medicine)
• Create Forgery (Society)
• Subsist (Society, Survival)
Stakes: None to low. Downtime is the counterpart to
adventuring and covers low-risk activities.
Time Scale: Downtime can last days, weeks, months,
or years in the game world in a few minutes of real time.
Actions and Reactions: If you need to use actions and
reactions, switch to exploration or encounter mode.
A creature that can’t act is unable to perform most
downtime activities, but it can take long-term rest.
PLAYING OUT A DOWNTIME DAY
At the start of a given day of downtime, have all the players
declare what their characters are trying to accomplish that
day. You can then resolve one character’s efforts at a time
(or group some characters together, if they are cooperating
on a single project). Some activities, such as Earning
Income, require only a simple roll and some embellishment
from you and the player. Other activities are more involved,
incorporating encounters or exploration. You can call on
the players to play out their downtime activities in any
order, though it’s often best to do the simplest ones first.
Players who aren’t part of a more involved activity might
have time to take a break from the table while the more
complex activities are played out.
Characters can undertake their daily preparations if
they want, just as they would on a day of exploration.
Ask players to establish a standard set of preparations,
and you can assume the characters go through the same
routine every day unless their players say otherwise.
Cooperation
Multiple characters can cooperate on the same downtime
task. If it’s a simple task that requires just one check, such
as a party Subsisting as they await rescue on a desert
island, one character rolls the necessary check while
everyone else Aids that character. If it’s a complex task,
assume all of them are working on different parts of it at
one time, so all their efforts count toward its completion.
For example, a party might collaborate to build a theater,
with one character drawing up architectural plans, one
doing manual labor, and one talking to local politicians
and guilds.
Checks
Some downtime activities require rolls, typically skill
checks. Because these rolls represent the culmination
of a series of tasks over a long period, players can’t use
most abilities or spells that manipulate die rolls, such as
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 502
================================================================================

activating a magic item to gain a bonus or casting a fortune
spell to roll twice. Constant benefits still apply, though,
so someone might invest a magic item that gives them
a bonus without requiring activation. You might make
specific exceptions to this rule. If something could apply
constantly, or so often that it might as well be constant, it’s
more likely to be used for downtime checks.
LONGER PERIODS OF DOWNTIME
Running downtime during a long time off—like several
weeks, months, or even years—can be more challenging.
However, it’s also an opportunity for the characters to
progress toward long-term plans rather than worrying
about day-to-day activities. Because so much time is
involved, characters don’t roll a check for each day.
Instead, they deal with a few special events, average out
the rest of the downtime, and pay for their cost of living.
Events
After the characters state what they want to achieve in their
downtime, select a few standout events for each of them—
usually one event for a period of a week or a month, or
four events for a year or longer. These events should be
tailored to each character and their goals, and they can
serve as hooks for adventures or plot development.
Though the following examples of downtime events
all involve Earning Income, you can use them to spark
ideas for other activities. A character using Perform to
Earn Income could produce a commanding performance
of a new play for visiting nobility. Someone using Crafting
might get a lucrative commission to craft a special item.
A character with Lore might have to research a difficult
problem that needs a quick response.
PCs who want to do things that don’t correspond to a
specific downtime activity should still experience downtime
events; you just choose the relevant skill and DC. For
example, if a character intends to build their own library
to house their books on magic, you might decide setting the
foundation and organizing the library once construction
is finished are major events. The first could be a Crafting
check, and the second an Arcana or Library Lore check.
Average Progress
For long periods of downtime, you might not want to
roll for every week, or even every month. Instead, set the
level for one task using the lowest level the character can
reliably find in the place where they spend their downtime
(see Difficulty Classes on page 503 for more on setting task
levels). If the character fails this check, you might allow
them to try again after a week (or a month, if you’re dealing
with years of downtime). Don’t allow them to roll again if
they succeeded but want to try for a critical success, unless
they do something in the story of the game that you think
makes it reasonable to allow a new roll.
The events you include during a long stretch of
downtime should typically feature higher-level tasks than
GAME MASTERING

================================================================================
PAGE 503
================================================================================

the baseline. For instance, a character Earning Income
with Sailing Lore for 4 months might work at a port
doing 1st-level tasks most of the time, but have 1 week
of 3rd-level tasks to account for busy periods. You’ll
normally have the player roll once for the time they spent
at 1st-level tasks and once for the week of 3rd-level tasks.
COST OF LIVING
For short periods of downtime, characters are usually just
passing through a settlement or spending a bit of time
there. They can use the prices for inn stays and meals
found on page 294. For long stretches of downtime, use
the values on Table 6–16: Cost of Living on the same
page. Deduct these costs from a character’s funds after
they gain any money from their other downtime activities.
A character can live off the land instead, but each day
they do, they typically use the Subsist activity (page 240) to
the exclusion of any other downtime activity.
BUYING AND SELLING
After an adventure yields a windfall, the characters might
have a number of items they want to sell. Likewise, when
they’re flush with currency, they might want to stock up
on gear. It usually takes 1 day of downtime to sell off a
few goods or shop around to buy a couple items. It can
take longer to sell off a large number of goods, expensive
items, or items that aren’t in high demand.
This assumes the characters are at a settlement of
decent size during their downtime. In some cases, they
might spend time traveling for days to reach bigger cities.
As always, you have final say over what sort of shops and
items are available.
An item can usually be purchased at its full Price and
sold for half its Price. Supply and demand adjusts these
numbers, but only occasionally.
LONG-TERM REST
Each full 24-hour period a character spends resting
during downtime allows them to recover double what
they would for an 8-hour rest (as listed on page 499).
They must spend this time resting in a comfortable and
secure location, typically in bed.
If they spend significantly longer in bed rest—usually
from a few days to a week of downtime—they recover
from all damage and most nonpermanent conditions.
Characters affected by diseases, long-lasting poisons,
or similar afflictions might need to continue attempting
saves during downtime. Some curses, permanent injuries,
and other situations that require magic or special care
to remove don’t end automatically during long-term rest.
RETRAINING
The retraining rules on page 481 allow a player to change
some character choices, but they rely on you to decide
whether the retraining requires a teacher, how long it
takes, if it has any associated costs, and if the ability can
be retrained at all. It’s reasonable for a character to retrain
most choices, and you should allow them. Only choices that
are truly intrinsic to the character, like a sorcerer’s bloodline,
should be off limits without extraordinary circumstances.
Try to make retraining into a story. Use NPCs the
character already knows as teachers, have a character
undertake intense research in a mysterious old library, or
ground the retraining in the game’s narrative by making
it the consequence of something that happened to the
character in a previous session.
Time
Retraining a feat or skill increase typically takes a
week. Class features that require a choice can also be
retrained but take longer: at least a month, and possibly
more. Retraining might take even longer if it would be
especially physically demanding or require travel, lengthy
experimentation, or in-depth research, but usually you
won’t want to require more than a month for a feat or
skill, or 4 months for a class feature.
A character might need to retrain several options at
once. For instance, retraining a skill increase might
mean they have skill feats they can no longer use, and
so they’ll need to retrain those as well. You can add all
this retraining time together, then reduce the total a bit to
represent the cohesive nature of the retraining.
Instruction and Costs
The rules abstract the process of learning new things as
you level up—you’re learning on the job—but retraining
suggests that the character works with a teacher or
undergoes specific practice to retrain. If you want, you
can entirely ignore this aspect of retraining, but it does
give an opportunity to introduce (or reintroduce) NPCs
and further the game’s story. You can even have one
player character mentor another, particularly when it
comes to retraining skills.
Any costs to retraining should be pretty minor—about
as much as a PC could gain by Earning Income over
the same period of time. The costs are mostly there to
make the training feel appropriate within the context
of the story, not to consume significant amounts of the
character’s earnings. A teacher might volunteer to work
without pay as a reward for something the character has
already done, or simply ask for a favor in return.
Disallowed Options
While some character options can’t normally be retrained,
you can invent ways for a character to retrain even these—
special rituals, incredible quests, or the perfect tutor. For
example, ability scores can’t normally be retrained, as that
can unbalance the game. But not all players necessarily
want to exploit the system—maybe a player simply
wants to swap an ability boost between two low stats. In
situations like this, you could let them spend a few months
working out or studying to reassign an ability boost.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 504
================================================================================

Simple DCs
Sometimes you need to quickly set a Difficulty Class. The
easiest method is to select a simple DC from Table 10–4
by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task
(that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task).
If it’s something pretty much anyone would have a decent
chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree
of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or
legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the
task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true
history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check
to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master
proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information,
so you’d set the DC at 30—the simple master DC.
Simple DCs work well when you need a DC on the fly
and there’s no level associated with the task. They’re most
useful for skill checks. Because there isn’t much gradation
between the simple DCs, they don’t work as well for
hazards or combatants, where the PCs’ lives are on the line;
you’re better off using level-based DCs for such challenges.
TABLE 10–4: SIMPLE DCS

Proficiency Rank

Level-Based DCs
When you’re determining a skill DC based on something
that has a level, use Table 10–5 to set the DC. Find the
level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since
spells use a 1–10 scale, use the Spell Level column for them.
Use these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or
Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn
Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so
on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles
instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you
might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was
constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You
could simply say only someone with master proficiency
could climb it, and use the simple DC of 30. Or you
might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the
dungeon crafted the wall, and use the 15th-level DC of
34. Either approach is reasonable!
Note that PCs who invest in a skill become more likely
to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase in level,
and the listed DCs eventually become very easy for them.

* If a spell is uncommon or rare, its difficulty should be

Adjusting Difficulty
You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline,
whether to account for PCs’ areas of expertise or to
represent the rarity of spells or items. A DC adjustment
represents an essential difference in the difficulty of a task
and applies to anyone attempting a specific check for it.
Adjustments happen most often with tasks whose DCs
are based on their level. Adjustments use a scale of –10
to +10, from incredibly easy checks to incredibly hard
Difficulty Classes
As the Game Master, it’s up to you to set the difficulty classes (DCs) for checks that don’t
use a predefined DC. The following sections offer advice on how to set appropriate DCs
and tweak them as needed to feel natural for your story. Picking a simple DC and using a
level-based DC each work well in certain circumstances, and you can adjust both types of
DC using the advice on adjusting difficulty.
GAME MASTERING

ones, and are broken into increments of 2, 5, and 10.
You’ll often apply the adjustments for uncommon, rare,
or unique subjects.

The adjustments’ names don’t translate to how hard a
task actually is for a PC or group of PCs, and adjustments
aren’t meant to balance out or replace PCs’ bonuses and
penalties. PCs who invest in a skill will become better and
better at that skill as they increase in level. For example, even
the best 1st-level PC has grim odds against an incredibly
hard 1st-level DC, with a huge chance of critical failure, but
by 20th level, an optimized character with a modicum of
magic or assistance can take down incredibly hard 20thlevel DCs over half the time, critically failing only on a 1. At
higher levels, many groups will find that the very hard DC is
more like standard for them; keep that in mind if you need
a check that presents a true challenge to a high level group.
You might use different DCs for a task based on the
particular skill or statistic used for the check. Let’s say
your PCs encounter a magical tome about aberrant
creatures. The tome is 4th-level and has the occult trait,
so you set the DC of an Occultism check to Identify the
Magic to 19, based on Table 10–5. As noted in Identify
Magic, other magic-related skills can typically be used at
a higher DC, so you might decide the check is very hard
for a character using Arcana and set the DC at 24 for
characters using that skill. If a character in your group
had Aberration Lore, you might determine that it would
be easy or very easy to use that skill and adjust the DC
to 17 or 14. These adjustments aren’t taking the place of
characters’ bonuses, modifiers, and penalties—they are
due to the applicability of the skills being used.
GROUP ATTEMPTS
The DCs in this chapter give an individual character a
strong and increasing chance of success if they have some
proficiency. On occasion, though, you’ll have a task that
only one person in the group needs to succeed at, but that
everyone can attempt. The number of dice being rolled
means that there’s a very high chance at least one of them
will succeed. Most of the time, that’s perfectly fine, but
sometimes you’ll want the task to be a challenge, with
some uncertainty as to whether the party can succeed. In
these cases, make the check very hard, or incredibly hard
if you want it to be particularly difficult or at high levels.
At these DCs, most of the party will probably fail, but
someone will probably still succeed, likely a character who
has heavily invested in the given skill, as is expected for
specialized characters.
Minimum Proficiency
Sometimes succeeding at a particular task requires a
character to have a specific proficiency rank in addition
to a success on the check. Locks and traps often require a
certain proficiency rank to successfully use the Pick a Lock
or Disable a Device actions of Thievery. A character whose
proficiency rank is lower than what’s listed can attempt
the check, but they can’t succeed. You can apply similar
minimum proficiencies to other tasks. You might decide,
for example, that a particular arcane theorem requires
training in Arcana to understand. An untrained barbarian
can’t succeed at the check, but she can still attempt it if she
wants—after all, she needs to have a chance to critically
fail and get erroneous information!
For checks that require a minimum proficiency, keep
the following guidelines in mind. A 2nd-level or lower
task should almost never require expert proficiency,
a 6th-level or lower task should almost never require
master proficiency, and a 14th-level or lower task should
almost never require legendary proficiency. If they did, no
character of the appropriate level could succeed.
Specific Actions
Several parts of this book, most notably Chapter 4: Skills,
state that you as the GM set the DCs for certain checks or
determine other parameters. Here are guidelines for the most
common tasks. Remember that all of these are guidelines,
and you can adjust them as necessary to suit the situation.
CRAFT
When a character Crafts an item, use the item’s level
to determine the DC, applying the adjustments from
Table 10–6 for the item’s rarity if it’s not common. You
might also apply the easy DC adjustment for an item the
crafter has made before. Repairing an item usually uses the
DC of the item’s level with no adjustments, though you
might adjust the DC to be more difficult for an item of a
higher level than the character can Craft.
EARN INCOME
You set the task level when someone tries to Earn Income.
The highest-level task available is usually the same as the
level of the settlement where the character is located. If
you don’t know the settlement’s level, it’s usually 0–1 for a
village, 2–4 for a town, or 5–7 for a city. A PC might need
to travel to a metropolis or capital to find tasks of levels
8-10, and to the largest cities in the world or another plane
to routinely find tasks beyond that. Some locations might
have higher-level tasks available based on the nature of
the settlement. A major port might have higher-level tasks
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 506
================================================================================

for Sailing Lore, a city with a vibrant arts scene might
have higher-level tasks for Performance, and so on. If
someone is trying to use a particularly obscure skill, they
might have trouble finding tasks of an ideal level, or any
at all—no one in most settlements is clamoring for the
expertise of someone with Troll Lore.
Once the PC has decided on a particular level of task
from those available, use the DC for that level from
Table 10–5. You might adjust the DC to be more difficult
if there’s inclement weather during an outdoor job, a
rowdy audience for a performance, or the like.
GATHER INFORMATION
To set the DC to Gather Information, use a simple DC
representing the availability of information about the
subject. Adjust the DC upward if the PC Gathering
Information seeks in-depth information. For example,
if a character wants to Gather Information about a
visiting caravan, you might decide that a common person
wouldn’t know much about it, but any merchant or guard
would, so learning basic facts uses the simple DC for
trained proficiency. A caravan leader’s name is superficial,
so discovering it might be DC 15 (the simple trained
DC in Table 10–4). Learning the identity of the leader’s
employers, however, might be DC 20 if the employers are
more obscure.
IDENTIFY MAGIC OR LEARN A SPELL
The DC to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell is usually
the DC listed in Table 10–5 for the spell or item’s level,
adjusted for its rarity. A very strange item or phenomenon
usually uses a higher DC adjustment. For a cursed item
or certain illusory items, use an incredibly hard DC to
increase the chance of misidentification.
RECALL KNOWLEDGE
On most topics, you can use simple DCs for checks to Recall
Knowledge. For a check about a specific creature, trap, or
other subject with a level, use a level-based DC (adjusting
for rarity as needed). You might adjust the difficulty down,
maybe even drastically, if the subject is especially notorious
or famed. Knowing simple tales about an infamous
dragon’s exploits, for example, might be incredibly easy for
the dragon’s level, or even just a simple trained DC.
Alternative Skills
As noted in the action’s description, a character might
attempt to Recall Knowledge using a different skill than
the ones listed as the default options. If the skill is highly
applicable, like using Medicine to identify a medicinal
tonic, you probably don’t need to adjust the DC. If its
relevance is a stretch, adjust the DC upward as described
in Adjusting Difficulty.

================================================================================
PAGE 507
================================================================================

Additional Knowledge
Sometimes a character might want to follow up on a check
to Recall Knowledge, rolling another check to discover
more information. After a success, further uses of Recall
Knowledge can yield more information, but you should
adjust the difficulty to be higher for each attempt. Once a
character has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed
a check, further attempts are fruitless—the character has
recalled everything they know about the subject.
Creature Identification
A character who successfully identifies a creature learns
one of its best-known attributes—such as a troll’s
regeneration (and the fact that it can be stopped by acid
or fire) or a manticore’s tail spikes. On a critical success,
the character also learns something subtler, like a demon’s
weakness or the trigger for one of the creature’s reactions.
The skill used to identify a creature usually depends
on that creature’s trait, as shown on Table 10–7, but you
have leeway on which skills apply. For instance, hags are
humanoids but have a strong connection to occult spells
and live outside society, so you might allow a character to
use Occultism to identify them without any DC adjustment,
while Society is harder. Lore skills can also be used to identify
their specific creature. Using the applicable Lore usually has
an easy or very easy DC (before adjusting for rarity).
SENSE DIRECTION
Pick the most appropriate simple DC when someone uses
Survival to Sense Direction. This is usually the trained DC
in normal wilderness, expert in deep forest or underground,
master in featureless or tricky locations, or legendary in
weird or surreal environments on other planes.
SOCIAL SKILLS
When
a
character
uses
Deception,
Diplomacy,
Intimidation, or Performance to influence or impress
someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, estimate
the level of the creature and use that DC. A commoner is
usually level 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It
often makes sense to adjust the DC based on the target’s
attitude for Deception, Diplomacy, or Performance,
making the DC easy for a friendly creature, very easy for
a helpful one, hard for an unfriendly one, or very hard
for a hostile one. You might adjust the DC further or
differently based on the PC’s goal; for instance, the DC to
Request something an indifferent NPC is fundamentally
opposed to might be incredibly hard or impossible, and
it might be easy to convince an unfriendly creature to do
something it already wants to do.
SUBSIST
A simple DC is usually sufficient for the Subsist action, with
a trained DC for a typical situation. Use the disposition of
the environment or city as a guide; an environment with
scarce resources or a city with little tolerance for transience
might require an expert or higher DC.
TRACK
Often when a PC uses Survival to Track, you can pick a
simple DC and adjust it based on the circumstances. For
example, an army is usually easy to track, so you could use
the untrained DC of 10. If the army marched through mud,
you could even adjust this down to DC 5. On the other
hand, if the party pursues a cunning survivalist using Cover
Tracks, you might use their Survival DC as the DC to Track.
TRAIN AN ANIMAL
Train Animal (page 268) allows PCs to teach animals
tricks. Use the level of the animal as the baseline; you can
adjust the DC up if the trick is especially difficult, or down
if the animal is especially domesticated, like a dog.
DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF LORE
Lore skills are one of the most specialized aspects of
Pathfinder, but they require GM oversight, particularly
in determining which Lore subcategories are acceptable
for characters to select. A Lore subcategory represents
a narrow focus, and thus it shouldn’t replace all or even
most of an entire skill, nor should it convey vast swaths
of information. For example, a single Lore subcategory
doesn’t cover all religions—that’s covered by the Religion
skill—but a character could have a Lore subcategory that
covers a single deity. One Lore subcategory won’t cover an
entire country or all of history, but it could cover a city, an
ancient civilization, or one aspect of a modern country, like
Taldan History Lore. A single Lore subcategory couldn’t
cover the entire multiverse, but it could cover a whole
plane other than the Material Plane.

Hero Points
Unlike Experience Points and treasure, which stay with a
character, Hero Points are granted and used on a per‑session
basis. At the start of a game session, you give out 1 Hero
Point to each player character. You can also give out more
Hero Points during the game, typically after a heroic
moment or accomplishment (see below). As noted on page
467, a player can spend 1 Hero Point for a reroll, or they
can spend all their Hero Points to recover when near death.
In a typical game, you’ll hand out about 1 Hero Point
during each hour of play after the first (for example, 3
extra points in a 4-hour session). If you want a more overthe-top game, or if your group is up against incredible
odds and showing immense bravery, you might give them
out at a faster rate, like 1 every 30 minutes (6 over a
4-hour session). Try to ensure each PC has opportunities
to earn Hero Points, and avoid granting all of the Hero
Points to a single character.
Brave last stands, protecting innocents, and using a
smart strategy or spell to save the day could all earn a
character a Hero Point. Look for those moments when
everybody at the table celebrates or sits back in awe of a
character’s accomplishments; that’s your cue to issue that
character a Hero Point.
The party could also gain Hero Points for their
accomplishments throughout the game. For a moderate
or major accomplishment, consider giving out a Hero
Point as well. This point typically goes to a PC who was
instrumental in attaining that accomplishment.
Experience Points
As characters adventure, they earn Experience Points (XP).
These awards come from achieving goals, completing
social encounters, exploring new places, fighting monsters,
overcoming hazards, and other sorts of deeds. You have
a great deal of control over when the characters gain XP,
though the following guidelines are what you’re expected
to give out in a standard campaign.
Normally, when a player character reaches 1,000 XP
or more, they level up, reduce their XP by 1,000, and
start progressing toward the next level. Other means of
advancement are described in the Advancement Speeds
sidebar on page 509.
XP AWARDS
Experience Points are awarded for encounters, exploration,
and progress in an adventure. When the PCs face direct
opposition, such as a fight or a social conflict, the XP
earned is based on the level of the challenge the party
overcame. Characters can also gain XP from exploration,
such as finding secret areas, locating a hideout, enduring
a dangerous environment, or mapping an entire dungeon.
Any XP awarded goes to all members of the group. For
instance, if the party wins a battle worth 100 XP, they
each get 100 XP, even if the party’s rogue was off in a
vault stealing treasure during the battle. But if the rogue
collected a splendid and famous gemstone, which you’ve
decided was a moderate accomplishment worth 30 XP,
each member of the party gets 30 XP, too.
Adversaries and Hazards
Encounters with adversaries and hazards grant a set
amount of XP. When the group overcomes an encounter
with creatures or hazards, each character gains XP equal to
the total XP of the creatures and hazards in the encounter
(this excludes XP adjustments for different party sizes; see
Party Size on page 508 for details).
Trivial encounters don’t normally grant any XP, but
you might decide to award the same XP as for a minor or
moderate accomplishment for a trivial encounter that was
important to the story, or for an encounter that became
trivial because of the order in which the PCs encountered
it in a nonlinear adventure.
Accomplishments
Characters’ actions that move the story forward—like
securing a major alliance, establishing an organization,
or causing an NPC to have a change of heart—are
considered accomplishments and should be rewarded
with XP. Their significance determines the size of the
XP award. Determine whether the achievement was a
minor, moderate, or major accomplishment, and refer
to Table 10–8: XP Awards on page 508 to award an
appropriate amount of XP. Minor accomplishments
include all sorts of significant, memorable, or surprising
moments in the game. A moderate accomplishment
typically represents a goal that takes most of a session
to complete, and a major accomplishment is usually
the culmination of the characters’ efforts across many
sessions. Moderate and major accomplishments usually
come after heroic effort, so that’s an ideal time to also give
a Hero Point to one or more of the characters involved.
As mentioned earlier, it’s up to you how much XP to
give out for accomplishments. As a general guideline, in
a given game session, you’ll typically give several minor
awards, one or two moderate awards, and only one
major award, if any.
Rewards
In Pathfinder, player characters can receive three kinds of rewards for their heroic deeds:
Hero Points, which they can use to get out of sticky situations; Experience Points, which
they’ll use to level up; and treasure, including powerful magic items.

PARTY SIZE
The rules for advancement assume a group of four PCs.
The rules for encounters (page 489) describe how to
accommodate groups of a different size, but the XP awards
don’t change—always award the amount of XP listed for a
group of four characters. You usually won’t need to make
many adjustments for a differently sized group outside of
encounters. Be careful of providing too many ways to get
accomplishment XP when you have a large group, though,
since they can pursue multiple accomplishments at once,
which can lead to the PCs leveling up too fast.
GROUP PARITY AND PARTY LEVEL
It’s recommended that you keep all the player characters
at the same XP total. This makes it much easier to know
what challenges are suitable for your players. Having
characters at different levels can mean weaker characters
die more easily and their players feel less effective, which
in turn makes the game less fun for those players.
If you choose not to keep the whole group at the same
character level, you’ll need to select a party level to determine
your XP budget for encounters. Choose the level you think
best represents the party’s ability as a whole. Use the highest
level if only one or two characters are behind, or an average
if everyone is at a different level. If only one character is
two or more levels ahead, use a party level suitable for the
lower-level characters, and adjust the encounters as if there
were one additional PC for every 2 levels the higher-level
character has beyond the rest of the party.
Party members who are behind the party level gain
double the XP other characters do until they reach the
party’s level. When tracking individually, you’ll need to
decide whether party members get XP for missed sessions.
Treasure
As the GM, it’s your job to distribute treasure to the player
characters. Treasure appears throughout an adventure,
and the PCs obtain it by raiding treasure hoards, defeating
foes who carry valuable items or currency, getting paid
for successful quests, and any other way you can imagine.
This section provides guidelines for distributing treasure
in a typical Pathfinder campaign, but you always have
the freedom to assign extra treasure for a high‑powered
game, less treasure for a gritty survival horror adventure,
or any amount in between.
TREASURE BY LEVEL
Table 10–9: Party Treasure by Level on the next page shows
how much treasure you should give out over the course of a
level for a group of four PCs. The Total Value column gives
an approximate total value of all the treasure, in case you
want to spend it like a budget. The next several columns
provide suggestions for breaking down that total into
permanent items, which the PCs keep and use for a long
time; consumables, which are destroyed after being used
once; and currency, which includes coins, gems, and other
valuables primarily spent to acquire items or services. The
final column gives the amount of currency to add for each
PC beyond four in the group; use this only if you have more
than four characters in the game. (Different Party Sizes on
page 510 provides more guidance on this.)
For instance, between the time your PCs reach 3rd
level and the time they reach 4th level, you should give
them the treasure listed in the table for 3rd level, worth
approximately 500 gp: two 4th-level permanent items, two
3rd-level permanent items, two 4th-level consumables, two
3rd-level consumables, two 2nd-level consumables, and
120 gp worth of currency.
When assigning 1st-level permanent items, your best
options are armor, weapons, and other gear from Chapter 6
worth between 10 and 20 gp. The treasure listed in the row
for 20th level represents a full level’s worth of adventures,
even though there is no way to reach 21st level.
Some creature entries in the Pathfinder Bestiary list
treasure that can be gained by defeating an individual
creature; this counts toward the treasure for any given level.
Published adventures include a suitable amount of treasure
throughout the adventure, though you should still monitor
the party’s capabilities as the PCs progress through the
adventure to make sure they don’t end up behind.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 510
================================================================================

ADVANCEMENT SPEEDS
By varying the amount of XP it takes to gain a level, you
can change how quickly characters gain power. The game
rules assume a group playing with standard advancement.
Fast advancement works best when you know you won’t
be playing a very long campaign and want to accomplish
as much as possible quickly; slow advancement works
best for a gritty campaign where all progress is hard won.
You can alter XP from one adventure to the next to get
a different feel. During a street-level murder mystery and
travel through a haunted wilderness, you might use slow
advancement. When the PCs reach the dungeon, you might
switch to standard or fast advancement. The values below
are just examples. You can use values even higher or lower.

Advancement Speed
XP to Level Up

Fast
800 XP

Standard
1,000 XP

Slow
1,200 XP
Story-Based Leveling
If you don’t want to deal with managing and handing out
XP, or if you want to have progression based solely on
events in the story, you can ignore the XP process entirely
and instead simply decide when the characters level up.
Generally, the characters should gain a level every three
to four game sessions, just after the most appropriate big
event that happens during that time, such as defeating a
significant villain or achieving a major goal.
Currency
A party will find money and other treasure that isn’t
useful on its own but that can be sold or spent on other
things. The gp values in the Party Currency column don’t
refer only to coins. Gems, art objects, crafting materials
(including precious materials), jewelry, and even items of
much lower level than the party’s level can all be more
interesting than a pile of gold.
If you include a lower-level permanent item as part of a
currency reward, count only half the item’s Price toward
the gp amount, assuming the party will sell the item or use
it as crafting material. But lower-level consumables might
still be useful, particularly scrolls, and if you think your
party will use them, count those items at their full Price.
Other Types of Treasure
Not all treasure has to be items or currency. Crafters can
use the Crafting skill to turn raw materials directly into
items instead of buying those items with coins. Knowledge
can expand a character’s abilities, and formulas make good
treasure for item-crafting characters. A spellcaster might
get access to new spells from an enemy’s spellbook or an
ancient scholar, while a monk might retrain techniques with
rarer ones learned from a master on a remote mountaintop.
Treasure and Rarity
Giving out uncommon and rare items and formulas
can get players more interested in treasure. It’s best to
introduce uncommon items as a reward fairly regularly
but rare items only occasionally. These rewards are

================================================================================

especially compelling when the adventurers get the item
by defeating or outsmarting an enemy who carries an
item that fits their backstory or theme.
Uncommon and rare formulas make great treasure for a
character who Crafts items. Note that if an uncommon or
rare formula is broadly disseminated, it eventually becomes
more common. This can take months or years, but the item
might start showing up in shops all around the world.
Different Item Levels
The levels listed for items on Table 10–9: Party Treasure by
Level aren’t set in stone. You can provide items of slightly
higher or lower level as long as you take into account the
value of the items you hand out. For instance, suppose
you were considering giving a party of 11th-level PCs a
runestone with a fortification rune (with a Price of 2,000 gp)
as one of their 12th-level items, but you realize they’ve had
trouble finding armor in their recent adventures, so you
instead decide to give them a suit of 11th-level +2 resilient
armor (1,400 gp) instead. Since the armor has a lower
Price than the rune, you might also add a 9th-level shadow
rune (650 gp) to make up the difference. The total isn’t
exactly the same, but that’s all right.
However, if you wanted to place a 13th-level permanent
item in a treasure hoard, you could remove two 11thlevel permanent items to make a roughly equivalent
exchange. When you make an exchange upward like this,
be cautious: not only might you introduce an item with
effects that are disruptive at the party’s current level of
play, but you also might give an amazing item to one PC
while other characters don’t gain any new items at all!
If you’re playing in a long-term campaign, you can
spread out the treasure over time. A major milestone can
give extra treasure at one level, followed by a tougher
dungeon with fewer new items at the next level. Check
back occasionally to see whether each PC’s treasure is
comparable to the amount they’d get if they created a
new character at their current level, as described under
Treasure for New Characters below. They should be a bit
higher. but if there’s a significant discrepancy, adjust the
adventure’s upcoming treasure rewards accordingly.
Different Party Sizes
If a party has more than four characters, add the following
for each additional character:
• One permanent item of the party’s level or 1
level higher
• Two consumables, usually one of the party’s level
and one of 1 level higher
• Currency equal to the value in the Currency per
Additional PC column of Table 10–9
If the party has fewer than four characters, you can
subtract the same amount for each missing character,
but since the game is inherently more challenging with a
smaller group that can’t cover all roles as efficiently, you
might consider subtracting less treasure and allowing the
extra gear help compensate for the smaller group size.
TREASURE FOR NEW CHARACTERS
When your new campaign starts at a higher level, a
new player joins an existing group, or a current player’s
character dies and they need a new one, your campaign
will have one or more PCs who don’t start at 1st level. In
these cases, refer to Table 10–10: Character Wealth on the
next page, which shows how many common permanent
items of various levels the PC should have, in addition to
currency. A single item on this table is always a baseline
item. If the player wants armor or a weapon with property
runes, they must buy the property runes separately, and for
armor or a weapon made of a precious material, they must
pay for the precious material separately as well.
These values are for a PC just starting out at the given
level. If the PC is joining a party that has already made
progress toward the next level, consider giving the new
ADJUSTING TREASURE
The treasure you award to the party should be monitored
and adjusted as you play. You might need to give out
treasure you hadn’t originally planned for, especially
if the group bypasses part of an adventure. Keep an
eye on the party’s resources. If they’re running out of
consumables or money, or if they’re having trouble in
combat because their items aren’t up to the task, you can
make adjustments.
This is especially common in adventures that have little
downtime or that take place far from civilization. If the
group goes a long time without being able to purchase or
Craft useful items, the PCs will be flush with coins and
valuables but behind on useful equipment. In a situation
like this, you can either place more useful treasure in the
adventure or introduce NPCs who are willing to trade.
Megadungeons and Sandboxes
Some adventures have an expectation that the player
characters explore where they want and find only what
their skill, luck, and ingenuity afford. Two common
examples of this type of adventure are the sprawling
dungeon with multiple different sections and paths, often
called a megadungeon, and free-form exploration, often
called a sandbox and typically occurring in a wilderness.
If you want to build a free-form adventure like this
where characters are likely to miss at least some of the
treasure, increase the amount of treasure you place. Be
aware, however, that a meticulous group can end up with
more treasure than normal and will have advantages in
later adventures.
For a simple guideline to these situations, increase the
treasure as though there were one more PC in the party.
If the structure is especially loose, especially in sandbox
adventures, you can increase this amount even further.

character an additional item of their current level. If your
party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and
passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the
new character less than the values on the table or reduce
some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures.
Item Selection
You should work with the new character’s player to decide
which items their character has. Allow the player to make
suggestions, and if they know what items they want their
character to have, respect their choices unless you believe
those choices will have a negative impact on your game.
At your discretion, you can grant the player character
uncommon or rare items that fit their backstory and
concept, keeping in mind how many items of those rarities
you have introduced into your game. The player can also
spend currency on consumables or lower-level permanent
items, keeping the rest as coinage. As usual, you determine
which items the character can find for purchase.
A PC can voluntarily choose an item that has a lower
level than any or all of the listed items, but they don’t gain
any more currency by doing so.
If you choose, you can allow the player to instead start
with a lump sum of currency and buy whatever common
items they want, with a maximum item level of 1 lower
than the character’s level. This has a lower total value than
the normal allotment of permanent items and currency,
since the player can select a higher ratio of high-level items.

Buying and Selling Items
Characters can usually buy and sell items only during
downtime. An item can typically be sold for only half its
Price, though art objects, gems, and raw materials can be
sold for their full Price (page 271).

================================================================================

Each of the environments presented in this section uses
the terrain rules (which are summarized on page 514
and appear in full beginning on page 475) in different
ways, so be sure to familiarize yourself with those rules
before reading this section. Some environments refer to
the rules for climate (page 517) and natural disasters
(beginning on page 517). Many places have the traits of
multiple environments; a snow-covered mountain might
use both the arctic and mountain environments, for
example. For environmental features with effects based
on how tall or deep they are, those effects vary further
based on a creature’s size. For instance, a shallow bog
for a Medium creature might be a deep bog for smaller
creatures, and a deep bog for a Medium creature could
be only a shallow bog for a larger creature (and so
insignificant for a truly massive creature that it isn’t
even difficult terrain).
Table 10–12 lists the features of various environments
alphabetically for quick reference. The Proficiency DC
Band entry indicates a range of appropriate simple DCs
for that environmental feature, while also providing a
rough estimate of the danger or complexity of the feature.
Environmental Damage
Some environmental features or natural disasters deal
damage. Because the amount of damage can vary based
on the specific circumstances, the rules for specific
environments and natural disasters use damage categories
to describe the damage, rather than exact numbers.
Use Table 10–11 below to determine damage from an
environment or natural disaster. When deciding the exact
damage amount, use your best judgment based on how
extreme you deem the danger to be.

Aquatic
Aquatic environments are among the most challenging
for PCs short of other worlds and unusual planes. PCs in
an aquatic environment need a way to breathe (typically
a water breathing spell) and must usually Swim to

Primarily used during exploration, environment rules bring the locales your party
travels through to life. You’ll often be able to use common sense to adjudicate how
environments work, but you’ll need special rules for environments that really stand out.
move, though a PC who sinks to the bottom can walk
awkwardly, using the rules for greater difficult terrain.
Characters in aquatic environments make frequent use
of the aquatic combat (page 478) and drowning and
suffocation rules (page 478).
Currents and Flowing Water
Ocean currents, flowing rivers, and similar moving water
are difficult terrain or greater difficult terrain (depending
on the speed of the water) for a creature Swimming against
the current. At the end of a creature’s turn, it moves a
certain distance depending on the current’s speed. For
instance, a 10-foot current moves a creature 10 feet in
the current’s direction at the end of that creature’s turn.
Visibility
It’s much harder to see things at a distance underwater
than it is on land, and it’s particularly difficult if the water
is murky or full of particles. In pure water, the maximum
visual range is roughly 240 feet to see a small object, and
in murky water, visibility can be reduced to only 10 feet
or even less.
Arctic
The main challenge in an arctic environment is the low
temperature, but arctic environments also contain ice
and snow. The disasters that most often strike in arctic
environments are avalanches, blizzards, and floods.
Ice
Icy ground is both uneven ground and difficult terrain, as
characters slip and slide due to poor traction.
Snow
Depending on the depth of snow and its composition,
most snowy ground is either difficult terrain or greater
difficult terrain. In denser snow, characters can attempt
to walk along the surface without breaking through, but
some patches might be loose or soft enough that they’re
uneven ground.
Desert
Desert encompasses sandy and rocky deserts as well
as badlands. Though tundra is technically a desert, it’s
classified as arctic, as the climate is the primary challenge
in such areas. Sandy deserts often have quicksand hazards
(page 526) and sandstorms.

Rubble
Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is difficult
terrain. Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather
than navigated through is uneven ground.
Sand
Packed sand doesn’t usually significantly impede a
character’s movement, but loose sand is either difficult
terrain (if it’s shallow) or uneven ground (if it’s deep).
The wind in a desert often shifts sand into dunes, hills
of loose sand with uneven ground facing the wind and
steeper inclines away from the wind.
Forest
These diverse environments include jungles and other
wooded areas. They are sometimes struck by wildfires.
Canopies
Particularly dense forests, such as rain forests, have a
canopy level above the ground. A creature trying to reach
the canopy or travel along it must Climb. Swinging on
vines and branches usually requires an Acrobatics or
Athletics check. A canopy provides cover, and a thicker
one can prevent creatures in the canopy from seeing those
on the ground, and vice versa.
Trees
While trees are omnipresent in a forest, they typically
don’t provide cover unless a character uses the Take
Cover action. Only larger trees that take up an entire
5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to
provide cover automatically.
Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a
character to Take Cover. Heavy undergrowth is greater
difficult terrain that automatically provides cover. Some
sorts of undergrowth, such as thorns, might also be
hazardous terrain, and areas with plenty of twisting roots
might be uneven ground.
Mountain
Mountain environments also include hills, which share
many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme
features. The most common disasters here are avalanches.
Chasms
Chasms are natural pits, typically at least 20 feet long
and clearly visible (barring mundane or magical efforts to
conceal them). The main danger posed by a chasm is that
characters must Long Jump to get across. Alternatively,
characters can take the safer but slower route of Climbing
down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the
far side to get across.
Cliffs
Cliffs and rock walls require creatures to Climb to
ascend or descend. Without extensive safety precautions,
a critical failure can result in significant falling damage.
Rubble
Mountains often have extremely rocky areas or shifting,
gravelly scree that makes for difficult terrain. Especially
deep or pervasive rubble is uneven ground.
GAME MASTERING

================================================================================
PAGE 515
================================================================================

Slopes
Slopes vary from the gentle rises of normal terrain
to difficult terrain and inclines, depending on the
angle of elevation. Moving down a slope is typically
normal terrain, but characters might need to Climb up
particularly steep slopes.
Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is common in mountains. It is difficult
terrain and allows a character to Take Cover.
Plains
The plains environment encompasses grasslands such as
savannas and farmland. The most common disasters in
plains are tornadoes and wildfires.
Hedges
Hedges are planted rows of bushes, shrubs, and trees.
Their iconic appearance in adventures consists of tall
hedges grown into mazes. A typical hedge is 2 to 5 feet
tall, takes up a row of squares, and provides cover. A
character trying to push through a hedge faces greater
difficult terrain; it’s sometimes faster to Climb over.
Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a
character to Take Cover. Heavy undergrowth is greater
difficult terrain that provides cover automatically.
Undergrowth in plains is usually light with a few scattered
areas of heavy undergrowth, but fields of certain crops,
like corn, are entirely heavy undergrowth.
Swamp
Wetlands are the most common kind of swamp, but
this category also includes drier marshes such as moors.
Swamps often contain quicksand hazards (page 526).
Despite their soggy nature, swamps aren’t very likely
to experience heavy flooding, since they act as natural
sponges and absorb a great deal of water before
they flood.
Bogs
Also called mires, bogs are watery areas that accumulate
peat, are covered by shrubs and moss, and sometimes
feature floating islands of vegetation covering deeper pools.
Shallow bogs are difficult terrain for a Medium creature,
and deep bogs are greater difficult terrain. If a bog is deep
enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the creature
has to Swim. Bogs are also acidic, so particularly extreme
or magical bogs can be hazardous terrain.
Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is difficult terrain that allows a
character to Take Cover, while heavy undergrowth is
greater difficult terrain that provides cover automatically.
Some sorts of undergrowth, such as thorns, are also
hazardous terrain, and areas with plenty of twisting roots
are uneven ground.
Urban
Urban environments include open city spaces as well as
buildings. The building information in this section also
applies to ruins and constructed dungeons. Depending on
their construction and location, cities might be vulnerable
to many sorts of disasters, especially fires and floods.
Crowds
Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are difficult
terrain, or greater difficult terrain if an area is truly packed
with people. You might allow a character to get a crowd to
part using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance.
A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or
a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the
danger as quickly as possible, but it is slowed by its own
mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at the Speed of an
average member each round (usually 25 feet), potentially
trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of
the crowd.
TERRAIN RULES
Environments make frequent use of the rules for difficult
terrain, greater difficult terrain, and hazardous terrain, so
those rules are summarized here.
Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes movement,
ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to
thick ground cover and countless other impediments.
Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5
feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you’re
not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement.
Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead
costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional
cost is not increased when moving diagonally. Creatures
can’t normally Step into difficult terrain.
Any movement creatures make while jumping
ignores terrain that the creature is jumping over.
Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal)
allow creatures to avoid the movement reduction from
some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities
let creatures ignore difficult terrain while traveling on
foot; such an ability also allows a creature to move
through greater difficult terrain using the movement
cost for difficult terrain, but unless the ability
specifies otherwise, these abilities don’t let creatures
ignore greater difficult terrain.
Hazardous terrain damages creatures whenever
they move through it. For instance, an acid pool, a pit
of burning embers, and a spike-filled passageway all
constitute hazardous terrain. The amount and type of
damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 516
================================================================================

Doors
Opening an unlocked door requires an Interact action
(or more than one for a particularly complicated or large
door). Stuck doors must be Forced Open, and locked ones
require a character to Pick the Lock or Force them Open.
Floors
Wooden floors are easy to walk on, as are flagstone floors
made of fitted stones. However, floors of worn flagstone
often contain areas of uneven ground.
Gates
Walled settlements often have gates that the city can close
for defense or open to allow travel. A typical gate consists
of one portcullis at each end of a gatehouse, with murder
holes in between or other protected spots from which
guards can attack foes.
Guards
Most settlements of significant size have guards working
in shifts to protect the settlement at all hours, patrolling
the streets and guarding various posts. The size of this
force varies from one guard for every 1,000 residents to a
force 10 times this number.
Portcullises
A portcullis is a wooden or iron grate that descends
to seal off a gate or corridor. Most are raised on ropes
or chains operated by a winch, and they have locking
mechanisms that keep them from being lifted easily. The
rules on lifting a portcullis or bending its bars appear in
the sidebar on this page. If a portcullis falls on a creature,
use a slamming door trap (page 523).
Rooftops
Rooftops make for memorable ambushes, chase scenes,
infiltrations, and running fights. Flat roofs are easy
to move across, but they’re rare in any settlement that
receives significant snowfall, since heavy buildups of snow
can collapse a roof. Angled roofs are uneven ground, or
inclines if they’re especially steep. The peak of an angled
roof is a narrow surface.
Hurdling from roof to roof often requires a Long Jump,
though some buildings are close enough to Leap between.
A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof, or
a Leap followed by Grabbing an Edge and Climbing up.
Sewers
Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level
and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend
and descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer
workers access, while channels in the center carry the waste
itself. Less sophisticated sewers, or sections those workers
don’t usually access, might require wading through diseaseridden waste. Sewers can be accessed through sewer grates,
which usually require 2 or more Interact actions to open.
DOORS, GATES, AND WALLS
Some of the most common obstacles that characters
face in urban areas and dungeons are doors, gates,
and walls.
Climbing
The table below gives the typical DC for Athletics checks
to Climb a structure, which is usually a simple DC. You
might adjust the difficulty based on the specifics of the
structure and environment.
Demolishing
A character might want to smash their way through
a door, a window, or certain walls. The Hardness, Hit
Point, and Broken Threshold values provided in the table
below are based on the material the structure is typically
made out of, so a portcullis made of iron, for example,
has a higher Hardness than one of wood. For more on
damaging objects, see page 272.
Strong walls, such as well-maintained masonry
or hewn stone, can’t be broken without dedicated
work and proper tools. Getting through such walls
requires downtime.

Structures that can be opened—such as doors, gates, and

usually necessary only if they’re locked or stuck. The DC
to Force Open a structure uses the Thievery DC of its lock
but adjusts it to be very hard (increasing the DC by 5).
If there’s no lock, use the following table; when lifting
a portcullis, use the lock DC or the DC from the table,
whichever is higher.

================================================================================

Sewer Gas
Sewer gas often contains pockets of highly flammable
gas. A pocket of sewer gas exposed to a source of flame
explodes, dealing moderate environmental fire damage to
creatures in the area.
Stairs
Stairs are difficult terrain for characters moving up them,
and shoddy stairs might also be uneven ground. Some
temples and giant-built structures have enormous stairs
that are greater difficult terrain both up and down, or
might require Climbing every step.
Streets
Most settlements have narrow and twisting streets that
were largely established organically as the settlement
grew. These roads are rarely more than 20 feet wide, with
alleys as narrow as 5 feet. Streets are generally paved with
cobblestones. If the cobblestones are in poor repair, they
could be difficult terrain or uneven ground.
Particularly lawful or well-planned cities have major
thoroughfares that allow wagons and merchants to reach
marketplaces and other important areas in town. These
need to be at least 25 feet wide to accommodate wagons
moving in both directions, and they often have narrow
sidewalks that allow pedestrians to avoid wagon traffic.
Walls
Well-built structures have exterior walls of brick or
stonemasonry. Smaller, lower-quality, or temporary
structures might have wooden walls. Interior walls tend
to be less sturdy; they could be made of wooden planks,
or even simply of thick, opaque paper held in a wooden
frame. An underground structure might have thick
walls carved out of solid rock to prevent the weight of
the ground above from collapsing the structure. Rules
for climbing and breaking walls are in the sidebar on
page 515.
Underground
Underground environments consist of caves and natural
underground areas. Artificial dungeons and ruins combine
underground features with urban features like stairs and
walls. Deep underground vaults have some of the same
terrain features as mountains, such as chasms and cliffs.
The most common disasters underground are collapses.
Floors
Natural underground environments rarely have flat floors,
instead featuring abrupt changes in elevation that result in
difficult terrain, uneven ground, and inclines.
Ledges
Ledges are narrow surfaces that overlook a lower area
or provide the only means to move along the edge of
a chasm. Moving across a narrow ledge requires using
Acrobatics to Balance.
Rubble
Caverns can be covered in rubble, which is
difficult terrain. Deep or pervasive rubble is
also uneven ground.
Stalagmites and Stalactites
Stalagmites are tapering columns that
rise from the floor of a cave. Areas
filled with stalagmites are greater
difficult terrain, and especially large
stalagmites have to be sidestepped
or Climbed. Stalagmites can
be sharp enough they can be
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 518
================================================================================

used as hazardous terrain in some circumstances, as can
stalactites (icicle-shaped formations that hang from the
roof of a cave) if they’re knocked loose from a ceiling
or overhang.
Walls
Natural cave walls are uneven, with nooks, crannies,
and ledges. Since most caves are formed by water, cave
walls are often damp, making them even more difficult
to Climb.
Climate
Weather is more than just set dressing to establish
mood—it has mechanical effects you can combine with
environmental components to create a more memorable
encounter. Weather can impose circumstance penalties
on certain checks, from –1 to –4 based on severity.
Fog
Fog imposes a circumstance penalty to visual Perception
checks, depending on the thickness; it causes creatures
viewed through significant amounts of fog to be
concealed; and it cuts off all visibility at half a mile or
less—possibly much less. Conditions limiting visibility
to about a mile are called mist, and those that do so to
about 3 miles are called haze.
Precipitation
Precipitation includes rain as well as colder snow, sleet,
and hail. Wet precipitation douses flames, and frozen
precipitation can create areas of snow or ice on the
ground. Drizzle or light snowfall has little mechanical
effect beyond limited visibility.
Visibility
Most forms of precipitation impose circumstance
penalties on visual Perception checks. Hail often is sparser
but loud, instead penalizing auditory Perception checks.
Especially heavy precipitation, such as a downpour of
rain or heavy snow, might make creatures concealed if
they’re far away.
Fatigue
Precipitation causes discomfort and fatigue. Anything
heavier than drizzle or light snowfall reduces the
time it takes for characters to become fatigued from
overland travel to only 4 hours. Heavy precipitation
can be dangerous in cold environments when characters
go without protection. Soaked characters treat the
temperature as one step colder (mild to severe, severe to
extreme; see Temperature below).
Thunderstorms
High winds and heavy precipitation accompany
many thunderstorms. There’s also a very small chance
that a character might be struck by lightning during
a storm. A lightning strike usually deals moderate
electricity damage, or major electricity damage in a
severe thunderstorm.
Temperature
Often, temperature doesn’t impose enough of a
mechanical effect to worry about beyond describing the
clothing the characters need to wear to be comfortable.
Particularly hot and cold weather can make creatures
fatigued more quickly during overland travel and can
cause damage if harsh enough, as shown in Table 10–13
on page 518.
Appropriate cold-weather gear (such as the winter
clothing) can negate the damage from severe cold
or reduce the damage from extreme cold to that of
particularly severe cold.
Wind
Wind imposes a circumstance penalty on auditory
Perception checks depending on its strength. It also
interferes with physical ranged attacks such as arrows,
imposing a circumstance penalty to attack rolls involving
such weapons, and potentially making attacks with them
impossible in powerful windstorms. Wind snuffs out
handheld flames; lanterns protect their flame from the
wind, but particularly powerful winds can extinguish
these as well.
Moving in Wind
Wind is difficult or greater difficult terrain when Flying.
Moving in wind of sufficient strength requires a Maneuver
in Flight action, and fliers are blown away on a critical
failure or if they don’t succeed at a minimum of one such
check each round.
Even on the ground, particularly strong winds might
require a creature to succeed at an Athletics check to
move, knocking the creature back and prone on a critical
failure. On such checks, Small creatures typically take a
–1 circumstance penalty, and Tiny creatures typically take
a –2 penalty.
DUNGEONS
Dungeon environments, which include both ruins and
contemporary buildings constructed in the wilderness,
are a fairly common venue for adventures. As an
environment, they combine urban features like doors and
buildings (page 515) with features from an underground
environment,
and
occasionally
components
from
other environments. While underground dungeons are
particularly common, you might also consider setting
your adventure in a ruin reclaimed by the forest, with
giant trees spreading their roots through the walls, or a
ruin deep in a swamp, with bogs covering access to some
of the ruin’s hidden secrets.
GAME MASTERING

================================================================================
PAGE 519
================================================================================

Natural Disasters
Climate and environmental features can be a hindrance
or long-term threat, but natural disasters represent acute
danger, especially to those directly exposed to their fury.
The damage in the following sections uses the categories in
Table 10–11: Environmental Damage on page 512.
Avalanches
Though the term avalanche specifically refers to a
cascading flow of ice and snow down a mountain’s slope,
the same rules work for landslides, mudslides, and other
similar disasters. Avalanches of wet snow usually travel
up to 200 feet per round, though powdery snow can
travel up to 10 times faster. Rockslides and mudslides
are slower, sometimes even slow enough that a character
might be able to outrun them.
An
avalanche
deals
major
or
even
massive
bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path.
These victims are also buried under a significant mass.
Creatures caught in an avalanche’s path can attempt
a Reflex save; if they succeed, they take only half the
bludgeoning damage, and if they critically succeed, they
also avoid being buried.
Burial
Buried creatures take minor bludgeoning damage each
minute, and they potentially take minor cold damage
if buried under an avalanche of snow. At the GM’s
discretion, creatures without a sufficient air pocket could
also risk suffocation (page 478). A buried creature is
restrained and usually can’t free itself.
Allies or bystanders can attempt to dig out a buried
creature. Each creature digging clears roughly a 5-footby-5-foot square every 4 minutes with a successful
Athletics check (or every 2 minutes on a critical success).
Using shovels or other proper tools halves the time.
Blizzards
Blizzards combine cold weather, heavy snow, and strong
winds. They don’t pose a single direct threat as other
disasters do; instead, the combination of these factors all
at once poses a substantial impediment to characters.
Collapses
Collapses and cave-ins occur when caverns or buildings
fall, dumping tons of rock or other material on those
caught below or inside them. Creatures under the
collapse take major or massive bludgeoning damage and
become buried, just as with an avalanche. Fortunately,
collapses don’t spread unless they weaken the overall
integrity of the area and lead to further collapses.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes often cause other natural disasters in the
form of avalanches, collapses, floods, and tsunamis, but
they also present unique threats such as fissures, soil
liquefaction, and tremors.
Fissures
Fissures and other ground ruptures can destabilize
structures, but more directly they lead to creatures taking
bludgeoning damage from falling into a fissure.
Soil Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when granular particles shake to
the point where they temporarily lose their solid form
and act as liquids. When this happens to soil, it can
cause creatures and even whole buildings to sink into
the ground. You can use the earthquake spell for more
specific rules, though that spell represents only one
particular kind of localized quake.
Tremors
Tremors knock creatures prone, causing them to fall or
careen into other objects, which can deal bludgeoning
damage appropriate to the severity of the quake.
Floods
Though more gradual floods can damage structures and
drown creatures, flash floods are similar to avalanches,
except with a liquid mass instead of a solid one. Instead
of burying creatures, a flash flood carries creatures and
even massive objects away, buffeting the creatures and
potentially drowning them. The drowning rules appear
on page 478.

Sandstorms
Mild sandstorms and dust storms don’t present much
more danger than a windy rainstorm, but they can cause
damage to a creature’s lungs and spread diseases across
long distances. Heavy sandstorms deal minor slashing
damage each round to those exposed to the sand, force
creatures to hold their breath to avoid suffocation,
or both.
Tornadoes
In a tornado’s path, wind conditions impose severe
circumstance penalties, but creatures that would
normally be blown away are instead picked up in the
tornado’s funnel, where they take massive bludgeoning
damage from flying debris as they rise through the cone
until they are eventually expelled (taking bludgeoning
damage from falling).
Tornadoes usually travel around 300 feet per round
(roughly 30 miles per hour). They normally travel a few
miles before dissipating. Some tornadoes are stationary
or travel much faster.
Tsunamis
Tsunamis present many of the same dangers as flash
floods but are much larger and more destructive. Tsunami
waves can reach 100 feet or more in height, wrecking
buildings and creatures alike with massive bludgeoning
damage from both the wave itself and debris pulled up
along its path of destruction.
Volcanic Eruptions
Volcanic eruptions can contain any combination of ash,
lava bombs, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and vents.
Ash
Ash from volcanic eruptions is hot enough to cause
minor fire damage each minute. It limits visibility like
a thick fog and can make air unbreathable, requiring
characters to hold their breath or suffocate (page 478).
Ash clouds generate ash lightning strikes, which typically
deal moderate electricity damage but are very unlikely
to hit an individual creature. Ash buildup on the ground
creates areas of uneven ground, difficult terrain, or
greater difficult terrain, and ash in the atmosphere can
block the sun for weeks or even months, leading to colder
temperatures and longer winters.
Lava Bombs
Pressure can launch lava into the air that falls as lava
bombs: masses of lava that solidify as they fly and shatter
on impact, dealing at least moderate bludgeoning damage
and moderate fire damage.
Lava Flows
Lava flows are an iconic volcanic threat; they usually
move between 5 and 60 feet per round over normal
ground, so characters can often outrun them. However,
flows can move up to 300 feet per round in a steep
volcanic tube or channel. Lava emanates heat that deals
minor fire damage even before it comes into contact
with creatures, and immersion in lava deals massive fire
damage each round.
Pyroclastic Flows
Mixes of hot gases and rock debris, pyroclastic flows
spread much faster than lava, sometimes more than
4,000 feet per round. While cooler than the hottest lava,
pyroclastic flows are capable of overwhelming entire
settlements. They work like avalanches but deal half of
their damage as fire damage.
Vents
Steam vents shoot from the ground, dealing moderate fire
damage or more in a wide column. Acidic and poisonous
gases released from beneath the surface can create wide
areas of hazardous terrain that deals at least minor acid
or poison damage.
Wildfires
Wildfires travel mainly along a front moving in a single
direction. In a forest, the front can advance up to 70
feet per round (7 miles per hour). They can move up
to twice as fast across plains due to a lack of shade
and the relatively low humidity. Embers from the fire,
carried by winds and rising hot air, can scatter, forming
spot fires as far as 10 miles away from the main
wildfire. Wildfires present three main threats: flames,
heat, and smoke.
Flames
Flames are hazardous terrain, usually dealing moderate
damage and potentially setting a character on fire,
dealing moderate persistent fire damage. The flames from
a small fire are often less dangerous than the advancing
heat from the front of a large fire.
Heat
Wildfires increase the temperature in advance of the front,
reaching nearly 1,500° F at the fire’s arrival, as hot as
some lava. This begins as minor fire damage every round
at a reasonable distance from the front and increases to
massive fire damage for someone within the wildfire.
Smoke
Wind can carry smoke far in front of the wildfire
itself. Smoke imposes a circumstance penalty to visual
Perception checks, depending on the thickness. It causes
creatures viewed through significant amounts of smoke
to be concealed, and it cuts off all visibility at half a mile
or less. Near or within the wildfire, the combination of
smoke and heated air require characters to hold their
breath or suffocate (page 478).
GAME MASTERING

================================================================================
PAGE 521
================================================================================

Detecting a Hazard
Every hazard has a trigger of some kind that sets its
dangers in motion. For traps, this could be a mechanism
like a trip wire or a pressure plate, while for an
environmental hazard or haunt, the trigger may simply be
proximity. When characters approach a hazard, they have
a chance of finding the trigger area or mechanism before
triggering the hazard. They automatically receive a check
to detect hazards unless the hazards require a minimum
proficiency rank to do so.
During exploration, determine whether the party
detects a hazard when the PCs first enter the general area
in which it appears. If the hazard doesn’t list a minimum
proficiency rank, roll a secret Perception check against
the hazard’s Stealth DC for each PC. For hazards with a
minimum proficiency rank, roll only if someone is actively
searching (using the Search activity while exploring or
the Seek action in an encounter), and only if they have the
listed proficiency rank or higher. Anyone who succeeds
becomes aware of the hazard, and you can describe what
they notice.
Magical hazards that don’t have a minimum proficiency
rank can be found using detect magic, but this spell
doesn’t provide enough information to understand or
disable the hazard—it only reveals the hazard’s presence.
Determining a magical hazard’s properties thoroughly
enough to disable it requires either the use of more
powerful magic or a successful skill check, likely using
Identify Magic or Recall Knowledge. Magical hazards
with a minimum proficiency rank cannot be found with
detect magic at all.
Triggering a Hazard
If the group fails to detect a hazard and the hazard’s
trigger is a standard part of traveling (such as stepping
on a floor plate or moving through a magical sensor
while walking), the hazard’s reaction occurs. Hazards
that would be triggered only when someone directly
manipulates the environment—by opening a door, for
example—use their reactions only if a PC explicitly takes
that action.
Reaction or Free Action
Most hazards have reactions that occur when they’re
triggered. For simple hazards, the reaction is the entirety
of the hazard’s effect. For complex hazards, the reaction
may also cause the hazard to roll initiative, either starting
a combat encounter or joining one already in progress,
and the hazard continues to pose a threat over multiple
rounds. Some hazards have a triggered free action instead
of a reaction; for instance, quicksand can suck down
multiple creatures per round.
Routine
A complex hazard usually follows a set of preprogrammed
actions called a routine. Once triggered, the hazard first
performs its initial reaction; then, if the PCs are not yet
in encounter mode, they should roll initiative. (If they’re
already in encounter mode, their initiative remains
the same.) The hazard might tell you to roll initiative
for it—in this case, the hazard rolls initiative using its
Stealth modifier.
After this happens, the hazard follows its routine each
round on its initiative. The number of actions a hazard
can take each round, as well as what they can be used for,
depend on the hazard.
Resetting a Hazard
Some hazards can be reset, allowing them to be triggered
again. This can occur automatically, as for quicksand,
whose surface settles after 24 hours, or manually, like a
hidden pit, whose trapdoor must be closed for the pit to
become hidden again.
Hazards
Dungeons are rife with devious traps meant to protect the treasures within. These range
from mechanical devices that shoot darts or drop heavy blocks to magic runes that
explode into bursts of flame. In addition to traps, adventurers may stumble into other
types of hazards, including naturally occurring environmental hazards, mysterious
hauntings, and more.
MONSTERS AND HAZARDS
The statistics for NPCs and monsters usually don’t list their
proficiency ranks. Most of the time, they don’t need to deal
with detecting or disabling hazards the way PCs do, so you
don’t need this information. However, if a PC resets a trap
in a monster’s path or plans to lure a monster into a hazard,
you can improvise this information.
For Perception, a monster is usually an expert at 3rd
or 4th level, a master at 8th or 9th level, and legendary
at 16th or 17th level. If the monster has Thievery listed in
its skills, it has the highest proficiency possible for its level
(trained at 1st, expert at 3rd, master at 7th, and legendary
at 15th); otherwise, it’s untrained. Of course, an individual
monster might deviate from these guidelines, especially if
it’s mindless or not very perceptive.
Core Rulebook

================================================================================
PAGE 522
================================================================================

Disabling a Hazard
The most versatile method for deactivating traps is the
Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill, though
most mechanical traps can also simply be smashed, and
magical traps can usually be counteracted. Environmental
hazards often can be overcome with Nature or Survival,
and haunts can often be overcome with Occultism or
Religion. The specific skill and DC required to disable
a hazard are listed in the hazard’s stat block. As with
detecting a hazard, disabling a hazard might require
a character to have a certain proficiency rank in the
listed skill.
A character must first detect a hazard (or have it pointed
out to them) to try to deactivate it. They can attempt to
deactivate a hazard whether or not it has already been
triggered, though some hazards no longer pose a danger
once their reactions have occurred, especially if there is
no way for them to be reset.
For most hazards, a successful check for the listed
skill against the DC in the stat block disables the hazard
without triggering it. Any other means of deactivating
the hazard are included in the hazard’s stat block, as are
any additional steps required to properly deactivate it.
A critical failure on any roll to disable a hazard triggers
it, including a critical failure on a roll to counteract a
magic hazard.
Some hazards require multiple successful checks to
deactivate, typically because they have a particularly
complicated component or have several discrete portions.
For hazards with a complex component, a critical success
on a check to disable the hazard counts as two successes
on a single component.
Damaging a Hazard
Rather than trying to carefully disable a hazard, a
character might just smash it. Damaging a mechanical
trap or another physical hazard works like damaging
objects: the hazard reduces the damage it takes by its
Hardness. In most cases, hitting the hazard also triggers
it, as explained in Attacking a Hazard below. If a
hazard’s Hit Points are reduced to its Broken Threshold
(BT) or lower, the hazard becomes broken and can’t
be activated, though it can still be repaired. If it’s
reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed and can’t be repaired.
(See page 272 in Chapter 6 for more information on
damaging objects.)
Hazards’ AC, applicable saving throw modifiers,
Hardness, HP, and BT are listed in their stat blocks. A
hazard that doesn’t list one of these statistics can’t be
affected by anything targeting that statistic. For example,
a hazard that has HP but no BT can’t be broken, but can
still be destroyed. Hazards are immune to anything an
object is immune to unless specifically noted otherwise,
and they can’t be targeted by anything that can’t target
objects. Some hazards may have additional immunities,
as well as resistances or weaknesses.
Attacking a Hazard
If someone hits a hazard—especially if it’s a mechanical
trap—they usually trigger it, though you might
determine otherwise in some cases. An attack that breaks
the hazard might prevent it from triggering, depending
on the circumstances. If the hazard has multiple parts,
breaking one part might still trigger the trap. For
example, if a trap has a trip wire in one location and
launches an attack from another location, severing the
trip wire could still trigger the attack. Destroying a
trap in one blow almost never triggers it. These rules
also apply to most damaging spells or other effects in
addition to attacks.
Repairing a Hazard
You might allow a character to repair a damaged hazard
to restore its functionality. You determine the specifics of
this, since it can vary by trap. The Repair action might be
insufficient if fixing the trap requires gathering scattered
components or the like. If the item has a Reset entry, the
character needs to do whatever is listed there, in addition
to repairing the damage.
Counteracting a Magical Hazard
Some magical hazards can be counteracted using dispel
magic and the counteracting rules found on page 458.
These hazards’ spell levels and counteract DCs are listed
in their stat block. Counteracting a hazard otherwise
works like using a skill check to disable the hazard.
Hazard Experience
Characters gain Experience Points for overcoming a
hazard, whether they disable it, avoid it, or simply endure
its attacks. If they trigger the same hazard later on, they
don’t gain XP for the hazard again. The XP values for
hazards of different levels also appear on page 508, but
are repeated here for convenience. The XP for a complex
hazard is equal to the XP for a monster of the same level,
and the XP for a simple hazard is one-fifth of that. Hazards
of a lower level than the party’s level – 4 are trivial and
award no XP.

Hazard Format
Hazards are presented in a stat block format similar to
those used for monsters. A few notes regarding the format
follow the sample stat block.
HAZARD NAME
HAZARD [LEVEL]
TRAITS
Stealth This entry lists the Stealth modifier for a complex
hazard’s initiative or the Stealth DC to detect a simple
hazard, followed by the minimum proficiency rank to detect
the hazard (if any) in parentheses. If detect magic can be
used to detect the hazard, this information is located here
as well.
Description This explains what the hazard looks like and might
include special rules.
Disable The DC of any skill checks required to disable the
hazard are here; if the hazard can be counteracted, its spell
level and counteract DC are listed in parentheses.
AC the hazard’s AC; Saving Throws the hazard’s saves. Usually
only haunts are subject to Will saves.
Hardness the hazard’s Hardness; HP the hazard’s Hit Points,
with its Broken Threshold in parentheses; Immunities the
hazard’s immunities; Weaknesses the hazard’s weaknesses,
if any; Resistances the hazard’s resistances, if any
Action Type [reaction] or [free-action] This is the reaction or free action the
hazard uses; Trigger The trigger that sets off the hazard
appears here. Effect For a simple hazard, this effect is often
all the hazard does. For a complex hazard, this might also
cause the hazard to roll initiative.
Routine This section describes what a complex hazard does on
each of its turns during an encounter; the number in parentheses
after the word “Routine” indicates how many actions the hazard
can use each turn. Simple hazards don’t have this entry.
Action Any action the hazard can use appears here. Typically,
this is a melee or ranged attack.
Reset If the hazard can be reset, that information is here.
Level
The hazard’s level indicates what level of party it’s a good
challenge for. If the hazard involves a toxin, curse, or other
non-spell feature, that feature’s level is the hazard’s level.
Traits
The most notable hazard traits are trap (constructed to
harm intruders), environmental (natural hazards), and
haunt (spectral phenomena). Traps have a trait to indicate
whether they’re magical or mechanical. Hazards that have
initiative and a routine have the complex trait.
Stealth or Stealth DC
Complex hazards list their Stealth modifier, which they
use for initiative, instead of their Stealth DC. If you need
the DC, it’s equal to this modifier + 10.
Simple Hazards
A simple hazard uses its reaction only once, after which
its threat is over unless the hazard is reset.
HIDDEN PIT
HAZARD 0
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 18 (or 0 if the trapdoor is disabled or broken)
Description A wooden trapdoor covers a pit that’s 10 feet
square and 20 feet deep.
Disable Thievery DC 12 to remove the trapdoor
AC 10; Fort +1, Ref +1
Trapdoor Hardness 3, Trapdoor HP 12 (BT 6); Immunities
critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect
The triggering creature falls in and takes falling damage
(typically 10 bludgeoning damage). That creature can use
the Grab an Edge reaction to avoid falling.
Reset Creatures can still fall into the trap, but the trapdoor
must be reset manually for the trap to become hidden again.

Slam Shut [reaction] Trigger Pressure is placed on any floor tile. Effect
The door falls, closing off the hallway. The stone slab deals
3d8 bludgeoning damage to anyone beneath or adjacent to
the slab when it drops and pushes them out of its space in a
random direction. A creature that succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex
save takes no damage and rolls out of the way in a random
direction. On a critical success, they can choose the direction.
Lifting the fallen slab requires a successful DC 25
Athletics check. Hitting the floor panels triggers the
trap. The slab uses the same AC and saves as the
trap, but it has Hardness 12, HP 48 (BT 24).

magical sensor with a 20-foot radius.
Disable Thievery DC 22 (expert) to erase the rune without
triggering the sensor, or dispel magic (3rd level; counteract
DC 20) to counteract the rune
Fireball [reaction] (arcane, evocation, fire); Trigger A living creature
enters the sensor area. Effect The rune detonates a fireball
centered on the triggering creature’s square. This is a 3rdlevel fireball spell that deals 6d6 fire damage (DC 22 basic
Reflex save).
HALLUCINATION POWDER TRAP
HAZARD 6
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 24 (expert)
Description A tube of hallucinogenic powder armed with a
miniature explosive is connected to a doorknob or similar latch.
Disable Thievery DC 26 (expert) to disable the hammer that
strikes the percussion cap
AC 24; Fort +0, Ref +0
Hardness 0, HP 1; Immunities critical hits, object immunities,
precision damage
Powder Burst [reaction] (mental, poison); Trigger The latch is opened
or the tube is broken. Effect The tube explodes, spraying
hallucinogenic powder in a 30-foot cone. Any creature in
the cone must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused
for 1 round and take a –2 status penalty to Perception
checks and saves against mental effects for 1d4 hours. On a
critical failure, the penalty is instead –4.
PHARAOH’S WARD
HAZARD 7
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 25 (expert)
Description A curse is imbued on an entryway’s threshold.
Disable Thievery DC 27 (master) to painstakingly remove the
lintel without triggering the magic, or dispel magic (4th
level; counteract DC 25) to counteract the rune
Curse the Intruders [reaction] (curse, divine, necromancy); Trigger The
seal on the tomb is broken from the outside. Effect Each living
creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or
be subjected to the pharaoh’s curse. A cursed creature takes
a –2 status penalty to Fortitude saves, and any natural or
magical healing it receives is halved. The curse remains until
removed by remove curse or similar magic.
Reset The trap resets when the door is shut.
YELLOW MOLD
HAZARD 8
ENVIRONMENTAL
FUNGUS
Stealth DC 28 (trained)
Description Poisonous mold spores assault nearby creatures.
Disable Survival DC 26 (expert) to remove the mold without
triggering the spores
AC 27; Fort +17, Ref +13
HP 70; Immunities critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Spore Explosion [reaction] Trigger A creature moves into the mold’s
space or damages the mold. The mold can’t use this reaction
if it’s in direct sunlight or if the damage was fire damage.
Effect The triggering creature and all creatures within 10
feet are exposed to yellow mold spores.
Yellow Mold Spores (inhaled, poison) Any drained condition
from the spores persists after the poison’s duration ends;
Saving Throw DC 26 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6
rounds; Stage 1 1d8 poison damage and drained 1 (1 round);
Stage 2 2d8 poison damage and drained 2 (1 round); Stage
3 3d8 poison damage and drained 3 (1 round)
BOTTOMLESS PIT
HAZARD 9
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 30 (or 0 if the trapdoor is disabled or broken) or
detect magic
Description An iron trapdoor covers an infinitely deep
10-foot‑square pit.
Disable Thievery DC 28 (trained) to remove the trapdoor
AC 28; Fort +12, Ref +12
Trapdoor Hardness 9, Trapdoor HP 36 (BT 18); Immunities
critical hits, object immunities, precision damage
Infinite Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor.
Effect The triggering creature falls in and continues to fall,
potentially forever. That creature can try to Grab an Edge to
avoid falling (page 472). The DC to Climb the walls or Grab
an Edge is 26.
The pit contains many handholds, so the falling creature
can try to Grab an Edge again every 6 seconds. If the
creature succeeds, it can start to Climb out from that point
(though it might be a very long climb, depending on how
far the creature fell). Since the creature falls endlessly, it
can rest and even prepare spells while falling, though items
dropped while falling are usually lost forever.
Reset The trap still causes creatures to fall forever if they fall
in, but the trapdoor must be reset manually for the trap to
become hidden again.
BLOODTHIRSTY URGE
HAZARD 10
HAUNT
Stealth DC 31 (trained)
Description An object haunted by the echoes of a vicious mind
attempts to kill someone who comes near.
Disable Religion DC 29 (master) to exorcise the spirit or
Diplomacy DC 31 (expert) to talk it down
Quietus [reaction] (death, emotion, fear, illusion, mental, occult);
Trigger A creature moves within 10 feet of the haunted
object. Effect The haunt takes control of the triggering
creature, forcing it to attack itself. The creature must
attempt a DC 29 Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target makes a Strike against itself and automatically
hits; the target also becomes frightened 1.
Failure The target makes a Strike against itself and automatically
scores a critical hit; the target also becomes frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target attempts a Fortitude save. If the

target succeeds, it is subject to the effects of a failure instead.
If the target fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies.
HAMMER OF FORBIDDANCE
HAZARD 11
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 30 (expert)
Description An enormous hammer at an edifice’s entrance
swings down in an attempt to damage a creature entering
an area, push it back, and prevent it from going any further.
Disable Thievery DC 28 (expert) once on the hammer itself
and once on its joint to prevent the hammer from swinging
AC 32; Fort +24, Ref +15
Hammer Hardness 22, Hammer HP 88 (BT 44); Joint Hardness
16, Joint HP 64 (BT 32); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Forbid Entry [reaction] (abjuration, attack, divine); Trigger A creature
attempts to enter through the entrance. Effect The hammer
swings down, making an attack against the triggering creature.
Melee hammer +28, Damage 6d8+20 bludgeoning plus the
target is knocked back 10 feet and must succeed at a DC
30 Will save or be unable to enter the edifice through
any entrance for 24 hours (on a critical hit, the target
automatically fails the Will save); no multiple attack penalty
Reset The trap resets over the course of the round, and is
ready to swing again 1 round later.
POLYMORPH TRAP
HAZARD 12
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 34 (trained)
Description A Druidic glyph tries to transforms a trespasser
into an animal.
Disable Thievery DC 32 (master) to drain the glyph’s power
harmlessly, or dispel magic (6th level; counteract DC 30) to
counteract the glyph
Baleful Polymorph [reaction] (primal, transmutation); Trigger
A creature moves within 30 feet of the glyph without
speaking the passphrase in Druidic. Effect The creature is
targeted by baleful polymorph (DC 32 Will save).
PLANAR RIFT
HAZARD 13
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 35 (trained)
Description A rift attempts to draw creatures into another
plane (the GM chooses the specific plane).
Disable Thievery DC 33 (master) to assemble a rift seal using
objects strongly grounded to your plane, or dispel magic
(7th level; counteract DC 31) to counteract the rift
Into the Great Beyond [reaction] (conjuration, occult, teleportation);
Trigger A creature moves within 10 feet of the rift. Effect The
triggering creature and all creatures within 30 feet of the
rift are drawn into another plane. Each creature can attempt
a DC 33 Reflex save to avoid this fate.
FROZEN MOMENT
HAZARD 17
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 40 (master)
Description Warding magic attempts to trap intruders or
would-be thieves in a disrupted time flow.
Disable Thievery DC 38 (legendary) to rapidly disassemble
the spell’s myriad components in a single blink of an eye;
or dispel magic (9th level; counteract DC 36) to counteract
the trap before it triggers or to counteract the effect on one
creature after the trap is triggered
Adrift in Time [reaction] (occult, transmutation); Trigger A creature
touches the warded object or area. Effect The triggering
creature and all creatures within 30 feet are trapped
in a disrupted time flow (DC 38 Fortitude negates). The
creatures’ minds move so quickly that each round seems to
last a century, but their bodies and magical energies move
so slowly that they can’t use any actions except Recall
Knowledge. An affected creature must attempt a DC 36 Will
saving throw against a warp mind spell immediately and
again for every minute of real time that passes while the
creature is trapped in the frozen moment. This effect has an
unlimited duration but can be counteracted.
VORPAL EXECUTIONER
HAZARD 19
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 43 (expert)
Description A wickedly sharp saw blade descends and
travels along grooves in a complex path throughout the room,
attempting to decapitate everyone within.
Disable Thievery DC 41 (expert) at four different junctions to
jam all the saw blade’s possible paths, preventing it from
traveling through the room
AC 43; Fort +32, Ref +32
Hardness 30; HP 120 (BT 60) per junction; Immunities critical
hits, object immunities, precision damage
Total Decapitation [reaction] (attack, death); Trigger A creature
attempts to exit the room. Effect The saw blade travels
along its path, making one Strike against each creature in
the room, twisting and varying its height for a maximum
chance of beheading its targets.
Melee saw blade +40 (deadly d12), Damage 6d12+25 slashing
plus decapitation; no multiple attack penalty
Decapitation On a critical hit, a target must succeed at a DC
39 Fortitude save or be decapitated, dying instantly unless
it can survive without a head.
Reset The trap resets over the course of the round and can be
triggered again 1 round later.
SECOND CHANCE
HAZARD 21
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 44 (legendary)
Description Powerful warding magic tied to an object or
location tries to regress the ages of a creature and its allies.
Disable Thievery DC 46 (legendary) to take apart the spell one
tiny piece at a time, with eyes closed, while recalling every
vivid life memory in order, starting from the earliest memory
In the Beginning [reaction] (divine, transmutation); Trigger A creature
tries to steal the object or intrude upon the location. If
someone uses a proxy or dupe for the theft or intrusion, the

trap unerringly targets the true perpetrator or perpetrators
at any distance—even across planes. Effect The triggering
creature and up to five coconspirators instantly revert to
infants, losing all memories, class abilities, and other skills
acquired during their lives (DC 44 Fortitude negates).
Reversing this effect is nearly impossible, requiring
powerful magic such as wish.
ARMAGEDDON ORB
HAZARD 23
RARE
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth DC 10 or detect magic
Description A roiling red orb, forged from a drop of the god
Rovagug’s blood, rains fire from the sky when a specified
condition is met.
Disable Thievery DC 48 (legendary) to imbue thieves’ tools
with aspects representing Asmodeus and Sarenrae and use
them to drain away the orb’s power over 10 minutes; the
character attempting this check takes 5 fire damage each
round until the orb is depleted
Burn It All [reaction] (death, divine, evocation, fire); Trigger A special
condition set by the trap’s creator occurs; this is typically
the event of their death. Effect Fire rains from the sky in a
100-mile radius, dealing 10d6 fire damage to creatures and
objects in the area. Each creature or object can attempt a DC
46 basic Reflex save. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points
by this damage dies instantly. This is not enough damage to
completely burn away a forest or level an entire mountain
or city, but it typically kills most creatures in the area.
Complex Hazards
Complex hazards function similarly to monsters during
encounters, as they roll initiative and have actions of their
own, though these are usually automated in a routine.
SUMMONING RUNE 
HAZARD 1
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth +7 (trained)
Description A cloud of invisible magical sensors in a 10-foot
radius surrounds an invisible wall or floor rune the size of the
creature to be summoned.
Disable Acrobatics DC 15 to approach without triggering the
trap followed by Thievery DC 17 (trained) to erase the rune, or
dispel magic (1st level; counteract DC 15) to counteract the rune
Summon Monster [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, summon; Trigger
A creature enters the cloud of magical sensors. Effect
This trap summons a specific level 1 creature, determined
when the trap is created. The creature rolls initiative and
remains for 2d6 rounds, after which the spell ends and
the creature disappears. The creature also disappears if
someone disables the trap before the duration expires. The
summoned creature can use 3 actions each round and can
use reactions, unlike most summoned creatures.
Reset The trap resets each day at dawn.
DROWNING PIT
HAZARD 3
COMPLEX
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +10 (trained); DC 22 (expert) to notice the water
spouts once the pit opens
Description A trapdoor covers a 10-foot-square pit that’s 30
feet deep and has 5 feet of water at the bottom. Four water
spouts in the walls connect to hidden water tanks. Each water
spout extends out of a different wall, 6 inches from the top
of the pit.
Disable Thievery DC 18 (trained) to seal each water spout,
Thievery DC 22 (trained) to open the trapdoor, or Athletics
DC 22 to Force Open the trapdoor
AC 19; Fort +8, Ref +5
Trapdoor Hardness 15, Trapdoor HP 60 (BT 30); Spout
Hardness 8, Spout HP 32 (BT 16); Immunities critical hits,
object immunities, precision damage
Pitfall [reaction] Trigger A creature walks onto the trapdoor. Effect
The triggering creature falls in and takes damage from the
fall, reduced by 5 feet for falling into the water (typically 12
bludgeoning damage). A creature can Grab an Edge to avoid
falling (page 472). The trapdoor then slams shut, and the
hazard rolls initiative.
Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action each turn for each
disabled water spout. On each of the trap’s actions, a spout
pours water, increasing the depth of the water by 5 feet.
Once the pit is full of water, the pit stops using actions, but
creatures in the pit begin drowning (page 478).
Reset The trap can be reset if the door is manually reengaged
and the water tanks refilled; it can be reset without draining
the pit, but doing so renders it less effective.
QUICKSAND
HAZARD 3
COMPLEX
ENVIRONMENTAL
Stealth +12 (trained) (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the
surface is disturbed)
Description A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts
to submerge creatures that step onto it.
Disable Survival DC 18 (trained) to disturb the surface
Submerge [free-action] Trigger A Huge or smaller creature walks onto
the quicksand. Effect The triggering creature sinks into the
quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it
hasn’t already.
Routine (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down
each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to
its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature
UPGRADED SUMMONING RUNES
You can make a summoning rune of nearly any level. It
summons a creature of a level equal to the trap’s level.
Use Table 10–5: DCs by Level on page 503 to determine
the Thievery DC and spell DC, using the trap’s level and
applying a hard adjustment (+2). The Stealth modifier for
the trap is equal to this number – 10. Stronger summoning
runes usually require expert proficiency or better in
Perception to find, and they might require a higher
proficiency rank in Thievery to disable.

hold its breath to avoid suffocation (page 478).
A creature in the quicksand can attempt a DC 20 Athletics
check to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged
to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only
up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down
one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes
the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand
patch. Other creatures can Aid the creature, typically by using
a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with
their own DC 20 Athletics check, with the same results as if
the creature attempted the check.
Reset The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but
the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over
the course of 24 hours.
SPINNING BLADE PILLAR 
HAZARD 4
COMPLEX
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +11 (trained) or DC 26 (expert) to notice the control panel
Description A metal pole with three razor-sharp spinning
blades is hidden in the floor, connected to trigger plates in up
to eight floor tiles and a hidden control panel within 30 feet.
Disable Thievery DC 21 (trained) twice on the pillar, or Thievery
DC 19 (expert) once on the control panel deactivates the
whole trap. Breaking the control panel prevents anyone
from disabling the trap using the control panel and prevents
the trap from deactivating automatically (see Reset below).
AC 21; Fort +10, Ref +12
Pillar Hardness 12, Pillar HP 48 (BT 24); Panel Hardness
5, Panel HP 20 (BT 10); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Rising Pillar [reaction] (attack); Trigger A creature steps on one of
the trapped floor tiles. Effect The trap pops up in a grid
intersection and makes a spinning blade attack against
one adjacent creature (if any), then rolls initiative.
Routine (3 actions) The trap uses its first action
to make a spinning blade Strike against each
adjacent creature, its second action to move
straight in a random direction (roll 1d4 to
determine the direction), and its third action
to make a spinning blade Strike against
each adjacent creature. This trap doesn’t
take a multiple attack penalty.
Speed 10 feet
Melee [one-action] spinning blade +12, Damage
2d10+5 slashing

after 1 minute.
WHEEL OF MISERY 
HAZARD 6
COMPLEX

MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +16 (expert) to detect the
magical sensor; noticing the wheel
has a DC of 0
Description An ornate wheel set into a
wall—divided into six segments with colored
runes on each—is controlled by a magical sensor that detects
any creature within 100 feet in front of it.
Disable Thievery DC 26 (expert) on the wheel to stop it from
spinning, Thievery DC 22 (master) to erase each rune, or
dispel magic (4th level; counteract DC 22) to counteract
each rune
AC 24; Fort +15, Ref +13
Hardness 14, HP 56 (BT 28); Immunities critical hits, object
immunities, precision damage
Wheel Spin [reaction] Trigger A creature enters the sensor’s detection
area. Effect The wheel begins to spin and rolls initiative.
Routine (2 actions) On its initiative, the trap uses its first action
to spin, then stops. Roll 1d6 to determine which segment is
topmost when the wheel stops spinning. The wheel uses its
second action to replicate the spell listed for that segment
(3rd level, DC 24, spell attack roll +14). This spell’s target is
centered on or otherwise includes the nearest creature in the
area. This increases the spell’s range to 100 feet if necessary.
Any spell cast by this trap is arcane.
1 sleep
2 paralyze
3 lightning bolt (100-foot line)
4 blindness
5 acid arrow
6 ray of enfeeblement

POISONED DART GALLERY
HAZARD 8
COMPLEX
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +16 (expert) or DC 31 (master) to notice the control panel
Description Countless holes to launch poison darts from line a
long hallway with a hidden control panel on the far end.
Disable Thievery DC 21 (expert) on the control panel
deactivates the trap.
AC 27; Fort +13, Ref +17
Hardness 14; HP 56 (BT 28) to destroy the control panel and
disable the trap; Immunities critical hits, object immunities,
precision damage
Dart Volley [reaction] (attack); Trigger A creature enters the hallway
or ends its turn in the hallway. Effect The trap makes a
poisoned dart Strike against the triggering creature, then
rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The trap launches one dart against every
creature in the gallery as 1 action. Because it launches darts
continuously, the trap can also use the Continuous Barrage
free action (see below) to launch darts at each creature during
that creature’s turn.
Ranged poisoned dart +21, Damage 3d4 piercing plus flesset
poison; no multiple attack penalty
Continuous Barrage [free-action] Trigger A creature within the active
gallery finishes an action. Effect The trap makes a poisoned
dart Strike against the triggering creature.
Flesset Poison (poison); Saving Throw DC 22 Fortitude;
Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 1d6 poison damage and
clumsy 1 (1 round); Stage 2 2d6 poison damage and clumsy 2

LAVA FLUME TUBE
HAZARD 10
COMPLEX
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +19 (trained)
Description Four gated channels carved into stone allow lava
to flow into a 15-foot-tall room; the floor can withdraw to allow
the hardened lava to fall into a chamber beneath.
Disable Thievery DC 29 (expert) to block a channel, or Thievery
DC 31 (master) to release the floor latch and escape to the
chamber below
AC 30; Fort +20, Ref +16
Channel Hardness 12, Channel HP 48 (BT 24) to destroy a
channel gate (this prevents that channel from being disabled
and stops the trap from resetting); Floor Hardness 18; Floor
HP 72 (BT 36); Immunities critical hits, object immunities,
precision damage
Flume Activation [reaction] Trigger A creature tries to leave the room.
Effect The exits seal instantly and the trap rolls initiative.
Routine (4 actions) The trap loses 1 action per disabled
channel each turn. On each action, a different channel spews
lava, dealing 4d6 fire damage to each creature within 10 feet
of the channel (DC 27 basic Reflex save), and increasing the
depth of the lava in the room by 1 foot (4 feet per round if all
the channels are active).
A creature that starts its turn in lava takes 8d6 fire damage
and is immobilized until it Escapes the hardening lava (DC 27).
The creature might suffocate if covered in lava (page 478). Lava
from the previous round hardens fully at the start of the trap’s
turn, effectively raising the floor of the room. Once the room is
full of lava, the trap stops taking actions, but creatures in the
room remain stuck until the floor opens and the trap resets.
Reset The trap deactivates and resets after 1 hour by withdrawing
the floor, cracking and dumping the hardened lava (and any
creatures trapped inside) into the chamber. Creatures fall 40
feet, taking falling damage (typically 17 bludgeoning damage).
TELEKINETIC SWARM TRAP
HAZARD 12
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
MECHANICAL
TRAP
Stealth +24 (expert)
Description Three innocuous decorations instilled with
telekinetic magic pull objects and pieces of the room itself into
spinning clouds of debris that attack all creatures in the room.
Disable Thievery DC 27 (expert) to take apart a telekinetic
cloud, Thievery DC 32 (master) to disable each telekinetic
decoration, or dispel magic (6th level; counteract DC 30) to
counteract each telekinetic decoration
AC 33; Fort +24, Ref +19
Hardness 22, HP 88 (BT 44) per telekinetic cloud
Agitate [reaction] (arcane, evocation); Trigger A creature stays in the
room for at least 6 seconds. Effect Each telekinetic decoration
constructs a cloud of objects in the room (three clouds total)
and the trap rolls initiative. The creatures in the room when
the trap is triggered become the trap’s targets, regardless of
whether they leave the room or other creatures later enter
the room. Each decoration targets a different creature if
possible. A target creature that moves at least 1 mile from
the trap ceases being a target, at which point the decoration
designates a new target.
Routine (9 actions) Each decoration uses 3 of the trap’s
actions each turn, and the trap loses 3 actions each turn for
every decoration that is disabled. A decoration uses its first
action to move its cloud of objects up to 200 feet, its second
action to make the objects Strike, and its third action to add
more objects to the cloud, increasing its damage by 1d12 (to
a maximum of 4d12+10). If a decoration’s cloud is already at
maximum damage, it does nothing with its third action.
If a decoration’s cloud has been destroyed, the decoration
instead spends its first action to create a new cloud of objects
inside the room (using the starting damage value) and then its
second and third actions to have the cloud move and attack.
Melee [one-action] objects +24, Damage 2d12+10 bludgeoning
Reset The trap deactivates and resets 10 minutes after it has
no target creatures (because the creatures either moved too
far away or died).
DARKSIDE MIRROR
HAZARD 14
COMPLEX

TRAP
Stealth +24 (master) to notice it isn’t a regular mirror
Description A magic mirror replaces characters with evil
mirror duplicates from another dimension.

(possible only if their mirror duplicate is dead), Thievery
DC 39 (master) to permanently disable the mirror once
all mirror duplicates are dead, or dispel magic (7th level;
counteract DC 32) to counteract the mirror for 1 minute and
prevent additional replacements during that time
AC 34; Fort +25, Ref +20
Hardness 1, HP 4 (BT 2), the mirror can’t be damaged while
any mirror duplicate is alive
Reflection of Evil [reaction] (arcane, conjuration, teleportation);
Trigger A non-evil creature is reflected in the mirror. Effect
The mirror absorbs the creature into the mirror, replacing it
with an evil mirror duplicate (DC 34 Reflex to avoid being
absorbed into the mirror), and rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The mirror absorbs another reflected
creature into the mirror and replaces it with a mirror
duplicate. Mirror duplicates attack on their own initiative,
using the same statistics as the original creature, but with
an evil alignment (changing only abilities that shift with the
alignment change). A mirror duplicate can spend 3 actions in
contact with the mirror to return to its original dimension and
release the creature it duplicated, but most mirror duplicates
prefer not to.
Reset The mirror is always ready to absorb creatures into the
other dimension. Ten minutes after a creature is sucked into
the mirror, if an ally doesn’t rescue the creature with Thievery,
it reaches the other dimension, where it might be captured or
killed. In the mirror dimension, it counts as a mirror duplicate,
so the denizens of the other dimension can’t destroy the
mirror on their side while the absorbed creature is there.
These dimensions are alternate realities, not planes, so even
rituals like plane shift can’t reach them.
BANSHEE’S SYMPHONY
HAZARD 18
COMPLEX
MAGICAL
TRAP
Stealth +30 (legendary)
Description A magically contagious wail of the banshee spell
is trapped in the larynx of an invisible, mummified elf.
Disable Thievery DC 42 (master) to pierce the invisible larynx
so precisely that the magic releases in a trickle before the
trap activates, Thievery DC 44 (legendary) three times to
deconstruct the larynx while the trap is active in such a
way that it tears the spell apart, or spell DC 38 (9th level) to
counteract the wail of the banshee before the trap activates
Scream [reaction] Trigger Three or more living creatures remain
within 100 feet of the trap for 6 seconds or longer. Effect
The trap releases an arcane wail of the banshee (DC 40) with
a 100-foot-radius emanation instead of 40 feet, targeting all
living creatures in the area, and rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) The trap uses its action to force one random
creature that failed its save against wail of the banshee last
turn to emit a wail of the banshee with the same statistics as
the initial one. The creature wails even if it is dead or unable
to speak, no matter how far away from the trap it is. Unlike a
casting of the spell, the drained condition from this trap’s wail
of the banshee spells increases the targets’ drained condition
values. A creature that critically succeeds at any of its saves
can still be affected by the trap on future rounds, but can’t be
forced to wail by the trap.
Reset The trap ends when the trap is unable to make a
creature scream (usually because no creature failed its save
on the previous turn or because all creatures have critically
succeeded in the past). It then resets over 24 hours, as a new
scream builds up in the mummified larynx.

Treasure comes in all sorts of forms, from humble copper
coins to incredibly powerful and valuable magic items.
The GM controls the flow of items in the game as the PCs
win them through adventures, find them for purchase, or
acquire the formulas to make the items themselves.
Items can support characters by granting bonuses to their
statistics, allowing them to cast more spells, and creating
all sorts of effects that can’t be achieved in any other way.
Magic items come in many varieties, from enchanted swords
that can harm even incorporeal undead to containers that
can store a king’s ransom within a tiny space; many are
permanent items that can be used repeatedly. Alchemical
items, by contrast, are not intrinsically magical and are
often consumed when used. Both have a variety of uses,
from curing the sick to lighting foes on fire. Some treasures
are neither magical nor alchemical, but are instead crafted
from precious materials or using specialized expertise.
This chapter provides rules for using different kinds
of items encountered in the game. Rules for distributing
treasure and creating treasure hoards can be found on
page 508 of Chapter 10: Game Mastering.
• Using Items, beginning below, describes how to
activate items and explains the statistics for items.
• Table 11–1: Treasure by Level, beginning on page
536, lists the options for treasures, arranged by
level, category, and Price.
• The catalog of items, which begins on page 543,
presents descriptions and rules for all sorts of
different treasures that can appear in the game,
sorted by category (page 533 has a list of key
categories and subcategories). This also includes
a section on precious materials found in the game
world, which can give items unusual properties.
Using Items
This section presents the rules for how characters use
alchemical items, magic items, and other special items
during play.
The myriad types of items give their powerful boons in
different ways. Some function automatically, while others
need to be activated. While you need only swing a flaming
greataxe to scorch foes, you need to invest a diadem of
intellect for it to work, imbibe an elixir of life to heal
yourself, activate slippers of spider climbing to walk up
a wall, activate your mail of luck to protect yourself, and
Cast a Spell using a magical scroll.
