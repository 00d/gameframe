When you take on the role of Game Master, you’ll have
the rewarding job of crafting fun experiences for a group
of your friends. Your responsibilities include...
• Telling the story of the group’s adventures in a
compelling and consistent way.
• Fleshing out the world in which the game takes
place, emphasizing the fantastical while grounding
it enough in the real world to feel believable.
• Entertaining the players and yourself with novel
concepts, and rewarding creative ideas with
interesting outcomes.
• Preparing for game sessions by building or studying
adventures and creating characters and plots.
• Improvising the reactions of nonplayer characters
and other forces in the world as the players do
unexpected things.
• Making rules decisions to ensure fairness and keep
the game moving forward.
This chapter provides the tools you need to shoulder
those responsibilities. The following sections break
down the various components of a campaign, discuss the
different modes of play and how to set DCs for the tasks
the PCs attempt, provide different ways of rewarding
player characters, and describe aspects of the environment
that might affect an adventuring party.
Planning a Campaign
A Pathfinder game is typically structured as a campaign—a
serialized story that focuses on a single party of characters.
A campaign is subdivided into multiple adventures,
smaller stories that involve exploration and interaction
with nonplayer characters. A single adventure represents a
complete story that might be connected to the larger arc of
a campaign. Playing an adventure spans one or more game
sessions—gatherings where the group plays a part of the
adventure over the course of several hours.
A campaign provides the overall structure for your
Pathfinder game. As you prepare for your campaign, you’ll
establish its scope and themes, which you’ll then reinforce
in the adventures and scenes that take place within it.
CAMPAIGN LENGTH
The length of a campaign can range from a few sessions
to many years. Two main factors determine campaign
length: how much time you need to complete the story,
and how much time players want to devote to the game.
