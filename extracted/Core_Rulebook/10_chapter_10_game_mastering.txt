Chapter 10: Game Mastering
As Game Master, you run each session of Pathfinder, providing the link between the players
and the world of the game. It’s up to you to set the scene as the player characters battle
monsters, interact with other people, and explore the world.
COLLABORATION DURING PLAY
As Game Master, you have the final say on how the world
and rules function, and how nonplayer characters act.
This rule’s purpose is to make the game run smoothly,
with one guiding hand ensuring consistency. It’s not
intended to make one player into a dictator over the rest
of the group. Collaboration is vital to roleplaying games!
How you implement collaboration in a game depends
on what your players are interested in. In some groups,
players enjoy adding details to the world and to nonplayer
characters. In others, players want to feel like the world
is outside their control, and the only decisions they get to
make are those made by their own characters. Both are
fun and acceptable ways to play.
You are encouraged to collect input from your players
before you start, asking what storytelling genres they’d
like to emphasize, which areas of the world they want to
play in, the types of enemies they’d like to face, or which
published adventure they want to play. A good campaign
includes some back-and-forth at the beginning as the
players figure out what characters they want to play and
you figure out what sort of adventure to run. The results
can range from building an adventure entirely to fit the
characters to choosing a specific published adventure,
having the players make their characters, and then just
adapting the beginning of that adventure so that all the
player characters have a reason to be involved.
As you play, opportunities to collaborate will occur
again and again. When players throw out suggestions
or come up with specific theories about the events of
the campaign, they’re telling you what they’d like to
see in the game. Try to find ways to incorporate their
suggestions, but with enough of a twist that each still
includes something unexpected.
A single session, or a “one-shot,” is great if your group
is trying out Pathfinder or wants to play a specific short
adventure. This requires a smaller time commitment but
requires the GM to present the events of the game in a way
that is immediately engaging, since there’s less opportunity
for the players to become invested in the story or setting.
If you want to play through a longer campaign, you’ll
need to add some story elements that speak directly to the
characters in your game rather than just to the events of
the adventure. In other words, the characters should have
individual goals in addition to the group’s overall goals.

================================================================================
PAGE 485
================================================================================

You can estimate how long a campaign will take by
looking at the amount of time you actually have to play, or
the number of character levels you intend the characters
to advance. It typically takes three to four sessions for a
group to level up. Since you’ll probably cancel sessions
on occasion, playing once a week for a year results in
roughly a 14-level campaign, playing every 2 weeks for a
year gives you an 8-level campaign, and playing monthly
allows for a 5-level campaign. If you play only once a
month, you might consider holding longer sessions and
using fast advancement (page 509).
It’s entirely okay to have a campaign with an indefinite
length. Many groups play through one adventure and
then decide to take on another. If you run an indefinite
campaign, however, avoid ongoing plots that you can’t
satisfactorily end if the campaign comes to a close after
the next adventure. If you introduce an overwhelmingly
powerful villain who’s crucial to the story but can’t be
stopped until the player characters are 15th level, ending
the campaign at 8th level will feel anticlimactic.
It pays to be conservative when estimating your
campaign length and scope. It’s always tempting to run a
20-level epic campaign with complex, interwoven plots,
but such games can fall apart long before the end if your
group can play only once a month and the players have
other responsibilities.
Expected Duration
Not every campaign ends at the same point. Some
campaigns go all the way to 20th level, ending after the
player characters attain the height of power and confront
the greatest threats any mortal could face. Others end at
a lower level, after the group takes down a major villain
or solves a crucial problem. And still other campaigns
end when players become unable to attend or decide its a
good time to stop playing.
You should have an end point in mind when you start
a campaign. Still, you have to be flexible, since you’re
telling the story alongside other players, and your initial
expectations for the campaign may be proven incorrect.
When you think you’re heading toward a satisfying
conclusion, it’s useful to check in with the other players.
You might say, “I think we have about two sessions left.
Does that work for everyone? Is there any unfinished
business you want to take care of?” This lets you gauge
whether your assumptions match up with the rest of the
group—and make any necessary adjustments.
THEMES
The themes you choose for your campaign are what
distinguish it from other campaigns. They include the
major dramatic questions of your story and the repeated
use of certain environments or creatures, and they can
Core Rulebook
484

PAGE 486
================================================================================

also include embracing a genre beyond traditional high
fantasy. The themes you choose for your campaign also
suggest storyline elements you might use.
A storyline’s themes usually relate to the backstories,
motivations, and flaws of the player characters and villains.
For example, if you’ve chosen revenge as one of the themes
of your game, you might introduce a villain whose quest
for revenge tears his life apart and causes tragic harm
to those around him. If one of the player characters is a
chaotic good believer in liberty and freedom, you might
engage that character by pitting the group against slavers.
Or, you might choose a theme of love, leading to nonplayer
characters involved in doomed romances, seeking to regain
lovers they have lost, or courting the player characters.
Using similar locations and related creatures helps you
form connections between disparate adventures. The
players feel like their characters are becoming experts
negotiating with giants, navigating seaways, battling
devils, exploring the planes, or dealing with whatever
the recurring elements are. For example, you might have
the players explore a frozen tundra early on, then later
travel to an icy plane filled with more difficult challenges
that can be overcome using knowledge they’ve previously
developed. Likewise, hobgoblin soldiers may be tough
enemies for your group at low levels, but as the PCs attain
higher levels and the hobgoblins become mere minions of
another creature, the players feel a sense of progression.
Pathfinder is a fantasy adventure game, but you can shift
your campaign to include elements of other fictional genres.
You might want to infuse your game a with a sense of horror,
reduce the amount of magic and use slow advancement
(page 509) to make it a tale of sword and sorcery, or turn
magic into technology for a steampunk setting.
A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT
The role of Game Master comes with the responsibility of
ensuring you and the rest of the players have a rewarding,
fun time during the game. Games can deal with difficult
subjects and have stressful moments, but fundamentally
Pathfinder is a leisure activity. It can remain so only if the
players follow the social contract and respect one another.
Players with physical or mental disabilities might find
themselves more challenged than abled players. Work
with your players to ensure they have the resources
and support they need. Additionally, be on the lookout
for behavior that’s inappropriate, whether intentional
or inadvertent, and pay careful attention to players’
body language during the game. If you notice a player
becoming uncomfortable, you are empowered to pause
the game, take it in a new direction, privately check in
with your players during or after the session, or take any
other action you think is appropriate.
If a player tells you they’re uncomfortable with
something in the game, whether it’s content you’ve
presented as the GM or another player’s or PC’s actions,
listen carefully to that player and take steps to ensure
they can once again have fun during your game. If you’re
preparing prewritten material and you find a character
or a situation inappropriate, you are fully empowered
to change any details as you see fit. You also have the
authority (and responsibility) to ask players to change
their behavior—or even leave the table—if what they’re
doing is unacceptable or makes others feel uncomfortable.
It’s never appropriate to make the person who is
uncomfortable responsible for resolving a problem. It’s
okay if mistakes happen. What’s important is how you
respond and move forward.
Gaming is for everyone. Never let those acting in bad
faith undermine your game or exclude other players. Your
efforts are part of the long-term process of making games
and game culture welcoming to all. Working together, we
can build a community where players of all identities and
experiences feel safe.
TOOLS FOR RESPONSIBLE PLAY
Consent and comfort are important topics for roleplaying
games, and many designers have created techniques to
help facilitate responsible play. Some methods you can use
are lines and veils, developed by Ron Edwards, and the
X-Card, developed by John Stavropoulos.
Lines and Veils
The terms “line” and “veil” can give your table a common
vocabulary for the concepts described in this section. A
line is a hard limit to the actions players might take, such
as “We’re drawing a line at torture.” The group agrees not
to cross a line and omits that content from the game.
A veil indicates something that shouldn’t be described
in detail. The scene fades to black for a veil, or the group
moves on to discuss a different topic, though whatever the
veil is drawn across still happens. For example, you might
say, “We’ll draw a veil across the scene as those characters
head into the bedroom.”
You might come up with some lines and veils in advance,
but then find more as play continues.
The X-Card
Draw an “X” on a card, and you’ve got an X-Card. Place it on
the table at the start of the session and describe its use to
the players: any player can silently reject content they find
upsetting by tapping the X-Card; whoever’s speaking then
rewinds a bit and continues on, excising the objectionable
content. As with setting the basic guidelines for your
campaign, there are no questions asked, no judgment, and
no argument when someone invokes the X-Card. You can,
however, ask for clarification if you need it, such as “How far
back should I rewind this?” Some groups instead make an
X with their hands, say “Let’s X that out,” or use some other
method. Either way, follow up with the player privately,
after the game, to see if the guidelines need to be revised.

•	 Reprehensible uses of mind-control magic
Villains might engage in such acts, but they won’t happen
“on-screen” or won’t be described in detail. Many groups
choose to not have villains engage in these activities at all,
keeping these reprehensible acts out of mind entirely.
Social Splash Damage
As important as it is to take care of yourself and the other
players in your game, be mindful of your group’s impact
on the other people around you. If you’re playing in a
space that’s not your own, respect your hosts. If you’re
playing in public, consider the comfort of the people
around you, not just what your group is comfortable with.
It’s easy to get caught up in a game, as we get sucked into
the microcosm of an imagined world, but don’t ignore the
real world around you. Be aware when you’re making
too much noise, leaving a mess, alarming passersby with
graphic descriptions of violence, or even just giving the
cold shoulder to curious spectators witnessing RPG play
for the first time.
CHARACTER CREATION
At the outset of a new campaign, the players will create
new player characters. Part of that process involves you
introducing what the campaign will be about and what
types of characters are most appropriate. Work with the
players to determine which rule options are available. The
safest options are the common choices from the Pathfinder
Core Rulebook. If players want to use common options
from other books or uncommon or rare options, through
play, review those options to see if any of them conflict
with the style of campaign you have in mind or might
present strange surprises down the road. It’s usually best to
allow new options, but there’s no obligation to do so. Be as
open as you’re comfortable with.
Preparing an Adventure
An adventure is a self-contained collection of story
elements, characters, and settings that become the basis
for the story you and the other players tell. Think of
the adventure as an outline for your own story. You’ll
have major beats you want to include, some consistent
characters, and themes you want to convey, but all sorts
of things can change during the process of turning the
outline into a completed story.
You might use a published adventure from Paizo or
another company, or you might construct your own
adventure as you prepare for your game sessions.
PUBLISHED ADVENTURES
Prewritten adventures include background information
and nonplayer characters needed for the story, plus all the
locations, maps, and monster groups necessary for both
exploration and encounters. Prewritten adventures can
speed up your preparation, since you can simply read the
Objectionable Content
Before a campaign begins, check in with your players—
as a group or individually—to find out what types of
content they want to allow in the game, and which topics
they would prefer to avoid. Because the story unfolds in
real time, it’s essential that you discuss these topics before
the game starts. These discussions are intended to keep
players safe, and so it’s not okay to ask why someone
wants a type of content banned. If someone wants it
banned, ban it—no questions asked.
It can help to start with a rating, like those used for
movies or video games. Pathfinder games often include
violence and cruelty. What’s the limit on how graphically
these concepts should be described? Can players swear at
the table? Does anyone have phobias they don’t want to
appear in the game, such as spiders or body horror?
After you figure out the limits on objectionable content,
you have four important tasks:
•	 Clearly convey these limits to the other players.
•	 Ensure you and the players abide by the boundaries.
•	 Act immediately if someone becomes uncomfortable
about content during a session, even if it wasn’t
already banned in a prior discussion. Once the issue
is resolved, move on.
•	 Resolve the issue if any player deliberately pushes
these boundaries, tries to find loopholes, tries to
renegotiate the limits, or belittles people for having
a different tolerance to objectionable content.
The Pathfinder Baseline
You might find that your players don’t have much to say
on the topic of objectionable content, and just assume that
general societal mores will keep the most uncomfortable
topics out of the game. That’s not always enough, as that
approach relies on shared assumptions that aren’t always
accurate. The following is a set of basic assumptions that
works for many groups, which you can modify to fit your
preferences and those of the other players.
•	 Bloodshed, injuries, and even dismemberment
might be described. However, excessive descriptions
of gore and cruelty should be avoided.
•	 Romantic and sexual relationships can happen in
the game, but players should avoid being overly
suggestive. Sex always happens “off-screen.”
Because attempts at initiating a relationship
between player characters can be uncomfortably
similar to one player hitting on another, this should
generally be avoided (and is entirely inappropriate
when playing with strangers).
•	 Avoid excessively gross or scatological descriptions.
The following acts should never be performed by
player characters:
•	 Torture
•	 Rape, nonconsensual sexual contact, or sexual threats
•	 Harm to children, including sexual abuse
•	 Owning slaves or profiting from the slave trade

================================================================================

CHARACTERS WITH DISABILITIES
A player might want to create a character with a disability,
or their character might end up with a disability over
the course of play. Work with the player to find ways to
respectfully represent the disability. Conditions such as
blinded and deafened aren’t a good fit for a character
who has been living with a disability long-term. Here are
suggestions for rules you might use for PCs with disabilities.
Blindness or Impaired Vision
A blind character can’t detect anything using vision,
critically fails Perception checks requiring sight, is immune
to visual effects, and can’t be blinded or dazzled. You might
give this character the Blind-Fight feat (page 149) for free.
A character with impaired vision might take a –2 to –4
penalty to vision-based Perception checks. Spectacles or
other corrective devices might reduce or remove this.
Deafness or Being Hard of Hearing
A deaf character can’t detect anything using hearing,
critically fails Perception checks that require hearing, and is
immune to auditory effects. They have enough practice to
supply verbal components for casting spells and command
components for activating magic items, but if they perform
an action they’re not accustomed to that involves auditory
elements, they must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the
action is lost. It’s best to give them the Sign Language feat
for free, and you might give them Read Lips as well (page
266 and 265). You might give one or more other characters
in the group Sign Language for free as well.
A hard-of-hearing character might take a –2 to –4
penalty to Perception checks that are hearing-based.
Corrective devices for hearing are less common than
spectacles are in a typical Pathfinder world.
Missing Limb
Some magic items require certain limbs or other body parts.
It’s fine to allow an alternative form of the item, turning
boots into bracers for a character without legs, for example.
A character with a missing hand or arm might need
to spend 2 actions to Interact with an item that requires
two hands, or otherwise compensate. Using a two-handed
weapon is not possible. A character can acquire a
prosthetic hand or arm to compensate.
Someone missing a foot or leg might take a small
penalty to Speed, but can typically acquire a prosthetic
to compensate. If they have no legs, they might use a
wheelchair, a dependable mount, or levitation or flight magic.
Mental Illness and Chronic Illness
Some disabilities, such as mental illness and chronic
illnesses, are best left to the player to roleplay. Mental illness
is an especially fraught topic, with a history of insensitive
portrayal. Be careful about the intentions of the player and
the impact the presentation might have on other players.
relevant sections of the adventure before a game, and you
don’t have to create everything from scratch. A published
adventure already includes the expected amount of
encounters and treasure, and you can find adventures built
for different character levels to match your group. Reading
a published adventure or running one as your first game
can help you see how adventures are structured, which
makes it easier to write one later if you choose.
Though a published adventure is prewritten, it’s not
set in stone. Changing the details of an adventure to suit
your group isn’t just acceptable, it’s preferred! Use the
backstories and predilections of the player characters to
inform how you change the adventure. This can mean
altering adversaries so they’re linked to the player
characters, changing the setting to a place some of the
player characters are from, or excising particular scenes
if you know they won’t appeal to your players.
CREATING ADVENTURES
Building your own adventure is much more challenging
than using a published one, but it lets you express yourself,
be even more creative, and tailor the game directly to the
players and their characters. Later sections in this chapter
include guidelines for building and running encounters,
placing treasure, and setting appropriately difficult
challenges, all to help you construct your own adventures.
Adventure plotting can start at many different points.
You might begin with a particular antagonist, then
construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme and
leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could start with
an interesting location for exploration, then populate it
with adversaries and challenges appropriate to the setting.
Locations
Memorable settings that include mysterious and fantastical
locations for players to visit can elicit the players’ curiosity.
Exploring each location should be a treat in itself, not
just a chore the players must complete to get from one
fight to the next. As you create a locale, picture it in your
mind’s eye and write down minor details you can include
as you narrate the game. Describing decorations, natural
landmarks, wildlife, peculiar smells, and even temperature
changes make a place feel more real.
Beyond monsters and loot, your locations can include
environment-based
challenges,
from
environmental
conditions like blizzards to puzzles, traps, or other hazards.
These challenges should suit your adventure’s location:
walls of brambles in a castle ruin overrun with vegetation,
pools of acid in a cursed swamp, or magical traps in the
tomb of a paranoid wizard. Rules for environments appear
on page 512, and those for hazards start on page 520.
Encounters
A robust set of encounters forms the backbone of your
adventure. Encounters often feature combat with other
creatures, but they can also include hazards, or you might

================================================================================

create social encounters in which characters duel only
with words. The rules for building encounters appropriate
to your group’s level begin below.
Some adventures have a clear and direct progression,
with encounters occurring at specific times or in a specific
order. Others, such as a dungeon filled with interconnected
rooms the group can investigate in any order, are
nonlinear, and the group can face encounters in any
order—or even avoid them entirely. Most adventures are
somewhere in between, with some keystone encounters
you know the characters will need to contend with, but
others that are optional.
Treasure
Your adventure should give out an amount of treasure
that’s appropriate to the characters’ level. The guidelines
for assigning treasure are on page 508. You can dole out
treasure in all kinds of ways. Treasure could be items carried
by an adversary, rewards from a patron for completing a
mission, or a classic pile of coins and items inside a wooden
chest guarded by a monster. It’s best to spread treasure
throughout an adventure rather than stockpiled in a single
hoard. This gives the players incremental rewards, letting
their characters advance in frequent small steps rather than
giant leaps separated by many hours of play.
BUILDING ENCOUNTERS
The most common type of encounter is a combat
encounter, where the PCs face other creatures. Combat
encounters are strictly governed by rules; the guidelines
that follow will help you build combat encounters that
pose appropriate challenges for your group. Building
hazard encounters works the same way. Social encounters
are more free-form, and are up to you as the GM to design.
To build a combat encounter, first decide how the
encounter fits in the adventure as a whole. Then, estimate
how much of a threat you want the encounter to pose,
using one of five categories below.
Trivial-threat encounters are so easy that the characters
have essentially no chance of losing; they shouldn’t
even need to spend significant resources unless they
are particularly wasteful. These encounters work best
as warm-ups, palate cleansers, or reminders of how
awesome the characters are. A trivial-threat encounter
can still be fun to play, so don’t ignore them just because
of the lack of threat.
Low-threat encounters present a veneer of difficulty
and typically use some of the party’s resources. However,
it would be rare or the result of very poor tactics for the
entire party to be seriously threatened.
Moderate-threat encounters are a serious challenge
to the characters, though unlikely to overpower them
completely. Characters usually need to use sound tactics
and manage their resources wisely to come out of a
moderate-threat encounter ready to continue on and face
a harder challenge without resting.
USING RARITY AND ACCESS
The rarity system has two purposes: to convey how
common or rare certain spells, creatures, or items are in
the game world, and to give you an easy tool to control
the complexity of your game. Uncommon and rare options
aren’t more powerful than other options of their level, but
they introduce complications for certain types of stories,
or are less common in the world. For instance, it might
be more challenging to run a mystery adventure when a
player can cast an uncommon spell such as detect evil.
At the start of the campaign, communicate your
preferred expectations on rarity to the players. Unless
you decide otherwise, the players can choose from any
common options they qualify for, plus any uncommon
options granted by their character choices—primarily
their ancestry and class. By default, a character who
tries hard enough might eventually find an uncommon
option, whereas a rare option is always a special reward.
Beyond that baseline, you can grant access as freely as
you want; some GMs open up all uncommon and rare
options universally. If you’re not sure, just look over any
uncommon or rare elements before you include them as
rewards or otherwise allow a player to acquire them.
Rewards
You can use uncommon and rare rules elements to
reward characters. These still have the same value and
approximate power as any other treasure of the same
Price, but they’re just a bit more special because they hail
from distant lands or have unusual or surprising abilities.
Items are the most likely candidates for uncommon or rare
rewards, but an NPC might teach an uncommon or rare
spell to a PC in gratitude or to help the party prepare for
a certain adversary. You can also improvise extra benefits
based around uncommon or rare items. For instance, if
a PC gains a rare plant with occult uses, you might also
decide that the PC should temporarily get more money if
they use it while Earning Income using Herbalism Lore,
because it enables them to produce novel poultices.
Different Locations
The rarities in this book assume you’re playing in the
Inner Sea region of Golarion, where most Pathfinder
games are set. These rarities are also suitable for most
western medieval fantasy games. However, you might
want to alter the rarities for a campaign set in another
location on Golarion (detailed in Chapter 8), to emphasize
a non-human culture, or to play in a fantasy setting with
different roots, like a wuxia game based on Chinese
culture. These changes most often affect basic items. If
you start your campaign in a dwarven stronghold, for
example, you might make all the weapons with the dwarf
trait common. You should feel free to adjust rarities to
suit your campaign’s theme, but if you do, you should
share your changes with your group.
Core Rulebook
488

PAGE 490
================================================================================

Severe-threat encounters are the hardest encounters
most groups of characters can consistently defeat. These
encounters are most appropriate for important moments in
your story, such as confronting a final boss. Bad luck, poor
tactics, or a lack of resources due to prior encounters can
easily turn a severe-threat encounter against the characters,
and a wise group keeps the option to disengage open.
Extreme-threat encounters are so dangerous that
they are likely to be an even match for the characters,
particularly if the characters are low on resources. This
makes them too challenging for most uses. An extreme-
threat encounter might be appropriate for a fully rested
group of characters that can go all-out, for the climactic
encounter at the end of an entire campaign, or for a group
of veteran players using advanced tactics and teamwork.
XP Budget
Once you’ve selected a threat level, it’s time to build the
encounter. You have an XP budget based on the threat,
and each creature costs some of that budget. Start with
the monsters or NPCs that are most important to the
encounter, then decide how you want to use the rest
of your XP budget. Many encounters won’t match the
XP budget exactly, but they should come close. The XP
budget is based on a group of four characters. If your
group is larger or smaller, see Different Party Sizes below.
Choosing Creatures
In all but the most unusual circumstances, you’ll select
creatures for your encounter that range from 4 levels
lower than the PCs’ level to 4 levels higher (see Table
10–2: Creature XP and Role). Each creature has a part
to play in your encounter, from a lowly lackey to a boss
so mighty it could defeat the entire party single-handedly.
Each creature costs some of the XP from your XP
budget for the encounter, based on its level compared to
the levels of the characters in your party. For instance,
if the PCs are 5th level, a 2nd-level creature is a “party
level – 3” creature, a lackey appropriate for a low-
to-moderate-threat encounter, and it costs 15 XP in an
encounter’s XP budget. Party level is explained in detail
on page 508.
Different Party Sizes
For each additional character in the party beyond the
fourth, increase your XP budget by the amount shown
in the Character Adjustment value for your encounter in
Table 10–1: Encounter Budget. If you have fewer than
four characters, use the same process in reverse: for each
missing character, remove that amount of XP from your
XP budget. Note that if you adjust your XP budget to
account for party size, the XP awards for the encounter
don’t change—you’ll always award the amount of XP
listed for a group of four characters.
It’s best to use the XP increase from more characters to
add more enemies or hazards, and the XP decrease from
fewer characters to subtract enemies and hazards, rather
than making one enemy tougher or weaker. Encounters
are typically more satisfying if the number of enemy
creatures is fairly close to the number of player characters.
Running a Game Session
A campaign happens over a series of sessions. Each session
is usually several hours long, with multiple encounters,
some exploration, and possibly downtime. Your session
can be compared to an episode of a TV show; it should
include some twists, turns, and changes, and end leaving
people excited about what comes next.
PLANNING A SESSION
One of the greatest challenges in gaming is scheduling
a time for everyone to get together and play. Often, this
responsibility falls on you as the GM, since you’re the one
who has to prepare your game between sessions. Many
games have a set schedule, such as once per week, once
every 2 weeks, or once per month. The less frequently
your group meets, the better notes and recaps you’ll need
to keep everyone on the same page.
Plan a time for everybody will arrive, and also try to
set a time when playing the game will begin. This can
make it easier for everyone to finish chatting, catching
up, and eating in a timely fashion so you can start
playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also
fairly important. A typical game session lasts about 4
hours, though some groups hold 2-hour sessions or play
marathon games. Less than 2 hours usually isn’t enough
time to get much done in most Pathfinder campaigns. If
your session will be longer than 2 hours, plan out some
15-minute breaks (in addition to bathroom and beverage
breaks, which players can take as needed).

RUNNING A SESSION
During a session, you’re in charge of keeping the game’s
action moving, managing the different modes of play,
fielding questions, and making rules decisions. You’ll also
want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can end
when most convenient for the group.
You’re the interface between the rules and the
imagined world you and the other players share. They
will ask you questions, and they’ll act based on their own
assumptions. It’s up to you to establish what’s true in the
world, but you don’t do this unilaterally. You’re informed
by the setting’s backstory, your preparations, and the
suggestions and assumptions the other players bring to the
table. Keep in mind that until you announce something,
your own plans are subject to change. For example, if you
originally intended the owner of a tavern to be kindly and
well-intentioned, but a player misreads her and invents
an interesting conspiracy theory regarding her intentions
that sounds fun, you might convert the tavern owner into
an agent of evil after all.
You’ll also determine when PCs and foes need to attempt
checks, as well as the consequences of those rolls. This
comes up most often outside of encounters, as encounters
are more regimented about when checks happen and how
they are resolved. In an encounter, a player can usually
determine their own character’s turn, with you chiming in
only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the
environment requires a character to attempt a check.
STARTING A SESSION
Once everyone is ready, get everyone’s attention and
cover the following topics. These are in a rough order
that you can change based on your group’s style or a
session’s needs.
•	 Recap what happened during the previous sessions.
•	 Establish where the characters are at the beginning
of this session. Have they been resting since their
last challenge? Are they in a hallway, preparing
to raid the next room of a dungeon? Tell players
whether their characters had time to rest or
recover since the last session.
•	 Remind players that they each have 1 Hero Point
at the start of the session (page 507).
•	 Establish goals. The players should have an idea
of what they want to do next. Reestablish any
goals the group already had, then let the players
weigh in on whether these goals still apply, and
on whether there’s anything else they hope
to accomplish in this session.
•	 Commence adventuring! Decide which mode of
play you’re going to start in, then lead off with a
verbal prompt to get the action started. You might
ask a question related to a particular character, have
everyone immediately roll initiative as a monster
attacks, or briefly describe the environment and
sensations that surround the player characters,
allowing them to react.

================================================================================

The Spotlight
As you run the game, keep track of who has the spotlight.
It can be easy to keep attention on the most outgoing
player or character, but you need to check in with all the
players. If a player hasn’t contributed in some time, stop
and ask, “What’s your character doing at this point?” If
the player’s not sure, add a detail or nonplayer character
to the scene that the player might find interesting.
Distractions and Interruptions
Maintaining the players’ attention keeps a game moving
and leads to memorable moments when everyone’s in the
same zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. This
is fine in moderation. Distractions become a problem if
they’re too frequent, as they cause people to miss things
and make misinformed decisions as the session becomes
disconnected. Yet every game includes breaks—sometimes
intentional, sometimes not—and digressions. Finding the
right balance of diversions for your group is essential.
A game is a social gathering, so there’s definitely a place
for conversation that’s not directly related to playing the
game. These interruptions become a problem if they’re too
frequent, or if people are talking over others. If a player
repeatedly interrupts you or other people or undercuts
every crucial moment of the game with a joke, talk to them
about limiting their comments to appropriate times. Often,
all you need to do is hold up your hand or otherwise
indicate that the player is talking out of turn to delay them
until after you or another speaker finishes talking.
Phones and other mobile devices are another major
source of distraction. Banning them entirely is often
impractical—many players use apps to roll dice or manage
their character sheets, or they need to answer texts from
their partner, check in on a work project, or otherwise
stay connected with people who rely on them. However,
you can set ground rules against using a device for
anything that’s not time-sensitive or game-related, such
as refreshing social media, checking the score of a hockey
game, playing a mobile game, or answering a non-urgent
text. You can relax these rules for players when their
characters are “offstage.” If a player’s character isn’t in a
scene, that might be a good time for the player to use a
mobile device.
ADJUDICATING THE RULES
As the GM, you are responsible for solving any rules
disputes. Remember that keeping your game moving is
more important than being 100% correct. Looking up
rules at the table can slow the game down, so in many
cases it’s better to make your best guess rather than scour
the book for the exact rule. (It can be instructive to look
those rules up during a break or after the session, though!)
To make calls on the fly, use the following guidelines,
which are the same principles the game rules are based on.
You might want to keep printouts of these guidelines and
the DC guidelines (page 503) for quick reference.
•	 If you don’t know how long a quick task takes, go
with 1 action, or 2 actions if a character shouldn’t be
able to perform it three times per round.
•	 If you’re not sure what action a task uses, look for
the most similar basic action. If you don’t find one,
make up an undefined action (page XXX) adding
any necessary traits (usually attack, concentrate,
manipulate, or move).
•	 When two sides are opposed, have one roll against
the other’s DC. Don’t have both sides roll (initiative
is the exception to this rule). The character who
rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of
saving throws).
•	 If an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a
+1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty.
•	 If you’re not sure how difficult a significant
challenge should be, use the DC for the party’s level.
•	 If you’re making up an effect, creatures should be
incapacitated or killed on only a critical success
(or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).
•	 If you don’t know what check to use, pick the most
appropriate skill. If no other skill applies to a check
to Recall Knowledge, use an appropriate Lore skill
(usually at an untrained proficiency rank).
•	 Use the characters’ daily preparations as the time
to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.
•	 When
a
character
accomplishes
something
noteworthy that doesn’t have rules for XP, award
them XP for an accomplishment (10 to 30 XP, as
described on page 507).
•	 When the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they
might fail forward, meaning the story moves
OFF-SESSION GAMING
Session play with a full group isn’t the only way to play
Pathfinder. Finding opportunities to expand on the game
outside of its regular schedule can keep your group
engaged between sessions.
You can get together with a single player to run a
mini-session for their character, covering a mission that’s
important to their story but doesn’t concern the rest
of the group. You and the players can work out what
their characters do during solid stretches of downtime
via e-mail or chat messages. You can also give players
opportunities to collaborate on details of the story,
like having a player design a heraldic symbol for the
adventuring group or map out their home base. You might
even decide to award a Hero Point at the next session to
a player for events that happened outside a session.
Some events aren’t suitable for handling outside of
sessions. Any event that strongly affects a character
whose player isn’t present should be handled at the
table when everyone can attend. It’s also helpful to
recap events that took place outside of the session for all
characters so no one feels excluded or lost.

forward with a negative consequence rather than
the failure halting progress entirely.
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
The player characters in your group will at times attempt
tasks that should be easier or harder than the rules or
adventure would otherwise lead you to expect, such
as a PC Gathering Information in their hometown. In
these cases, you can just apply a circumstance bonus or
penalty. Usually, this is +1 or –1 for a minor but significant
circumstance, but you can adjust this bonus or penalty to
+2 or –2 for a major circumstance. The maximum bonus
or penalty, +4 or –4, should apply only if someone has an
overwhelming advantage or is trying something extremely
unlikely but not quite impossible.
You can also add traits to actions. Let’s say that during a
fight, Seelah dips her sword into a brazier of hot coals before
swinging it at an enemy with a weakness to fire. You could
add the fire trait to this attack. A PC getting an advantage
in this way should usually have to use an action to do so,
so Seelah would get the benefit for one attack, but to do it
again she’d need to bury her sword in the coals once more.
INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
You might grant players access to additional rule or
character options. If you feel confident that allowing a
character to take a particular option will be a good addition
to your game, then go for it! If you’re uncertain or worried
about a request, you don’t have to allow it, and it’s your call
to make. However, try to meet players halfway or suggest
alternatives. If you want to allow an option on a trial basis
but are worried it might become a problem later, talk to
the player beforehand and explain that you are tentatively
allowing the option, but might change your mind later,
after you see how the option can be used during play.
Pathfinder Society
Organized play campaigns allow you to play in and run
games all over the world with persistent characters. If you
want to play Pathfinder this way, you can do so through
the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild! Once you go
online to PathfinderSociety.club to make an account, you
can organize games yourself with your friends or join an
existing event.
Pathfinder Society primarily uses 4- to 5-hour adventures
called scenarios. At the start of a session when you’re
running a scenario, you’ll collect your players’ information.
At the end of the adventure, you’ll record the rewards their
characters earn for completing the scenario, all of which
are detailed in the adventure. Once you report the session’s
results online, the rewards become a persistent part of
these characters, even if they play in other games with
other groups. These scenarios include important choices,
and you can report what your group chose—decisions that
will guide the future of the campaign!
PAIZO’S PUBLISHED ADVENTURES
You can purchase the following types of adventures at
paizo.com, your local game store, or many book stores. If
you want to acquire all the adventures in a given line, you
can purchase a subscription at paizo.com.
Pathfinder Adventure Paths
Each monthly volume of a Pathfinder Adventure Path
leads into the next as part of a greater story spanning
multiple volumes. The first volume of each Adventure
Path typically starts at 1st level, and each volume has a
self-contained story that eventually leads to a big climax
at the end of the final volume. Each volume also typically
includes new monsters, rules, and details about the world.
Each Adventure Path has a different theme, and their
settings range across the Inner Sea region and beyond.
Pathfinder Adventures
Pathfinder Adventures are standalone adventures that
cover several levels of play. They’re self-contained and
typically have a unique structure or theme. You can play
through a Pathfinder Adventure on its own or as part of
your ongoing campaign—some make ideal side adventures
for Adventure Paths that have similar themes.
Pathfinder Society Scenarios
Scenarios are the adventures used by the Pathfinder
Society Roleplaying Guild; you can play them as part of
the Pathfinder Society or on your own. Each takes about
4 to 5 hours to run, so you can tell a whole story in a
short amount of time, but they’re also part of a larger
continuity and can be combined together to form the
basis of a longer campaign.
SHARING RESPONSIBILITY
Just because you’re the GM and ostensibly in charge
doesn’t mean you have to do all the extra work to make
the campaign run. Some of the tasks described here, like
scheduling games, taking notes, and giving recaps, can be
delegated to other players. You might also have someone
track initiative or the Hit Points of the PCs’ foes for you
in encounters, or even run those foes if you have a large
group and someone would rather do that than control
a character of their own. It’s also great when someone
else can host a session, provide snacks for the group, or
take on other responsibilities that aren’t directly related
to the game.
It’s best to figure out a schedule of responsibilities
when you’re first setting up a game. Ask the players
what they’re willing to take on. If you start to feel
overwhelmed partway through a campaign, you can
revisit the topic and try out new options until you find a
setup that’s comfortable.
Core Rulebook
492

PAGE 494
================================================================================

Encounters take place in real time or slower, and they
involve direct engagement between players and enemies,
potential allies, or each other. Combat and direct social
interaction usually take place in encounter mode.
Exploration is the connective tissue of an adventure,
and it is used whenever characters are exploring a place
where there’s danger or uncertainty, such as an unfamiliar
city or a dungeon. In exploration mode, characters
aren’t in immediate peril, but they must still be on
their toes. Exploration and encounters are collectively
called adventuring.
When the party isn’t adventuring, the characters are in
downtime. This mode covers most of a normal person’s
life, such as mundane, day-to-day tasks and working
toward long-term goals.
Encounters
Encounter mode is the most structured mode of play,
and you’ll mostly be following the rules presented in
Chapter 9 to run this mode. Because you usually call for
initiative during exploration before transitioning into
an encounter, guidelines for initiative order appear on
page 498 in the discussion of exploration mode. Rules
for building combat encounters appear on page 488.
Stakes: Moderate to high. Encounters always have
significant stakes, and they are played in a step-by-step
time frame to reflect that.
Time Scale: Encounter mode is highly structured and
proceeds in combat rounds for combat encounters,
while other sorts of encounters can have rounds
of any length. In combat, 1 minute consists of 10
rounds, where each combat round is 6 seconds long,
but you might decide a verbal confrontation proceeds
in minute-long or longer rounds to give each speaker
enough time to make a solid point.
Actions and Reactions: In combat encounters, each
participant’s turn is broken into discrete actions, and
participants can use reactions when their triggers occur.
Reactions can occur in social situations, though their
triggers are usually more descriptive and less tactical.
CHOOSING ADVERSARIES’ ACTIONS
Players often coordinate and plan to be as efficient as
possible, but their adversaries might not. As the GM,
you’re roleplaying these foes, and you decide their tactics.
Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like
flanking or focusing on a single target. But you should
remember that they also react based on emotions and
make mistakes—perhaps even more than the player
characters do.
When selecting targets or choosing which abilities to
use, rely on the adversaries’ knowledge of the situation,
not your own. You might know that the cleric has a high
Will save modifier, but a monster might still try to use a
fear ability on her. That doesn’t mean you should play
adversaries as complete fools; they can learn from their
mistakes, make sound plans, and even research the player
characters in advance.
Adversaries usually don’t attack a character who’s
knocked out. Even if a creature knows a fallen character
might come back into the fight, only the most vicious
creatures focus on helpless foes rather than the more
immediate threats around them.
Running adversaries is a mix of being true to the
creature and doing what’s best for the drama of the
game. Think of your encounter like a fight scene in a
movie or novel. If the fighter taunts a fire giant to draw
its attention away from the fragile wizard, the tactically
sound decision is for the giant to keep pummeling the
wizard. But is that the best choice for the scene? Perhaps
everyone will have more fun if the giant redirects its ire to
the infuriating fighter.
BYPASSED ENCOUNTERS
What happens if you’ve planned a fight or challenge
and the PCs find a way to avoid it entirely? This could
leave them behind in XP or cause them to miss important
information or treasure.
In the case of XP, the guidelines are simple: If the
player characters avoided the challenge through smart
tactical play, a savvy diplomatic exchange, clever use of
magic, or another approach that required ingenuity and
planning, award them the normal XP for the encounter.
If they did something that took only moderate effort
or was a lucky break, like finding a secret passage and
using it to avoid a fight, award them XP for a minor or
moderate accomplishment. In an adventure that’s more
free-form, like a sprawling dungeon with multiple paths,
there might be no reward for bypassing an encounter,
because doing so was trivial.
You’ll have to think on your feet if information or items
get skipped when players bypass encounters. First, look
for another reasonable place in the adventure to place the
information or item. If it makes sense, move the original
encounter to another part of the adventure and give the
PCs a major advantage for bypassing the encounter in
the first place.
Running Modes of Play
Pathfinder sessions are divided into three different modes of play: encounters, exploration,
and downtime. Each mode represents different kinds of situations, with specific stakes
and time scales, and characters can use different sorts of actions and reactions in each.

================================================================================

ENDING ENCOUNTERS
A combat encounter typically ends when all the creatures
on one side are killed or knocked unconscious. Once
this happens, you can stop acting in initiative order.
The surviving side then has ample time to ensure that
everyone taken out stays down. However, you might need
to keep using combat rounds if any player characters are
near death, clinging to a cliff, or in some other situation
where every moment matters for their survival.
You can decide a fight is over if there’s no challenge
left, and the player characters are just cleaning up the last
few weak enemies. However, avoid doing this if any of
the players still have inventive and interesting things they
want to try or spells they’re concentrating on—ending
an encounter early is a tool to avoid boredom, not to
deny someone their fun. You can end a fight early in
several ways: the foes can surrender, an adversary can die
before its Hit Points actually run out, or you can simply
say the battle’s over and that the PCs easily dispatch
their remaining foes. In this last case, you might ask, “Is
everyone okay if we call the fight?” to make sure your
players are on board.
One side might surrender when almost all its
members are defeated or if spells or skills thoroughly
demoralize them. Once there’s a surrender, come out
of initiative order and enter into a short negotiation.
These conversations are really about whether the
winners will show mercy to the losers or just kill
or otherwise get rid of them. The surrendering side
usually doesn’t have much leverage in these cases, so
avoid long back-and-forth discussions.
Fleeing Enemies
Fleeing enemies can be a problem. Player characters
often want to pursue foes that flee because they think an
enemy might return as a threat later on. Avoid playing
this out move by move, as it can easily bog down the
game. If every adversary is fleeing, forgo initiative
order and give each PC the option to pursue any one
fleeing foe. Each PC can declare one action, spell, or
other ability to use to try to keep up. Then, compare the
PC’s Speed to that of the target, assess how much the
pursuer’s chosen spell or ability would help, and factor
in any abilities the quarry has that would aid escape.
If you determine that the pursuer catches up, go back
into combat with the original initiative order. If not, the
quarry escapes for now.
If the PCs decide to flee, it’s usually best to let them do
so. Pick a particular location and allow them to escape
once they all reach it. However, if they’re encumbered
or otherwise slowed down, or if enemies have higher
Speeds and a strong motive to pursue, you might impose
consequences upon PCs who flee.
SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS
Most conversations play best as free-form roleplaying,
with maybe one or two checks for social skills involved.
Sometimes, though, a tense situation or crucial parlay
requires a social encounter that uses initiative, much like
a combat encounter. As with any other encounter, the
stakes of a social encounter need to be high! A failed social
encounter could mean a character is imprisoned or put to
death, a major rival becomes a political powerhouse, or a
key ally is disgraced and ostracized.
Using the structure of an encounter is helpful because
it makes the timing clearer than in free-form play, and
each character feels like they’re contributing. When
running a social encounter, establish the stakes up
front, so the players know the consequences of success
or failure and the circumstances that will cause the
encounter to end.
You have much more flexibility in how you run a
social encounter than in a combat encounter. Extending
the length of rounds beyond 6 seconds, allowing more
improvisation, and focusing less on special attacks and
spells all differentiate a social encounter from a combat
one. In most cases, you don’t need to worry about
character’s movements, nor do you need a map. Some
examples of social encounters include:
•	 Proving someone’s innocence in front of a judge.
•	 Convincing a neighboring monarch to help defend
against an invasion.
•	 Besting a rival bard in a battle of wits.
•	 Exposing a villain’s deception before a noble court.
Initiative and Actions
Initiative in a social encounter typically has characters
rolling Society or a Charisma-based skill, such as
PLAYING WITHOUT A GRID
The Pathfinder rules are built to play combat encounters
on a 1-inch grid, but you can play without a grid or map.
In what’s traditionally called the “theater of the mind,”
you and other players imagine the locations of the
combatants and the environment. In this style of play,
you’ll frequently need to make judgment calls. These are
usually simple, like “Can I see the ogre from where I’m
standing?” or “Can I get to the ogre with one Stride?” It’s
often best to have a player tell you what they want to do,
such as “I want to cross the beam to get to the ogre and
attack it.” Then, you tell the player how that breaks down
into actions, like “You’ll need to spend one action and
succeed at an Acrobatics check, then Stride to get close
enough, then you’ll have one action left for a Strike.”
When preparing encounters, avoid using lots of
difficult terrain, cover, or other battlefield challenges
that work better on a grid. Also, be more lenient with
combat tactics like flanking. You won’t have a way to
measure flanking, but the rules expect melee characters
like rogues to often get into a flanking position—often,
two characters ganging up in melee is enough to count.
Core Rulebook
494

PAGE 496
================================================================================

Diplomacy or Deception. As with other encounters, a
character’s approach to the conflict determines which
skill they’ll roll. On a character’s turn, they typically get
to attempt one roll, usually by using a skill action. Let
the player roleplay what their character says and does,
then determine what they’ll roll. Allow them to use any
abilities or spells that might help them make their case,
though keep in mind that when most people see the visual
signs of a spell being cast, they think someone is using
magic to try to influence or harm them, and they have a
negative reaction.
Good social encounters include an opposition.
This can be direct, such as a rival who argues against
the characters’ case, or passive, such as a mob that
automatically becomes more unruly as each round
passes. Give the opposition one or more positions in the
initiative order so you can convey what it is doing. You
can create game statistics for the opposition, especially if
it’s an individual, but in situations like that of the unruly
mob, you might need nothing more than establish a set
of increasingly difficult DCs.
Measuring Success and Progress
You’ll need to decide how to measure the characters’
success in social encounters, because there’s no AC
to target or HP to whittle down. Chapter 4 includes
guidance on setting DCs for social skill actions, often
using a target’s Will DC. If you need a DC for people who
don’t have stats, such as a crowd or an NPC for whom
you haven’t already generated statistics, use the guidelines
on setting DCs, found on page 503. You can either pick a
simple DC or use a level-based DC, estimating a level for
the subject or how challenging it should be to sway them.
The attitude conditions—hostile, unfriendly, indifferent,
friendly, and helpful—provide a useful way to track the
progress of a social encounter. Use these to represent
the attitude of an authority, a crowd, a jury, or the like.
A typical goal for a social encounter is to change the
attitude of a person or group to helpful so they assist you,
or calming a hostile group or person to defuse a situation.
Try to give the players a clear idea of how much they’ve
progressed as the encounter proceeds.
Another option is to track the number of successes
or failures the characters accrue. For instance, you
might need to trick four guards into leaving their posts,
and count each successful attempt to Lie or Create a
Diversion toward a total of four necessary successes.
You can combine these two methods; if the PCs need a
group of important nobles to vote their way, the goal of
the encounter might be to ensure that a majority of the
nobles have a better attitude toward the PCs than they
have of a rival—all within a limited time frame.

================================================================================

Consequences
When you set stakes at the start of a social encounter,
give an idea of the consequences. Beyond whatever
narrative benefits player characters might gain, a social
encounter usually includes an XP award. Because these are
encounters along the same lines as combat encounters, they
grant a sizable amount of XP, typically that of a moderate
accomplishment, or even a major accomplishment if the
encounter was the culmination of long-term plans or a
significant adversary got their comeuppance.
The outcome of a social encounter should direct
the story of the game. Look for repercussions. Which
NPCs might view the PCs more favorably now? Which
might hold a grudge or formulate a new plan? A social
encounter can seal the fate of an NPC and end their story,
but this isn’t true for player characters. Even if something
looks truly dire for them, such as a death sentence, the
social encounter isn’t the end—there’s still time for
desperate heroics or a twist in the story.
Exploration
Exploration mode is intentionally less regimented than
encounters. As a result, during exploration you’ll be making
judgment calls on just about everything that happens.
Fundamentally, exploration is all about rewarding the
PCs for learning about their surroundings. To facilitate
this, it’s especially important to have and convey a clear
mental picture of the group’s surroundings. You’ll be
better able to keep track of where the players are and
describe the sights, sounds, and other sensations of their
adventuring locales. Encourage the players to have their
characters truly explore, and reward their curiosity. The
things they try to do in exploration mode show you what
they’re interested in and what they consider important.
As you play, you’ll get a good feel for the aspects of
exploration that intrigue certain players, and you can add
more of those things to your adventures or emphasize
these points in published adventures.
Stakes: Low to moderate. Exploration mode should be
used when there’s some amount of risk, but no immediate
danger. The PCs might be in an environment where they’re
likely to face monsters or hazards, but they usually stay
in exploration mode until they enter a fight or engage in
some other direct interaction.
Time Scale: When the PCs are in exploration mode,
time in the game world passes much faster than
real-world time at the table, so it’s rarely measured out
to the second or the minute. You can speed up or slow
down how quickly things are happening as needed. If it’s
important to know exactly how much time is passing,
you can usually estimate time spent in exploration mode
to 10-minute increments.
Actions and Reactions: Though exploration isn’t
broken into rounds, exploration activities assume the
PCs are spending part of their time using actions, such as
Seeking or Interacting. If they have specific actions they
want to use, they should ask; you can decide whether the
actions apply and whether to switch to encounter mode
for greater detail. PCs can use any relevant reactions that
come up during exploration mode.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
In exploration mode, each player who wants to do
something beyond just traveling chooses an exploration
activity for their character. The most common activities
are Avoid Notice, Detect Magic, Hustle, and Search,
though there are many options available. While players
usually hew close to these default activities, there’s no
need for them to memorize the exploration activities and
use them exactly. Instead, allow each player to describe
what their character is doing. Then, as the GM, you can
determine which activity applies. This also means you
determine how an activity works if the character’s actions
differ from those on the list.
The following sections discuss exploration activities that
require adjudication from you beyond the guidelines for
players detailed on pages 479–480 of Chapter 9.
Detect Magic
This activity doesn’t enable characters to automatically
find every single magical aura or object during travel.
Hazards that require a minimum proficiency can’t be
found with detect magic, nor can illusions of equal or
higher level than the spell.
When characters find something magical using this
activity, let them know and give them the option to stop
and explore further or continue on. Stopping brings
you into a more roleplay-heavy scene in which players
can search through an area, assess different items, or
otherwise try to figure out the source of the magic and
what it does. Continuing on might cause the group to
miss out on beneficial magic items or trigger a magic trap.
Follow the Expert
A skilled character can help out less skilled allies who
choose to Follow the Expert. This is a good way to help a
character with a low Stealth modifier sneak around, get a
character with poor Athletics up a steep cliff, and so on.
Usually, a character who is Following the Expert can’t
perform other exploration activities or follow more than
one person at a time.
Investigate
As with Searching or Detecting Magic, the initial result
of Investigating is usually enough to give the investigator
a clue that leads into a more thorough examination, but
it rarely gives all possible information. For instance, a
character might note that the walls of a dungeon are
covered with Abyssal writing, but they would need
to stop to read the text or determine that it’s written
in blood.

================================================================================

Search
With a successful Perception check while Searching, a
character notices the presence or absence of something
unusual in the area, but it doesn’t provide a comprehensive
catalog of everything there. Instead, it gives a jumping-off
point for closer inspection or an encounter. For instance,
if an area has both a DC 30 secret door and a DC 25 trap,
and a Searching character got a 28 on their Perception
check, you would tell the player that their character
noticed a trap in the area, and you’d give a rough idea
of the trap’s location and nature. The party needs to
examine the area more to learn specifics about the trap,
and someone would need to Search again to get another
chance to find the secret door.
If an area contains many objects or something that will
take a while to search (such as a cabinet full of papers),
Searching would reveal the cabinet, but the PCs would have
to examine it more thoroughly to check the papers. This
usually requires the party to stop for a complete search.
You roll a secret Perception check for a Searching
character to detect any secrets they pass that’s in a
place that stands out (such as near a door or a turn in
a corridor), but not one that’s in a more inconspicuous
place (like a random point in a long hallway) unless they
are searching particularly slowly and meticulously.
SETTING A PARTY ORDER
In exploration mode, it often matters which characters
are in the front or back of the party formation. Let the
players decide among themselves where in the group their
characters are while exploring. This order can determine
who gets attacked first when enemies or traps threaten
from various directions. It’s up to you to determine the
specifics of who gets targeted based on the situation.
When you come out of exploration mode, the group
usually remains in the same general formation. Decide
the PCs’ exact positions, with their input, if you’re
moving to a grid (as usually happens at the start of a
combat encounter). If they come out of exploration mode
on their own terms, they can move around as they see fit.
For example, if they detect a trap and the rogue starts
attempting to disarm it, the other characters can move to
whatever locations they think are safe.
ADVERSE TERRAIN AND WEATHER
Exploration gets slower when the party faces dense
jungles, deep snow, sandstorms, extreme heat, or similar
difficult conditions. You decide how much these factors
impact the characters’ progress. The specific effects of
certain types of terrain and weather are described starting
on page 512.
