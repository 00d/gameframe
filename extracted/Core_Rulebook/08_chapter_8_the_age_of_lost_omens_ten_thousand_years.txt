Chapter 8:
The Age of Lost Omens
Ten thousand years ago, the world of Golarion came close to ending. Earthfall, as this
extinction-level event came to be known, saw the world pummeled by a shower of
falling stars that sank continents, hollowed out new seas, and destroyed civilizations. It
took centuries for the world to recover, and centuries more for society to rebuild, but
recover it did.

Beyond the Inner Sea
The Inner Sea region consists of the continent of Avistan
and the northern portion of the continent of Garund,
but it is only one part of a much larger world. Garund
itself extends further south, and its southern reaches are
home to several unique ancestries and cultures. As one
travels east from the Inner Sea, the vast expanse of the
continent of Casmaron stretches beyond the horizon.
With the immense inland Castrovin Sea at its heart,
Casmaron is the largest of Golarion’s continents and
home to some of its oldest and most successful empires.
Farther east of Casmaron lies the continent of Tian Xia,
a region often called the Dragon Empires. The northern
section of Tian Xia connects to Golarion’s northernmost
continent, a frozen reach known as the Crown of the
World. This continent forms a bridge between Tian Xia
and Avistan over the north pole. South of Tian Xia lies
the mysterious continent of Sarusan, of which little is
known due to the powerful storms and vexing currents
that shroud its shores. Heading west from the Inner Sea
region, sailors encounter the shattered remnants of lost
Azlant, a ruined continent that hosted one of humanity’s
first empires until it was destroyed during Earthfall.
Sailing farther west from these ruins eventually leads
to the shores of Arcadia, a land with unusual magical
traditions and powerful nations of its own. And beneath
all of these lands, carved into the planet’s very crust, lie
the twisting tunnels of the tripartite underground realm
known collectively as the Darklands, which houses great
horrors and dangers but equally great opportunities for
triumph and treasure.
In addition, Golarion is but one of 11 worlds that
orbit its sun. To the vast majority of the planet’s
denizens, the other 11 worlds are little more than points
of light in the sky, but these worlds are not so distant as
one might expect. The planets of Akiton and Castrovel
are Golarion’s closest neighbors. Travelers from both
have visited and in some cases settled on Golarion,
most notably elves, who originally hail from Castrovel.
Even the farthest planet, remote Aucturn, has influenced
Golarion, with its alien inhabitants exerting a sinister
touch on the world that recently put the entire planet
in peril. The wise thus do not discount the dangers
and wonders that dwell on other planets of Golarion’s
solar system.
The Great Beyond
Countless planets lie beyond Golarion’s solar system, but
even these myriad worlds of the universe, known as the
Material Plane, are but a fragment compared to what
lies in the multiverse beyond. Other planes of existence
and strange dimensions wrap this reality in a series of
layered, nested spheres, known collectively as the Great
Beyond. This model of reality is as much a metaphor
for concepts that mortal minds have difficulty grasping
as a physical description, for within the Great Beyond,
anything is possible.

Inner Sphere
The core of the multiverse is the Inner Sphere. Here, the vast expanse of the Material
Plane and its countless worlds can be found. The Elemental Planes surround the
Material Plane like layered shells, with the Plane of Air on the inside, transitioning
to the Plane of Water, then to the Plane of Earth, and finally to the Plane of Fire,
in something of a reversal of order in which these elements most often appear on
habitable planets. The planes of Positive and Negative Energy are also within the
Inner Sphere, their opposing nodes of life and death, creation and destruction, light
and dark forming the start and the end of all existence.
Outer Sphere
The scope of reality within the Outer Sphere is difficult to grasp. Here the gods dwell
and the souls of the dead gather to be judged by the goddess of the dead, Pharasma, atop
the spire in the realm that is her Boneyard. Anything is possible in the Outer Sphere,
and its realms are as much manifestations of philosophies and belief as anything else.
From the towering mountain of Heaven to the endless gulfs of the demon-held Abyss,
be it the agonizing pit of Hell or the boundless wonders of Elysium, all of reality is
represented within the Outer Sphere. Over time this reality erodes away and is recycled
back into the raw material of life within the Positive Energy Plane.
other planes and Dimensions
Some planes exist in the same physical or metaphysical space as others, overlapping
these other planes like overlays of reality. They include the ghost world of the
Ethereal Plane, which overlays the Inner Sphere; the dizzying vastness of the Astral
Plane, which overlays almost all reality and fills the seemingly endless gulf between
the Inner Sphere and the Outer Sphere; and the fey-haunted First World and the
sinister Shadow Plane, which each overlay the Material Plane. Stranger reaches of
the Great Beyond exist as well; some, such as the Dreamlands, are visited often (if
accidentally), while others, such as the enigmatic Dimension of Time, are visited
rarely, if ever. In all cases these dimensions cannot be accessed by normal means, and
each has their own method of entry and exit.
The Inner Sea Region
Although infinite opportunities for adventure await on other continents, worlds, and
planes, the Inner Sea region is the focus of the Pathfinder campaign setting. With
dozens of nations, empires, frontiers, and wildlands, this region presents a huge range
of opportunities for heroism and villainy, exploration and adventure!
The following pages break down the Inner Sea region into 10 separate regions, each
with its own themes. Only a brief overview of each region is presented here—enough
to establish the setting and whet the imagination. If you’re interested in exploring
Golarion and the Inner Sea region more, see the Pathfinder World Guide, Pathfinder
Adventures, and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes. Adventure paths present not only
in-depth material about the region, but also full-length campaigns whose adventures
bring a brand-new group of heroes all the way to the height of power!
The year in the Inner Sea region is 4719 Absalom Reckoning (ar). As the calendar
advances in the real world, time also progresses for Golarion. The Pathfinder Core
Rulebook was first published in the year 2019, with the Inner Sea region’s corresponding
year ending in the same two final digits. Golarion’s history is expansive, but two of the
most significant events to shape the world occurred in –5293 ar, when Earthfall nearly
brought an end to the world, and in 4606 ar, when Aroden, the god of humanity, died,
and prophecies the world over began to fail, beginning the Age of Lost Omens.
The map on page 416 depicts the Inner Sea region, further subdivided into the 10
subregions explored on the following pages. The borders of these regions are thematic
rather than political. For an in-depth exploration of the Inner Sea region and its dozens
of nations and wildlands, see the Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide.
TIME
Like Earth, Golarion spins on
its axis once roughly every 24
hours. A week has 7 days and
a year has 52 weeks. To keep
the calendar synchronized
with the astronomical year, an
extra leap day is tacked on to
the second month of the year
every 4 years.
MONTHS AND DAYS
The names of the months of
the year are as follows in the
Inner Sea region:
Abadius ( January)
Calistril (February)
Pharast (March)
Gozran (April)
Desnus (May)
Sarenith ( June)
Erastus ( July)
Arodus (August)

At the heart of the Inner Sea stands the Isle of Kortos,
raised from the waters thousands of years ago as
Aroden’s first deific act. This amazing feat marks the
dawn of the Age of Enthronement and the first year of
the Absalom Reckoning calendar. The city of Absalom
itself, the largest in the Inner Sea region, sprawls on the
southern shore of this isle, and at the city’s heart stands
the legendary Starstone Cathedral. Within the walls of
this structure, the Starstone ever waits to test its next
supplicants—the few mortals who pass this mystic test
become gods themselves. This has made Absalom an
oft-besieged metropolis, but in its nearly 5,000 years, it
has never once fallen.
Absalom, called by many the City at the Center of the
World, boasts a population of over 300,000, and its culture
is a true melting pot in both ancestry and belief. Even the
city’s architecture reflects this, as one might expect of a
settlement of its age. From the towering and majestic
temples of the Ascendant Court to the close-packed
shops and guildhalls of the Petal District and the sagging
shanties in the Puddles, Absalom’s neighborhoods never
fail to present a memorable skyline. Many world-reaching
organizations were born in Absalom, notably the
Pathfinder Society (page 436).
The Isle of Kortos, also known as Starstone Isle, has
a similarly diverse ecosystem. The verdant forests and
grasslands of the west provide many of the resources
Absalom needs, but to the east, the rugged stony desert
known as the Scrape, the dangerous Riven Hills, and
the newly formed necromantic wasteland known as the
Tyrant’s Grasp present far harsher climates. The Isle
of Erran, just north of Starstone Isle, hosts the second-
largest city in the area, Escadar. A rough seaport with
more than its share of shady dealings and dangerous
types, Escadar also hosts large shipyards and maintains
a strong navy that helps to keep the surrounding waters
of the Inner Sea safe. A number of smaller islands also
skirt the coast of the Isle of Kortos—some barren, some
serving as hideouts for criminals and outcasts.
Rising from the center of the Isle of Kortos are the
Kortos Mounts, a short but rugged range of tors that
have, over the years, been ruled by minotaurs, harpies,
dragons, and worse. A few treacherous passes allow
travel through the mountains, but with the northern
shore of the Isle of Kortos being dominated by the soggy
tangles of Dunmire, these northern reaches offer little to
draw anyone other than bandits and adventurers into
these still-untamed lands.

================================================================================

Far to the north of Absalom sprawl the Broken Lands,
nations and wildernesses united in their shared stature
as fractured regions—places where life itself has taken
a blow and the struggle to survive is simply part of
daily reality. Not all of the Broken Lands are constantly
fraught with peril, but regardless of where one might
settle down in these parts’ tumultuous times, danger is
rarely far from home.
In some cases, the breaks are political. In the northeast,
the nation of Brevoy has hung on the edge of civil war
for many years, as the long-running feud between the
traditional noble houses of Issia and the mercenary
swordlords of Rostland maintain an ongoing state of
tension that may be nearing a breaking point. But in the
case of the oft-contested River Kingdoms, these political
breaks have reached something of a draw, for here it is
said that anyone might become the ruler of a nation—if
they have the tenacity to seize the reins of rule.
Elsewhere in the Broken Lands, the fractures are more
spiritual. Razmiran, for example, is ruled by the living
god Razmir, who demands the worship of all who dwell
within his nation’s borders and brooks no competition
of faith. His priests act as police throughout the land,
brutally enforcing their deity’s laws. To the north in
Mendev, these spiritual breaks are less obvious; this
land struggles to reclaim its heritage in the wake of a
century of occupation by a crusading force that, until a
few years ago, stood as a bulwark against the demons
who ruled the lands across the river to the west.
These western lands are truly broken, in a physical
sense, for in the chaotic times at the dawn of the Age
of Lost Omens, powerful agents of the demon lord
Deskari tore a hole in reality. The resulting wound in the
landscape allowed legions of demons to pour through
and devastate the lands once known as Sarkoris.
Although heroes of the Fifth Crusade recently defeated
Deskari and closed the rift, these lands are still known
as the Worldwound. The main threat has been quelled,
but demons still inhabit the region, and the blighted
landscape struggles to return to normal.
Perhaps the strangest of the Broken Lands lie near
its heart. The rugged hills and plains of Numeria are
home to many Kellid clans. However, in the distant
past, the crash of a scientifically advanced starship
brought strange aliens, mechanical monstrosities, and
technological wonders to Golarion, but its fiery arrival
left large reaches of the surrounding land blighted and
blasted even to this day.

The heart of the continent of Avistan has rotted.
This region is dominated by Lake Encarthan, a large
inland sea that was—until recently—a well-traveled hub
for trade. To the southwest stands the militaristic nation
of Molthune, which had long engaged in an intermittent
war against its northern neighbor, Nirmathas, a wooded
nation populated by folk who take their freedom
seriously. An uprising of hobgoblins took advantage of
this conflict, and while hostilities have since abated, the
two nations now share their borders with a third: the
newborn hobgoblin nation Oprak.
North of these war-torn nations lie two other lands
equally forged in the crucible of conflict. Until recently,
the paladins and protectors of the small but strong
nation of Lastwall stood fast against invasions from
orcs, undead, and the like. The wild and rugged Hold of
Belkzen, meanwhile, has long been held by those orcs,
ever since they were driven up from the Darklands below
by the dwarves during their Quest for Sky thousands of
years ago.
Still farther to the north is the nation of Ustalav,
a collection of counties each beset with its own
manifestation of horror and fear, ranging from the
nightmarishly cosmic to the dreadfully infernal.
It was from Ustalav that one of the greatest threats to the
Inner Sea region emerged. The ancient lich Tar-Baphon—
known as the Whispering Tyrant—has been defeated
twice in the distant past—once by Aroden and once by
the heroes of the Shining Crusade, but he has never been
truly destroyed. When the magical seals that kept him
imprisoned below the ominous tower of Gallowspire
were finally sundered in 4719 ar, Tar-Baphon emerged,
bringing with him devastation on such a scale that
the one-time nation of Lastwall, which bore the brunt
of his return to the world, has been utterly scoured. It
exists now only as the Gravelands—the nation that once
stood watch over undead uprisings now consigned to an
undeath of its own. While heroes temporarily thwarted
the Whispering Tyrant’s immediate plans shortly after he
emerged, the lich remains an active menace.
The Whispering Tyrant now rules a kingdom of the
undead on the aptly named Isle of Terror in the center
of Lake Encarthan. The nations lining Lake Encarthan’s
shores have all suffered to varying degrees under the
Whispering Tyrant’s renewed influence, and some are
pursuing unlikely alliances to resist him. The lich is
gathering his resources on the Isle of Terror, and none
can say where or when he will strike next.

================================================================================

Trade and travel rule the pathways of the so-called
Golden Road, known for its shining sands and economic
strength. Much of this region consists of sprawling desert
wilderness, but this does not mean that the Golden
Road is sparse in population. Coastlines and rivers
serve as the lifeblood of this region, and some caravans
brave the heat and dangers of the desert to trade across
northern Garund. Some of the oldest nations in the
Inner Sea region command this region, and ancient lore
and valuable treasures can be found amid the shifting
sands and storied cities.
The largest of these cities is the cosmopolitan
Katapesh, where mercantilism is overseen by a strange
group known as the Pactmasters. Much of the trade
in Katapesh is in goods that can be freely exported or
imported from throughout the Inner Sea region, but
the city does just as much business in avenues normally
regulated to the black markets of other societies.
Qadira’s cities may not be as individually large as
Katapesh, but the nation’s economy is perhaps the
strongest. It’s certainly the oldest in the region, with
support from the long-established Padishah Empire of
Kelesh to the east. This, coupled with the church of
Sarenrae—perhaps the nation’s most successful cultural
export to the rest of the Inner Sea region—has secured
Qadira’s status as one of the most important centers of
influence on the Golden Road.
To the west, the five city-states of Thuvia control
a legendary artifact called the sun orchid elixir, which
grants near-immortality to those who consume it. This
treasured commodity is the keystone of Thuvia’s place in
the Golden Road. Further west, the nation of Rahadoum
is perhaps the weakest mercantile link, but the fact that
this society has eschewed the worship of gods to place
its faith in the industry and talent of mortals alone gives
the nation its own compelling draw.
At the center of the Golden Road lies mighty Osirion,
one of the oldest nations of the Inner Sea region. While
Osirion was for a time ruled by Qadira, the legacies and
monuments of its early days still stand tall and are an
indisputable and iconic source of pride and identity to its
people. The influence of Osirion’s artisans, philosophers,
and spellcasters has spread far and wide, particularly via
the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, far to the north in
Ustalav, and the faith of Nethys, whose not-so-humble
beginnings as a mortal wizard can be traced to the very
beginning of Osirion’s history during the ancient Age
of Destiny.

From fleets of pirates united under the Hurricane
Queen of the Shackles to an ancient, subaquatic empire
of shapechanging monsters led by the sinister veiled
masters, the High Seas of Golarion present dangers
both above and below the waves. Yet they also serve as
important trade routes, with merchant ships traveling
the waters to link powerful nations at opposite ends of
continents. Sea captains brave the dangers of the High
Seas hoping to partake in the fortunes to be made in
trade, linking the ports of the Inner Sea itself to those
on the shores of the Arcadian Ocean from the Mwangi
Expanse to the Saga Lands.
Piracy is one of the greatest dangers facing travel on
the High Seas. The immense volcanic archipelago known
as the Shackles serves as a haven for these pirates, with
their Hurricane Queen providing just enough structure
to keep them from going at each other’s throats. A great
diversity of monsters and threats populate these islands,
and the local pirates know which are safe and which to
avoid. North of the Shackles lies Mediogalti Island. While
its only significant port, Ilizmagorti, is a known safe
harbor for pirates, it is the presence of the infamous Red
Mantis assassins who rule the isle that gives this region
its greatest infamy.
Other ports present their own complications. The
port-city of Promise on the remote isle of Hermea a few
hundred miles west of Avistan rewards well those who
can negotiate the privilege of trade, but such honors are
hard won, for the dragon who rules this closed society
does not allow just anyone to visit. Rumors of what goes
on beyond Promise’s dock district range from tales of a
perfect society to those of an oppressive government that
affords no free will. Farther to the north, the elves of the
Mordant Spire are even more closed to visitors, and for
most sailors, the only thing the Mordant Spire offers is
an unmistakable landmark for navigation, as the twisting
spire can be seen for miles.
Of all the regions along the Avistani and Garundi
coastlines, though, none are more hazardous to travel
than the waters tortured by the Eye of Abendego. This
immense hurricane first formed at the onset of the Age
of Lost Omens, when storms wracked all of Golarion in
the wake of Aroden’s death. Unlike those other storms,
though, this hurricane remained. Its winds and storm
surge have destroyed several nations and transformed a
previously key gulf into a navigational nightmare. What
strange force caused and perpetuates the Eye of Abendego
has, to date, eluded all investigation.

Magic allows for astounding feats, yet even those
who consider themselves experts in the magical arts
pause in wonder before the spectacles to be found in
the Impossible Lands. What is taken for granted in
these strange and eclectic nations would be all but
impossible elsewhere.
Take Geb as an example. Here, the living are the
minority, and undeath is the predominant way of life.
Cruelty, sadism, and violence are the norm in Geb, as
one might expect of a land ruled by a violent, undead
dictator. This ghost, for whom the country was named,
has ruled his nation for thousands of years, although
for the past several centuries the day-to-day rule of the
land fell to his queen, Arazni. Her recent disappearance
(many would instead say “escape”) and abandonment
of her duties have invigorated the ghost sovereign to
once again take active leadership of his benighted realm.
Geb has opposed its northern neighbor, Nex, for the
entirety of its existence. Also named after its ruler, Nex
is a cosmopolitan realm where magic is mundane. Nex
himself has been missing for ages, yet in his absence
the Arclords have ruled quite effectively. Here, golems
patrol the streets, and the practice of fleshwarping is an
accepted and legitimate industry.
Between these two opposed nations lies a stretch of
land known as the Mana Wastes, a blasted and blighted
badland formed by the ancient wars between Nex and
Geb. The very magic of these lands is damaged—or in
many reaches dead entirely—and peculiar mutants flop
and prowl through the ruins in search of prey.
Only in the duchy of Alkenstar does life approach
anything approximating normal, but even here the
assumptions of the rest of the world are turned on
their head. With magic being unpredictable, Alkenstar’s
citizens have turned instead to technology. The nation
is home to metallurgists and machinists, and the art of
gunsmithing gives them an excellent advantage in this
part of the world. Exports of firearms have steadily
increased over the years, and Alkenstar is emerging as a
significant power of its own as a result.
Across the waters of the Obari Ocean lies the final realm
of the Impossible Lands: the island nation of Jalmeray.
Here it isn’t magic alone that allows for impossibilities
but also focused self-control and perfection of the spirit.
The people of Jalmeray have accomplished astounding
physical feats and achieved remarkable intellectual
insights using nothing more than ancient traditions of
mysticism and self-perfection.

The Mwangi Expanse is home to a wide array of
civilizations, both past and present, even as it holds the
largest stretch of wilderness in the Inner Sea region. In
fact, one of the first civilizations to rise from the ashes
after Earthfall rose here in this land—the nation of Shory
and its astounding flying cities, from which many modern
customs of magic stem.
Some Mwangi cities and kingdoms were lost far more
recently than those ancient wonders. When the Eye of
Abendego formed just over a century ago, its winds and
waves flooded two significant realms along Garund’s
west coast. Where once stood the nations of Lirgen and
Yamasa now stretch only the Sodden Lands, a swath
of swampland and salt marshes held by rival gangs of
scavengers and monsters. Even more recently, a powerful
city-state in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle, Usaro, fell
when its brutal leader, Ruthazek the Gorilla King, was
slain by adventurers. Usaro has been without a leader for
only a few short years, but already its violent inhabitants
have caused significant damage in their anarchic rioting.
A long lineage of demonically infused Gorilla Kings has
ruled Usaro over the centuries, and so a new one will
likely soon rise to seize control of Usaro, for the moment
this sinister region lacks a head to focus its wrath.
Despite these instances of ruin and destruction, the
Mwangi Expanse hosts a wealth of diverse and powerful
city-states within its reaches. In Bloodcove, the ruthless
mercantile league of the Aspis Consortium rules. Farther
south along the coast stands Senghor, whose stance
against both piracy and slavery place the city in stark
contrast to its northern neighbor. The city-state of
Nantambu lies far upstream from Bloodcove on the Vanji
River, where its citizens carry on the ancient traditions
of Old-Mage Jatembe in combining arcane and primal
magic. Far to the southeast stands Mzali, which lies
under the oppressive rule of the undead child-king
Walkena, though a group of dissidents called the Bright
Lions works to build resistance to the mummy’s reign.
Then there is the city of Kibwe, where within its walls
dwell an eclectic mix of people who have journeyed
from afar to seek trade and companionship.
Farther south from these independent city-states lies the
recently freed nation of Vidrian. Originally established as
the Chelish colony of Sargava, Vidrian has now seized its
own destiny and cast off its colonial shackles. In so doing,
the young nation has exposed itself to the predations
of pirates and worse, yet to its citizens, freedom from
oppression is well worth that price.

Wars several decades ago, House Thrune did little to
provide  aid. As the repercussions of the Whispering
Tyrant’s return to power send ripples of nervous dread
through the land, Isger’s people grow fearful that they
lack not only their own political strength but also that of
their supposed protector, and as a result, Isger is one of
the lands in the Inner Sea region most in need of heroes.
Recently, several uprisings within Cheliax have further
tested the nation’s resolve. After a devastating nautical
loss in the Shackles resulted in Vidrian’s independence, a
new Iomedaean rebellion called the Glorious Reclamation
threatened Cheliax from within. House Thrune and the
Asmodean church defeated the Glorious Reclamation, but
at a price—a simultaneous rebellion was successful, with
a group of rebels called the Silver Ravens negotiating the
successful secession of the new nation of Ravounel.
North of Cheliax, the shadowy nation of Nidal remains
the diabolic nation’s only real ally. A theocracy ruled by
the church of Zon-Kuthon, Nidal is the oldest nation on
Avistan, for its people turned to the Midnight Lord for
protection during the Age of Darkness after Earthfall.
Today, pain and dread are comforts to the citizens of
Nidal, and millennia of rule under a church that revels in
pain have left them inured to agony and welcoming of loss.
At its height, the empire of Cheliax had holdings that
reached from Varisia to Garund and east all the way to
Galt. Aroden was prophesized to return to the world
of mortals to usher in a new Age of Glory, and those
prophecies predicted the Chelish city of Westcrown
would be the point of his arrival. Instead, his death
ignited a civil war that lasted for decades. When the
Thrice-Damned House of Thrune emerged as victor,
Cheliax had forever changed. Under House Thrune’s
rule, Cheliax transformed into a nation that viewed Hell
as a blueprint for government. The church of Asmodeus
became Cheliax’s official state religion, and diabolism
its most powerful philosophy. The devil had come home
to rule, and while the nation’s politicians and leaders
claimed that they maintained control of their fate­—and
House Thrune had merely formed an alliance with Hell to
maintain its power and keep order—the nation’s internal
and external enemies know better.
Many of Cheliax’s outlying provinces—such as
Andoran, Galt, and Vidrian—revolted and became their
own nations. The nation of Isger remains, at least on paper,
a thrall. Cheliax values Isger for its important position as
a trade route to the Lake Encarthan region, but when
Isger was wracked by the violence of the Goblinblood

While the opportunity for epic adventure exists throughout
the world, in recent years it seems the Saga Lands have
produced the most notorious and legendary tales. These
sprawling northern reaches feature kingdoms ruled by
vikings and witches, realms home to mammoth-riding
Kellid clans, and a frontier land of free cities and
dangerous wilderness—all of which are steeped in the
ancient legacy of the long-gone empire of Thassilon.
Millennia ago, the nation of Thassilon was ruled by
the sinful, tyrannical runelords. These wizards carved
out legends intended to last for an eternity, but even
the mighty runelords succumbed to the devastation
of Earthfall. The seven reigning runelords of that time
retreated into the safety of extradimensional domains,
and for eons they slumbered, until they began to wake
in 4707 ar.
The frontier realm of Varisia, once the heart of
Thassilon, bore the brunt of the wrath of the first
wakened runelord, an avaricious sadist named Karzoug.
A band of unlikely heroes emerged from the small
coastal town of Sandpoint to eventually face and
defeat Karzoug, yet his wakening soon roused other
slumbering runelords, and a new band of heroes was
forced to defeat the risen tyrants.
While the neighboring Lands of the Linnorm Kings,
Realms of the Mammoth Lords, and witch-haunted
Irrisen never faced direct repercussions from the
runelords, these northern lands hold dangers of their
own. A long-running cold war between the vikings
of the Linnorm Kingdoms and the winter witches of
Irrisen to the east finally came to a sputtering end when
a daughter of the immortal witch Baba Yaga attempted
to defy her mother and usurp Irrisen’s traditions of
rule. While the eternal winter of Irrisen set in place by
Baba Yaga endures, its new ruler, Anastasia, may prove
to be the first benevolent presence to sit on the throne
in centuries. Farther to the east, the Kellid clans of the
Realm of the Mammoth Lords played their own pivotal
roles in defying the demons of the Worldwound.
Recently, a new nation has risen in the Saga Lands.
After the runelords were defeated, two surviving
runelords decided to adjust their traditions to fit this
strange new world they found themselves in. Now the
fledgling nation of New Thassilon sprawls along the
northern border of Varisia, and it remains to be seen if
its rulers will fully adopt a more peaceful path, or if it is
but a matter of time before the old traditions of sin and
violence rise once again.

The empire of Taldor was historically the heart of the
Shining Kingdoms. In the early Age of Enthronement,
Taldor sent several Armies of Exploration to expand
the nation’s borders and colonize the surrounding lands.
Today, Taldor is but a shadow of its former glory, but after
a recent bout of internal strife, a progressive new empress
has claimed the crown, and Taldor may be on the path to
recover its old glory for the first time in centuries.
To the west, the democratic nation of Andoran stands
as a rising star on the international stage. Ever since the
province seceded from the nation of Cheliax, Andoran’s
military has helped to stem the flow of slavery, and its
heroes have stood tall against all manner of peril to the
common folk. But the future doesn’t look entirely bright
for Andoran, for with Cheliax’s recent upsets, rumors
flow that House Thrune may seek to reclaim control
of its wayward thrall. Given the looming threat of the
Whispering Tyrant, an all-out war between these two
powerful nations could be disastrous.
Northeast of Andoran sprawls the dwarven city-states
of the Five Kings Mountains. No strangers to war, both
against enemies and among themselves, the dwarves of the
Five Kings remain allies of Andoran but have their own
troubles that command most of their attention. To the
west of the dwarven realm, the rich and powerful nation
of Druma controls nearly half of the lake’s southern
shoreline and uses its position to bolster its coffers and
further the teachings of the Prophecies of Kalistrade,
a philosophy that teaches that wealth can be achieved
through adherence to strict and abstemious practices.
Northeast of Druma lie the forested elven lands
of Kyonin, one of Avistan’s oldest nations. This land
belonged to the elves long before Earthfall, but for
thousands of years after that devastation, they left their
realm abandoned. In that time, a powerful demon named
Treerazer seized control of the forest’s southern reaches,
corrupting the terrain into a swampy, desolate mire called
Tanglebriar. Although the elves have returned, they’ve
been unable to force Treerazer from their southern border.
Still farther east is the nation of Galt. Wracked for
decades by a self-perpetuating series of rebellions and
revolutions, this land has been torn apart from within
over and over. Its people are tired and desperate as they
continue to live what lives they can in the shadow of the
final blades—powerful magical guillotines that claim the
souls of those they decapitate. If any of the regions of the
Shining Kingdoms is poised for significant change in the
near future, it is surely revolution-wracked Galt.

================================================================================

Human Ethnicities
A variety of ethnic groups make up the human populace of the continents bordering
Golarion’s Inner Sea. Many of these groups have origins on distant lands, but the Inner
Sea region has a diverse population drawn from across the globe. Human characters can
be from any of these ethnicities, regardless of what land they call home.
Characters from these ethnicities speak Common if they come from the Inner Sea
region, and some ethnicities give access to a regional language or another uncommon
language (page 65). Half-elves and half-orcs arise across all human ethnicities and bear
the features of both those ethnicities and their non-human parents.
Garundi
Garundi span the nations of northern Garund along the shores of the Inner Sea,
and their clans are known for strength and empathy, treating their neighbors with
compassion and respect. Their skin tones often range from dark brown to beige, and
they often have tall statures, broad shoulders, and high cheekbones. Garundi have
access to the Osiriani language.
Keleshite
Tracing their origins to the Keleshite Empire in the eastern deserts, Keleshites often
have black hair, brown eyes, and dark- to cool-brown skin. Their culture takes pride
in the empire’s legacy, valuing boldness, wit, and luxury. Fashions tend to incorporate
flowing fabrics, headdresses, and turbans. Keleshites have access to the Kelish language.
Kellid
In the mountains and steppes of northern Avistan, Kellids live hard lives to survive the
threats of the wild, wary of magic and relying on skill and might when hunting and
fighting. They are typically a brawny and dark-haired people, tanned and bearing eyes
that are often black, blue, or gray. Kellids have access to the Hallit language.
Mwangi
Spread across the vast continent of Garund, from the parched deserts in the north
to the dense jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the Mwangi people are divided into
four diverse subgroups: Bekyar, Bonuwat, Mauxi, and Zenj. Mwangi skin tones
range from black to dark-brown to ocher, and they have black or dark-brown hair.
Mwangi have access to the Mwangi language.
Nidalese
Nidalese hail from a culture that escaped destruction during the Earthfall, when a
swarm of meteoroids carved out the Inner Sea. The ancient Nidalese pledged fealty to
an evil shadow god to obtain salvation, and the grip of Zon-Kuthon has tainted these
people ever since. Nidalese tend toward gray, ashy skin tones, with white, gray, or
black hair. Nidalese have access to the Shadowtongue language.
Shoanti
The Shoanti clans called quahs were long ago pushed out of lush territory in the nation
of Varisia into the harsh badlands of the Storval Plateau. Stalwart and tenacious, they
remain oath-sworn to someday retake what they’ve lost. Their skin tones typically
range from sepia to russet, and quah members are easily identified by their shaved
heads and traditional tattoos. Shoanti have access to the Shoanti language.
Cultures
Of course, there’s more to the world of Golarion than its geopolitical borders and wilderness
regions. It’s the people who dwell in those nations and the creatures that lurk in those wilds
who bring the world to life.

Taldan
Renowned as artisans, scholars, and soldiers, Taldans have spread throughout Avistan,
as the empire of Taldor once spanned almost half of the northern continent. Taldans
often have brown hair, pale-white to deep-bronze skin, and green, gray, or amber eyes.
Their native language, Taldane, is so widespread that it is also called Common.
Tian
Few in number in the Inner Sea region, Tians originally come from myriad nations
in Tian Xia, a continent on the opposite side of the world. They typically have dark
hair, but their body types, skin tones, and eye colors vary greatly, as “Tian” is in fact
a general term describing several ethnicities. Tians have access to the Tien language.
Ulfen
The coastal raiders of the Ulfen clans are skilled sailors and bodyguards. They’re
often tall, with pale to ruddy skin and blond, light-brown, or red hair. They typically
show pride in their appearances by adorning themselves with furs, horn, and ivory.
Ulfen have access to the Skald language.
Varisian
Varisians historically favored a nomadic life of roving caravans, but today many lead
a settled lifestyle in places like Ustalav and their namesake land. Their skin tones
typically range from tawny beige to khaki. They have a wide variety of hair colors
from platinum to red to brown, and their large, expressive eyes range into even rarer
colors like violet and gold. Varisians have access to the Varisian language.
Vudrani
Though the empire of Vudra is far to the east, it has a foothold in the Inner Sea on
the island of Jalmeray. A widespread belief in reincarnation makes dedication to
self-improvement a hallmark of Vudrani culture. Vudrani typically have dark eyes
and skin tones that run from umber to tawny. Their hair is often black and ranges
in thickness and texture. Piercings, jewelry, and makeup are common adornments
among Vudrani. Vudrani have access to the Vudrani language.
Dwarves
For untold eons, the dwarven people dwelled in the lightless reaches of the Darklands.
It wasn’t until after Earthfall that the dwarves undertook the legendary Quest for
Sky, during which the majority of dwarves made a pilgrimage to relocate to the
surface of Golarion. In doing so, they not only drove the orcs to the surface before
them, but also established several immense Sky Citadels at each location where
they emerged from the realm below. Today, three major ethnicities of dwarves exist,
each associated with one of three altitude bands: the grondaksen dwarves (who
still dwell in the upper reaches of the Darklands), the ergaksen dwarves (the most
widespread heritage, and those who dwell on or adjacent to the surface world), and
the holtaksen dwarves (the least populous—dwarves who dwell only among the
highest mountain reaches).
Elves
Golarion is not the original elven home world, but those elves who dwell here
today are considered native to the planet. These people first came to Golarion from
the neighboring planet of Castrovel via a network of portals known as aiudara.
While elves abandoned Golarion for several thousand years after the devastation of
Earthfall, they have since returned in force. The most populous elves are the aiudeen,
elves who have acclimated to temperate forest lands. These are the elves who rule
the nation of Kyonin and are most often encountered in other societies. To the south,
the mualijae elves have acclimated to the sweltering jungles of the Mwangi Expanse,
while far to the north the ilverani elves (known to some as the snowcasters) dwell

in the frozen reaches of Irrisen and beyond in the Crown of the World. The vourinoi
elves of Garund’s deserts are the most secretive of the elven ethnicities.
Gnomes
The first gnomes arrived on Golarion at some point after Earthfall from the
otherworldly dimension known as the First World, fleeing a terror whose nature
few can recall. Since that time, gnomes have transitioned fully to creatures of the
Material Plane, although they all live in fear of the life-threatening condition known
as bleaching. Feychild gnomes are the most widespread. Glimmer gnomes retain a
stronger tie to the First World, while others known as fell gnomes have embraced
the darker traditions of their fey heritage. Keenspark gnomes (jokingly referred to
as “sour gnomes”) seek to avoid the bleaching by exploring new innovations rather
than seeking new experiences or exploring the world.
Goblins
Although many adventurers might assume a goblin is a goblin, these scrappy and
creative people are as diverse as any other ancestry. The most widespread are the rasp
goblins, so named for the large numbers who have traditionally dwelled along the
rugged coastlines of Varisia’s west coast, a region known as the Rasp. Forest goblins
tend to be smaller than the other ethnicities and are located mostly in central Avistan.
Their numbers are only now beginning to recover from the horrors of the Goblinblood
Wars. The frost goblins of Irrisen’s eternal winter are unusual among their kind for their
propensity to grow blue fur on their bodies, while the monkey goblins of Mediogalti
Island are known for their prehensile tails and arboreal habitats.
Halflings
Many halflings have lived in the shadow of other societies for as long as they can
remember, living in much the same way as their neighboring cultures and adding
their own unique variations over time or as necessity demands. However, numerous
distinct halfling cultures exist outside of the context of other peoples and nations.
In some cases, these divisions were fueled by separation and circumstances, such as
the oppressed halflings of Cheliax who have been forced into slavery, and the Song’o
halflings of the Mwangi Expanse, who hid from all other cultures to avoid a similar
fate. Other halflings, such as the jaric, mihrini, othoban, and uhlam halflings, simply
formed their own traditions without the influence of humans and other creatures.
Regional Languages
These languages are uncommon outside the region of their genesis. A character hailing
from one of the regions listed below automatically has access to that language. In the
Inner Sea region, the language referred to as Common elsewhere in the rules is the same
as Taldane—a result of Taldor’s legacy of control and influence over the whole region.
Nearly every language listed here is spoken on the melting-pot streets of Absalom.

================================================================================

Listed on these pages are brief descriptions of many
creatures that have held important cultural, regional,
or historical roles on Golarion, particularly in the Inner
Sea region.
Alghollthus
Perhaps the oldest intelligent creatures on Golarion,
the alghollthus ruled vast empires in the depths of the
world’s oceans for eons before the first humans came
to be. In fact, according to some of their wall carvings,
they created the first human beings. Whether or not this
claim is true is impossible to prove, but these creatures—
from the sinister aboleths to their shape-changing
rulers, the veiled masters—have certainly been a part of
the world for a long, long time. Moreover, their claim
to have existed on Golarion before the gods themselves
turned their divine eyes upon the world carries some
disturbing implications.
Demons
Normally bound to the Abyss, demons can be
found wherever cults or evil spellcasters exist
to call them to this world. Two notable locations,
the Worldwound in the north and the Tanglebriar in
southern Kyonin, deserve special mention, for here the
demons of the Abyss have established lasting presences.
Devils
Although the rulers of Cheliax maintain that Hell is but a
blueprint and devilkind is just a tool the clever spellcasters
of House Thrune use to maintain control over their
nation (as well as their decadent lifestyle), devils have
an insidious hold over that nation. With the state
formally devoted to Asmodeus and powerful orders
of Hellknights serving as mercenary arbiters of law, it
should come as no surprise that devils are unusually
common in Cheliax and the neighboring realms.
Dragons
Dragons are rightfully counted among the
most legendary of monsters in the Inner Sea
region. Most prefer to dwell in remote lairs,
swooping down to interact with humanity
only when their violent tempers push them
to raid. Good dragons may seem less common
than their evil kin, but only because they have less of an
urge to mingle with humanoids.
Genies
The nation of Qadira has a long history with genies,
but geniekind’s involvement with the Inner Sea region
is certainly not limited to that nation. They serve as
architects and creators of impossibilities on the isle of
Jalmeray, and in Katapesh they are rumored to be infused
into the very stone and soil of the land.
Giants
Countless tribes and varieties of these
massive humanoids rule the rugged
reaches of the world, from volcanic
mountain ranges and stinking
marshlands to trackless badlands
Creatures
The six humanoid ancestries are far from Golarion’s only inhabitants. Many other
creatures dwell in the world, some kindly and others cruel, some wild and others
organized, some anthropomorphic and others completely monstrous. Even creatures
that are usually foes of civilization, and whom brave adventurers face in battle, can
sometimes be reasoned with or even befriended. Not all of them are evil, and some are
actively helpful to their neighbors. And some, of course, simply want to be left alone.

and steaming jungles. They were used as slaves in ancient
Thassilon, where they were ruled by magic-infused rune
giants and forced to erect enormous monuments that
remain to this day in Varisia, Belkzen, and the Lands of
the Linnorm Kings. But now the giant tribes of northern
Avistan are scattered across the land, largely unaware
they once had a society that was destroyed and reshaped
by the ancient empire of Thassilon.
Gnolls
Hyena-headed gnolls, ever seeking new slaves to perform
menial labor, make for unreliable mercenaries but excel at
hunting intelligent prey. Gnolls dwell primarily in northern
Garund and are particularly common in Osirion, Katapesh,
and Nex. Indeed, gnolls can be found operating openly as
bodyguards, mercenaries, and slavers in cities like Katapesh.
Goblinoids
Goblins are certainly the most widespread and recognized
goblinoids, but their taller, more militaristic hobgoblin
kin rule the new kingdom of Oprak near Lake Encarthan.
The looming, murderous creatures known as bugbears
remain loners who eschew social structures, preferring to
pursue their sadistic hobbies on their own.
Kobolds
Industrious and fecund, kobolds thrive anywhere they
can, often dwelling in narrow confines and twisting
burrows in the hinterlands of rural regions or spreading
throughout the sewers of urban centers. These small,
reptilian humanoids share many traits with dragons—
but courage, might, and an intimidating presence are
certainly not among them!
Leshys
The first leshys were grown by druids as minions, but over
time these strange, plantlike creatures have diversified
and now take many forms. Leshys have yet to organize or
form nations of their own, but considering how quickly
their numbers have grown and how swiftly they adapt to
new regions, a leshy nation seems all but guaranteed in
the near future.
Lizardfolk
Once widespread in Avistan and Garund, the isolationist
lizardfolk, also known as iruxis, have been forced farther
and farther into their forests and swamps by climate
change and the rapid expansion of other humanoids.
Normally peaceful, lizardfolk can be driven to war by
encroaching civilization and power-hungry lizardfolk
leaders—the latter are disturbingly common in the
Mwangi Expanse and the River Kingdoms.
Orcs
Most orcs currently regard the Hold of Belkzen as their
ancestral land, despite the fact that they once called the
upper reaches of the Darklands home. After living in a
violent and brutal culture built on conquest and strength,
some orcs of the Hold of Belkzen have begun to consider
other means of securing
their lands.
Planar Scions
A wide variety of planar scions
dwell in the Inner Sea region, including
the descendants of celestials and fiends who
have mixed their bloodlines with those of mortals,
and other lineages that arose from the influence of the
Elemental Planes. In Cheliax, those who exhibit diabolic
influences are particularly despised, as the leaders of that
nation see them as examples of mortals who succumbed
to fiendish influence instead of commanding devils as
minions and slaves.
Serpentfolk
Serpentfolk once ruled the second layer of the Darklands
along with much of the surface of Garund and Avistan.
Azlant’s expansion into the Inner Sea region long before
Earthfall led to a terrible war between the two peoples.
When Azlant proved the victor, the surviving serpentfolk
fled into the Darklands; they are nearly extinct today.

================================================================================

The largest factions compete with lesser sovereign nations
for wealth, power, and influence, and they sometimes
rival even larger nations. In some cases, nations take
the risky step of relying upon these powerful factions,
making them an extension of government itself (as is the
case with some Hellknights in Cheliax, for example). In
other cases, such as that of the Red Mantis, entire nations
bow to the power of these organizations. Smaller groups,
while less rich in resources, nonetheless inspire great zeal
in their members. Those groups that strive to grow in size,
influence, or wealth frequently attract more dedicated
and motivated members.
The factions summarized below represent a sampling
of those active in the Inner Sea region. Some, like the
Pathfinder Society and the Aspis Consortium, are
widespread and powerful; their influence can be found
throughout the world. Others, such as the Firebrands
and the Sczarni, are disorganized or regional in scope.
All encourage adventurers to join their ranks, although
the benefits each faction can offer an adventurer
varies widely.
Aspis Consortium
The sprawling mercantile concern known
as the Aspis Consortium is structured to
ensure that the survival of the faction is
more important than any single member. Originally
founded as a private trading endeavor, the Consortium
has grown to be one of the largest business ventures in the
Inner Sea region. Most of the group’s members are skilled
merchants and mercenaries, and the organization has
made a merciless and bloodthirsty name for itself when it
comes to ensuring its profits. The Aspis Consortium has
clashed many times with the Pathfinder Society.
Bellflower Network
The unsavory practice of slavery continues
to be a strong economic force in diabolic
Cheliax. Here, halflings are particularly
valued as slaves, for they work hard and take up only
half the room of a human laborer. It should come as no
surprise, then, to learn of the Bellflower Network, an
organization founded by halfling freedom fighters that
accepts any into its ranks, provided they aid the network
in its goal of freeing all slaves from servitude and helping
them escape from oppressive lands like Cheliax.
Esoteric Order of the
Palatine Eye
Based in the nation of Ustalav, the
scholars and philosophers of this
semisecret society have long stood
against the Whispering Way (page 441), but more recent
events have placed them in opposition to the sinister goals
of the Night Heralds. When left to their own devices,
however, members of this faction prefer to explore and
study dusty secrets hidden in the past, particularly those
still awaiting rediscovery in the regions of the Golden
Road—especially in the nation of Osirion.
Eagle Knights
The Eagle Knights are the protectors and
defenders of the people of Andoran. The
group itself consists of four subfactions—
the Steel Falcons (who protect Andoran’s
interests beyond its borders), the Golden Legion
(Andoran’s defenders and the commanders of its armies),
the Gray Corsairs (nautical agents who specialize in
fighting the slave trade), and the Twilight Talons (spies
and deep cover agents).
Firebrands
Not all factions have central bases of
operation or organized hierarchies of
command. The loosely affiliated freedom
fighters,
swashbuckling
heroes,
and
entertainers known as the Firebrands are one such group.
They are united by a desire to fight oppression, oppose
tyrannical regimes, free slaves, rescue the wrongfully
accused, and engage in jolly cooperation with like-minded
heroes—all
while
building
their
own
individual
reputations and wealth. This group of defenders has
proven surprisingly difficult for oppressive governments
and cruel religions to defeat.
Free Captains
To an outside observer or a merchant
whose ship has been looted or sunk, the
pirates of the Shackles may seem like
Factions
While nations and faiths command vast resources and control entire regions, they must still
compete for the loyalty of their followers. In addition to being swayed by church and state,
many people are influenced by societal groups known as factions. These groups vary wildly
in size and purpose­—from local thieves’ guilds interested only in filling the pockets and
bellies of their members, to far-reaching, international commercial conglomerates with their
own private armies.

a disorganized scourge. But in truth, these pirates are
bound by a complex code of, if not honor, then a mutual
recognition that it’s always good to have allies on the
open seas. The Shackles are ruled by a council of pirate
lords who call themselves the Free Captains; they sail
the southern Arcadian Ocean and follow their own code
of rules when it comes to who can be raided and what
can be sunk—even if, to their victims, those rules seem
capricious and arbitrary.
Hellknights
Several different orders of the mercenaries
known collectively as Hellknights operate
in Avistan, with most of their number
stationed in the nation of Cheliax. These mercenaries see
the law of the land as inviolate and offer their services
as enforcers to any who can pay their prices. They wear
distinctive suits of intimidating armor and take the
legends of Hell as inspiration, but they see no one but
themselves as the true arbiters of law.
Knights of Lastwall
For centuries, the nation of Lastwall stood
as a bulwark against the orcs of Belkzen
and the lingering threat of the Whispering
Tyrant. But when the Whispering Tyrant escaped
his prison, he brought to his enemies in Lastwall a
devastating apocalypse. Now Lastwall is destroyed,
and the knights who once served there are without a
home. In its absence, they have formed a ragtag group
known as the Knights of Lastwall, and they carry on
their charge to stand against the undead legions of the
Whispering Tyrant wherever their skills are needed.
Lion Blades
The Lion Blades of Taldor are a secret
organization committed to protecting the
interests of Taldor and its ruler. They oppose
Taldor’s many enemies, foreign and domestic, through
a program of infiltration, espionage, and assassination.
One of the major goals of the Lion Blades is to rein in
corruption within the empire (aside from corruption that
is useful to them); another is keeping any one faction of
the imperial court from becoming powerful enough to
upset the status quo. Through its shadow schools, the
Lion Blades intensively train new recruits before investing
them with a high degree of initiative and latitude.
Magaambya
Golarion reeled from the disaster of
Earthfall, and its peoples took long to
recover. But recover they did, and one
of the first institutions to rise from the ashes of near
destruction was the Magaambya, an academy of arcane
learning founded by the legendary wizard known as Old-
Mage Jatembe. Today, the scholars of Magaambya not
only preserve ancient magical traditions founded in those
early days but also protect the learning and culture of the
Mwangi people as a whole.
Night Heralds
The Night Heralds turn to the lure of the
starlit night for guidance, seeking advice
and aid from forces far removed from
Golarion. The sinister aliens of the Dominion of the
Black hold special importance for the Night Heralds,
and many Night Heralds worship these inscrutable
beings almost as gods. Night Heralds seek and collect
obscure texts and mysterious lore from the ancient past
and peruse the secrets they find within to unravel larger
hidden meanings and obscured truths beyond reality.
Their hope is that when the world inevitably falls to
alien influence, they will be rewarded for their service by
the world’s new masters.
Pathfinder Society
Many of the greatest explorers and
adventurers of the modern age have
recorded their discoveries in an ongoing
series of chapbooks known as the Pathfinder Chronicles,
published irregularly by the Pathfinder Society itself.
This diverse group is devoted to exploring the world,
supporting its agents in the field, and ensuring the
discoveries they make are documented. The Society
often finds itself in conflict with the more mercenary
Aspis Consortium. The Pathfinder Society’s pursuit of
discovery often puts its agents in the thick of developing
plots, forcing them to choose between being heroes or
villains as events unfold.
Red Mantis
It’s easy to know if an assassination is the
work of the notorious Red Mantis; they
typically kill with a sacred sawtooth saber,
have a knack for targeting their victims in public or in
sanctuaries believed to be safe, and take steps to ensure
that those they are contracted to kill stay dead. Their
prices change with each mission, but no matter the offer,
the Red Mantis never targets rightfully ruling monarchs,
for their own deity, the mantis god Achaekek, forbids
the murder of those with a divine mandate to rule.
Sczarni
The Sczarni are a collection of Varisian
bandits, smugglers, and thieves. They are
organized into tightly knit families, each
of which has little or nothing in common with Sczarni
in other locations beyond shared skills, techniques, and
pursuits. Their crimes focus on thievery, scams, and other
relatively nonviolent acts, but since these crimes have
a tendency to spiral out of control, their schemes often
result in violence anyway.

Deities
Anyone can worship a deity, but those who do so devoutly
should take care to pursue the faith’s edicts (behaviors
the faith encourages) and avoid its anathemas (actions
considered blasphemous). Each deity below has their
alignment listed in parentheses after their name, followed
by a short description and their edicts, anathemas, and
the alignments permitted for followers. Following that are
benefits available to the most ardent devotees of the deities.
You get these benefits only if you’re a cleric of the deity

Abadar (LN)
The Master of the First Vault holds sway over cities,
the law, merchants, and wealth. Abadar seeks to

Religion
Selection of a deity is critical for certain classes—like champion and cleric—but most
characters pay respect to at least one deity to find a focus in life and guide their choices,
especially in times of hardship or need. Some people instead worship a group of deities
arranged in a pantheon, follow a nondeific religion like the Green Faith, or adhere to a
specific philosophy. Note that far more deities, religions, and philosophies exist on any
world, Golarion included, than those detailed below.

Faiths and Philosophies
Of course, faith can express itself in more ways than
venerating a single deity—or a deity at all. A few examples
of nondeific religions and philosophies are presented
below. Clerics can work with allied faiths and philosophies,
but the organizations here turn to other classes—such as
sorcerers with divine bloodlines, druids, or monks—to
serve as their leaders. These faiths and philosophies don’t
have an external godhead that offers benefits to devotees.
Atheism
While most concede that the gods exist, some do not view
them as worthy of worship, and a few even deny their
presence altogether.
Edicts pursue your own agenda with faith in your own ability
to excel
Anathema offer prayers to a deity

Chapter 9: Playing the Game
At this point, you have a character and are ready to play Pathfinder! Or maybe you’re
the GM and you are getting ready to run your first adventure. Either way, this chapter
provides the full details for the rules outlined in Chapter 1: Introduction. This chapter
begins by describing the general rules and conventions of how the game is played and then
presents more in-depth explanations of the rules for each mode of play.
Before diving into how to play Pathfinder, it’s important to
understand the game’s three modes of play, which determine
the pace of your adventure and the specific rules you’ll use
at a given time. Each mode provides a different pace and
presents a different level of risk to your characters. The
Game Master (GM) determines which mode works best
for the story and controls the transition between them.
You’ll likely talk about the modes less formally during
your play session, simply transitioning between exploration
and encounters during the adventure, before heading to a
settlement to achieve something during downtime.
The most intricate of the modes is encounter mode. This
is where most of the intense action takes place, and it’s most
often used for combat or other high-stakes situations. The
GM typically switches to encounter mode by calling on
the players to “roll for initiative” to determine the order in
which all the actors take their turns during the encounter.
Time is then divided into a series of rounds, each lasting
roughly 6 seconds in the game world. Each round, player
characters, other creatures, and sometimes even hazards or
events take their turn in initiative order. At the start of a
participant’s turn, they gain the use of a number of actions
(typically 3 in the case of PCs and other creatures) as well as
a special action called a reaction. These actions, and what
you do with them, are how you affect the world within
an encounter. The full rules for playing in encounter mode
start on page 468.
In exploration mode, time is more flexible and the play
more free form. In this mode, minutes, hours, or even
days in the game world pass quickly in the real world, as
the characters travel cross country, explore uninhabited
sections of a dungeon, or roleplay during a social
gathering. Often, developments during exploration lead to
encounters, and the GM will switch to that mode of play
until the encounter ends, before returning to exploration
mode. The rules for exploration start on page 479.
The third mode is downtime. During downtime, the
characters are at little risk, and the passage of time is
measured in days or longer. This is when you might forge a
magic sword, research a new spell, or prepare for your next
adventure. The rules for downtime are on page 481.
General Rules
Before exploring the specific rules of each mode of play,
you’ll want to understand a number of general rules of
the game. To one degree or another, these rules are used
in every mode of play.
Making Choices
Pathfinder is a game where your choices determine the
story’s direction. Throughout the game, the GM describes
what’s happening in the world and then asks the players, “So
what do you do?” Exactly what you choose to do, and how
the GM responds to those choices, builds a unique story
experience. Every game is different, because you’ll rarely,
if ever, make the same decisions as another group of players.
This is true for the GM as well—two GMs running the exact
same adventure will put different emphasis and flourishes
on the way they present each scenario and encounter.
Often, your choices have no immediate risk or
consequences. If you’re traveling along a forest path and
come across a fork in the trail, the GM will ask, “Which
way do you go?” You might choose to take the right fork
or the left. You could also choose to leave the trail, or just
go back to town. Once your choice is made, the GM tells
you what happens next. Down the line, that choice may
impact what you encounter later in the game, but in many
cases nothing dangerous happens immediately.
But sometimes what happens as a result of your choices
is less than certain. In those cases, you’ll attempt a check.
Checks
When success isn’t certain—whether you’re swinging a
sword at a foul beast, attempting to leap across a chasm, or
straining to remember the name of the earl’s second cousin
at a soiree—you’ll attempt a check. Pathfinder has many
types of checks, from skill checks to attack rolls to saving
throws, but they all follow these basic steps.
1.	Roll a d20 and identify the modifiers, bonuses,
and penalties that apply.
2.	Calculate the result.
3.	Compare the result to the difficulty class (DC).
4.	Determine the degree of success and the effect.
Checks and difficulty classes (DC) both come in many
forms. When you swing your sword at that foul beast,
you’ll make an attack roll against its Armor Class, which
is the DC to hit another creature. If you are leaping across
that chasm, you’ll attempt an Athletics skill check with a
